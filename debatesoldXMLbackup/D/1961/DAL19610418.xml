      <P>asked the Taoiseach what would have been (a) the trade excess and (b) the balance of payments for 1960 if the terms of trade had remained at the level prevailing in February, 1957.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give quantitative expression to the effect of changes in the terms of trade on the volume of imports and exports.  What can be done is to estimate the value, at price levels prevailing in one period, of the quantum of imports and exports recorded in a different period.  If the actual 1960 totals for imports and exports are revalued using the official import and export price (unit value) index numbers for February, 1957, the import excess is estimated at £102.0 million, or £28.0 million more than the actual outcome in 1960.  As the actual outcome of balance of payments for 1960 was a deficit on current account of £0.8 million, the deficit obtained by using the revalued external trade aggregates would be £28.8 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has seen in Dublin evening papers of 10th April last, which contained advertisements issued by his Department in favour of fluoridation, quotations from an authoritative book on food and drugs stating that all evidence available stamps the use of fluorides as preservatives as an abominable <Col N="468" /> practice, as even in small doses they have been shown to have deleterious effects on bone and blood; and if he will now reconsider the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the letter, published in certain of the Dublin evening papers on 10th instant, which contains quotations as referred to by the Deputy, stated to be taken from a text book entitled &ldquo;Analysis of Food and Drugs&rdquo; by Moor and Partridge.  None of the scientific libraries which I have consulted has been able to trace such a publication.  The reference may, however, be to a text book entitled &ldquo;Aids to Analysis of Food and Drugs&rdquo; by T. H. Pearmain and G. C. Moor. The book was first published sixty-six years ago, in 1895.  Subsequent editions appeared in 1899, 1909, 1918, 1934, 1942 and 1952.  I have been unable to verify whether the passages quoted in the letter appeared in the earlier editions, which, being out-of-date, are no longer readily available.  The passages do not occur in the later editions, presumably having been deleted in the light of advances in scientific knowledge if, in fact, they appeared at all in the earlier editions.</P>
      <P>The foregoing information illustrates how inaccurate and misleading is much of the matter published in the correspondence columns of the newspapers by the small minority opposed to fluoridation, and how much expenditure of time and energy would be necessary to counter all such tendentious propaganda.</P>
      <P>In reply to the last part of the question, I propose, in the interest of the dental health of children and of the community generally, to give effect as rapidly as possible to the will of the Oireachtas as expressed in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1961.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total cost of the recent half page advertisements in the national newspapers publicising certain aspects of the fluoridation argument; and if he will allocate a similar amount of money to publicise the case against fluoridation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A contract for the production and publication of this advertisement was placed with an advertising agency following the invitation of tenders.  To state the cost of publishing the advertisement would be to disclose the amount of the tender accepted.  This would be contrary to established practice.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is in the negative.  The money in the relevant subhead of the Vote for my Department is provided to educate members of the public in relation to measures affecting their health and that of their families.  It would be not only absurd but subversive to apply any part of it to encourage opposition to a procedure which the Oireachtas, by statutory enactment, has decided should be adopted for the protection of the health of the child-population in those areas where it is feasible to apply it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total amount spent by his Department in the last year in newspaper advertising of the rules of good dental hygiene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department in the last financial year has not adopted the medium mentioned in the question. Instead, in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare, it has issued an instructional leaflet to the heads of young families and has arranged for supplies of this leaflet to be available to health authorities and dentists for distribution to young persons and their parents.</P>
      <P>In addition, a film on dental care which was made specially has been extensively shown to school children through the health film shows which are provided by the National Film Institute, acting as my agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year also, extensive use was <Col N="470" /> made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of a postal franking slogan advocating dental hygiene.</P>
    <P>I may say that it is my intention to avail more extensively in the future of the newspapers to bring home to the general public the striking advantage which the fluoridation of public water supplies will confer on their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>As to the amount of public money which must be expended to counteract the misleading propaganda with which the Deputy has associated himself, I am not prepared to put any limit on the amount. They are two separate questions to which, if the Deputy will put them down on the Order Paper, I shall reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not open to the Minister to use the same methods of propaganda as those who oppose fluoridation instead of using public money to support his side of the argument?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of applicants in County Leitrim for unemployment assistance who have had their means reviewed during the year ended 31st December, 1960, and the number of such applicants whose assistance has been (a) increased and (b) reduced as a result of such review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, <Col N="471" /> the means of holders of qualification certificates must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of a holder, e.g. acquirement of property, marriage, change of address. The means of self-employed persons must also be re-examined periodically. Apart from the other reasons mentioned the means of the holder of a qualification certificate must also be re-investigated if his circumstances have not been reviewed for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployment assistance cases in the County Leitrim reviewed by Officers of my Department in discharge of their statutory duties in the year ended 31st December, 1960, was 239.  Unemployment assistance was increased in 41 cases and reduced in 137 cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to September, 1958, the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes, where such were derived from the occupation of land, was based on values for stock, crops, etc., adopted in 1940.  Since September, 1958, up-to-date values, as are used for non-contributory old age and widows' and orphans' pensions purposes, have been applied to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

The receipts under some of these headings may include small amounts attributable to articles imported for use otherwise than on mechanically propelled vehicles but it is not feasible to segregate any such amounts.

      <P>The works being carried out at Rosslare which were agreed with the Wexford County Engineer are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  A survey and float test.</P>
      <P>2.  The erection of experimental groynes along the beach.</P>
      <P>3.  Direct protection works along the portions of the coast considered by the County Engineer to be most urgently in need of protection, and where such works would yield useful information.</P>
      <P>The survey and float tests having been made, direct protection works were done at the selected places and groynes, wavescreens and wind breaks were erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The direct protection works consisted of large concrete blocks placed in line at the head of the beach. Groynes of various types were used&mdash; trapezoidal concrete blocks, stones in gabion baskets and wooden stakes driven into the beach&mdash;to determine the most economical and effective type. All were more or less effective but the experiments have shown that a groyne <Col N="474" /> of closely driven timber stakes is the most satisfactory.  The length of the beach from the Churchyard immediately south of the village to a point half way up the Spit, has been groyned and the intervals at which they have been placed is being closely watched.  The windbreaks and wavescreens have also proved useful and are under observation.</P>
    <P>The works completed to date are effective in building of beach levels but the results are in their nature slow and artificial nourishment of the groynes is being tried.  I am advised that the effects of the work are encouraging and that the work is proceeding on sound lines.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 28 to 41 and to insert the following subparagraphs, namely:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  in case the quantity would, if increased by the quantity (if any) of bacon already purchased by the Commission from the holder during that period, be equal to or less than the quantity specified in the external-sales sub-quota certificate (within the meaning of the said Part 111) in respect of that period for the premises to which the licence relates, the whole of the bacon, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in any other case, such quantity (if any) of the bacon as it thinks proper, having regard to the quantities (if any) of bacon exported by the holder aforesaid on or after the 1st day of January, 1960, and before the commencement of this Act, provided that <Col N="493" /> the quantity purchased shall not be less than the quantity (if any) which if increased by the quantity (if any) of bacon already purchased by the Commission from the holder during the external-sale period aforesaid would be equal to the quantity specified in the said external-sales sub-quota certificate.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of the amendment is, by necessity, rather complex and difficult to understand.  I appreciate that the first part is substantially a drafting amendment.  The second part comes in some degree part of the way to meet the problem which I raised in connection with the bacon curer who had been diligent in exploiting export markets prior to the proposal for the centralisation of marketing. I would have wished that the Commission should have been required to accept the total quantity such curer had available, but I appreciate that, in practical circumstances, it may be necessary to retain some measure of flexibility.  I should like to be reassured by the Minister now that the phrasing &ldquo;in any other case, such quantity (if any) of the bacon at it thinks proper, having regard to the quantities (if any) of bacon exported by the holder aforesaid on or after the 1st day of January, 1960,&rdquo; does in fact imply that, in ordinary practice, the diligent exporter in the past will not find himself left with bacon on his hands as a result of an export quota fixed hereafter by the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have gone as far as we could in our final score to meet that point and to clarify it.  The Commission, I am informed, could purchase from the curer in excess of the quota, but this amendment helps to clarify the position and, as I say, goes as far as it would be wise to go.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stage today.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is mainly a Bill to attempt the experiment of central marketing, although of course it provides for some other minor matters as well.  On Committee Stage, I directed the attention of the Minister to the fact that his proposal to give the curers a larger representation on the Commission than he was prepared to give to the producers is a grave psychological mistake.  If this new departure is to have any prospect of success, it must command the confidence and goodwill of the producers and everyone in the pig and bacon industry.  I believe the producers are justified, and fully justified, in expecting and demanding that they should have equal representation on this Commission&mdash;at least equal representation &mdash;with the bacon curers.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that his revised proposal to give the bacon curers three representatives and the producers only two is calculated to produce a more efficient Board.  I very much doubt if the Minister believes that himself.  I believe he was subjected to pressures to which he saw fit to give way.  I greatly regret that that feature had been incorporated in this Bill.  I gravely apprehend that the Minister's decision constitutes a flaw in the legislation which will gravely prejudice the prospects of success that might have attended the proposal we all have in mind.  I do not think it is yet too late to put this matter right and accordingly I urge the Minister, between now and the time he approaches Seanad Éireann, to review this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Board, as originally constituted, would have done all right. It would then have consisted of two representatives of the bacon curers, two of the producers, two of the Department and an independent chairman. If the Minister is not able to resist pressure brought upon him to <Col N="495" /> expand the curers' representation to three, then I urge that between now and the time he goes to Seanad Éireann he should introduce an amendment expanding the personnel of this Commission to three for the curers, three for the producers, two from the Deaprtment and a chairman, giving a total body of nine.  Unless that is done, this Bill is going to have a very grave flaw in it.</P>
    <P>All of us are anxious to see the pig and bacon industry further expanded. It is a flaw in this legislation that there is not more advertence to the possibility of expanding the export of live pigs because I believe that in that direction there might be found a marketing opportunity for the producer which could be developed and if it ever reached the dimensions it had reached three years ago, it would be a most valuable additional outlet for pig producers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate all the difficulties of maintaining standards and grades in pigs for the purpose of securing that the bacon we have to export will be of the quality and type that foreign markets want to purchase, but it would be folly for a central marketing organisation such as we now propose to set up to close their eyes to the fact that some of the largest pig producers in Great Britain have now publicly avowed that they no longer believe that the production of the end product now associated with Grade A pigs is primarily the responsibility of the pig producers. Some of the largest curers in England have now said they are not only willing but anxious to accept whatever type of pigs the producers find it most economic to produce and that they are prepared in their processing plants to extract from these pigs suitable bacon and saleable by-products by their own techniques.</P>
    <P>We should be vigilant to ensure that, if the processors here are not equipped to do as much, we should not cut off our producers from processors in Great Britain who are prepared to handle profitably types of pig other than Grade A or Grade A.1. Neither should we be unduly critical <Col N="496" /> of processors here, if they find themselves unable to provide an identical service for producers with that offered by certain processors in England because we should bear in mind that there is in the densely populated British market a market for a wide variety of by-products that are not so readily marketable here and that are not so readily transportable from here to the British market were they produced here.</P>
    <P>It is these by-products, such as pork pies and bath chaps, and a variety of other by-products of the pig industry, which are readily saleable in certain areas of Great Britain which make it possible for the processor there to handle efficiently and economically a heavier pig than can be handled by the factories here.  Nor can we close our eyes to the dilemma that if we are concerned to secure for our factories the maximum number of Grade A and Grade A.1 pigs, if we make too readily available an alternative market for pigs that do not fall within these grades, we may very easily create a situation in which there will be no Grade A or Grade A.1 pigs available for our factories here at all.</P>
    <P>I see all the difficulties&mdash;perhaps I see them too clearly&mdash;of steering between Scylla and Charybdis.  There is a temptation to over-simplify these two problems and to demand of the Minister and this body which is now being created an easy and facile solution. With the best will in the world, I do not think it is possible to find either an easy or a facile solution to these problems, but the fact that their solution is not easy should not induce us to turn our backs resolutely on what may be in the future a very valuable and expanding market for a type of pig which it is economic to produce and which our geographical circumstances may make it possible for us to process effectively here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Subject to these two important considerations: (1)  the personnel of this Commission and its present inadequate representation of the producer, and (2) the potential market for live pigs which this Commission should have a graver duty to pursue and investigate, we have no objection to the passage of this Bill.  I am bound to say, however, that <Col N="497" /> the absence from this body of an equal volume of representation for the producer as is being made available for the curer causes me the gravest apprehension that this Pigs and Bacon Commission may find itself prejudiced against diligently seeking a market for live pigs.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that, human nature being what it is, bacon curers in this country do not welcome competition any more than any of us do. A strong and vigorous market for live pigs would be the most effective competition that producers could have in order to keep the curers up to their duty.  It would be a thousand pities if that valuable instrument of competition were blunted by any decision of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I used to be a director of a bacon factory&mdash;I am not any longer&mdash;but, as a pig producer, I feel quite honestly that the Minister is making a very grave mistake not only from the point of view of the psychology of the matter, but also from the point of view of getting this Commission to do the right thing in not giving the producers equal representation with the bacon curers.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is a Deputy on either side of this House who believes that a Pigs and Bacon Commission concerned to serve the pig industry equitably is properly constituted with three curers on it, two representatives of the producers, one of the Minister, and an independent chairman.  It seems to me that that is a most unsuitable arrangement.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately tried to avoid making a violent personal attack upon the Minister in regard to this matter, though I could very easily have done so, because I do not want questions of prestige or face to become involved in this.  I believe it is desirable from everybody's point of view that the right thing should be done.  There is still time.  I was tempted to divide the House on this stage of this Bill, on the ground that the representation of the farmers is not equal to that of the curers.  I do not propose to call for a division.  The reason I do not propose to divide the House on the Bill is that I hope that, between now and the time the Minister brings it before the Seanad, wiser counsels may prevail <Col N="498" /> and we will get a fair representation which will give producers that measure of confidence in this Commission that it ought to have if it is to have a fair chance of doing the job committed to it effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general feeling in the country, as well as in the House, that this Bill is a fairly good Bill.  Any Bill designed to put things right is worth a chance.  That seems to be the general feeling of those interested in pig and bacon production. I should, however, like to add my voice to that of the last speaker in relation to the serious discontent that exists amongst pig producers.  The Minister has deliberately limited their representation on the Commission and made it something less than the representation given to the curers.  Quite a number of people have asked me why the Minister gives only two representatives to producers, when he is giving three representatives to the curers.  If there are no producers, there will be no curers.  The Minister, between now and when the Bill goes through the Seanad, should set that matter right.</P>
      <P>The bacon industry is one of the most important from the farmers' point of view.  The very fact that producers have got this dash of cold water thrown on them in the matter of representation on the Commission will not help the intentions of the Minister. Neither will it help the hopes that everybody has in this Bill.  I cannot see any reason why the producers should have a more limited representation on the Commission than the curers or for that matter any other body. The average farmer who raises pigs is the very basis of the bacon industry in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Producers all over the country have gone through a very lean period during the past three, four and five years.  They suffered severely from a feast and a famine.  They looked to this Bill for some ray of hope, but they find that they are still of little consequence so far as the whole industry is concerned. That is a bad start.  At the very least the Minister should even the matter up and, when this Bill goes through <Col N="499" /> the Seanad, he should give them equal representation with the curers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose there is anything I can say which will convince Deputies on the other side who protest as to the constitution of this Commission.  I still think it is fair.  I still think it will be a well-balanced body.  The Commission consists of three curers, two producers, a representative nominated from my Department and a chairman who is independent. No amount of arguing and no process of reasoning would convince me that there is anything unjust or unfair about that.</P>
      <P>We debated this at length and no argument on my part will, perhaps, induce the Deputies who made the opposite case to change their mind. The same applies in my case.  I do not feel I am called upon to repeat the case I made beyond saying that a Commission of six, composed as I have described, with an independent chairman provided for in this measure, could not be said to be a Commission loaded against the producers.  The producers I know&mdash;and there are a few &mdash;do not seem to share the fears expressed here at all by the Deputies opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the other developments in the bacon curing business in Britain are concerned, the developments on the consumer side and marketing, these are tremendously interesting as Deputy Dillon stated.  No doubt they pose considerable problems for the industry here in the future.  They are things for which it is not easy to find a solution, but they are certainly developments which will have to be watched most carefully.  I know the difficulty the Commission will have to face.  I think&mdash;and I thought from the very beginning from the report received from the advisory body&mdash;that it was the one business where a central marketing body should be making some worthwhile contribution for the whole industry.  I am a believer in private enterprise.  I see the advantages from time to time in many ways.  At the same time if central marketing could be justified in any case, I believe this <Col N="500" /> is an outstanding one and I naturally hope that the Commission provided for here will meet with success.</P>

I know it will not be possible to introduce it <i>in toto</i> because, as the House knows, there are many dozens and dozens of regulations to be made before the Act can be made 100 per cent. effective.  The Minister might be in a position to tell us when the main portions will become effective.</P>

      <P>I think I mentioned on an earlier Stage of the Bill in a broad sort of way what we envisaged as the sequence in regard to the coming into operation of the various Stages of the Bill.  It is the intention that, immediately the Bill is passed, Part 1 will be brought into operation and then, Part 2, Section 20, which gives the Guards power to test vehicles.  The next portion to be brought into operation will be Part 3, Sections 26 and 29, which concern consequential disqualifications and enable a person to apply to the courts for the removal of disqualification. I can and will, if the House so wishes, list these portions right down. There are a number of varying sections which I could enumerate.  I do not think that at this stage I could answer the actual question the Deputy has asked&mdash;about the time.  It is difficult to give the actual time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, lines 35 to 39, to delete the definition of &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; and substitute a new definition as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; means:</P>
      <P>(a)  the holder of a trade licence issued under section 9 of the Roads Act, 1920, as amended,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a vehicle in respect of which a declaration is made for the purpose of obtaining in respect of more than six vehicles of uniform type in the same ownership a licence under section 1 of the <Col N="504" /> Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, the person shown on such declaration,</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a State owned vehicle the Department of State referred to in the declaration made to the licensing authority for the purpose of registering the vehicle in accordance with the provisions of any enactment or any regulations made thereunder,</P>
    <P>(d)  in any other case the person shown as the current owner in the registration book issued in respect of the vehicle by the licensing authority.</P>
    <P>This amendment, like a number of other amendments, is simply for the purpose of making the action of the Minister readable without in any sense altering what the Minister wants the Act to provide.  In the definition section of the Bill&mdash;Section 3&mdash;the registered owner is defined by reference to the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1958.  That means the person who wants to find out who is a registered owner does not find the answer in this Bill but has to consult the 1958 regulations in order to get the answer.  What I am suggesting in this amendment is that the provisions of the Road Vehicles Regulations of 1958, which defined the registered owner, should be incorporated into this Bill.  It does not vary what the Minister wants to achieve in any way, but makes the Bill readable so that a person looking at the Bill will see at a glance who is the registered owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the general implications of the Deputy's amendment, but I would point out to him that the definition as now suggested is in exactly the same terms as it was so defined in an Act of 1960 and about which no action whatsoever is being taken.  The regulations in respect to this matter may change and that being so, the spelling out of it as the amendment suggests could mean legislation as well as regulations.  It could mean an amendment of the actual law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate there is a certain virtue in that?  Surely it is preferable that as far as possible we should, in legislation of this or any other type, try to put the full definition into the Bill rather than to leave it in a vague way which may be altered by regulations later on.  The Minister might also appreciate that the wording of the definition of registered owner here could give rise to a very great deal of trouble if the regulations were in fact altered, because it provides that the words &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; will have the meaning assigned to them by the 1958 regulations, but if these regulations should be revoked they will have the meaning assigned to them by any such corresponding regulations as may for the time being be enforced. Without being in any way fanciful, I think it would be open to argument that if other regulations were made which did not tally reasonably with the 1958 regulations, they could not be held to correspond to the 1958 regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition will depend entirely on the system in use. The implication of the Deputy's amendment now would be that we accept the use of the registration books as at present as being the absolute end in so far as this matter is concerned and that we write into this Bill something that in itself is based on a matter which is subject to change and that we would later have to amend the law any time we came to a change in the registration system.  It is not really the system that is of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what Deputy O'Higgins has said, I would point out that in order to understand the full meaning of &ldquo;registered owner,&rdquo; the person has, in the first instance, to look to regulations printed in 1958 which, for all I know, are not obtainable at the moment because many of the regulations made under the existing road traffic regulations are out of print.  Having succeeded in getting a copy of the regulations, he then has to race after a copy of the Roads Act, 1920, which even our own <Col N="506" /> Stationery Office does not stock because it is a publication that was issued when the British rule operated here.  He then has to chase further to find regulations under Section 1 of the Finance (excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>Our criticism of the section as it stands and of much of this Bill is really criticism of drafting.  We believe that a Bill of this nature, which is a popular Bill, a Bill to which the public must look, day in and day out, which everybody will be presumed to know and understand&mdash;while in all cases we are presumed to know the law&mdash;a Bill which is to be operated by ordinary men and women, should be so comprehensive as to hold within the first and last sections everything a person may need to understand.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there may have to be further consideration of the amendment and of the section as it stands, but I respectfully urge the Minister to consider how far he may go in explaining the thing to the ordinary man in the street, who will have to understand this Bill.  It is not a Bill which should be understood only by lawyers or the Department or the Garda Síochána.  It should be understood by the ordinary man in the street.  Certainly, it is not understandable by the ordinary man in the street as it stands at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan mentions the Act of 1920.  It is clear from that Act and the registration regulations made under it that that Act clearly envisaged the registration system being set out in regulations and that the system would change from time to time.  That is inherent in the sense and meaning of the particular sections in the 1920 Act, to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said that it is doubtful if the regulations printed in 1958 are available.  He asks where does one get them and talks of the public not having them available to them. These regulations are statutory instruments and are available and can be procured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing I should like <Col N="507" /> to say as it is possibly a matter which may arise on many other sections.  I do not really agree with Deputy Ryan that it should be possible to put within the framework of this Bill definitions and every matter of regulations, spelled out to the last degree.  If that were to be done, this Bill would be enlarged four times and the ordinary owner and driver would have to go driving around the countryside studying each page and line of it.</P>
    <P>I do not think laws of this nature are to be understood in absolute letter and line, in the legal sense which the Deputy seems to imply, by each and every member of the public.  I do not think that the writing of everything into the Bill would make the law any more readily available to the public mind.  If the Bill were to be enlarged very much further in consequence of such an approach, rather than clarifying the traffic laws in general, it would be much more likely to clutter up the minds of those reading the Bill to a degree that unless they were very well legally trained, they would probably know less about it when finished reading than they did when they started.</P>

      <P>If an Act tells me that &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by particular regulations, without saying what that meaning is, unless I hunt for and get those regulations, I still do not know what is the meaning of the words &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo;.  I do not intend to press this but I would ask the Minister to consider whether the amendment as tabled, if it contained an additional subparagraph enabling the Minister to add or vary the definition by regulations, might not meet the point. <Col N="508" /> It would then give a reasonably comprehensive definition but it would put people on notice that it could be varied.</P>

He says it is not possible, and that he does not intend, to frame legislation which the ordinary man might be able to understand. These are not the Minister's exact words.  It would seem to me, therefore, that before I start to drive a car, I should consult a solicitor so that he might interpret the law and so that I might know, for example, whether I am the &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; and the meaning of &ldquo;parking&rdquo; and &ldquo;lights&rdquo;.

      <P>According to what the Deputy has said, it is likely that he would need to take a solicitor with him.  Perhaps I should elaborate, as the matter will arise on other sections. It is not the intention in determining matters to be prescribed by regulation to spell out the matters which any particular regulation is expected to cover.  Something we did not foresee or envisage, which should be included in a regulation under a given section and which is not included, is by implication not allowed to be brought within that section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (2), page 9, lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;disabled (either through accident, by the removal <Col N="509" /> of vital parts or otherwise)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;substantially disabled (either through accident, breakdown or the removal of the engine or other such vital part)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  To explain the reason for it I should say that &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; was not defined in the 1933 Act. Doubts were thrown on the meaning of the words.  It was held in a court case that a vehicle, although capable of being mechanically propelled, was not a mechanically propelled vehicle when it was not actually propelled by the engine&mdash;that is the kernel of the situation&mdash;for instance, a vehicle coasting down a hill or otherwise or a stationary vehicle, even though it was obvious to the onlooker from its appearance that it was a mechanically propelled vehicle.  There was that weakness in that there was no definition in the 1933 Act and the question arose in a court case.  It is for that reason that we have the amendment in a form which will give more clarity.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister some questions. With regard to the definition of &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo;, the section says that &ldquo; `omnibus' means a large public service vehicle which is for the time being used on a definite route for the carriage of passengers...&rdquo; What is the significance of the phrase &ldquo;a definite route&rdquo;?  What is the position of an omnibus which is chartered by a party for a particular function and which may go by one route and return by another, having no particular route laid down?  I assume this is a question that has been considered and I should like to know the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo;, the owner is the person who, in subsequent sections of this Bill, can be made liable in respect of various offences in which the vehicle is involved.  Two points arise in relation to a vehicle which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement.  One of the aspects is that which was referred to <Col N="510" /> in Deputy Costello's amendment which has been ruled out of order.  That amendment was clearly designed to protect an innocent purchaser who, as the law stands at the moment, would not be afforded protection if he buys a vehicle which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement although there is no obligation on the registered owner, on the hire purchase firm or on the road authorities to indicate in any way on the registration book that the car is the subject of a hire purchase agreement.</P>
    <P>As an extension of that, I should like to know what is the position of a person who buys a car which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement in breach, as far as the hirer is concerned, of that hire purchase agreement. Suppose I own a car which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement. I am not entitled to sell that because I am not the legal owner until that hire purchase company is paid off. If I do sell that car to the Minister and the Minister is involved in some offence with that car, does the Minister get off scot free because, under the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in the section, the owner is the person in possession of the vehicle under the hire purchase agreement?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could put the point more clearly to the Minister.  If a person buys a car which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement in breach of the terms of that agreement and that person is involved in one of the statutory offences envisaged by this Bill, as owner is he exempt under this section for the reason that he is not the person in possession under the agreement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins will admit that the cases he envisages here are rather unusual and likely to be unique.  In regard to the liability of the owner or registered owner, I should think that the court, to which undoubtedly such a case would find its way, would, in the initial stages or at some stage in its proceedings, determine whether it was the owner through the hire purchase company, the registered owner or who should be proceeded against under the terms of the Bill.  I do not think one could possibly <Col N="511" /> answer the Deputy categorically in that connection.  Possibly I have not grasped exactly what he intends but in regard to what I understood him to say, I believe the situation would be as I said, that the court would determine the owner and the liability of the owner in the case arising from the circumstances the Deputy outlined.</P>

It works both ways.  As things stand and notwithstanding what the Minister says regarding any civil court, some confusion might arise as between the person who had the agreement with the hire purchase company and an innocent purchaser who might have control of the car for the time being.</P>

    <P>Few as these cases are, they would be even fewer and a great deal of trouble and complexity would be avoided if our tax books were to have <Col N="512" /> a column or a page, something like a land registry document, where burdens, mortgages or loans would be registered. Then the position would be that no person would have a car without having noticed that some hire purchase company had an interest in it. That is very necessary from the point of view of the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser, from the point of view of the hire purchase companies and also from the point of view of prosecutions under this Bill.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will take it up with the Department of Finance, and such other Departments as may be involved, in order to bring about a system whereby, if a car has been bought under a hire purchase agreement, the interest of the party lending the money will be noted in the tax book itself.</P>

      <P>This matter is certainly not new.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that the vast majority of motor vehicles are subject to hire purchase, but why the owner, or owner for the time being, of such a vehicle should be obliged, for the information of the general public, to carry on his windscreen a notice that the car has been bought on borrowed money is something one has to examine.  The person concerned surely must have some right in this matter.  I have looked at this matter from the same angle as Deputy Ryan has stated here, of trying to protect the innocent purchaser of a secondhand car from non-recognised sources.  It must be appreciated, however, that for the public to buy a car from a stranger on the street, and not through an authorised dealer or through somebody of whom he knows, is a risky business at the best of times.  If people are prone to do that sort of thing and continue to do it, I am afraid they will learn their lesson the hard way.  It is not a sufficient argument for compelling an ordinary car owner who has a liability to a hire purchase company for the fact that he owns a car to put a notice on his windscreen saying that he has borrowed money to buy the car, for the mere protection of the innocents abroad who part with their money easily and simply to a stranger who doctors old cars and sells them as new cars at big prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get the record right on this point.  I am not suggesting that such a notice should go on the windscreen; I said it should go on the tax book, which changes hands only when the ownership of the car changes.  That is an entirely different thing.  I do not think this applies only to what might be called secondhand cars.  While the majority of motor car dealers are most reputable, there have been cases of dealers who sold cars as new, notwithstanding hire purchase agreements which existed in relation to those cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that it would not be quite as objectionable to have it stamped on the tax book as it would be to have it on the windscreen. Nevertheless, it is not quite right to say that no one except the vendor of the car or the purchaser knows anything about the tax book.  Tax books are handled through various tax offices, in various years and in various quarters, and for those reasons a person's private business and his private arrangements would be made public&mdash;for the protection of those people who will insist on buying cars from doubtful sources. A register has been compiled to which people may have recourse before the completion of the deal and in that register they can check on whether there is anything outstanding on a particular car.  This point in relation to hire purchase was considered under another heading altogether.  I feel that in all the circumstances that type of safeguard is a reasonable one.  It does not interfere with anyone and it is available to people who want to have recourse to it for their own protection. If they do not, it is their own look-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to flog this matter.  I know the register to which the Minister referred is available to registered motor dealers, but I do not think we should compel a person to go to a registered motor dealer if he wants to carry out a legitimate transaction with a neighbour.  He should be free to do so without having to have recourse to information which, I understand, is a private arrangement between the hire purchase companies and the finance houses themselves. <Col N="514" /> That does not cover the points Deputy Costello, Deputy O'Higgins and I have already stressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is unduly sensitive about people's desire for privacy in regard to their financial affairs.  They would prefer a system under which they would be safeguarded against dishonesty.  In any event, many new motor cars are as dear as house property, and you cannot buy house property without knowing whether or not there is a mortgage or a loan on it.  You cannot buy house property without research in the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry to find out whether or not there is a loan or a mortgage on the premises.</P>
      <P>Therefore, while I appreciate a person's right not to have his financial arrangements disclosed to the world, I think the Minister is taking the wrong view in his desire to protect the private affairs of an innocent party.  It is not possible for me to quote any figures but I know that not infrequently solicitors are consulted by people who innocently purchased cars and subsequently find the hire purchase companies chasing them for the balance due.  Many such cases do not reach the courts&mdash;probably less than .05 of such cases do&mdash;for the reason that the solicitor will advise the purchaser that he has no legal remedy, that the hire purchase company are in the right, and usually an arrangement is made with regard to the balance.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to have the matter reconsidered.</P>

      <P>My information does not correspond with the Deputy's information in regard to this information service, known as Hire Purchase Information Limited.  A Press notice concerning that company was published last year.  I understand that a prospective purchaser of any given vehicle may, at a small fee, have information supplied to him prior to the completion of a deal, for his own safety, if he is dealing with a garage. If he is dealing with his neighbour, I take it his neighbour is not likely to be &ldquo;doing him in the eye&rdquo;.  If he is, no one should deal with him.</P>

      <P>If such a register exists, it makes mincemeat of the Minister's argument that privacy is being preserved and that people are sensitive about it.  If such a register exists, it would give a good measure of protection, but complete protection would be given by adopting the principle in the amendment which Deputy Costello had hoped to move.  There is another system by which the purchaser can very often protect himself, as the Minister is probably aware.  I think all hire purchase companies insist on their name being included on the insurance policy, so long as there is money outstanding, and any prospective purchaser looking at the insurance policy of the vendor could find out in that way whether or not the car was the subject of a hire purchase agreement.</P>

      <P>I should like to confirm that the register of which the Minister has spoken is in existence, and is very frequently used.  In fact, it is invariably used by anyone who is not prepared to take any risk.  I think there is some restriction, however&mdash;although I am not quite certain &mdash;as to who may consult it, for the precise reason which Deputy O'Higgins has stated.  I do not think that register is public property.  It would not be right if the confidential relationship between the dealer and vendor were freely available to anyone.  For that reason, so far as I know, it is open only to a motor trader who is genuinely engaged in the negotiation for sale, or in the sale of a vehicle, and the purchaser of the vehicle.  It does give some protection to the borrower to know that the source of the money with which he originally bought the vehicle will not be disclosed to someone making idle inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, people who buy cars without knowing everything necessary about the owner are taking very considerable risks.  We do not buy property without consulting solicitors and inquiring in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, but we do not always rely on solicitors to carry out the necessary researches to make sure the vendor is the beneficial owner <Col N="516" /> without any restriction on his right to dispose of it.  The public should be warned of the peril which exists when they are buying used cars or other vehicles and advised to do their business through someone who has access to the register which is kept up to date. and can be relied upon.</P>

      <P>I should like confirmation from the Minister that in the case of a Garda who is testing a vehicle, and who may possibly be involved in an accident, the Minister for Finance is the person responsible to the injured party.

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Before making any regulation under this Act, except in cases of urgency, the Minister shall give prior notice of his intention to do so in order to enable organisations representative of road users to make representations to him for his consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point I had in mind in putting down this amendment was to be as helpful as possible to the Minister, without casting any reflection on him or on any of his possible successors. We had a case not so long ago when there was some amendment of the provision for the taxation of commercial road vehicles.  In that case the regulations were all set out but they required considerable amendment by virtue of the complexity of the matter involved.  It seems to me that the Minister is now being empowered to make regulations in connection with a great number of difficult and complex matters and that it would be wise for this House to make some provision whereby the Minister would ensure that the interested parties, particularly the representative bodies formed by various types of road users, would have an opportunity of making their opinions known to him for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite happy with amendment 113, because I believe that one can have too many advisory bodies and an additional advisory council such as is envisaged by amendment 113 does not seem to me to serve any useful purpose in this regard.  There are at the moment two major bodies representing the users of private motor vehicles, the Automobile Association <Col N="518" /> and the Royal Irish Automobile Club. There are also, at least, two organisations representing those who operate commercial vehicles.  I feel that it is bodies such as these that would be very well able to help the Minister by letting him have the benefit of their expert and technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any Minister for Local Government or members of his staff can be expected to have the expert technical knowledge which is available to those whose whole livelihood depends on the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.  I do not intend that as a reflection upon them, but there is always a danger that regulations may be made in perfectly good faith but in quite understandable ignorance of some detail or major principle which could make such a regulation a mistake in the form in which it might be drafted. I hope the Minister will accept my amendment because it does not make the legislation any more cumbersome and it does not set up any advisory body, but it simply asks that he give advance notice of any regulations proposed to be made.  For that reason I have left it deliberately rather vague and I simply ask that prior notice be given to the various representative bodies of any regulations which it is proposed to make.</P>
    <P>I agree in advance with the Minister that these various organisations would have certain vested interests, but I do not suggest that he should feel bound to accept any advice which he might be given by them.  He should make himself open to receive advice and information in connection with the making of regulations.  If the Minister is prepared to do this, it would give much more confidence to road users generally, and I ask him to accept it in the form in which it is drafted or, if it would be more acceptable in an amended form, I would be happy to withdraw it in its present form so that it could be reconsidered on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Booth's amendment and on amendment 113 I would like to say that, while the House as a whole welcomed the provisions of <Col N="519" /> the Road Traffic Bill now before us, there was much justifiable criticism in respect of the number of regulations that the Minister will have power to make when the Bill finally becomes law.  Many Deputies expressed their concern about the power being handed over to the Minister and that concern is being demonstrated by the number of amendments tabled here today.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to attempt to usurp the functions of the Minister.  He and he alone can make the regulations and he and he alone has the power to put them into effect.  I should like to subscribe to what Deputy Booth has said. While we appreciate the functions of the Minister's advisers, the officials of his Department, who could describe them as experts in all the various fields of motoring or of the various offences of which motorists can be guilty from time to time?</P>
      <P>We on the Labour Benches have proposed that an advisory council be established.  The amendment asks that a new section be inserted before Section 121.  Subsection (1) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Before section 121 to insert the following new sections:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall appoint a Road Traffic Advisory Council representative of local authorities, the Garda Síochána and of workers' and employers' organisations, to which regulations proposed to be made under this Act shall be referred for its observations.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Booth says, a motorists' organisation is omitted.  I would not attempt to nominate one in the amendment. However, if the Minister decided to include on the advisory council an organisation or body representative either of the motor trade or the various motorists' associations we have in the country my colleagues would not object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people mentioned in the subsection have a very great interest, not necessarily a vested interest, in this legislation.  Certainly they will have a <Col N="520" /> tremendous interest in the many dozens of regulations to be framed by the Minister.  It is important that local authorities should be in a position to advise the Minister on regulations he may frame under the terms of this Bill.  A serious burden will be placed on local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the provision of different signs, &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs and various signs mentioned in the Bill.  I assume that in the ordinary course of events, the Garda Síochána would be consulted by the Minister and his officials in the framing of certain regulations.</P>
    <P>The workers would be vitally concerned. I do not want to go into detail yet about their interests.  The many amendments will demonstrate how vitally concerned the workers are with this legislation&mdash;the hours they may be required to drive, rest hours, and so on.  An employers' organisation would be concerned, too, with the upkeep of their vehicles, the cost of repairs, the putting of lorries and different vehicles into such condition as may be prescribed by the Minister. It is not necessary to labour all these points now.  The House will readily see how vitally concerned all these people will be not alone in the direct proposals of the legislation but in regulations of which we have no knowledge yet.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal in amendment 113, the Minister is not bound to accept their advice.  If such a council is established, a Minister would feel obliged to listen to them and their advice on various aspects of the road traffic code.  Some might say this would create a precedent and point out that the Minister is responsible and is prepared to accept the responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has responsibilities. The Minister for Social Welfare has responsibilities.  So, too, have the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power. Recent legislation which provides for the safety of workers and the financial protection of employers provided for an advisory council.  The National Health Council was established by the <Col N="521" /> Minister for Health to advise him on health matters.  It is representative of various organisations&mdash;doctors, nurses, the general trade union movement and different sections of the community. They meet frequently.  They advise the Minister on regulations he may introduce under the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>A Factories Act was recently enacted for the protection of workers and to determine what safety measures are required.  The Act carries with it the establishment of a Factories Advisory Council.  So far as I am aware, that council plus the Health Council have worked well.  An Offices Act was recently enacted.  It also carries a proposal for the establishment of an Office Premises Advisory Council.  The proposal to establish this council is not designed to usurp the functions of the Minister or to try to bully or browbeat him.</P>
    <P>I know there will be people on that council who may have a vested interest. We all have vested interests in many things.  Whether we be Deputies, civil servants or anything else, we have vested interests in practically everything. I do not believe the establishment of an advisory council will hinder the Minister in framing regulations. If he accepts this proposal, he will find that traffic legislation can, even by regulation, be improved to a substantial extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 4, I think it is accepted that the regulations proposed in the Bill are of a very widespread nature.  Some of them will deal with matters that are not really the concern of road users, as such.  The amendment suggests that all regulations should be discussed with people representative of road interests and road users.  Some are not of interest to them.  The disposal of fees, for instance, is not a matter that in the ordinary sense would be of interest to road users or interests concerned with roads and road traffic in the ordinary sense.  It would be wrong and cause delay to compel the Minister in all cases to have recourse to the advice of bodies representing various sections of road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> It cannot be disputed in regard to matters such as those referred to in the amendment, that interested parties have been consulted in the past.  On the Second Stage of this Bill I indicated the willingness and indeed the wish to consult those interested in these matters who can be of assistance.  But to oblige a Minister for Local Government to consult in all cases might cause a delay that might not be in the best interests of the community.</P>
    <P>When there is no question of urgency, it is likely that the road user interests concerned will be aware of what is intended long before it comes to pass and that their views will be conveyed to the Minister, either by deputation or written submission.  In that way, the difficulties envisaged by this amendment will not arise and there will be no real difference between what is proposed in the regulations and what is acceptable to the road-using public.  To my knowledge, organisations representative of the motor trade and groups such as the A.A. and the R.I.A.C. have had no reason to complain in the past of not being informed of proposed changes in road traffic regulations affecting their interests.  No such complaints were ever recorded and I do not think they ever existed.</P>
    <P>The position at present then would be to leave the section as it stands, giving the Dáil and Seanad the power to annul regulations, if they think fit, after such regulations have been made. I think the basis of the argument is that safeguards are required.  If that is so, surely that is the best possible safeguard without involving the adoption of a delaying procedure?  The real safeguard is that the Dáil and Seanad may annul an Order after it has been made.  Surely no one will deny that the views of all road users and interests are fully reflected on both sides in the Dáil and Seanad?  In that way, the safeguarding of interests is adequately taken care of.  While what is suggested in the amendment may, at first sight, appear admirable, I do not think it is really necessary.  In view of that, and since it may create a danger of delay in cases where urgency is <Col N="523" /> required, I do not think it serves a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Amendment 113 deals with the setting up of an advisory council.  Such a council could undoubtedly contribute much wisdom, but we must ask ourselves if the wisdom they could contribute is not already available through other channels.  Might not such a council absorb the energies that should be devoted to the implementation of the new Act and might it not tend to channel away energies from the main stream of endeavour?  This idea of an advisory council was adopted in the Six Counties in 1956 and a council was set up.  Very recently, that council has liquidated itself voluntarily.  For what reasons it has done so, I do not know; but I am aware it has done so.  That they themselves should have brought an end to their activities after four short years of existence would seem to indicate that the members themselves could not see any useful purpose for the council to serve.  They have, therefore, taken the sensible step of disappearing of their own volition.</P>
    <P>However, there is a last saver for those who feel this amendment should be carried.  At present, power exists under the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, for the setting up of an advisory committee.  If it happens, when this new Act is under way and the new laws enforced, that we feel there is need for such a committee, we could, if we wished, have recourse to the 1919 Act and set up such a committee. However, it need not necesarily deal solely with matters relating to what is contained in the Bill but could deal with other matters concerning roads and road construction.  In fact, I did consider setting up such a committee under the 1919 Act one and a half or two years ago, but after full consideration of the matter at the time, it was felt that energies which should be devoted to bringing this Bill before the House would be dissipated by the setting up of such a committee.  For that reason, it was not set up at that time.</P>
    <P>By and large, I feel that such a council as is proposed in this amendment would not really help the operation <Col N="524" /> of the new Act.  Having got the Bill through this House and the other House, our first and fundamental task is to put it into operation.  Anything that would tend to take away from that endeavour should not be considered at this stage.  However, the question of whether or not the setting up of such a council under the 1919 Act might be considered at a later stage is one on which I have an entirely open mind.  The House would be well advised not to endeavour to bring in a statutory advisory council at this stage and thereby reduce the effort which should go into having the Bill put into operation at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I might say that amendment No. 4 and amendment No. 113 have a common outlook.  The idea is to get the Minister to submit proposed regulations to the interests most likely to be affected, prior to deciding on the particular regulation he is endeavouring to carry out.  It is desirable that before the Minister commits himself to making a regulation all interests concerned should have given advice freely to him.  It is quite true that the Minister can always avail of advice from anybody prior to making the regulation but the difference between amendment No. 4 and amendment No. 113 is that while it is open to all concerned to advise or to offer advice to the Minister, it is well known that what is everybody's business is nobody's business and all the organisations will each be expecting the other groups or bodies to be making recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the advantage there is when people get together, as they do in a council, and have proposals submitted to them which they must discuss and about which they must come to a decision.  It is a vastly different thing to expect different groups with different points of view to put forward a common policy.  There is the need to get divergent views together, such as employers, workers, local authorities, Garda and motor traders, in a council to discuss this matter and produce a decided policy, if that is possible, and <Col N="525" /> to put that to the Minister.  That would be of much more use to the Minister in determining what is the best regulation to bring forward rather than to be presented with individual views, seen only from the purely sectional angle.</P>
    <P>It is quite true as the Minister said that each Deputy and Senator can constitute himself an advisory council. But we all know the value of that.  How many regulations are placed on the Table of the House and are actually law before a Deputy is aware of it? Again it is a case of what is everybody's business is nobody's business. If a special body were established as suggested by amendment 113, I believe it would serve a very useful function.  I was surprised when the Minister was making his speech to find the case was so good.  He said it could be useful and, if the House still thought so, later on they could bring it in in another section.  Then he suggested it would take from the working of the Bill if we set up such a council.  I could not follow how he was of opinion that energies would be dissipated by forming an advisory council.</P>
    <P>He also pointed out how trivial regulations, such as one to decide what was to be done with certain fees, would have to go before the advisory council and would not be of any great interest to them.  That would only be a line on a sheet of paper which they would look at and agree to without further discussion.  Surely it would not involve any great hold-up for anyone to have a copy of the Minister's intended proposals listed and then let the advisory council single out those they felt were controversial, difficult or objectionable&mdash;and mainly the objectionable proposals.  If they were not in favour of the Minister's regulations, I could see the advisory council disposing of all the objections in a very short time.</P>
    <P>It is most desirable to curtail government by regulation as much as possible. It is the most dangerous type of government and is completely opposed to democracy and gives to a Minister powers which could not be foreseen by the legislators.  We have a very clear <Col N="526" /> knowledge of that under the Health Act which has now become so twisted by regulation as to mean a different thing altogether.  The Road Traffic Act might well meet the same fate.  It is not only advisable but essential that an advisory council should be set up for the protection of the general public and the other various interests who use the roads&mdash;employers, traders and motor users.  I may say that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has a very strong view on this and they feel that such an advisory council is absolutely essential.  The Minister should reconsider his views on this matter.  As he said himself he sees the value of it and it could be established under another Act.  I believe this is the time and the place for the Minister to indicate what he proposes to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of what the Minister has said and I should like to assure him that this was not introduced in any way as a complaint by motoring organisations that they had not been consulted in the past.  It is much more that the organisations of road users were anxious to take this opportunity of trying to get a statutory guarantee that the same courtesy as had been extended to them in the past would continue to be extended to them in the future.  I might say that the making of all regulations might be a matter which would be inappropriate to refer to a representative organisation but, so far as cases of urgency are concerned, I did make an exception in my amendment that the Minister, in the making of any regulations, &ldquo;except in cases of urgency, shall give prior notice.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the Minister can meet me in this regard at all, but we would all be happier if we felt that the Minister would at least consider some means whereby those primarily interested, and those most technically qualified, would be given an opportunity of giving some advice in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with the Minister that there is the final safeguard of the Order being laid on the Table of the House. What I wanted to avoid being brought in was delay in having to do that and then possibly having to pass a resolution which would oppose the making <Col N="527" /> of the regulation in that form.  I hoped he would get the advice in advance rather than in arrear.  In view of what the Minister said, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment, but in doing so I would ask the Minister whether he can give anything more than his own personal assurance that he will seek the advice of representative bodies in future because, while we would accept his personal assurance, we should like to have some assurance which would be binding on his successors.  Accordingly, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the case that the Advisory Council in the Six Counties concluded after four years and he implied that they must have found themselves either exhausted or useless.  Is it not possible that, after four years of dealing with the regulations made, they found that all the regulations possible had been made and there was no further need for them to continue as an Advisory Council? Is it not likely that after four years, they had done all the good work they could possibly do?  Is it not possible that that was the reason they dissolved and not that they had done no work at all?  Four years is a long period in which to give advice after the passing of an Act.  The Minister rather suggested the reverse.  He may not have intended to do so, but he certainly implied that this body dissolved after four years because they were of very little use.  I suggest it is more likely they dissolved because there was no further need for their services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, there have not been any daft regulations, because, in all cases, except where urgency demanded a different course, they have <Col N="529" /> consulted every available source of information in an informal and unofficial manner.  That has been far more effective than would have been the position had they been compelled to seek such information in a formal manner, involving a great deal of paper work before council meetings and a great deal of paper work from such meetings.  That type of machinery involves a great deal more time than does informal discussion.  A traditional close harmony has always existed between Ministers for Local Government and the different organisations representing road users.  To envisage a situation in which a Minister for Local Government would ignore such sources of information is beyond my capacity to either accept or appreciate.</P>
      <P>The practice which has existed up to now will continue.  So far as I am concerned, these matters will be given ample advance publication.  The only exception will be where a matter of supreme urgency arises.  In every other case, notice will be given in advance of the making of such regulations. After that, the regulations will be laid on the Table of both Houses.  It must be admitted that we have in Dáil and Seanad Éireann the most representative group possible, a more representative group than any council would be irrespective of how one set it up or from where one garnered the material for its composition.  The Dáil and Seanad are the best representatives of the interests of all sections of the community and of all sections of road users.  The final say will rest here.  If something detrimental emerges, the House will be in a position to annul the offending regulation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  Where regulations are proposed to be made under any of the provisions of this Act a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations <Col N="530" /> shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been approved by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is rather more drastic than the amendment proposed by Deputy Booth or the Labour Party amendment which was discussed with it.  It does not deal with quite the same problem.  It deals generally with the question of ministerial regulations which will be made under this measure.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to alter the procedure whereby regulations made under the Bill as it stands will have the force of law.  It is required that such regulations will be placed on the Table of both Dáil and Seanad. After a certain period, any regulation so tabled automatically has the full force and effect of law.  Even if it is upset within the prescribed time under subsection (2) of Section 5, any act done under such regulation will continue to have validity,</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, I said, and I repeat it now, that it is better that an Act should be as comprehensive as possible and should stand on its own feet without the props of subsequent ministerial regulations. We recognise that in some types of legislation, and road traffic legislation of this type is one of them, it is necessary, because of changing conditions and even changes in the make of vehicles, that the Minister should be given power to legislate&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;by regulation.  We think, however, that the House should regard legislation by regulation as the exception rather than the rule.  On every occasion on which I have taken part in a debate in which legislation by regulation was under discussion, I have made my views quite clear irrespective of which side of the House I happened to be sitting.</P>
    <P>Every time we pass legislation in this House whereby we give power to a Minister to act by regulation and legislate by regulation, we are to a certain extent abdicating our position and our rights and, indeed, our duties as public representatives.  It should be accepted by the Minister and the <Col N="531" /> House that, as a general rule, a Bill, when it is introduced here, should contain the law which is proposed by the Minister or the Government and that that should not simply be an enabling Act to empower the Minister, his servants or agents not only to define but alter the law subsequently by regulation.</P>
    <P>I can well understand that it must be attractive to any Minister to take powers to legislate by regulation. Amendments have been put down from all sides of the House.  In the amendment moved by Deputy Booth, the amendment spoken to by Deputy Corish and the amendment which I am now moving from this side of the House, there is some significance in the fact that Deputies on all sides of the House have taken exception to some extent to the proposals in this Bill dealing with regulations.</P>
    <P>We suggest that instead of the negative type of procedure which is laid down in the Bill&mdash;the Minister simply has to lay the regulations on the Table of the House&mdash;it should be necessary for the Minister to introduce a resolution and to have that resolution passed by the House before the regulation would have the force of law.  The Minister may tell us in reply that that is going to slow down things and that one of the attractions of legislation by regulation is that you have speed and that very often in road traffic matters speed is essential.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is attractive from the point of view of speed to legislate by regulation but it is essential we should remember, and the Minister should remember, that in agreeing to legislation by regulation the members of this House are giving a concession to the Minister and the Government.  It is a very definite concession because it is the right and duty of the members of this House and of the other House of the Oireachtas to legislate and discuss legislation.  When we are making that concession to the Minister by allowing him to make regulations under the Act, I do not think the Minister or the Government should be allowed to push the House <Col N="532" /> too far.  I do not think it is something too much that we should say to the Minister: &ldquo;Very well, we agree that this is a case where you are entitled to have power to make regulations.  We agree it is the kind of Bill where it is important that the law should be defined or altered in a speedy manner. We are prepared to give you the power to make regulations provided you come into the House and ask the sanction of the House for what you are doing and pass a resolution agreeing to the regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an occasion where I suggest that should be done.  I believe it is important that on some occasion this House should make a very definite stand, first, from the point of view of the House itself, the members of it and the members of the other House of the Oireachtas and, secondly, from the point of view of the people we represent when we talk in this House.  The rights of the House as such are involved and the rights of the people are involved.  They are entitled to expect from us that in any legislation or regulation which is to have the force of legislation we should at least not dispossess ourselves of that right to give our views as representatives on the legislation which is proposed.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is somewhat more onerous than the proposal which he has in the Bill but not a lot.  It still allows him to make his regulations. All we are asking is that he should come into the House and have the regulations passed by the House before they are allowed to have the force of law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper that the Minister published last year in connection with the Road Traffic Bill, it is stated in paragraph 3 that the Government are alive to objections against legislation by regulation but are satisfied that special considerations apply in the case of road traffic law. That underlines what Deputy O'Higgins said in regard to legislation by regulation.  There is never a case in which a Minister seeks to legislate by regulation that he does not assure us he is satisfied that the circumstances <Col N="533" /> of a particular case justify it.  While the Minister accepts&mdash;and must accept &mdash;responsibility for all legislation and while this House is the House which passes legislation, let it be said that the great lovers of legislation by regulation are not so much the Ministers but the civil servants who resent criticism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attacking individual civil servants.  I am attacking the system under which civil servants propose to a Minister why he ought to go into the House and give them power to make the law because that is finally what is going to happen.  The test of a Minister's ability is his ability to stand up against the civil servants. I am not relating that to this particular matter.  I am talking in a general way.  Very frequently, as a matter of practice, regulations are submitted for the signature of a Minister and are made without any more ado.  The regulation is manufactured down in some Civil Service office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of our amendment is to see to it that where laws are to be made controlling the behaviour of the people in the highways and byways of Ireland, where regulations are to be made in regard to speed and the manner in which people move a quarter ton of steel along the roadway, where regulations are to be made regarding vehicles and other things of that nature, these are matters upon which the ordinary members of this House are well informed.  Most of the members are motorists or they have certainly <Col N="534" /> travelled in motor cars from time to time.  We all move along the highways and byways to get into this House.  Perhaps that is one of the things that irritate the administration, the civil servants, who will be making the regulation but we are the spokesmen for the people who feel the effects of regulations.</P>
    <P>Very frequently the person who eats a meal is as good a judge of it as the person who cooks it.  We are the people who will be consuming the meal in this case.  We are the people who speak for those people who are going to eat the regulations cooked for them in Government offices.  Where you have that&mdash;and it touches upon and controls the daily deeds of millions of our people&mdash;this House ought to have an opportunity to consider the regulation put before us.  I appreciate the argument that, in practice, out of 147 Members of the existing House or the 144 Members who will succeed the Dáil there may only be two or three who will give careful consideration to any regulation which reaches them in the course of post.  The fact is that, by spreading the responsibility for reviewing draft regulations, we are preserving the liberties of our people and ensuring that no cockeyed regulation is put into force and left there indefinitely for want of prior consideration.</P>
    <P>I do appreciate that in this and other legislation, we have a power whereby regulations will operate only until there is a motion in this House setting them aside, but I do not think that is quite sufficient.  I believe in such cases, because they are smothered in data, Deputies do not really apply themselves to the application of such regulations. The attention of Deputies is arrested when they have to consider the regulations which are already in force.  I know that Parties in this House have their own sub-committees and that such committees would consider regulations at length but by then the regulations are made.  There is no regulation which is so urgent that it could not get prior consideration by the House.</P>
    <P>After all, we have waited the better part of 30 years for an urgent Road <Col N="535" /> Traffic Bill and, now that we get it, it is already ten years out of date.  We have over 300,000 licence holders in this country involving 250,000 vehicles and here, some small group of civil servants, with the consent of the Minister, are going to control the behaviour of those 300,000 people.  That is bad law and I do not think the Bill which provides for it should be permitted to go through in its present form.  It is for those reasons that I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that in fact we had at an earlier stage come to appreciate the type of Bill this is and the matters which we are dealing with in it.  Whether we like it or not, we must accept that this Bill is dealing with day-to-day operations in a changing pattern of road traffic which, of necessity, has to be dealt with by regulation. The suggestion of Deputy Ryan that Ministers are prone to seek this type of legislation and that behind them are the members of the executive of the Department seeking the easy way to do a job by getting legislation by regulation is not a fact.  I do not think the Deputy is really serious in putting that view to the House as his considered opinion.  I have a slightly higher regard for his opinion on matters such as this than to swallow the suggestion that he is serious in this matter but, if I am misled in this, I must say that I certainly entirely disagree with him.</P>
      <P>In so far as this matter of regulation is concerned, it has been pointed out by the Chair that this is not a matter which one can throw at the executive of the Civil Service.  It is only at the Minister of the Department concerned that any of these charges can be flung and made to stick, if stick they will, and in so far as the advisers to a Minister are concerned, regulations dealing with this or any other matter are not just lumped with the daily correspondence for signature and signed by the Minister without knowing something about them.  If in fact Deputy Ryan's view and his experience have been that Ministers are expected to behave in that way, all I can say is that I do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> The Minister is responsible to the House: his Government is responsible to the country.  He is naturally concerned about any matter emanating from his Department.  He is particularly concerned about any matter arising from legislation which has its origin in his Department.  In making regulations under this proposed road traffic legislation, the Minister of the day will naturally be most concerned to ensure that, since these regulations will concern many hundreds of thousands of people, the regulations made will be of a proper nature and that, if they are not, they will be challenged in the Oireachtas when presented to it and that, if they are objectionable in any degree, the Minister's trouble and labour will have been in vain because they will be annulled.</P>
    <P>No Minister or no adviser wishes to place himself in that position.  No Minister responsible to the House will jeopardise his own future and his Government's future in the public mind by making regulations in a haphazard, inefficient and careless manner which would bring discredit on him, his Party and his Government.  Surely that is quite evident to those making the case that this matter of legislation by regulation is something to be sought after by Ministers.  To suggest such a thing is ludicrous.  If the Minister can be induced, as suggested by the Opposition, to introduce something which is wrong because his advisers advise him that it is right, he should not be there and I doubt if he would be there for very long.  That is a safeguard which I am afraid is sometimes forgotten in this House.</P>
    <P>Possibly I have transgressed in the past in holding the same belief.  We seem to set Ministers aside as if they were immovable, forgetting that the Ministers, like everybody else in the House, are Deputies first and last who are answerable to the people.  We owe allegiance to the people and if we do not give it to them the people will deal with us in their own way.</P>
    <P>They will liquidate anybody who is detrimental to the public good.  Let us forget then the suggestion that the <Col N="537" /> Minister, with just a prod in the back from his advisers, will bring in regulations detrimental to the public good.</P>
    <P>To get down to the amendment, if accepted, it would have the effect of bringing all proposed regulations before the Oireachtas in advance of their being put into operation.  That would immediately bring about a situation wherein an urgent matter could not be dealt with, because, despite Deputy Ryan's repeated comment that we have waited 30 years for this Bill and that in another few months it will be out of date in any case, the Act would be so young that introducing another could not even be thought of.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, there are, there have been and I have no doubt there will be urgent cases where regulations are quickly required.  I have in mind a situation where this House is in recess from midsummer until autumn and if the procedure proposed by the amendment were adopted, we would have to wait from July or August until October or November before we could have the matter even put before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for long.  However, it comes rather strange that the one regulation which was made in an urgent manner, and necessarily so, by the sponsor of this amendment, was made in 1956.  It referred to the lighting of vehicles.  It was Amendment Regulation 1956, S.I./33/4 of 1956.  It was made by Deputy O'Donnell as Minister, and it was made in a hurry. It was made urgently, and necessarily so, because it was discovered that there was a flaw in the regulations in that a trailer need not show a red light to the rear.  I presume that the existence of that flaw emerged from perusal in court.  After the announcement of the verdict, this gap in the existing regulations emerged and Deputy O'Donnell, rightly, immediately set-to to bring about the amendment that closed the gap and made it necessary to have a red light on the rear of a tractor trailer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would anybody say that in the month of August this year, if some such matter arose, the House should be recalled to deal with it in advance of the Minister making a regulation? Would it not be far more sensible, as would be the case under the proposals in the Bill and under the existing provisions, that the Minister should in fact make the regulation and that that regulation should come into force right away and be placed on the Table of the House and within 21 sitting days, that order, if found unsatisfactory by the Oireachtas, could be annulled and thrown out and replaced, possibly, by another?  Is that not a far more sensible approach than to say that an emergency matter, a small matter, although no doubt a very important one, should be left over until the Dáil resumed three or four months after it had gone into recess or that the Dáil should be recalled in the <Col N="539" /> middle of a recess to deal with that one matter?</P>
    <P>It would look ludicrous if we were to find ourselves in the position that we had to recall the House for such a matter when the procedure which we have tried over the years and never found wanting is in fact the procedure we are proposing that the House should adopt.  The House would be well advised to leave the matter as it is.  Experience shows that no flaw exists.  Indeed, while a resounding case can be made for the proposed change, the benefit is more apparent than real. If we do make the change, it will be <Col N="540" /> a retrograde step, although much lauded by the Deputies who have spoken for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have dealt with all the major points raised on this Estimate.  There is very little more I need say.  I was dealing with some points raised in connection with the equitation team when progress was reported on the last day this Estimate was before the House. I said I was glad to see that all the Deputies who took an interest in this matter had noted with appreciation the continued improvement in the performance of <Col N="542" /> the team.  I mentioned in my opening statement that they finished last year with a successful American tour and, when I was replying.  I was able to state that the team had started this year very successfully on the Continent. Since then, Deputies will have noted the further outstanding success of the team at the second show in their present Continental tour at Nice.</P>
      <P>This high standard of performance by a team composed of young riders and horses has been reached earlier than it was reasonable to expect and is a great tribute to everyone concerned. The riders have worked very hard and, in spite of the fact that there was some unkind criticism, their morale is high.  The officers in charge of the School have tackled the task of restoring the team to its former high standard with diligence, skill and enthusiasm.  And the Horse Purchasing Board have played their part and, despite the shortage of suitable animals, have succeeded in getting a number of first-class horses which are obviously able to hold their own in international competitions.</P>
      <P>While I am speaking of the purchase of horses, I should like to assure Deputy Sweetman that there is no specific limit to the amount which may be paid for any one horse.  In fact, in the past two years, the money allocated for that purpose has not been fully availed of because of the difficulty of obtaining suitable horses.  Although the team are doing well, they cannot be considered as being up to strength in regard to the number of first-class horses.  It is the objective of the Purchasing Board to try to rectify that deficinecy as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, the allocation of money for the past few years has been on the basis of the number and price of suitable horses which it was hoped they would be able to obtain during the coming year.  There is no specific limit on the price to be paid for any one horse, except what would be determined by the experience and good judgement of the Board.  I can find no record of any such limit, although Deputy Sweetman has referred to it <Col N="543" /> on a number of occasions.  I do not know if there was any such agreed figure between himself and the Minister for Defence when he was Minister for Finance, but I can find no record of a specific limit in the Department.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view that we should either have a team that is worthy of our traditions of horsemanship or not have a team at all.  I can assure Deputies that there is no such thing as cheeseparing, as was insinuated here, apart from the fact that every effort is made to ensure that good value is got for the expenditure of public money.  As Deputy Sweetman said, there will inevitably be some failures. Some horses will not be as good as was hoped, and some promising riders will not make the grade.  With proper encouragement, the team should continue to improve and continue to give a good account of themselves in international competitions.</P>
    <P>I must say it was rather a shock to me that a Deputy in this House objects to the annual parade on Easter Sunday, the parade which commemorates the birth of the struggle which gave us our present independence in this part of the country, and which is held to honour all those who took part in the struggle.  It is generally agreed that Easter has a uniquely important significance for the Irish people and to me, anyway, it seems inconceivable that this annual tribute should not be paid.</P>
    <P>Most people&mdash;and certainly those who sincerely want to see past bitternesses disappear&mdash;will agree that it would be most unwise for the Army to parade officially at a ceremony held to honour any one particular controversial figure, no matter what side he took during the Civil War.  That could only have the effect of helping to perpetuate the bitternesses which have persisted since that time.</P>
    <P>I regret that on this occasion I allowed myself to be somewhat provoked by the rather transparent attempt that has been made in the past couple of years to introduce this note of recrimination during the debate on this Estimate.  I suggest to the House that it is obvious that the present <Col N="544" /> position in which Easter Sunday is set aside by the State as a day to honour all those who took part in the national struggle&mdash;the position which obtained right up to the change of Government in 1948, and which was reverted to in 1951&mdash;is the fairest, least provocative, and most acceptable way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>I dealt fairly extensively with the question of Army pay and the recent pay increase, and I do not propose to go into any further detail in that regard, beyond saying that, as I suspected, the case made by Deputy Sweetman in which he quoted certain figures is completely wrong.  It is not true to say that civil servants' salaries have been increased by a greater percentage since 1939, than those of the Army, whether officers, N.C.O.s, or private soldiers.  In fact the reverse can be shown to be true, and I have figures to prove it, but, as I say, I went into the matter in fairly considerable detail and I do not propose to detain the House any longer on that subject.</P>

    <P>Go ndeonófar suim nach mó na £1,228,620 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1962, le haghaidh Pinsin Chréachta agus Mhíchumais, Pinsin Bhreise agus Pinsin Fear Pósta, Liúntais agus Aiscí (Uimh. 26 de 1923, Uimh. 12 de 1927, Uimh. 24 de 1932, Uimh. 15 de 1937, Uimh. 2 de 1941, Uimh. 14 de 1943, Uimh. 3 de 1946, Uimh. 19 agus Uimh. 28 de 1949, Uimh. 23 de 1953, Uimh. 19 de 1957, Uimh. 15 de 1959 agus Uimh. 2 de 1960, etc.); Pinsin, Liúntais agus Aiscí Seirbhíse Míleata (Uimh. 48 de 1924, Uimh. 26 de 1932, Uimh. 43 de 1934, Uimh. 33 de 1938, Uimh. 5 de 1944, Uimh. 11 agus 34 de 1945, Uimh. 7 agus 29 de 1949, Uimh. 5 de 1953, Uimh. 12 de 1957 agus Uimh. 3 agus 30 de 1960); Pinsin, Liúntais agus Aiscí (Uimh. 37 de 1936, Uimh. 9 <Col N="545" /> de 1948, Uimh. 30 de 1950, Uimh. 27 de 1952, Uimh. 4 de 1953, Uimh. 17 de 1957 agus Uimh. 4, 5, 6, 31 agus 33 de 1960, etc.); íocaíochtaí i leith Cúitimh de Chomhaltaí den Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil (Uimh. 19 de 1946, agus Uimh. 15 de 1949); agus le haghaidh Ranníocaí agus Costais iolartha ina dtaobh sin, etc.</P>
    <P>£1,842,920 méid iomlán an Mheastacháin seo, sé sin £125,290 níos mó ná an chéad Vóta don bhliain airgeadais 1960-61.  Chun críocha na méaduithe ar phá agus ar liúntaisí deonadh le Cáinaisnéis na bliana sin, tharla i rith na bliana 1960-61 gur aistríodh £54,714 ón Vóta le haghaidh Méaduithe ar Phinsin; tharla comh maith, anuraidh, go raibh gá le Meastachán Breise le go n-íocfaí cúiteamh ar leith do chleithiúnaithe iad siúd a maruíodh sa Congo agus iad ar sheirbhís le Fórsa na Náisiún Aontuithe nó a fuair bás de bharr na seirbhíse sin.  Fágann sin gurbh é £36,076 glan mhéid na breise ar solathríodh don bhliain 1960-61.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is for a sum of £1,842,920, which is an increase of £125,290 on the original vote for the financial year 1960/61.  During 1960/61, however, a sum of £54,714 was transferred from the Vote for Increases in Pensions for the purpose of meeting the Budgetary increases in pensions and allowances, and a Supplementary Estimate was taken last year also in respect of the payment of special compensation to the dependants of members of Na Buan-Oglaigh who were killed while serving with the United Nations Force in the Congo or died as a result of such service. The nett increase over the provision for 1960/61 is, therefore, £36,076.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is, I think, self-explanatory, and I feel that it is unnecessary for me to delay the House unduly in introducing it.  The principal increases are in Subhead G, which provides for retired pay and service pensions for former members of Na Buan-Oglaigh, and Subhead L, which relates to special allowances.  The principal decrease is in Subhead O, which provides for special compensation <Col N="546" /> for or in respect of personnel serving in the Congo.  This year, only a token provision is being made.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad, when concluding, to supply any additional information that may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not given us some further indication of what his intentions are about the further administration of this Vote.  I am sure there is no Deputy in the House who has not received, within the last two or three years, complaints from various sections of the forces that served in this country, whether it be the present Army, the Volunteers from 1916 to 1923, the Army of the Emergency and the allied associations, the nursing services and so on.  The Minister just blandly tells us that the Vote is so much and, notwithstanding all the complaints I know he must have received, he has not given us any indication of what administrative activities he proposes to alleviate the distress a number of these people are suffering.</P>
      <P>Taking the Army first, I am sure the Minister is perfectly aware that the allowance granted to the widow of a young officer who has lost his life in the service is totally inadequate.  He may say that to make a change would involve legislation but I do not know that that is right.  There is a scheme which he can draft which would alter the allowances over the last year or two.  I have written him on various cases but the reply I get is that the limit is set and it is regretted that there can be no increase.  Sympathetic consideration is given but these are the regulations and that is that.  Can you consider the widow of a second lieutenant&mdash;there are very few but there are some&mdash;who gets £80 a year?  That is an extraordinary sum.  We have the case of young officers who were killed recently&mdash;one of them was married&mdash; and again there is no indication of any sort of an adequate pension.  I did think that the Minister would avail of the opportunity granted by this Vote to meet these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of military service <Col N="547" /> certificates, the situation is in a hopeless condition.  The Minister has wound up the Pensions Board and no matter what the circumstances are, or who you are, there is no machinery by which justice can be done to those who, for one reason or another, failed to get the benefits from the 1924 Act, the 1934 Act or the amending Acts.  I feel that the Minister must, over the past two years, have received fairly substantial evidence that there are injustices and hardships still existing that should be remedied.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that hard cases make bad law but I do not subscribe to that view.  Even if there are only two people, when they are entitled to something from the State, the State should give these two people what they are entitled to.  I am aware that the Old I.R.A. have sent a memorandum to the Minister.  I thought again that he might on this occasion avail of the opportunity of this Vote to say that he was having it considered or that he was doing something about it.  I trust that, before a decision is taken on the Vote, he will give some expression of his intentions and the intentions of the Government on the matter.</P>
    <P>Numerous hardships arise on the question of the special allowances.  Not the least of these is the fact that where an old age pensioner had the full allowance and now qualifies for a contributory old-age pension, the increased sum is, I am informed, taken into consideration in the assessment of means.  I am informed that, in certain cases, deductions have been made because there was over-payment for a certain time.  The situation is that one Minister is giving something with one hand and another Minister is taking it away with the other hand.  I feel that that is having a psychological effect on these people.  They felt that they had got something, that the Minister and the Government had been generous.  They were led to believe that they were going to benefit from the increases in the contributory old age pensions.  Those with no special allowances have done so but, where there was a special allowance, that has <Col N="548" /> been withdrawn.  I leave it to any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party to say that that is something he approves of. There is not a responsible Deputy in the House who is not aware of the hardship and distress that have been created for many of those people who have served the country faithfully and well.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have told us something more about the administration of the special allowance.  I mentioned here recently that it is impossible to understand fully how the means are calculated.  For old age pension purposes the assessment is made in one way and for the special allowance it is made in a completely different way.  A standard should be set so that not only would justice be done but would appear to be done.</P>
    <P>As I visualised some years ago, the numbers in receipt of the special allowances are increasing.  However, every week there are more absentees from the roll call.  Time is pressing. In a few years' time, this problem will not be with us.  The Minister should tell us if he received a memorandum from the Old I.R.A.  If so, is he giving it any consideration and what are his intentions?</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to reconsider the whole question of medals with or without bar.  The benefit bestowed upon the Army by giving an extension of service to the people who had the medal with or without bar should also apply to other services in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister, with the Minister for Finance, has been able to make any adjustment in the pension or gratuity of a civil medical member of the Pensions Board.  The matter has been a long time under consideration. He has been a temporary official for over 30 years, rendering wholetime service.  His position is most unsatisfactory.  When I was Minister, the case was made to me that he was a nominee of the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance says he is the responsibility of the Minister for Defence.  Between the two Ministries, he has fallen to the ground.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> I hold no brief for the officer concerned. He did not ask me to make this case for him.  He is not a political supporter.  I feel that, no matter what he is, he is a person who has rendered very valuable and faithful service and should get recognition for it.  The Government of the day, no matter who may be in office, have an obligation in that case.  I would ask the Minister to say what his intentions are about the administration of this Vote.</P>

      <P>The first point raised by Deputy MacEoin was in connection with the pensions of widows of junior officers.  I am afraid he is under a misapprehension with regard to the case he quoted.  He quoted a figure of £80 per annum.  If I understood him rightly, he referred to the widow of an officer who was killed on service with the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had the wrong figure.  A sum of £88 is the pension in the case of a widow of a second lieutenant or lieutenant who dies in the normal way from natural causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a poor sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case such as that to which Deputy MacEoin referred &mdash;a second lieutenant who died as a result of service&mdash;the amount would be £117 10s. 0d. plus 50 per cent. of that amount.  If the officer dies of wounds arising out of his service four years after discharge from the Army, the amount is £117 10s. 0d. but that amount is increased by 50 per cent. if he dies within four years.  Therefore, the figure was completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that that is still a small figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the officer's pay was less than £800 a year, his widow would also be entitled to a contributory widow's pension which is all that is available to most widows.  Therefore the amount provided under the Army pensions code would be in addition to <Col N="550" /> the contributory widow's pension.  That applies to anyone whose pay is under £800 a year.  However, an officer can always keep up the contributions even when he goes over that amount.  The case mentioned by Deputy MacEoin would be under £800 a year and the contributory widow's pension would therefore be payable also.</P>
      <P>My opening statement was rather short.  Recently I introduced an Increases Bill on which I went into considerably more detail.  There was also a recent Private Members' Motion on which most of the points raised in the Old I.R.A. memorandum, to which Deputy MacEoin refers, were covered. I received it only comparatively lately. I am not aware that anything new has been raised in it but, if there is, it will be considered.  It is in process of being considered at the moment.</P>
      <P>The question of special allowances was raised, with particular reference to the case of special allowance holders who have recently qualified for the new Contributory Old Age Pensions Scheme.  There again, I think there is a certain amount of misunderstanding of the position.  It is true that in most cases those who have qualified for Contributory Old Age Pensions&mdash; and they are a very small minority of special allowance holders&mdash;have had their special allowances reduced even though the appropriate annual sums have been increased in the Army Pensions Bill, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should explain something more about these special allowances. First of all, the special allowance is a sum of such amount as, when added to a person's yearly means, will not equal or exceed what is known as the appropriate annual sum.  That is, in essence, what the special allowance is. It is not granted on the basis of service in the same way as the military service pension is.  The only qualification from that point of view is that the recipient or claimant should have been a member of one of the specified organisations for the three months prior to the Truce.  He has not to establish any greater degree of service than that.  There are the other conditions.  If he is under the age of 70, <Col N="551" /> he must be unable to earn his livelihood because of permanent infirmity. Then there is this condition that his means must not exceed the appropriate annual sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is under 70 years, the medical condition comes into it.  If he is over 70 years, that is not a necessary condition.  Certain items of means are taken fully into account in calculating the amount of the special allowance while others are taken into account only in part and others are ignored.  I circulated with the Official Report in reply to a question some time ago the main items taken into account and the main items ignored in that respect.  Perhaps I should give them again now in view of the fact that this question has been raised.</P>
      <P>The principal items taken into account are: value of house, plot or farm; the value of capital&mdash;the first £25 is disregarded; the next £375 is taken at 1/20th of the total and the remainder at 1/10th.  One half of the amount of disability benefit payable under the Social Welfare Acts is taken into account.  The amount of wages, profit from trade or business or other cash income is taken into account.  In the case of an unmarried person one shilling a week of the non-contributory old age pension of 28/6d. a week and 12/6 a week of the contributory old age pension of £2 a week is taken into account.</P>

    <P>In the case of a married person 19/6d. a week of the second pension, where both the person and the spouse are in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension of 28/6d. a week, is taken into account.  In the case of a married person who has a contributory old age pension and supplementary allowance for the spouse, 31/- a week of the combined amount of £3 8s. 6d. a week is taken into account.  In the case of a military service pensioner or a person holding a disability pension, wound pension or Connaught Rangers' pension, the amount exceeding £30 of <Col N="552" /> such a pension or combination of pensions is taken into account where the person is under 70, but the first £30 is not taken into account.  The entire amount is taken into account, however, where the applicant is over 70 because it has already been ignored for old age pension purposes.  In no cases, however, are the increases in pensions granted in 1959 and 1960 taken into account.  They are ignored in all cases.</P>
    <P>The value of free maintenance, where that does not impose any hardship on the giver, is taken into account, but if it can be shown there is a hardship on the person providing the free maintenance, then it is not taken into account.  The value of free lodging is taken at £3 18s. 0d. per annum; and the profit from the contributions of members of a family who are employed and live at home, is assessed on a scale.  If there is a son or daughter working and living at home and contributing to the household, the amount of his or her contributions is not taken into account, but what is estimated as the profit from their contributions is taken into consideration.  If the contribution is under 30/-, no profit is assumed to arise and nothing is taken into account; if it is between 30/- and 35/- 2/- is taken into account; if it is between 35/- and 40/- 3/- is taken into account; if it is between 40/- and 42/-, 4/- is taken into account; if it is between 42/- and 44/-, 5/- is taken into account; if it is between 44/- and 46/-, 6/- is taken into account; and anything over that is 6/- plus the amount by which the contribution exceeds 46/-. That is in respect of urban areas.</P>
    <P>For rural areas there is a similar but slightly different scale.  If the children concerned are under 18 years of age and the contribution does not exceed £28 14s. 0d., no amount is taken into account; if it is between £28 14s. 0d. and £39 2s. 0d., the actual excess over £28 14s. 0d. is taken into account; if it exceeds £39 2s. 0d. a year, then £10 8s. 0d. is taken into account, plus the profit from contributions as I already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The principal items not taken into account are: children's allowances <Col N="553" /> under the Social Welfare Acts; public assistance; free maintenance, as I have said, where it imposes hardship on the provider; maintenance in a hospital, sanatorium or county home&mdash;old age pensions are not taken into account except in the manner I have already mentioned&mdash;Gaeltacht grants, blind welfare grants; infectious diseases maintenance allowances and disabled persons maintenance allowances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of old age pensions it is not true to say that, as a result of the adjustments made in the special allowances, anybody receiving a contributory old age pension received less than he did previously. I explained that up to the 6th January, 1961, only non-contributory old age pensions were payable. They were at the maximum rate of 28s. 6d. per week.  For special allowances, one pension was completely ignored when assessing means. If there were two pensions&mdash;if the man and his wife both had old age pensions&mdash;one was completely ignored and the second taken into account as means to the extent of 24s. per week.</P>
    <P>As from the 6th January, 1961, however, contributory old age pensions became payable for the first time to persons who had the necessary insurance contributions.  Two pounds a week is the contributory old age pension and in the case of a married person the supplementary allowance is £1 8s. 6d. As a result of that, there was a revision of the means adjustment for special allowances.  From that date also the appropriate annual sum for special allowances was increased by £13 a year, except in one particular type of case where the increase was £36 10s. 0d. a year.  That was under the recent Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The means test was revised as follows: in the case of a married person who himself had a non-contributory pension&mdash;as I said it is in this class most of the special allowance holders with old age pensions are included, because only a comparatively small number qualified for a contributory old age pension&mdash;but whose spouse had not, he received prior to the 6th January, by way of pension plus special allowance, approximately £3 6s. 0d. a week.  The non-contributory <Col N="554" /> pension was completely ignored as means in the assessment of the special allowance.  But if as from the 6th January, 1961, he was still not qualified for a contributory pension but continued to be eligible for a non-contributory pension only, the appropriate annual sum in that case was increased by £36 10s. 0d. a year&mdash;giving him approximately £4 a week by way of an aggregated pension and special allowance. That is a person with a non-contributory pension whose spouse had not got an old age pension.</P>
    <P>Where a person, prior to 6th January, 1961, had a non-contributory pension and his wife also had one, the position was as I have already stated &mdash;that the second pension was assessed as means to the extent of 24/- a week and income by way of aggregated and special allowance was £3 10s. 6d. a week.  Now, if as from 6th January, 1961, that person still continued to be ineligible for a contributory pension, the means test was altered so that the second non-contributory pension was assessed to the extent of 19/6d. a week only, and that, taken in conjunction with the increase in the appropriate annual sum of £13, brought him also to approximately £4 by way of combined pension and special allowance. So it is obvious that in both of those cases there was an improvement in the total means.</P>
    <P>In the first case, the previous means were £3 6s. a week.  That was raised to £4 a week and in the second case, the total means were £3 10s. 6d. previously, and by means of the combination of the change in the means test and the increase of £13 in the appropriate annual sum, that was also raised to £4 per week.</P>
    <P>With regard to contributory pensions, where a person became eligible, from 6th January, 1961, for a contributory pension of £2 a week and the supplementary allowance was £1 8s. 6d. a week for his spouse, it was decided that 31/- of the £3 8s. 6d. would be assessed as means so that he would, having regard to the increased annual sum, receive £4 a week approximately by way of combined pension and supplementary allowance and special allowance.  That is what has been done <Col N="555" /> for married couples&mdash;to equalise the position.  By giving a greater increase in the case of a non-contributory pensioner and by taking 31/- of the £3 8s. 6d. into account in the case of the contributory old age pensioner, we have equalised the position of these two classes.</P>
    <P>With regard to unmarried persons, up to 6th January, 1961, the person who had a non-contributory pension had £2 18s. 6d. a week approximately by way of special allowance or pension combined.  It was the position at that time that the old age pension was not taken into account as means.  If since 6th January 1961, he was still eligible for a non-contributary pension only, there was an increase of approximately 5/- a week in the appropriate annual sum and 1/- of the pension was taken into account as means thus giving him £3 2s. 6d. a week between combined pension and special allowance.  If such a person became eligible for a contributory pension of £2 a week from 6th January 1961, then 12/6d. of that pension is taken into account as means and that, taken in conjunction with the 5/- a week increase in the appropriate annual sum, gives him also £3 2s. 6d. approximately, between pension and special allowance.</P>
    <P>It will therefore be seen that in all cases the total income has been increased, that is, a total increase from the combined pensions and special allowance.  As I say, it happened in some cases, for instance where a person became eligible for a contributory pension of £2 and supplementary allowance of £1 8s. 6d., the special allowance fell to be reduced and in some cases was discontinued.  But so far from there being a loss in the total income, the contrary was the case in all instances.</P>
    <P>I agree that this is a rather involved matter but this should make it clear what the position is with regard to these contributory old age pensions. Regard had to be had to the fact that the special allowance was not something that a person is automatically entitled to because of his service but <Col N="556" /> something introduced to relieve hardship. While it is true that some people will have their special allowances reduced, because of the contributory old age pensions the fact is that because of the increase in the appropriate annual sums that were introduced in the Army Pensions Bill, 1961, a number of new people became eligible for special allowances for the first time, and of course all those who did not qualify for contributory old age pensions, either because they had not reached the age or had not got the contributions, also received increases. The total cost of all those increases is £75,000 approximately per annum.</P>
    <P>From 6th January, 1961, also, special allowance holders under seventy received an increase of 5s. a week in their special allowance and in addition to that, there is an increase in the child's allowance from £10 8s. to £11 14s. a year.  The total cost of those increases is £75,000 per annum. I think the best possible use was made of the £75,000 in the way in which it was used.  I do not think it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way; it will only be a long question. Complaints have been made that those who decide whether people qualify or not are only civil servants who were not associated with the I.R.A. and who should receive assistance.  There should be advisory groups set up in every brigade area, is what has been said to me.  As time goes on, it will become much more difficult.  That is just one <Col N="557" /> point.  Would the Minister not set up advisory groups because, until the I.R.A. cease to exist, there will be claimants under this heading?</P>
      <P>The second point is that as this is the only concession medal holders get, they ought to get some other concession. There is the case of the Guards looking for the extra two years' service. Would the Minister not give the medal holders some little concession? I could speak at some length on the raw deal these medal holders got.  They should be getting some little concession by virtue of their being medal holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy MacEoin's point in relation to a member of the Army Pensions Board, I think the Deputy knows the difficulty in granting a pension in the case of a temporary appointment.  It has been the practice, however, that when a person with long temporary service comes to retire, the Minister for Finance invariably considers favourably the granting of a gratuity.  It must be remembered, too, that the normal retiring age does not apply in a case of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different question.  Deputy Sherwin raised the question of establishing whether or not a claimant for a medal without bar had the three months' pre-Truce service. Obviously, it is becoming more and more difficult to establish that.  It is a statutory requirement that a person must have that service before the medal can be awarded.  The special allowance attaches to a duly awarded medal without bar.  It applies automatically in the case of a man with a military service certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have adopted the only possible method of securing verification.  From <Col N="558" /> whom can verification be got except from the officers of the unit to which the person claims he belonged?  If that verification cannot be got and if the weight of evidence is against the applicant, I cannot see how any advisory body could deal with the question more fairly or more objectively than the body available to me in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the evidence of company commanders should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I always pay more attention to evidence at company level than at other levels.  There can be conflicts of evidence even at company level and in such cases one must go further.  We usually go to the battalion and company officers and very often it is difficult to decide even then. There are also the rolls which were submitted.  Again, the presence or absence of a man's name is not taken as definite evidence.  What can one do except assess all the evidence available&mdash;company verification, or the lack of it; battalion verification, or the lack of it&mdash;and the presence on or the absence of the person's name from the company roll.  That is the basis on which one decides that a man had or had not the requisite three months' pre-Truce service.  I can think of no other more satisfactory method of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Those interested should apply for their medals now and have them verified and awarded now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister says they will be rechecked again before they get the allowance.  In ten years' time, all the officers may be dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no recheck in the case of a medal awarded under the present system, but in some cases when the medals were originally awarded, I am afraid the officers were not as careful about verification as they are now that this monetary provision <Col N="559" /> attaches to the medal.  In such cases, we try to get the award of the medal re-verified.  Where there is no possibility of getting such verification because the officers concerned are no longer available, the only just course appears to be to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt.  With regard to claims now, surely the neglect in not claiming until now is the claimant's own fault.  We could not be expected to award such a claimant a medal merely on the basis of his own statements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the two years' extension of service for members of the Garda Síochána, that is a regulation which was introduced by the Minister for Justice, as the Deputy knows.  It has nothing whatever to do with the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Where their health and circumstances are such as to qualify them, they can get a special allowance.  With regard to the service medal with bar in the case of members of the Garda Síochána, that medal with bar was awarded in cases where either the Board of Assessors or the Referee and Advisory Committee awarded a military service certificate.  In the case of those who were turned down by either of these bodies, the Minister has obviously no power to go against that decision since these were statutory bodies entrusted with the task of deciding whether or not the applicant was a person to whom the relevant Acts applied.  Nothing can be done to reopen such cases.  If a person has never applied for a military service certificate under the appropriate Acts, I can consider a claim for a military service medal with bar.  I cannot award a military service certificate.  If, however, it is decided that the evidence produced in the course of such investigation <Col N="560" /> is such as would justify the award of a military service certificate, the applicant can be given a military service medal with bar and that will qualify him for two years' extension in, for instance, the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why a special allowance is not retrospective and why there is undue delay in having it passed.  The Minister will agree that the special allowance takes a long time to investigate. When there is an award, there is no retrospective payment.  Would the Minister say why and whether it is his intention to have it retrospective in the future?  I should also like to ask the Minister why a Guard, who made application for a military service pension and was refused, has no hope <Col N="561" /> of getting the medal with bar?  In other words, he has no hope of getting an extension of his service.  Could the Minister explain to the House why or how that decision was arrived at?</P>
      <P>Again, I would ask the Minister to tell the House how many applications for medals are in abeyance at the moment?  There is grave dissatisfaction with regard to verification amongst many of the young soldiers.  Is he aware that many of the old soldiers are being buried in poverty-stricken circumstances?  The hat has to go around.  Surely the Minister will see it is now time to make provision to cover the funeral expenses of all soldiers who die in impecunious circumstances.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister state whether it is his intention to provide medical treatment for those in receipt of wound and disability pensions?  I should like the Minister to say whether he will consider official treatment for those who have already been awarded wound and disability pensions. Will he tell the House how many people's claims are now outstanding in respect of dependants' allowances?  Can he tell us how many were refused?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that some claims for special allowance do take a long time to investigate. That is no fault of my Department.  As I said, we have to obtain verification before a medal can be duly awarded. The only way in which verification can be obtained is by applying to the company or battalion officers of the unit to which the claimant claims to have belonged.  A number of these officers are very lax in replying to queries.  You have to wait a reasonable time for the person concerned to reply. In the absence of verification, it is very unlikely that a decision would go to the applicant.  Before deciding, you have to send a number of reminders to those people.  In any case in which there is a long delay, it can be taken <Col N="562" /> that the delay is made in the interests of the person concerned.  If adequate verification were available, the decision would be made quickly.  If the matter is not decided in a reasonable time, the likelihood is that it is being held over in order to try to obtain verification which would establish the person's claim to the medal.  I think that is the usual and probably the only cause of the delay.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question whether the allowance, when finally granted, should be made retrospective, that is a principle which it would be very difficult to expect any Government to accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not got the same type of investigation there. In that case, it is only a question of means which has to be investigated. Here we have to investigate a person's entitlement to a medal.  We have to investigate a claim for service given 40 years ago.  In most cases, it is the person himself who has been remiss in not applying for the medal earlier. Most of these cases are difficult to decide because of the fact that the service claimed was given such a long time ago and the fact that people's memories have deteriorated in the meantime.  Also, it is sometimes difficult to trace some of the officers concerned and others are deceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Davern said, that a member of the Garda Síochána, who was refused a military service certificate either under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act, has, under the existing regulation, no hope of extension of service.  I do not think it reasonable to ask me to do anything about that.  The regulation is that the two years' extension of service is granted to a member of the Garda Síochána who has been awarded a service medal with bar.  The qualification for that is a military service certificate.  Whether a man qualifies for a military service certificate or not is established by the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act or the Referee and <Col N="563" /> Advisory Board under the 1934 Act. The Minister has no power to overrule their decision so there is nothing that I, as Minister for Defence, can do in that respect.  In the case of a Guard who never applied for a military service pension under the 1924 or the 1934 Act, I can deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern asked whether I could give any idea of the number of current applications for medals without bars.  There are in my Department quite a big number still undecided. Some of them arose a considerable time ago.  The number, I think, would be of the order of 5,000.  Most of those are cases where it appears impossible to get verification.  Applications for these medals are still coming in very rapidly, at an estimated rate of about 1,000 a year and the practice is to deal with those which appear to be the most urgent.</P>
    <P>In a considerable number of the undecided cases, it may be that the applicants have since died.  Medical treatment for wounded and disabled pensioners is, of course, provided only in the cases of disability of a temporary nature&mdash;where there is some hope that the degree of disability will lessen with treatment&mdash;but in the cases of final disability, there is no provision under the Army Pensions Acts for medical treatment.  In those cases, however, the services provided under the Health Act are available.  The Deputy also asked about the number of applicants for dependants' allowances.  I think he was referring to allowances under Part II of the 1953 Act and I can say that there are very few such cases outstanding at the moment.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (1) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) For the purposes of this section `local bye-law' means a bye-law made by the Commissioner to which subsections (5) and (6) of this section apply; `general bye-law' means a bye-law made by the Commissioner which is not a local bye-law.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are to some extent related to amendment No. 5 which was defeated, but they are in no way dependent on the decision on No. 5.</P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to bring bye-laws which may be made under this Bill by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána before the House. It seems to us that an anomalous position exists where regulations which the Minister may make under this Bill must come before the House, even in the negative sense provided for in the Bill, of being laid before each House of the Oireachtas and capable of being annulled by resolution of the House whereas bye-laws made under the Bill by the Commissioner do not require any authority, even in the negative sense, of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are later sections in this Bill which give the Commissioner power to make bye-laws in a whole variety of matters.  Without claiming to be accurate, I counted up to 60 specific matters on which the Commissioner is empowered to make bye-laws.  With regard to some of those bye-laws it is necessary for him to get the consent or approval of the Minister; with regard to others, it is necessary for him to consult with local authorities and with regard to others he can make the bye-laws, <Col N="565" /> as I read the Bill, without either the consent of the Minister or consultation with the local authority.  Just as in the case of Ministerial regulations, when these bye-laws are made they are going to have the force of law and the arguments which I made on amendment No. 5 apply with as much effect, and, in fact, even greater force and effect, to the question of bye-laws made by the Commissioner as they did to regulations being made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>These bye-laws can be of either general application or local application and what this series of amendments is designed to do is to require that, in the case of bye-laws of general application which the Commissioner is empowered to make, those bye-laws should have the force of law only when they are passed by a resolution of the House but that in the case of local bye-laws&mdash;that is, bye-laws which are purely of local application&mdash;it will be sufficient to lay the bye-laws or the draft of the bye-laws before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that they should, so to speak, come into force by default, if none of the Deputies representing the constituency affected by those local bye-laws moves to have them annulled.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have some measure of control over the bye-laws made by a person who is not <i>ex officio</i> amenable to account for these bye-laws to the House.  The regulations made by the Minister&mdash;a question which was argued on the last amendment&mdash;are in a somewhat different position.  At least, the Minister is a member of the Government and is a member of this House and to that extent he is accountable for every regulation he makes to this House; he is answerable to the House by way of Parliamentary Question, motion or anything else.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is in a different position and it seems to me there is little or no justification for the anomalous position being created where the Commissioner can make bye-laws without reference to the House and the Minister cannot make regulations without reference to the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> I imagine that the reason which will be advanced for that position is that the bye-laws to the made by the Commissioner are on matters which are relatively speaking, as compared with the ministerial regulations, of minor importance.  I do not know that everyone will accept that point of view.  It seems to me the Commissioner has power to make bye-laws with regard to a very great variety of matters of greater or lesser importance. If these amendments, as designed by us, do not meet with the Minister's approval, I would urge on him to examine the whole question and, if necessary, bring in his own amendments to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree with me when I say that while we talk in this Bill about bye-laws being made by the Commissioner, in actual practice, these bye-laws are often the product of the local sergeant or Guard, who makes his recommendation to the authorities and his recommendation subsequently becomes the Commissioner's bye-law. As far as I know, that is the way things are done.  I do not see any other way in which it can be done because, certainly, as far as local bye-laws are concerned, the Commissioner cannot be expected to go down and make an on-the-spot examination and he must rely on the officers and men under his control.  So that you have the position, I suggest, where the recommendation of a Guard or a sergeant somewhere in the country will, through the machinery of this Bill, without reference to this House, have the force and effect and authority of law unless something is done on the lines suggested in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is really a re-enactment of Section 8 of the 1933 Act which prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in making bye-laws. The section also provides that the making of representations by local authorities will be a reserve function. There are two kinds of bye-laws, the general bye-law and the local bye-law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general bye-laws, which the Commissioner proposes, are subject to <Col N="567" /> the approval of the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister may approve of them or modify them and then approve of them.  In that role, the Minister for Local Government will be representing the Dáil in his perusal and approval or rejection of the proposed bye-laws of the Garda Commissioner. Bye-laws of this general character would not be the product of the local sergeant. These general bye-laws are made by the Garda Commissioner. in the implemention of his police policy and it is on that basis that we must have regard to them in our deliberations here.</P>
    <P>The local bye-laws are bye-laws of local interest.  While, as Deputy O'Higgins has said, they may emanate from the Commissioner from information brought to his notice by a sergeant or other member of the Garda down the country, the fact remains that those bye-laws, however they may arise, are presented to the Minister for Local Government only after consultation with the local authority concerned, whether it be a county council, urban council or other such body.  The Minister then may approve or not approve, as the case may be, of the proposed local bye-law, but in his consideration of it, he will have regard to and have before him the representations of the local authority which will be the elected body's representations and not those of their manager or some of their executive officials.</P>
    <P>The background to the making and operation of the bye-laws under the 1933 Act is relevant in that the procedure was practically similar to this and over the past 27 years, no real objection that I am aware of has been noted in my Department in regard to it.  I am at a loss to know why we should anticipate that any such difficulties will arise in the future.  The fact that this practice, which has continued for 27 years, has not given cause for complaint is a very strong recommendation as to why we should not readily change the procedure in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the general bye-laws made by the Commissioner and submitted to the Minister are made by the Commissioner in implementation of his <Col N="568" /> general police functions so that he may maintain order.  The local bye-laws will have been vetted and commented upon and suggestions will have come from the local elected body in whose area the local bye-law will apply. It then goes to the Minister who can have a further look at it.  If he does not like it, he can amend or modify it in keeping with what he believes or with what the local authority suggests to him.  It is only then the proposed local bye-law will have the force of law.  In that way there is full cover against the risk of anything untoward being done against the best interests of the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>Strong though the plea be that Deputy O'Higgins has made that this provision be considered between now and Report Stage, it does not seem to me we would be wise in changing a well-proven procedure.  I do not feel that a sufficient case has been made or is capable of being made to justify altering the practice which has obtained over such a long number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pressing this, but I should like the Minister to have another look at it. The Minister has to a great extent based his case against these amendments on the belief that no very great exception has been taken to the procedure up to now.  My information does not tally with that.  I am not suggesting that representations have been made frequently or even at all to the Minister's Department regarding the matter, but I understand that local authorities very often find themselves in the position that they, as the authority controlling an area, town or village, take one view with regard to the bye-laws which are made by the Commissioner and the local garda takes another view.  There is that conflict of opinion and, as the law stands, the view of the local garda must, of necessity, prevail over the views of the representative local authority.  I should like the Minister to look at the provision again, particularly in regard to that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall not less frequently than once in every five years cause to be published in one or more volumes as he may think proper every regulation and bye-law made under this Act in the form in which such regulation or bye-law is then in force and shall put the same on sale at such price as the Minister shall determine.</P>
      <P>(2)  Copies of every such publication shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope this amendment which stands in the name of Deputy O'Donnell will be accepted by the Minister, at least in principle.  It is designed to provide that the public generally will have from the Minister some type of volume or publication containing the various regulations to be made under this Bill.  I want to assure the Minister&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Booth, as a person qualified to speak on the subject by virtue of his legal training, will also assure him&mdash;that so far as legal circles are concerned, there is a very definite need for such a provision.  When I say &ldquo;so far as legal circles are concerned&rdquo; I am not talking merely of the convenience of solicitors and barristers, but of the fact that, if they are to give proper service to the public, they should be able to put their hands on regulations, and on any changes, amendments or alterations made in regulations from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we start legislating by reference, we are inclined to get into a jungle which it is exceedingly difficult to get out of.  You start looking at one regulation and find it has been amended or replaced by another regulation, and it is, therefore, very hard <Col N="570" /> to find out just where you stand, and where the regulations stand.  We are suggesting that at least once in every five years&mdash;and that is not too much to ask&mdash;the Minister should be under a statutory obligation to publish in one volume the existing state of the regulations made under the Act.  In other words, we are not saying the Minister should go to the trouble of putting into this volume all the regulations made and repealed, but that he should bring out a volume of the regulations which are then effective and current.  We suggest that should be done once in every five years and we even agree that the Minister, if he feels the Government require it, might make a little profit by fixing a price for the volume and putting it on sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for the publication of statutory instruments rests with the Stationery Office. In fact, I do not think the Department or the Minister would have power to publish them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would have power, if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whether the power is there or not, I do not think it really alters the case very much because ministerial regulations, Garda bye-laws and rules under the Bill would be statutory instruments and published as such by the Stationery Office.  The Bill also provides specifically in Section 90 that local authority rules in regard to parking meters or such matters, for example, will be deemed to be statutory instruments and published by the Stationery Office. The Attorney General's office arranges for the periodic publication of an index of statutory instruments.  All that goes part of the way to meet the case that the proposers of the amendment feel would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Reading, I undertook that, if feasible, I would have the full list of current regulations published each year, with some helpful notes. That list could be published every year showing the bye-laws, regulations and rules in force and, very briefly, how and why they had been amended.  We could do that but to put it in statutory <Col N="571" /> form and oblige the Department to do this, that and the other, might not, indeed, be worth the candle.  It would add considerably to the paper work and, at the same time, it might not give any better service than that which is feasible and possible at present, without making any great difficulty for anyone.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department's annual report should be mentioned.  That report describes the regulations and bye-laws made under the road traffic legislation every year, and a summary of road traffic law is published in the Rules of the Road for the information of the ordinary road user in ordinary understandable non-legal language, if I might put it that way.  The Rules of the Road booklet is revised from time to time to bring it up to date in relation to the changes which have taken place since the previous publication.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Rules of the Road booklet, subject to revision from time to time, setting out in ordinary language that is fully understandable by the vast majority of our citizens, the departmental annual report describing the regulations and bye-laws which emerge every year with regard to road traffic legislation, together with the Attorney General's index of statutory instruments published periodically, plus the publication by the Stationery Office of all statutory instruments, I feel that what is being sought here by way of a volume published at least once in every five years is, in fact, being more than met at the moment, or will be met under the existing regulations and laws.</P>
    <P>In fact, if one were to wipe out all the other matters I have mentioned and substitute this amendment the effect would be that what is sought by the amendment would be less readily available than it now is.  I put it to the Deputy that if he considers the various heads under which information bearing on road traffic regulations and rules is being provided, he will be satisfied that the intention of the amendment is, in fact, being better carried out, or will <Col N="572" /> be more fully carried out, as things are than would be the case with this publication every five years.  I genuinely feel that is so.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have misunderstood me.  We are not suggesting that the volume which this amendment recommends should in in any way replace either what is there already or what the Minister proposes should be there.  We are suggesting that this volume should be in addition to the other facilities which already exist.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the index published by the Attorney General's office and to the Statutory Rules and Instruments published by the Government Publications Office.  In effect, what the Minister is saying is that every regulation and every bye-law which will be made under this Bill will be published, and will be available if you have either the knowledge or the patience, or both, to go and look for it.  We are suggesting that notwithstanding the publication that must take place now according as regulations and bye-laws are made, and notwithstanding the index which is published at least once in every five years&mdash;and I should prefer to see it published once every year &mdash;the Minister should accept the responsibility of combining in one volume&mdash;or if that is not found practicable, possibly in two volumes&mdash;all the bye-laws and regulations made under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, in relation to road traffic.  As a person with some experience in these matters, I assure the Minister it would be of very considerable help to the public generally if that were done.</P>

      <P>I think this is the point we must bear in mind.  An index of all the bye-laws would not necessarily tell you at any stage whether your <Col N="573" /> search was complete.  You would really have to go all the way through all the bylaws and try to remember what you had read all along.  I would support Deputy O'Higgins on this matter and urge the Minister to see if something along these lines could be done.  It is difficult to get the authority and I see the Minister's difficulty but I feel that something along the lines of this amendment would give him the authority and the obligation.  It would be easier to amend as you go along.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Booth are both coming to the same point.  They wish a reference in the Bill to the effect that when they had a certain volume in their hands and had read it, they would know at the end that the position was as stated.  I would be prepared to do something like that annually but I would ask the House not to make it a statutory obligation on me to do so. I would be prepared to publish a list of regulations each year showing how they had been changed or altered.</P>

We are very glad of any assurance that this will be done each year but there will always be a danger that, if the Minister does not do it each year, someone will feel aggrieved that he had been looking at the last list of regulations published and finds that they have been amended since and that he has been committing an offence.</P>

      <P>I hope I am in order in dealing with this point but if I go too far, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you can rule me out of order.  Personally I do not think it matters a great deal how these are published. What is important is how they come into operation.  I think the Minister misunderstood what I said on the Second Reading when I suggested that a committee of the House should advise on these regulations.  The Minister said that the Committee of the Seanad was doing that type of work.  The Committee of the Seanad does examine regulations and statutory instruments to see that they conform with the statute but it would be possible to make regulations that would be statutory regulations but that, at the same time, would be revolting regulations.</P>
      <P>In relation to road traffic some advice other than that of experts, let them be engineers or police, would be very desirable and could be very useful. Road traffic problems are not such that we know what they are at any particular time and can find the answer. They change.  I cannot think of anybody more representative of the people generally than this parliament and I still think the Minister will come around to my point of view that a Parliamentary Committee on road traffic regulations would be very useful.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (5) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Subsection (4) of section 3 of the Roads Act, 1920, shall be construed and have effect as if&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the reference in paragraph (a) to expenses were a reference to the expenses which in the opinion of the Minister are reasonably and properly incurred by the relevant council of a county or corporation of a county borough in connection <Col N="575" /> with the levying of the duties referred to in that paragraph, the registration of mechanically propelled vehicles, and the issuing of licences to drivers (including the issuing pursuant to this Act of test certificates, certificates of competency and certificates of fitness),</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12, on behalf of Deputy Lynch:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), paragraph (a), line 29, before &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, seating capacity and dimensions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is really to take this opportunity to call the attention of the Minister to what is suggested in the amendment rather than that we feel it necessary to insert the words proposed.  I think that Section 11 as it is drafted is sufficiently wide to cover the question of seating capacity and dimensions which is suggested in the amendment.  Under subsection (2), paragraph (a) the Minister has power to make regulations regarding the construction of vehicles.  I do not know if that general description &ldquo;construction of vehicles&rdquo; is sufficient to enable the Minister to make regulations <Col N="576" /> regarding the seating capacity. If it is, the amendment is not necessary other than to urge on the Minister the necessity, in a number of cases, to control the make of vehicles in regard to seating capacity; that is where you have vehicles that appear to be designed to allow three passengers and a driver to sit in front and another three passengers in the back.</P>
    <P>The Minister should&mdash;and I think the Garda should advise him as to the prudence of this&mdash;consider whether it is not necessary to make regulations to prohibit more than one passenger in any type of vehicle from sitting in front with the driver so long as there is any risk that there might be interference with the freedom of the driver to react to emergency conditions.  Our roads, except some of the larger of the main roads, are not of infinite width and the Minister and most Deputies will have found that there are good vehicles or industrial vehicles of a size and design using the roads in a manner which makes it extremely difficult and dangerous for other road users.  The Minister should consider whether it is necessary to do anything about that and whether the regulations which he is empowered to make under Section 11, subsection (2) (a) give him the necessary authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the passengers, very often.  I was not quite clear as to the intention of the amendment. The Deputy has cleared my mind to a degree.  I have no doubt whatever that in so far as seating capacity is concerned subsection (1) and, again, subsection (2) (d) will completely cover the point.  With regard to dimensions, we can rely on subsection (1) of Section 11, together with subsection (2) (a) (b) (c) and (d), in that order. All of them together will fully and completely enable both these matters to be exclusively dealt with under any foreseeable circumstances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> In subsection (2), paragraph (c), to add to the end of the paragraph &ldquo;including the type of lights used as traffic indicators.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to call the attention of the Minister to the necessity for some standard colour and type of traffic indicator, particularly colour.  Deputies will agree that the present position is quite unsatisfactory. There is the arm-type traffic indicator which is generally amber in colour.  There is a multitude of colours with the flashing type indicator&mdash;red, white, amber, and so on.</P>
    <P>The flashing indicator can be extremely confusing to a driver coming behind or against the car and to pedestrians, cyclists and other users of the road.  One is not quite sure, for a minute, whether it is a brake-light or a traffic indicator.  A white flashing indicator can be more confusing still.  It might be a parking light going out of order, or it might be intended to indicate that one is turning. It should be possible under the various subheads on which the Minister may make regulations, to make a regulation governing this matter.  I see some danger in it.</P>
    <P>It does not seem reasonable to expect car manufacturers or car users to alter their design even to the extent of coloured glass or coloured bulbs overnight. A policy should be laid down by the Minister's Department in relation to this matter and be put into operation by means of regulations.  The Minister should give notice that as and from a certain date electric lights used as indicators should be of a standard colour and as far as possible should be of a standard design.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the spirit of what Deputy M. J. O'Higgins has said.  I hope another point too can be covered.  I refer to candlepower.  Some indicators are designed to give warning and, in the normal way, with the city lights on&mdash;half dark and half light&mdash;suddenly, in front of you, a blaze of illumination goes on and off which is most blinding.  There should be a strict regulation about <Col N="578" /> candlepower and possibly a re-examination of the vexed question of the appropriate lighting of a vehicle in a lighted street.  There are great arguments on this subject.  Some people think you should drive with your headlights dimmed; other say that you should use your side lights.</P>
      <P>I do not know if a satisfactory regulation can be made but a definite inquiry should be made as to the effective lighting of a vehicle in use in a lighted street.  I do not mean a halflit street, which is only too frequent in a Dublin city.  I hope the new membership strength of this House will produce better light in this city.  However, even in a lit street, the difficulty appears to be that from the point of view of the driver there is no difficulty. Driving down O'Connell Street at night, which is brilliantly illuminated, one can see everything with only two tiny pin-points of light but the cyclist or the pedestrian may not see you.  It is equally important that they should see you.  How that may be achieved I do not know in a country of this size.  We might very well make representations to the big manufacturing companies. It appears to me that a type of light which is large in area but not too bright would be desirable&mdash;something that would be obvious to pedestrians without causing dazzle.  In particular, I hope the Minister will deal with the question of the amount of light that comes from flashing indicators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy Sheldon with regard to the intensity of light in trafficators. Recently I asked the Minister a question and he told me the matter would be considered in connection with the new Bill.  Within the past six months I heard from two district justices <i>obiter dicta</i> on this point.  Two people charged with dangerous driving were I believe, quite rightly, not convicted because in both cases the district justice was quite satisfied that the intensity of the trafficators was such as to dazzle the motorists.  We could have a prolonged debate if each Deputy were to give his experience as <Col N="579" /> a motorist.  I do not wish to contribute on that score.</P>
      <P>Medically speaking, I have average eyesight.  I am constantly blinded at the most dangerous points at which you can blind a motorist, namely, traffic junctions, by the intensity of trafficators blinking on and off a few feet from where I am sitting.  That is particularly so on a wet night when each drop of water on the windscreen may catch and reflect the flashing light.  It is a constant source of danger and needs to be remedied.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to see trafficators a mile away.  They need attention only 20 or 50 yards away. The intensity on many modern cars is much stronger than is necessary.  When my garage man suggested recently that I should have blinking lights instead of arm trafficators he boasted that they were of a certain intensity. I told him that while that might leave me in a good position, if I were prosecuted for dangerous driving, I considered I was constituting myself a hazard to other road users by having trafficators of such great intensity.</P>
      <P>What Deputy O'Higgins says is quite true.  They are confusing, between amber, red and white ones.  They are also confusing when you have some modern cars&mdash;these fin-tailed cars&mdash; with red lights of greater intensity and width than traffic lights themselves.  I appreciate that all these things are difficult for us to control.  In the motor industry, we are not a design country, but simply an assembly country.  But were we to provide some firm regulations to be applied by a certain date, I believe we might help to restore some degree of discipline and safety, in so far as trafficators are concerned.</P>

      <P>I suspect that discussions of this sort are likely to intrude themselves very frequently in this Bill.  This is not merely a question of technical equipment in cars; it is a question of the psychology of the drivers and other human agents involved. In modern conditions, this is evolving into a science of its own.  It is very easy to have opinions about it, but we are at the stage where a great <Col N="580" /> deal of information has been accumulated. This is now a matter of very definite scientific study.  As Deputy Ryan says, all of us will give our ideas. I grant you that the question of dazzling rere lights generally&mdash;and I would not restrict it to traffic indicators&mdash;is one that has struck most people at some stage or other, but the solution will not be found by our discussing it here like this.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, I am sure our police and local government authorities will, when they come to these problems&mdash;and they probably have already done so&mdash;give them the serious consideration they demand.  But in conjunction with this, I was going to suggest to the Minister that there is an agency, not very far away, where information might be had.  It might be well worth while to consult the Road Traffic and Road Safety Research Department which has been developed across the water recently. Traffic laws and, to some extent, traffic conditions have a certain similarity in the two countries, particularly the rule of the road, which is an important determining factor.  We have here at present vehicles designed for America, Europe and for Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that perhaps his Department could get some useful information from the Road Safety Research laboratories and from the directors there; but in any event, I suggest that the matter should be referred to some competent technical commission and not merely resolved on the opinions of most of us, who have not the assembled data to really come to a proper conclusion. It is amazing, when all the information is assembled and the experimental and observational data are assembled, how clearly certain answers emerge.  Sometimes they may be quite contrary to what we may have felt at our first approach to the problem.  It is important that these answers should be properly assessed and applied.  Instead of harassing the Minister throughout this debate with our opinions on technical matters, I should like to make this suggestion at <Col N="581" /> the outset.  When we come up against these matters again, I will renew the suggestion to have, where necessary, technical groups or study committees put on such problems.</P>

      <P>Tourists coming to this country have been encouraged in recent years to bring their cars with them.  I think that aspect should be taken into account in any regulations we make.  Perhaps the point raised by Deputy de Valera would cover the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to disagree with Deputy de Valera.  One of my grave doubts about this whole setup for making regulations is the fact that it is going to be done by experts who, to my mind, have the oddest points of view.  They seem to live in a world of their own.  I should like the ordinary man's point of view.  I think it would do the Minister's experts a world of good if there were some volume of debate here from the point of view of the practical motorist. Most Deputies drive cars.  They do not drive them with their eyes shut; if they did, they would not be sitting here.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point about tourists, anyone taking his car to France has to conform with the lighting system there and change to blue bulbs.  If we make regulations here, I do not see why tourists should not be reasonably expected to conform with them.  If the Deputy wished to take his car to France, he would have to change his headlight bulbs.  I do not think the tourist is any great problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheldon misunderstood me.  Opinions and reactions are all right, but we should not attempt to solve the problem.  Whether we like it or not, the problems of road safety and road traffic are now developing into a quasi-science.  Scientific research methods are being applied to these matters, both on the Continent and in England, with very remarkable results.  They will have a statistical impact on the question of casualties on the road and safe driving.  It is from <Col N="582" /> that point of view I made the suggestion and not from the point of view on which Deputy Sheldon seems to have taken me up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear any such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the colour of traffic indicators, I think there is a very real problem here.  It is not too difficult to solve, especially in view of the fact that it is becoming more general&mdash;certainly in Britain and, I think, almost certainly in America&mdash; that direction indicator lights should be amber rather than red.  I think the more pressure we can bring on manufacturers to make this standard, the better.  Every modern car is fitted with red brake lights at the rere, which means that every time you press the brake pedal, two red lights light up at the rere.  Very often one of those brake lights fails, in which case every time you put down the brake pedal you get a very good simulation of a rere winking indicator, and this can lead to fatal results.  I have several times very nearly got caught by noting a red winking light, which I thought indicated that the driver was going to turn right, when in actual fact he was touching his brake pedal and only one light was working.</P>
      <P>The only way out of that is to insist that indicator lights must be amber.  In view of the fact that these are now fairly simple, I see no difficulty in the provision of alternative lenses.  Even if the manufacturer might supply a lens which is red, I do not think any of us in the trade here would find undue difficulty in providing an amber lens instead.  I would ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to make a regulation to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter of traffic lights, I would suggest to the Minister that he consider also regulations providing that, as well as rere traffic indicators, there should be indicators on each side of a vehicle.  The problem, particularly in cities where there are large numbers of cyclists, is this.  There is great danger when a cyclist wishing to turn has passed the rere of a car and has no indication whatever <Col N="583" /> whether the vehicle is going to turn to the left or the right.  Very frequently near accidents arise from the fact that the traffic indicators only show at the rere of a car.</P>
      <P>That did not occur with the old semaphore type of indicator because it was mid-way up on the car.  Indeed, many manufacturers have made provision for additional traffic lights.  The matter is so serious that the Minister, when he is considering these regulations, might think not only in terms of the danger of confusion arising from red and amber traffic lights but also from the fact that a light at the rere of a car, even where both traffic lights are showing, may, in the absence of an indicator towards the front of the car, still constitute a danger.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by one Deputy to the question of blinding headlights. In this connection may I submit a personal opinion and suggest that the Minister be very careful about the regulations he makes in regard to an area like the city of Dublin.  You may make a regulation making it imperative for a driver to switch off his headlights in a particular area and then discover that while in one street the driver could drive quite safely and at a safe speed, 100 yards down the street there is a different type of lighting where the driver would require either dimmed headlights or his headlights full on.</P>
      <P>This question of headlights affects not only the traffic; it affects the safety of the general public.  With all our experts and with all our types of lighting we still see many comments to-day that accidents have arisen because an area was not properly lit. With all the experts on road traffic safety and lighting, the situation still arises in which it would be very difficult in the city areas to draft regulations which would protect the public because a driver would have to use his own judgment from the point of view of the amount of lighting available for him to see where he is going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, I should like to say at the <Col N="584" /> outset that it is not necessary and that the section as it stands is satisfactory and will in fact cover all that has been mentioned in relation to the amendment and many of the other matters also mentioned.  Having said that, I should like to agree almost entirely with all that has been said even though some of it seems contradictory.  I agree with the Deputies who have given their opinions and expressed their own experiences.</P>
      <P>With regard to this matter of lights, the lack of uniformity of lights, and the lack of uniformity in traffic signals and signs, and the question of blinding traffic indicators and the idea of there being a doubt as to whether or not side-lights only should be used in a built-up area or whether dipped headlights or full-on headlamps must be used, I should like to say that the various councils and corporations can utilise, as I think they will, the recent grants, which have been announced from my Department, to help them pay for the cost of improving their public lighting.  They may make these improvements and get the cost of them from the Road Fund grants.  If they all set their minds in that direction and use that facility we could envisage the time when in our built-up areas we could safely say side-lights only need be used.</P>
      <P>Until such time as we have that uniformity of light in our built-up areas it would be the height of folly to make it obligatory on any motorist to use only his dipped headlamps or to use only his side-lamps.  The critic at the moment must be the driver who is in charge of the car and the obligation is on him, if the lighting is bad in one street and good in another, to decide whether or not he may safely use his dipped headlamps or whether he can safely see where he is going with his side-lights.  His opinion on that will not be challenged of course until such time as he has an accident when it will be said that he had not got sufficient lighting and that will be a matter for the courts to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, regulations stating categorically what lights may or may not be used on the front of a vehicle <Col N="585" /> in built-up areas wherein we have not got proper or full lighting, not to talk of uniform lighting, could not be made. Until that stage is reached, we cannot regulate or legislate for the type of headlights which will be required. However, I feel that in time the situation will develop wherein public lighting in built-up areas will have reached a standard of adequacy and uniformity where in the interests of all concerned it will be possible to say side-lamps will be sufficient and no danger or hazard will be created for the public in that decision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the colours of blinking trafficators and the tail-light arrangements on cars, these are matters that have been and are being considered in my Department.  The fullest possible use of all scientific knowledge available to my Department is and will be used in arriving at what we shall regard as the best possible solution to these problems, so far as they affect our traffic.  That I think is the best approach, that we shall try to utilise the information garnered by others and adapt it to our needs as befits our own type of traffic.  In so far as the problem of tourists is concerned that, as pointed out by Deputy Sheldon, is one where there is no great reason why they should not be asked to conform, for their own safety as well as ours, to our regulations just as we would conform to theirs if we went on the Continent.</P>

      <P>We shall have to consider this matter.  We shall not naturally impede the influx of motoring holiday-makers. On the other hand, the anxiety on our part to accommodate holidaymakers with their cars will have to be tempered with judgment and wisdom in so far as the safety of themselves and our own people is concerned.  The House may take it that we will be very careful to arrive at the best solution&mdash;if necessary, the best compromise solution&mdash;to meet the two points of view expressed here by Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy Sheldon.  We will try to find a solution which will successfully resolve the difficulty.  I am quite satisfied, and I hope the House is, that the amendment is not really necessary. There is power in the section already to do all the things enumerated in it.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong this but the Minister has made one comment which makes me feel nervous.  He referred to the funds now available to provide adequate street lighting.  I do not know whether it was a report of the Commissioner or merely a remark of the Commissioner with regard to vehicles using only side lights in a street such as O'Connell Street, but it is quite true that, on a dark wet night, a large powerful black car purring along O'Connell Street, almost noiselessly and with only two little dots of side lights, constitutes a far greater menace to other road users than a fire engine would.  The driver may see perfectly but an innocent person crossing the street may not see this large black object.  From the driver's point of view the street is illuminated but the car is not illuminated from the point of view of other road users.  A few years back, as far as I remember, the Commissioner did comment on this and suggested that a different type of light is needed for driving in streets which are well lit: one needs something which is as large as a headlight but which has the <Col N="587" /> candlepower of a sidelight to make a large dark moving object visible to other road users.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), paragraph (d), to add to the end of the paragraph &ldquo;and the conditions subject to which unroadworthy vehicles may be sold.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to provide that no unsafe car will be sold except where the purchaser wants the car to get spare parts.  In such a case we suggest a regulation could be made allowing for a sale where it is clearly understood that it is a condition of the sale that the car will not be used by the purchaser, certainly not until such time as it is made roadworthy. The vast majority of car buyers rely on the good faith of the vendor, particularly where the vendor is a garage owner.  Frequently it is made a condition of the sale of second-hand cars that there is no warranty whatsoever regarding roadworthiness or otherwise.  That is not good enough. To allow any person to buy a car which is to the knowledge of the vendor an unsafe car is to permit a public danger.  A car may have faulty brakes, brakes which may fail within a short distance of the car leaving the garage.  It may have faulty steering not apparent to the inexpert purchaser. It may have a faulty axle.  It may <Col N="588" /> have several other faults all of which may constitute a serious danger to the driver, the passengers and innocent third parties on the road.</P>
    <P>A car may also be unroadworthy in that it may break down.  We have to face the simple necessity of using all our available road space to the best advantage.  We can no longer afford unroadworthy cars breaking down on the highway.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment which will give him power to make regulations imposing certain conditions governing the sale of cars and requiring the vendor to sell only cars which are roadworthy.  If a car should subsequently prove unroadworthy&mdash;in the case of a secondhand car, within three months; in the case of a new car, within a longer period&mdash;for a reason which must have been within the knowledge of the vendor, then the blame should lie fairly and squarely on the vendor.</P>
    <P>What this amendment seeks to achieve is not covered by the Bill as it stands.  The Minister has not taken the necessary powers to impose conditions governing the sale of cars.  It is because there is need to prevent people selling unroadworthy vehicles that this amendment has been tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 40 is more or less on the same lines as Deputy Ryan's amendment.  We are however more specific in our amendment. This amendment follows a recommendation made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Minister for Local Government.  A number of road traffic regulations were submitted to him last year.  A similar provision appears in Section 68 of the British Road Traffic Act of 1959.  Under subsection (4) of Section 11 of this Bill, the Minister can make regulations prescribing different kinds of roadworthiness. As Deputy Ryan has said he has not, however, taken any power to control the sale of vehicles.  The purchaser of an unroadworthy secondhand car or of a defective new car might find himself, through no fault of his own, liable to prosecution.  I feel that the purchaser should be safeguarded.  In doing so, however, a crux may arise.  What will <Col N="589" /> happen when the thing is in reverse, when you are trading in your old car? Usually because it is not roadworthy you decide to trade in.  Will the same law apply?  We have deliberately extended our amendment to cover such a case.  We made the specific part of the amendment state that it does not apply in a trade in case.  I think the amendment speaks for itself.  I think it is an extension of the thought behind Deputy Ryan's amendment.  I feel that the implementation of our amendment&mdash; amendment No. 40&mdash;when it comes up for discussion, will meet in full what Deputy Ryan is now advocating, if the Minister sees fit to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised here is rather more involved than Deputy Ryan may possibly appreciate.  I am speaking possibly with a certain self-interest in the matter but I shall try to keep my remarks as objective as possible.  When a motor trader trades in a used vehicle, he always has two courses open to him.  He may either strip it down, check it over completely, recondition it, re-examine it and sell it or he may simply resell it as it stands.</P>
      <P>I do not think any reputable motor trader would ever sell a vehicle which he knew to be unsafe but it is very difficult to draw the line between what is a reasonable inspection of the vehicle and what is unreasonable. Take the steering, for instance.  One can take a car out on the road and it appears to have sound steering.  One can never know whether one of the steering pins is badly warped or about to break unless the whole steering is stripped down.  You have the trackrod, the whole steering and brakes, not to mention the steering column and the attachment of the steering wheel to the column.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel it is a very heavy responsibility to place on a motor trader to ask him to guarantee a used car unless he has actually taken it to pieces and reassembled it.  The cost of stripping down a car completely, checking and reassembling it is enormous and it would almost certainly make the car completely unsaleable. There is a tremendous amount in what Deputy Ryan said but I want to warn <Col N="590" /> the Minister that any such suggestion as Deputy Ryan has put forward is one which would need very careful consideration indeed.  Unless the Minister is going to make general rules affecting the roadworthiness of all motor vehicles, it is scarcely fair that a person should be allowed to drive an old car without any restriction at all and only get into some sort of trouble if he attempted to sell it to anyone else.  Such a car is as dangerous in the hands of the original owner as it would be in the hands of a purchaser.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into this matter carefully bearing in mind that, if a car is going to carry any guarantee whatever, it will have to be substantially increased in price by reason of the fact that it will have to be very largely stripped.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that the steering and brakes in particular are the points which require attenion but you will get some of the older cars where the brakes are controlled by wire cables. It is almost impossible to say when one of those brake cables may break. I am sorry for the pun.  It may have a defect which is not immediately obvious.  Even with hydraulic brakes, there may be some flaw in the metal of the pipes, between the pedal and the brakes themselves, which is about to give.  Nothing but an X-ray examination of the complete hydraulic system would show that up.</P>
    <P>It would be very hard to blame a trader who accepted a car in good faith, who had tested the car and had found it behaving in a roadworthy manner if he were to be held liable for accidents when brakes suddenly fail through some cause which it was difficult, if not impossible, for him to have foreseen.  I should like to give this caution to persuade the Minister that it is not quite as easy possibly as Deputy Ryan said.  At the same time, motor traders would be only too glad of protection from themselves.  We are sometimes asked to dispose of cars which we are very doubtful about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Booth put his finger on the matter when he said that the car in question <Col N="591" /> is as dangerous in the hands of the original owner as it would be in the hands of the purchaser.  It gets back to the question of the roadworthiness of the car.  There is, perhaps, one qualification to that if we want to be very precise.  It is that many cars will be sold or changed.  A new car will be bought in its place by people when they feel that their old car is getting to the limit of its roadworthiness.  I do not think that affects the argument very much.</P>
      <P>What we are up against is the practical ascertaining of the roadworthiness of any vehicle.  I take it that the general policy would be&mdash;I can see no other way of dealing with this problem &mdash;to have certain general standards that can be checked by proper authority. Certain general standards of roadworthiness will be laid down.  You can go a certain length in regulation but after that it will depend on the tester within the terms of the regulations. The testing will be done under some officially sanctioned arrangement. That being so, a vehicle can only be accepted or rejected on what can be found in a new test.  The testers are not going to strip down the car to the detail Deputy Booth spoke about.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that if it is going to be a question of test it is immaterial in whose hands the car is. It would be better to approach this from the point of view that the liability is on the person who has the car and who is driving the car to see it is roadworthy.  Roadworthiness does not mean that it is absolutely roadworthy. That we cannot ascertain and that we cannot prove even for the purposes of a court of law.  Roadworthiness in this context will mean roadworthiness in the sense that it will conform to certain tests that are officially sanctioned and carried out by certain authorised persons.  That can be done whether it is in the hands of a purchaser or in the hands of the original vendor.  With regard to latent defects, I do not see why the purchaser should have any less obligation in regard to the testing of his car than the vendor had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem from the public <Col N="592" /> point of view.  The private aspect governing the <i>bona fides</i> of the sale is a different matter altogether. If the vehicle is capable of being tested.  I do not think it matters in whose hands it is.  Deputy Booth mentioned the latent effect&mdash;a fault in the hydraulic braking system, for instance.  That can happen to a new car and has happened in new cars.  It can happen in an old car or in the best maintained second-hand car.  On the other hand, the hydraulic system may be the last thing to go wrong in an old crock.</P>
    <P>An examination will not reveal a certain type of flaw.  The question arises: if a failure occurs, is that, in law, going to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of non-compliance with the regulation? I think the situation would be that if that vehicle were in an accident and even if it were proved that the brakes failed, the question would arise as to whether or not the vehicle had complied with such tests as were available. The decision on the liability or otherwise of the owner or driver would be determined by that and not by the fact that the hydraulic system or other mechanical compliance had gone.  It is premature for us to go into the testing system the Minister may think adequate.</P>
    <P>I understand that in other countries which have highly concentrated populations and fast roads, there is a testing system in force.  Remember, however, that when you put such a system into force, it will be sufficient to prove the evidence of the test, and if you have such a system of testing, you are back to the point that the onus is on the person who has the car at the moment.  The situation would resemble the conditions of sale in the purchase of property.  It would be sufficient for the vendor to produce evidence of the last sale.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if there is no specific test laid down, I do not think there can be any practical testing of road worthiness at all.  So from whatever point of view you apply this.  I think there is a misconception in the minds of Deputies and that they are <Col N="593" /> not grasping the point about the question of onus on the vendor.  The real solution will be found by coming back to such provisions as there will be for testing&mdash;the question of road worthiness which will be accepted in a court of law as determining the culpability of the owner or driver.  That is the line of approach to this problem in providing for the curtailment of the transfer of vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment is concerned with whether it is possible to protect people who buy second-hand, or even third-hand cars. Reference is made in the amendment to the fact that in Section 11, subsection (4), it is an offence for a person to use in a public place a vehicle which does not comply with the regulation under the section.  What the Labour Party have in mind is that unfortunately all those who engage in selling cars, particularly used cars, are not included under the section.  It has not been unknown for people who trade in used cars to think only in terms of the possible profit obtainable on the sale of used cars and sometimes on cars which should not be on the road at all.</P>
      <P>It has not been unknown that cars which have been involved in crashes have been done up and sold without letting the purchaser know anything at all about the crash in which the car had been involved.  Deputy Booth will agree immediately that when a car has been in a crash, apart from the obvious damage that may occur to steering and brakes, very frequently the chassis may be affected, thus making the car dangerous to drive in any circumstances. This situation does not arise in the case of a person purchasing a car from the manufacturers or from reputable garages. That of course would involve new cars and even in new cars it has been known that brakes may fail or the steering may fail within as short a period as six months after the purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case, however, it can be normally accepted that the car has had reasonable care in construction and assembly.  Deputy Booth mentioned the fact that the braking system can fail in new cars.  In the case of a second-hand <Col N="594" /> car, the brakes could seem to work normally.  The linings could be tightened up and the car could give satisfactory service for a month or so and then the braking system could fail without warning to the driver.  Faults could also exist in the steering system of a second-hand car which, though well known to the salesman, would not become evident to the driver until it was too late.  Certain faults in the steering of a car might not become evident without the car being taken apart.</P>
    <P>What the Labour Party are endeavouring to do here is to get the Minister to afford protection, so far as is reasonably possible, to purchasers of that type of car against persons prepared to exploit them without any regard to the danger involved, not only to the person behind the wheel but to the public at large.  I would ask the Minister to examine the matter very carefully because here we have no system for checking the road worthiness of cars. Possibly sometime in the near future it will be considered desirable to have such a checking system.  In the meantime, we believe it is highly important to protect people against buying cars which are dangerous, not only to themselves but to other users of our roads as well.  In no other field of purchase does the necessity for protection arise to such an extent.  Purchasers of other consumer goods, while they might harm themselves, while they might suffer losses because of the unwitting purchase of an almost valueless article, would not be endangering the lives of others as would the purchasers of defective cars.  We would ask the Minister to examine the matter again to see whether it would be possible to deal with that type of situation under the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are quite similar to Section 68 of the British Road Traffic Act, 1960, and the proposal was considered fairly thoroughly when the Bill was being drafted.  It was decided, not that the intentions expressed by the movers of the amendment here tonight would not be good in themselves, but that the actual effect of the amendment, as is <Col N="595" /> proved by what has taken place in Britain since the passage of their Act last year, would be that very little purpose would be served and that the laudable end sought by the movers of the amendment would not be achieved.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that people are &ldquo;done&rdquo; up to their eyes in the second-hand car business.  People are also &ldquo;done&rdquo; in several other ways.  If people wish to trade with those whom they do not know in a business which is suspect, if it is outside the normal, recognised channels, they are taking a calculated risk and, if they suffer, a great deal of the blame must rest on themselves.  People cannot be protected against everything.  We should like to afford the protection that it is suggested the amendment would afford but unfortunately the let-out that is necessary in a matter of this kind and, indeed, which is set out in subsection (4) (b) of the amendment, knocks the bottom out of the protection that the preceding subsections of the amendment would hope to confer on the general public.  Protection is given in the earlier parts of the amendment but subsection (4) (b) nullifies the benefits so conferred.  It is because of this and in view of the fact that, in Britain, where a similar provision was embodied in the British Road Traffic Act, 1960, the experience has been, admittedly in a short time, that the escape clause negatives the intent of Section 68 of the Act, that I believe subsection (4) (b) of the amendment would also largely negative the good that the preceding subsections would confer.</P>
      <P>There is another point to which we seem not to have very clear regard in this discussion.  It is that under Sections 18, 19 and 20 of the Bill, vehicle tests will be introduced which will go a long way to meet the difficulties as outlined by the various speakers in support of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be possible that as and when these vehicle testing facilities are in operation, there could be a very useful additional service&mdash;I mean a voluntary testing system.  I envisage a sale of a car second-hand, third-hand, tenth-hand&mdash;it does not really matter <Col N="596" />&mdash;and the deal could be conditional on its being voluntarily tested and passing the particular road vehicle test or, alternatively, that the vehicle would be brought up to such condition by the vendor that it would pass the test.  That type of utilisation of the testing facilities envisaged in Sections 18, 19 and 20 would be very useful.  It may not entirely meet the views of the movers of the amendment but the amendment weakens itself by virtue of subsection (4) (b) to such a degree that it is scarcely of any value.</P>
    <P>I will give further very definite consideration to the intentions behind the amendment but I have pointed out what we have discovered in earlier investigations in this direction.  I should like the end that is sought in this amendment to be attained, but, candidly, I do not think it is as easy as has been suggested.  If we cannot find a way to reach the end sought in the amendment, the ultimate would be, I think, that we would consider the question of voluntary testing when our vehicle testing facilities are in operation and they could be availed of and certainly would be an insurance to a prospective purchaser against buying an unroadworthy vehicle which could be not only a danger to himself but also a danger to the public.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy Ryan's amendment is concerned, I should have said before I went on to deal with the other amendment that we have just been talking about that it seems to me that amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Ryan is outside the scope of the section because subsection (1) of the section refers and relates to the use of vehicles whereas amendment No. 14 refers and relates to the selling or sale of vehicles or their condition in the course of sale.  I feel that that puts it outside the scope of the section.  The object of the amendment would indeed be served if the intentions of amendment No. 40 were to be given effect to.  I should have said that before I went on to talk about amendment No. 40.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>If we can do something on the lines of amendment No. 40, I certainly am not averse from doing so but I doubt if we can.  In fact, from our previous <Col N="597" /> consideration of this matter and of the similar type of proposal in the British Traffic Act, 1960, I doubt if we can find an effective method on the lines of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may refer to amendment No. 40, the objection which the Minister has raised is one which I share myself, that it gives an escape clause.  If only from the point of view of our export trade we should ensure that no second-hand cars are sold in this country which will be a menace to road users in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to pass a test there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be argued they would have to pass a test in Britain but they may be exported to countries other than Britain.  Some of these tests, whether they be voluntary or compulsory, add to the necessity for prohibiting the sale of unroadworthy cars.  As I said at the outset the majority of purchasers buy a vehicle upon the representations of the person selling it, be that person the previous owner or a garage man.  I am not aware of the statistics but I imagine most cars are bought through motor dealers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary person is not an expert in the mechanism of a car and he depends upon the good faith of the dealer.  From my own professional experience I know there are many cases where an innocent person is assured that the car is roadworthy, and then this person, in many cases buying under a hire purchase contract, signs the contract in which is written in small print a very emphatic statement that no warranty whatever is given in regard to the roadworthiness of the car and that the purchaser admits as much.  That puts the purchaser outside the possibility of taking any immediate action against the person who in the ordinary course of trade represents the car as being safe and roadworthy.  I am glad the Minister has said he is prepared to take a second look at the intention of the <Col N="598" /> two amendments because it is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth in a very reasonable commentary upon the discussion did say, however, that the second owner of the car was not in any more dangerous position than the first.  I would disagree with him there.  The first owner very often becomes aware of the deficiency in the braking or steering system or in some other part of the car and instead of bearing the cost of putting the thing right he decides to trade it in with perhaps only temporary repairs effected.  The innocent purchaser not being aware of this deficiency is in a much more dangerous position because the purchaser is likely to drive the car at a speed or in a manner which the equipment of the car is not capable of controlling in an emergency.</P>
    <P>That is all the Fine Gael Party and, I believe, the Labour Party had in mind when they put down their amendments, that some steps should be taken to protect the public.  I disagree with the Minister when he says it is the price of any person&mdash;perhaps I am paraphrasing what he said but in effect he did say&mdash;who buys from somebody other than a reputable dealer and that he is in no different position from that of anyone buying any other article. He is in a different position in that with a motor car he is likely to cause grave harm or perhaps death not only to himself but to other innocent people. If a person buys a dud suite of furniture the worst that can happen is that it will crumble.  It is unlikely to do any serious injury to persons or property but when you buy a motor car you buy a lethal weapon which may cause serious injury or death to other people.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while from a draftsman's point of view it may be argued that my amendment is not relevant under Section 11, I must submit it is entirely relevant because the purpose of it is to give power to the Minister to prevent unroadworthy vehicles being used on the roads.  We believe that prevention is better than cure and that it is better to prevent unroadworthy vehicles going on to the roads in the first place. <Col N="599" /> I am against regulations but since the House has already decided to confer regulation-making power on the Minister I would like to see him take power for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has given the assurance that not only has Section 68 of the British Road Traffic Act been considered with a view to applying it here but that further consideration will be given to it with a view to improving it.  We are seeking to prevent people being made answerable for an offence of which they are not really guilty.  I cannot understand Deputy de Valera's view that responsibility should not be placed on the vendor to see that a vehicle he sells stands up to certain severe tests. Surely that is an everyday occurrence. If a person sells an oil stove that does not come within the regulations he is subject to prosecution.  No one should be entitled to sell an article, particularly an article that can be dangerous to the general public, without complying with certain prescribed conditions.  We are suggesting that the vendor of a motor vehicle should be responsible for seeing that it complies with whatever regulations the Minister makes in regard to roadworthiness.</P>
      <P>It is very reasonable to suggest that garage proprietors and garage men who have both the knowledge and the method of testing cars should see that a vehicle which they have received and are going to resell, comes within the Minister's prescribed regulations.  That is an everyday business with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an ordinary owner sells a car to a person without going to a vendor, it should be compulsory on him to send his car to a garage in order to get a certificate of road worthiness under the regulation prescribed by the Minister before effecting a sale.  As the person who is going to make the money on the deal, it is only right that he should have the responsibility of seeing that the car he sells is not dangerous to the public or to the person to whom he sells it.  If he knows that it is dangerous and if he deliberately sells the vehicle he deserves to be punished and punished severely.  I am quite <Col N="600" /> happy that our amendment comes for disposal in the order of business.  I am also happy about the Minister's assurance. I believe he sees the point and that he is as anxious as we are to implement the proposal if possible.  On his assurance I would be prepared to withdraw it on behalf of my Party.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), paragraph (e), to add to the end of the paragraph &ldquo;including the signals (mechanical or by hand) to be given by the drivers of a combination of vehicles, and large motor lorries and other such heavy vehicles.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment which stands in the name of Deputy O'Higgins is to allow the Minister to make regulations compelling the drivers of a combination of vehicles to give suitable signals, either mechanical or by hand, which can be seen by persons coming from behind. This amendment was put down having in mind the fact that there is an increasing number of large vehicles used on the roadway and an increasing number of vehicles with trailers on the roadway.  It has been the experience of many motorists that they have to remain behind such slow-moving vehicles for long stretches of roadway in some cases because the driver is unaware of their presence behind him or is indifferent as to whether or not they are behind him and in other cases because the width of the vehicle is such that the driver is unable to give a signal which can easily be seen from the rere of the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, the length of these vehicles is such that it takes a not inconsiderable time to overtake them. The driver in the cabin of such vehicles frequently has a very good view of the road ahead, a view which is not available to the person coming behind, (1) because of the large obstruction of the large lorry or the combination of vehicles in front, and (2) because the driver of the large <Col N="601" /> vehicle is high up in his cabin, in many cases, and can see well ahead, sometimes over ditches over which the driver of a private car cannot see.</P>
    <P>I understand the proposer of this amendment had in mind that in such cases where trailers were attached to the vehicles, they would carry an electric sign, a green arrow or something of that nature, to indicate that it was safe to overtake.  That indication could be seen by the people behind such vehicles.  If such a scheme were operated and required by law, there would not be the considerable amount of frustration which leads to dangerous driving at the moment, when there is a long string of private cars behind a heavy vehicle and, in desperation, some person decides to take a chance and overtakes at the worst possible time.</P>
    <P>It was felt that the working of paragraph (e), subsection (2) of Section 11 is not wide enough to allow the Minister to make such regulations and it was, therefore, felt necessary that the paragraph should be extended in order to provide regulations to require signals, either mechanical or by hand, to be given by the drivers of a combination of vehicles, large motor lorries and other such heavy vehicles.  If the Minister is satisfied that the section as it stands would permit him to require these signals to be put on trailers, as well as the vehicles, then I think the proposer of the amendment would be content.  He feels the matter is so serious in view of the increasing number of trailers being used on heavy vehicles that it should be seriously considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the fixing of any lights or fixtures on vehicles arises, there is no question whatsoever that we have sufficient power as matters now stand, but in so far as the giving of signals is concerned, whether mechanical or manual, the position is that that aspect of the matter would be dealt with by the Garda Commissioner under Section 88 rather than by way of ministerial regulation under Section 11.  I do not doubt that there may be some overlap between Section 11 and Section 88, but, on the other <Col N="602" /> hand, if we were to fine down the overlap until it was invisible, the position might arise in which we might actually create a gap between the two, which would not be in the best interests of the general road user.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the House, I may say that regulations under Section 11 will specify how the vehicle is to be built and equipped, how the vehicle and its equipment will be maintained, in certain respects how the vehicle will be used, in certain respects, also, how the equipment will be used, how the driver and passengers are to be equipped and so on.  Under Section 88, the bye-laws deal with the control and management of the vehicle, how it is to be driven, what signals are to be given, etc.  Summarised briefly, Section 11 will deal with static control and Section 88 with dynamic control.  What the amendment envisages will be covered by Garda bye-laws under Section 88 rather than by regulation by the Minister under Section 11.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to open a discussion on Section 88 at this stage, but I do not think that covers the point the proposer of the amendment had in mind.  Section 88 allows the Commissioner to require a driver to indicate his intention, but what the proposer of the amendment had in mind was that the driver of the trailer or the large vehicle would give a sign indicating to following traffic that it was safe to overtake. I appreciate that an amendment of Section 88 could cover that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the difficulties envisaged by the Deputy in regard to these very large vehicles, and especially those with trailers, regulations compelling the drivers of such vehicles to have a green arrow or some indication that the road ahead is clear would be very dangerous in the case of an electrical fault.  We discussed earlier what could happen if one tail light went out and it does not take very much imagination to realise what would happen if this green light went on accidentally at the wrong time. An electrical fault could easily develop between the vehicle and the trailer.</P>
      <P>Is there not at the moment considerable doubt as to the wisdom of admitting signals indicating that you may pass because of the impossibility of pinning responsibility for anything that happens on the person giving the signal? In the case of electrical apparatus, it might be even more dangerous. There would also be great difficulty in the framing of the regulation.  Like all regulations dealing with what signal shall be, may be and may not be given, it really depends on having someone there to see that they are given at the appropriate time.  That is really where we fall down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a second difficulty which arises from that suggestion.  If a green arrow is attached to the rere of a lorry or trailer, it might indicate to a number of cars behind that the driver of the lorry considered that the road was clear, but there is the difficulty mentioned by Deputy Sheldon.  Suppose you are driving along the road and are overtaking a car or a lorry and trailer and you get some form of signal to go ahead.  You go ahead on the basis of that signal, whether it is a sign from the driver's hand or a signal by way of a light.  If you are involved in an accident and subsequently a legal action is taken, I doubt if you will get much support on the basis that someone else said you could pass.  The responsibility is yours as a reasonably <Col N="604" /> safe driver.  There is the possibility of a mechanical failure and there is the possibility of the green arrow on the back of the large lorry and trailer indicating, not to just one car but to a number of cars in convoy, that the road is apparently safe.  There is another aspect of this matter which does not arise at the moment so I shall not raise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16 on behalf of Deputy O'Donnell:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), paragraph (f), to add to the end of the paragraph &ldquo;including the use of protective helmets of approved standard to be worn by the driver and passengers on motor-cycles.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory. It is to direct attention to the necessity, in the interests of motor cyclists themselves, of wearing protective helmets of approved standard.  These should be worn by all motor cyclists and their passengers.  The section provides that the Minister can make regulations regarding the equipment of such drivers and passengers but we feel it is necessary to emphasise in statutory form the application of these regulations to motor cyclists and their passengers to ensure that they will wear protective headgear.  It is necessary to protect the lives of motor cyclists themselves and their passengers. They are not in any greater position to cause harm to other people by not wearing the headgear but there is an urgent necessity that they should wear it for the protection of themselves and their passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems which arises in relation to crash helmets, as I believe they are properly called, is that the standard has not yet been fixed in this country and there is great likelihood of serious injury being caused through <Col N="605" /> the sale of such helmets which are not safe and of an approved standard. I have no doubt that the Minister has looked into the matter carefully and one of the things which would certainly cause us to hasten the passage of the Bill is that higher standards for these helmets should be made as quickly as possible.  I hope the Minister will make the necessary regulations as soon as possible for the sake of motor cyclists and their passengers.</P>
    <P>There are other dangers in relation to mechanically propelled vehicles and in relation to pedal cycles and tricycles.  I know it is thought to be unwise for politicians to impose regulations in such matters because it may cause loss of votes but I think this is a matter of life and death. Many lives of motor cyclists and their passengers would have been saved if they had been wearing crash helmets of a reliable standard.  I believe that this is a matter which is worthy of most serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the amendment but I take it that a consequential amendment to define motor cycles would also be necessary. There is no definition in the Bill, which deals simply with mechanically propelled vehicles.  Motor scooters are equally as dangerous as motor cycles so that if the Minister is accepting the amendment, all he can do is to accept the spirit of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit of the amendment but I do not have to accept the amendment itself in order to attain the end desired by it.  Under paragraph (f), subsection (2) of Section 11 and paragraph (d) of the same subsection there is, without any question whatever, ample power and scope whereby regulations as to protective equipment can be made.  This question of crash helmets is one that has been considered by my Department and in respect of which I feel that ultimately we will come to adopt the point of view of the amendment and even go so far as to deal with the matter of body belts.  By and large there is no doubt in my mind that we <Col N="606" /> have the means in those paragraphs of subsection (2) of Section 11 to do all and any of the things sought by those who have spoken.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister put down the amendment but I think Deputy Sheldon is right in what he says.  Here in this city we have become so pestered by commercial individuals that they have become daymares as well as nightmares.  We have mechanically propelled vehicles moving through the city with loudspeakers on, under and attached to them.  I think the Minister ought to go further and bear in mind what Deputy Sheldon has said and add some further words to this section such as <Col N="607" />&ldquo;attached to or in any way connected with&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to criticise any judicial decision in any great detail but the Minister is not unaware of a decision in one of our courts not long ago where a prosecution was taken against the proprietor of a vehicle which had a loudspeaker attached to it.  The prosecution was taken under the Dublin Police Act which deals with the making of noise and the defence was put up and accepted in that case that it was not the making of the noise but the amplification of the noise. That defence was accepted and as a result the Garda and the corporation gave up any effort to control broadcasting from moving vehicles.  It is bad enough when they are moving but within the last two weeks I was appalled to discover in O'Connell Street at half past seven a parked van with loudspeaker equipment attached. Nobody was in the van but a record was playing <i>ad infinitum</i> to the effect that if people went to Mr. X's shop, they could acquire a T.V. set at reasonable terms.  No doubt, the person in charge of the van was off enjoying himself or about his lawful occupation for some hours because at 10.30 p.m. the same wretched record was still playing from the same vehicle in the same street.  We do not mind the use of loudspeakers for some unusual entertainment or function.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Donnell, I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (2) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  prohibiting the driving of heavy vehicles or combinations of vehicles in close proximity to one another and fixing minimum distances to be observed in the driving of such vehicles.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a matter which I do not think is covered in the subheads already in Section 11 as matters in respect of which the Minister may make regulations. This amendment is to add a new sub-paragraph to subsection (2) prohibiting the driving of heavy vehicles or combinations of vehicles in close proximity to one another and fixing the maximum distances to be observed by such vehicles.  Every Deputy will be conscious of the nuisance and the danger caused by large vehicles driving pretty well in convoy, each one very close to the next.  On a country road, these vehicles are in all probability driving at a fair speed but not at a speed considered reasonable for the driver of a modern private car.  They are probably travelling at between 35 and 40 m.p.h.  There may be two, three or four of them in convoy.  It is a hazard to endeavour to pass that long line of vehicles if they are travelling too close together.  The driver must pass all or none.</P>
      <P>We suggest the Minister should have power to make regulations fixing the distances these vehicles must keep from one another, if they are driving in convoy.  I do not believe that point is covered by the various sub-paragraphs of subsection (2) of Section 11. If I am right in that, I urge that the Minister should take power to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger to which Deputy M.J. O'Higgins refers is just <Col N="610" /> as great, very often, with private cars. You very often find, on main roads, a number of cars which, though not, technically speaking, travelling in convoy, are very close together and maintain their position so that a driver from the rere cannot overtake one without overtaking all.  If the Minister accepts this in principle or entirely, I hope the regulations will apply with equal force to private cars.  The danger of the heavy vehicle is greater but this nuisance, which can also be a danger, is very much experienced with private cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming an increasing practice on the roads to find large articulated trucks and large vehicles with trailers travelling in convoy so that, to pass them out, you must travel quite a considerable distance. By and large, drivers of these heavy trucks are very courteous and normally are prepared to give way to traffic from behind.  In many cases, however, the construction of the trucks makes it almost impossible for the drivers to have a clear view of what is occurring on the road.</P>
      <P>Motorists wishing to overtake often find an appreciable time elapses from the time they pull out until they can pass the heavy vehicle.  When that situation is worsened, because that heavy vehicle is travelling close to another in front, the danger becomes immediately apparent.  There is a serious necessity for some regulation providing for a minimum distance between cars as they travel.  I agree with Deputy Booth that the same situation obtains in regard to private cars, particularly on roads with heavy traffic.  Drivers are sometimes concerned only with keeping as close as possible to the car in front.  Sometimes it is impossible to overtake them; and if there is a car coming in the opposite direction, there is a danger of a very serious accident.  Regulations to deal with this situation are most desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see a solution of this problem, but we must consider the causes of it.  We may have a queue of private cars or lorries.  Take the private cars first.  They could be in <Col N="611" /> a funeral cortège.  Such a cortège cannot be overtaken if the road on which it is travelling has bends, because it would be dangerous for an overtaking driver to pass.  In such cases, it is obvious that road conditions do not permit of passing out.  You also have long lines of cars on a fine sunny afternoon near the popular seaside resorts, particularly in the north and south county Dublin.  At times the cars may stretch for one and a half miles.  There may be a driver who, because of time commitments, feels it almost essential to pass out.  There seems to be no remedy for his problem on a road on which there are bends.  Again, road conditions do not permit of passing out.</P>
      <P>You also have the situation in which a driver, through selfishness holds the road and travels at a speed much less than that of those following him.  It might be possible in that case for some kind of signal to be given to the slower moving car in front to compel him at certain places on the road to give way to overtaking traffic.  There might be a &ldquo;bay&rdquo; or &ldquo;inlet&rdquo; on the road where a slow moving car would be obliged by law to pull in and allow overtaking traffic to pass, if he had been given a warning to do so.  Very often, the long line of cars is caused by one driver in front holding the road or travelling slowly in circumstances in which, by ordinary standards of courtesy, he would be expected to give way.  We can deal only with the problem by the provision of proper road accommodation or by some kind of warning which will compel the foremost motor vehicle to give way to following vehicles.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment and urge its acceptance on the Minister.  I would urge, as Deputy Booth and Deputy Larkin have, that the Minister make regulations in respect not only of heavy vehicles but in respect of all mechanically propelled vehicles.  Since the Minister intimates he has power to do all these things, I do not propose to say any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may make a digression, before he concludes the Committee <Col N="612" /> Stage, I think the Minister will appreciate the force of my argument about a committee to consider road problems.  He might save himself a lot of trouble on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been said. With regard to Deputy Rooney, I have the horrible suspicion that a great many Dublin motorists share his rather curious views about the rights of what you do on the road.  There already is power in law to correct what is amiss in regard to the fellow sitting in the middle of the road at a slow speed.  Anybody using the road is supposed to keep as far to the left as is convenient.  On one occasion, I had to draw the attention of the House to a police car breaking this law on the Stillorgan Road.  I assume the Minister has power in paragraph (c) to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I think it is useful that the question of convoys has been ventilated here in regard to cars and lorries.  It is worse in relation to lorries, but private cars are subject to the type of difficulty Deputy Rooney mentioned.  I do not see why there should not be regulations in force in relation to private cars as well as lorries that so many lengths of a vehicle or so many feet should be imposed, even in the case of a funeral cortège.  I would suggest that some indication should be given by the Minister that he is taking a sympathetic view of the representations made.</P>
      <P>This regulation is like the others: unless another Department provide the Minister with an effective arm on the road to see all these regulations are obeyed, I do not think they are worth the paper on which they are printed. Already it is true a motorist is not allowed to go down the middle of a road at 20 miles an hour, holding up the traffic behind him when he has plenty of room: but it is happening every day and there does not seem to be a police force suitably equipped to deal with it.  The same thing will apply to any other regulations made.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(i)  the lighting to be used on and in connection with parked vehicles during lighting-up hours.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is principally for the purpose of directing the Minister's attention to the necessity, first of all, of making and, secondly, enforcing regulations regarding the lighting of parked vehicles at night.  As I understand the position at the moment, it is necessary, if you park at night on a <Col N="614" /> public highway, to show a light.  I am not certain of that but I think it is required under existing regulations or bye-laws.  To what extent that is enforced is another matter and I think the Minister and the House generally will agree that some of the shocking road tragedies which have occurred in comparatively recent times might very well have been avoided if vehicles parked on the roadside had been lighted at night.  While drawing attention to this by way of amendment, I think the Minister has the necessary power under the provisions contained in the Bill, but it is necessary that Deputies should emphasise the importance which they attach to this matter as a road safety measure.</P>

It may not be strictly relevant on this amendment but there is another matter allied to it to which I think we might direct the Minister's attention at this stage.  That is the question of rere lights or reflectors on bicycles, either mechanically propelled or pedal cycles, both for the safety of the cyclist and for the protection of others. The Minister should ensure that they have either a proper reflector or an actual light at the rere.</P>

      <P>On the question of reflectors, some people feel that once they put on reflectors, their obligation is discharged, but very often these reflectors at the rere of a vehicle become completely covered with mud and are no use.  If the Minister is to make some regulation, as he probably will, it should refer not only to fitting but to maintenance. I support Deputy O'Higgins on this question of rere lights for pedal cyclists because on a left hand bend especially, it is almost impossible to see a cyclist, either on a dark road or a fairly well lighted road, if there is another car approaching with headlights on.  Apart from the danger to the cyclist himself, the motorist may be forced on finding a cyclist in his path at the last minute to take drastic avoiding action which may precipitate a much more serious accident.  I would strongly support the compulsory fitting of red lights to all cycles.</P>

In regard to the use of a vehicle contravening the regulation, the owner of the vehicle is liable also, unless he shows that the use of it was unauthorised by him.

      <P>I agree with the Minister that that is an improvement in one respect, but it is not altogether satisfactory.  Bad as the subsection was, at least people knew where they stood; they knew that the owner as well as the user would be liable in respect of every offence, whereas now the owner does not know in respect of what offences he will be liable because the offences have to be prescribed by ministerial regulation.  If the Minister accepts our amendment No. 22, that difficulty will be overcome.  If he adds to paragraph (b) of subsection (5) &ldquo;or that the breach of the regulation was committed without the knowledge or consent of the owner,&rdquo; the difficulty Deputy Corish mentions will be overcome.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of whether or not it is prescribed by regulation, where the owner of the vehicle does not know that a breach of a regulation has been committed, and certainly does not consent to it, it is going too far to suggest that the owner should be made equally liable with the person who commits the offence.  I feel I should press the Minister to accept this amendment.  Offhand, I cannot think of any reason for his refusing to accept it.  Possibly there are valid grounds for his doing so, but, at the moment, I honestly cannot think of even one.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have answered most of the objections and queries raised in respect of the regulations he contemplates.  I am not a legal man and I can interpret this amendment only as I read it.  I should like to read it for the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who contravenes subsection (4) of this section or a regulation under this section shall be guilty of an offence and, where the contravention is of the said subsection (4) and such person is not the owner of the vehicle, such owner shall <Col N="618" /> also, in such cases as may be prescribed, be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I would be prepared to accept that amendment or subsection (5) of Section 11, I should like to have a little more detail from the Minister in relation to the regulations he contemplates. I do not think any of us would expect him to give us the absolute details, but, until I see the regulations, I interpret the position as follows: if I lend my car as a member to my family or to a friend, I can be held guilty of any offence that may be committed by the driver of my car, according to subsection (2) here.  If the equipment is changed in any respect by the person to whom I lend the car, and I lend it in good faith, I can be held responsible for the breach of the regulations.  There is provision here also in subsection (2) for regulations to be made governing the use and misuse of vehicles and vehicle equipment.  Surely we will not reach the position in which we cannot lend our cars to other members of our family or to friends without getting some sort of warranty or security from the person to whom we lend the car as insurance against what he may do and which might constitute an offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations under subsection (2) with regard to the duties of drivers of vehicles and passengers therein.  The Minister will have to be more specific.  To be quite honest, I do not believe the Minister contemplates making regulations which will render me liable for an offence committed by another, but, in the absence of information from him as to the regulations he may make, I can only conclude that if a friend who borrows my car contravenes regulations made under subsection (2), I will be equally guilty. That would be grossly unfair and unless I have some assurances, or greater detail as to the type of regulation, I will not be prepared to vote for either the amendment or the section.</P>

      <P>The Bill originally did bear on the side to which Deputy Corish takes exception.  Since then, <Col N="619" /> it has been decided that it would be unfair to join the owner with the driver for any or all of the offences committed in the handling of that car. For that reason, this amendment was brought in, to limit the circumstances in which the owner of a car driven by another authorised person might get into difficulties with the law.  It is impossible to detail every case in which an offence prescribed will apply and in which the owner will be liable with the driver.  If the car is in a dangerously defective condition and a friend takes it from the owner's door and something happens at the end of the road, obviously the owner would be even more guilty than the friend to whom he lent the car in that case. On the other hand, supposing a friend drove down Kildare Street, pulled round the corner into Molesworth Street and parked the car without lights six feet from the kerb, the owner could not obviously be held liable for such an offence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned a rather neat point with regard to a friend getting a loan of the car and making some change in the car, a change which rendered it unroadworthy or defective in some degree.  The Deputy wants to know if the owner in that case would be held liable.  Frankly, I cannot envisage the owner being held liable in such a case, since the alteration would not have the authority of the owner behind it.</P>

      <P>Judging from the clamour here tonight, there must be a great many people buying pigs in pokes from all kinds of dealers.  That is not a practice we should follow, but I cannot at this stage detail the actual offences which will be prescribed and in which the owner will be equally guilty with the drivers.  I am giving what I regard as extreme examples of what may or may not come within these regulations.  Beyond that, I cannot clarify the matter to the satisfaction of those who have in mind pigs in pokes which they do not want to buy.  I can give only the general outlines; I cannot give the details.  The amendment covers the objections that were raised.  I think the House should find it quite satisfactory.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will estimate the number of Irish citizens who travelled abroad as tourists in each of the years 1950-1959; <Col N="486" /> if he will state the countries visited by these tourists, the numbers visiting each country, and the total sum of money spent abroad by tourists in each of these years; and if he will give the number of tourists visiting this country, the countries from which they came, and the amount of money spent in this country by them in each of these years.</P>

      <P>The available information relates to the total number of visits of Irish residents who travelled to places outside the State for tourist or business purposes, etc., and the total number of visits to Ireland of persons resident outside the State for tourist or business purposes, etc.</P>
      <P>Information relating to the number of Irish residents who visited each country is not available, but estimates are made of the numbers of visits each year to the Six Counties, to Britain and direct to other countries.  Some of those persons who travel to the Six Counties and Britain also visit other countries.</P>
      <P>In the case of visitors to Ireland figures are also available showing the numbers of visits of persons who travelled from or via the Six Counties, from or via Britain or direct from other countries.</P>
      <P>Comparable data are available only for the years 1952-1959 and these are shown in the following tables together with estimated total expenditures.  It has been estimated that the receipts from visitors to the State amounted to £28 million and £31 million in 1950 and 1951 respectively, while the estimated expenditures outside the State by Irish residents amounted to £7 million and £9 million respectively, in the same years.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the type requested are available only in respect of establishments covered by the annual Census of Industrial Production. The following statement sets out for the years 1950-1958 inclusive, the number of wage earners who were employed by these establishments and whose earnings in mid-October were less than £10 per week.  Corresponding particulars for salaried workers are available only for the years 1950-1952 inclusive.</P>
      <P>Because of a discontinuity in the records, following on the introduction in 1954 of a simplified form of return for the smaller establishments, it has been necessary to give two series of figures for wage earners.  The first covers the years 1950-1953 inclusive and the second covers the years 1953-1958 inclusive.  Particulars for 1959 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>NUMBERS of persons returned at the annual Census of Industrial Production as earning less than £10 per week in mid-October of each of the years 1950-1958.</P>
