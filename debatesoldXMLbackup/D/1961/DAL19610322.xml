    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when it is proposed to terminate the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice which was stated by him on 10th May, 1960, to be a temporary arrangement to facilitate Government business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to my reply to a similar question addressed to me in this House on the 31st May, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it be a fact that the Minister for Justice is either unable or unwilling to execute the functions of his Department, would not the proper course be for him to resign so that the cost of £5,000 a year of the dual appointments in the Department of Justice will not continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am now quite satisfied that there is in the Department of Justice a great deal of work which has been neglected over many years by reason of the inability of successive Ministers for Justice to overtake it and that the work of that Department will require the assistance of a Parliamentary Secretary for quite a long time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the main reason this appointment <Col N="1004" /> was first made and why it is not now being terminated is because the Parliamentary Secretary is the Taoiseach's son-in-law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparently not now the intention of the Taoiseach to terminate this appointment which, he said, was a temporary appointment, and the country will have to wait for a general election and a Fine Gael Taoiseach to have this post abolished.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a)  the national average retail prices of the food items included in the Consumer Price Index at mid-February, 1957, and mid-February, 1961, and the actual increase or decrease in each case, and (b) the percentage changes in the prices of all items entering into the Consumer Price Index between February, 1957, and February, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report, a statement showing (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food in mid-February, 1957, and mid-February, 1961, and the actual change in each case, and (b) the percentage change in prices of all items entering into the Consumer Price Index between the two periods.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive enquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices as given in (b), computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentages calculated from (a).</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only estimates which can be made relating to total emigration from County <Col N="1011" /> Kerry are those for intercensal periods. They take into account all movement into and out of the county, whether to or from other parts of Ireland, Britain or overseas.  For the intercensal period 1951/56 the net outward movement from County Kerry amounted to 8,681 persons (4,535 males and 4,146 females).</P>
      <P>The only information as regards designation available related to the total numbers of persons who emigrated by sea to all countries outside Europe and who gave County Kerry as their last address.  I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the number of such persons who emigrated by sea in each of the years 1950 and 1953 to 1959.  Similar data in respect of 1951 and 1952 are not available and particulars in respect of 1960 have not yet been compiled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that where an old age pensioner has savings in the Post Office Saving Bank the interest is 2½ per cent., but that under the regulations governing means for a non-contributory old age pension, a return of 5 per cent. is assumed for all capital after the first £25; and if as, this regulation is unfair to Post Office depositors who are applicants for an old age pension, he will alter the regulations applicable in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Social Welfare) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the rate of interest on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, and in the method of determining <Col N="1012" /> the yearly value of capital for non-contributory old age pension purposes. That method is laid down by law in Part I of Rule 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and it is not confined to Post Office Savings Bank deposits.  It provides that the first £25 of capital is to be excluded.   The next £375 is assessed at an annual value of 5 per cent. and any capital in excess of £400, at an annual value of 10 per cent.  This is in fact generous provision because the annuity value at age 70 is over 12 per cent. in the case of a male and nearly 11 per cent. in the case of a female.   To assess the annual value merely at the 2½ per cent. rate payable on Post Office deposits would be to recognise a pensioner's right to preserve his capital intact for the benefit of his heirs.   The maximum amount which can be held on deposit in the Post Office Savings Bank is £3,000 producing an income of £75 per annum.  If this were the claimant's only means and the method of assessment were altered on the lines suggested in the question an old age pension of 18/6d. a week would be payable.  This would be Wholly unreasonable in the view of the fact that such a person could purchase a life annuity of about £380 in the case of a man and about £320 in the case of a woman.  Even as the law stands, a person with no other means could have £737 10s. 0d. on deposit and still qualify for the maximum pension of 28/6d. or £1,260 and still qualify for the minimum pension of 13/6d.</P>
      <P>I cannot therefore agree that the method of assessment provided for in posess capital sums of money and who are seeking State pensions to which a means test applies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question I understand that Irish Military Service pensions received by persons resident in Britain are chargeable to British Income Tax. Similarly, British Military Service pensions received by persons resident in Ireland are chargeable to Irish Income Tax.  I do not regard this position as anomalous; and accordingly the answer to the second part of the question is in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will provide a special grant to relieve the serious flooding of a number of holdings of persons at Ballyealan, Blue Ball, Offlay, where the road has been flooded to a depth of four feet for the past three months with the result that there is no entry or exit to their holdings; and if he will make arrangements for the planning of a suitable scheme to give immediate relief from the appalling conditions of land owners and their families in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only proposal that can be traced for the area referred to is in a rural improvements scheme for the repair of a road in the townlands of Ballyealan, Mullaghcrohy and Lugamarla, leading off the Mountbolus-Black Lion county road by the farmhouses of a number of landholders and ending at Patrick Daly's house, Ballyealan.  An offer of a grant of £351, subject to a local contribution of £151, towards a total estimated expenditure of £502 was issued on 11th January, 1961, but has not, so far, been accepted.  The scheme provides <Col N="1016" /> for the raising of the road at a number of points where there are depressions liable to become waterlogged.  If the Deputy should have some other case in mind, further enquiries will be made on his furnishing details, including the names of the landholders served.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in view of the fact that the school children in the area are unable to attend school and that the local residents cannot go to either Church, Mass or meeting except by a right of way across a ploughed field kindly given by a generous neighbour, would the Parliamentary Secretary cause special inquiries to be made so that a grant might be given in this connection?</P>

      <P>This station, of the bunglow type, was erected in 1934 and provided married quarters for a Sergeant and a station unit with sleeping accommodation for four single Gardaí.  Due to the development of the area the married quarters were dispensed with in 1953 and the premises were adapted to provide additional office accommodation.</P>
      <P>The present strength of the Station is 30 members of whom 26 are living out. The remaining 4 members, who are unmarried are, accommodated in two bedrooms measuring, approximately, 150 and 140 square feet.  A bathroom and two toilets are provided.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Commissioner that no complaints have been received in regard to the inadequacy of the accommodation provided and that, ordinarily, no difficulty has been experienced by the station party in carrying out the duties of the station.  The bedrooms are not now used for official purposes but I have ascertained that in the past a bedroom was used on very rare occasions by a resident Garda for official purposes when the dayroom and interview room were fully occupied.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, when the lands were being allotted to the local tenants some time ago, drainage works were carried out but, for some reason or other, subsequently ceased?  The fact that they were not carried out has resulted in the deplorable state of affairs prevailing in the area at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the lands were allotted 23 years ago and that in 1954 special works, including the cleaning of a drain and the raising of a road, were carried out by the Land Commission for the purpose of relieving flooding.  These works were carried out on the specific undertaking of those concerned that they would maintain them if they were carried out.  No complaint has been received in my Department since 1954 until the Deputy's Question was tabled.  I would suggest to the Deputy that he <Col N="1044" /> might advise these people to live up to their undertaking and maintain the drains provided for them.</P>

      <P>Whilst the normal period of repayment in respect of advances made under the 1903 Act is approximately 69 years, the duration of repayments of any Land Purchase Annuity is subject to variation&mdash;depending on such factors as consolidation of holdings, addition of a Funding Annuity under the Land Act, 1933, or charging of an additional annuity in repayment of an improvement or reclamation advance.  Thus, the repayment period in any case depends on the particular circumstances of that holding and, even at this stage, may be subject to future variation.</P>

      <P>The recording meters in use in my Department are of the highest quality and standard of accuracy obtainable and are identical with those used in other telephone administrations.  There is, of course, a possibility of fault as there is in practically every similar type of electrical equipment.  During the three years 1958, 1959, 1960 refunds were made in a total of about 600 cases.  These included a great number of cases in which the refunds were made on the basis of giving the subscriber the benefit of the doubt.</P>
      <P>As over 100,000 accounts have to be issued and cleared every quarter office procedures have had to be designed to deal with queries as expeditiously as possible.  Accordingly, neostyled letters have been devised to inform subscribers of the result of enquiries which are liable to arise frequently.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, though far removed from the area to which Deputy O. J. Flanagan is referring, similar complaints have been received in connection with other telephone exchanges?  I am referring specifically to Sutton where one subscriber <Col N="1048" /> was able to assert that she had been charged in respect of 1,000 calls which she had not made.  Is the Minister further aware that a Catholic priest was all but called a liar by an official of his Department when he said he had been charged in respect of thousands of calls which he had not made and that he was threatened with disconnection, and that, because of the honoured post he held, he was not disconnected but within a month the Department sent an official humbly to him to ask him what amount he was prepared to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a small sum of money required under two subheads but the sum, of course, is relatively substantial under these two subheads.  The first is travelling expenses.  A number of items which were unexpected cropped up during the year.  In particular, I should mention sending officials across to deal with the G.A.T.T., which was not foreseen.  Secondly, my Department had also to send a delegate or two, I think, to the European Economic Co-Operation Plan, which was not expected at the beginning of the year.  These two, in particular, have added to the excess on the vote for travelling expenses which has caused the necessity for a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Incidental Expenses is an item which also was not foreseen and which I mentioned here on another occasion. In our attempt to get more officers of the type of administrative officers we adopted the new scheme of taking the four or five best men coming in as junior executive officers, giving them the option of going to the University and paying their fees during that time.  It is the fees arising out of this first year of the scheme that has caused the excess on the Incidental Expenses side.  The additional sum required is £1,680.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Bill is, as its title indicates, Supplementary to the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill and I propose, subject to the approval of the Ceann Comhairle, that both Bills be discussed together on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill is to give effect to the provisions of Article 34 of the Constitution by establishing a Court of Final Appeal and Courts of First Instance.  Five Courts are being established, namely, a Supreme Court, a High Court, a Court of Criminal Appeal, a Circuit Court and a District Court.  Provision is also made for the constitution of these Courts and for the manner in which the judges of these Courts are to be styled.  In general, no change is being made in the constitution <Col N="1058" /> of the various Courts with the exception of the District Court.  In that case the Bill provides for the creation of a new office of President of the District Court.  I shall have more to say later on regarding this new office when I am dealing with the Supplemental Provisions Bill, where the powers and functions of the President are set out.</P>
    <P>The Constitution, while specifying that a Supreme Court and a High Court must be established, left the Oireachtas free to determine the number and kind of other courts.  This is, therefore, an appropriate time to consider the suitability of these courts in present conditions and to ask, for example, whether we should continue to have courts on the lines of the Circuit Court and District Court or whether, say, one such court would suffice for our needs. I think most people will agree that the present system of having two inferior Courts of First Instance has worked well, on the whole, during the period of nearly forty years during which it has been in operation and, moreover, the two Courts enjoy the full confidence of the public.  The Government have come to the conclusion that nothing would be gained by making any such fundamental change in the structure of the existing courts and accordingly the Bill provides, as I have said, for establishing courts similar to those now functioning.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides that the existing courts will cease to exercise jurisdiction when the Act comes into operation and that when the judges and justices of these Courts have ceased to hold their present offices the courts will be disestablished.  Disestablishment of the existing courts is a necessary consequence of the establishment of the new Courts and of the provisions of Article 58 of the Constitution providing for the continuance of the existing Courts &ldquo;until otherwise determined by law&rdquo;.  Disestablishment involves the abolition of the offices of judges and justices and this is also provided for in Section 7. The position of existing judges and justices is not being prejudiced, however, because they, and only they, are being made eligible for appointment <Col N="1059" /> as the first judges and justices of the new Courts.  Any judge or justice who is so appointed or who retires before the Bills are brought into operation will retain his existing pension rights.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Supplemental Provisions Bill, which is a complicated measure of 56 sections and eight Schedules, I trust that the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated will be of assistance to Deputies, particularly when we come to examine the Bill on Committee Stage.  The object of the Bill is to regulate, pursuant to Article 36 of the Constitution, various matters affecting the new courts and the judges and justices thereof.  In general, this is being done by the application of the enactments governing the existing courts, with whatever modifications are necessary, but in some cases&mdash;notably in regard to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court &mdash;the existing enactments cannot be conveniently applied and new comprehensive provisions have had to be incorporated. The system of applying existing enactments, while convenient, has several obvious disadvantages, and I am hoping that when this legislation has been passed work will be resumed on a measure to consolidate all the various enactments relating to the courts.  It is contemplated that the consolidation measure will replace the Act which will result from this Bill, so that all the enactments dealing with the courts of justice (other than the fundamental provisions relating to their establishment and constitution) will be set out in one comprehensive statute.</P>
    <P>On this stage of the Bill I propose to confine myself to its more important provisions.  The first of these is provided for in Section 7 of the Bill and deals with the number of judges of the Supreme Court who should determine an appeal or other matter cognisable by that Court.  Under the provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court must consist of not less than five judges to decide on the incapacity of the President or on the constitutionality of a Bill referred to the court by the President.  In other cases, the statute law governing the existing Supreme Court <Col N="1060" /> permits a court of three, four or five judges, so that a court of three or four may even decide whether a provision in an Act of the Oireachtas is repugnant to the Constitution.  It will be generally agreed that it is undesirable that a court of final appeal should sit with less than five judges.  If it should sit with three judges, it is possible that the views of two judges&mdash;a minority of the full court of five&mdash;would decide the issue.  And if it should sit as a court of four, there is the risk of an even division of opinion.</P>
    <P>In such a case the decision of the court below prevails but the successful litigant does not get the costs of the appeal.  In the past there have been cases of courts of three and four deciding on constitutional issues and at least one case where a court of three adjourned to have the arguments considered by a court of five.  In this situation the Government considered it proper to propose an amendment to the law, in Section 7 of the Bill, which would prevent a matter being determined by a Supreme Court of four judges unless the parties agree. While it would be desirable to have all matters determined by a Supreme Court of five, there would be practical difficulties in giving effect to this and accordingly the section recognises that a court of three may sometimes be necessary.</P>
    <P>Next I should like to refer to the new office of President of the District Court provided for in the Establishment and Constitution Bill.  For some time past consideration has been given to the need for improving arrangements for the prompt and efficient discharge of the work of the district court and the Government have come to the conclusion, as a result of their examination of the question, that it would be desirable to have a judicial person who would co-ordinate generally the work of the district court and who would deal with complaints regarding unpunctuality in commencing courts or the cancellation of courts without sufficient reason or sufficient notice.  In the country areas at least there is scope for efforts to keep justices abreast of current High <Col N="1061" /> Court decisions, to ensure some rough uniformity in decisions and penalties and to improve efficiency and punctuality. In the Dublin Metropolitan District experience of the operation of the system of three separate divisions, each in charge of a principal justice, which was introduced by the 1946 Act, suggests that placing responsibility for the allocation of the business of that Court on one person would be a more efficient arrangement.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Government decided that it would be in the public interest and in the interests of the better administration of justice that a district justice should be appointed President of the District Court and be given sufficient powers to enable him to achieve the desired objects.  The district court is the court to which most of our citizens have to resort to secure justice or before which they must appear to answer complaints. In an average year the district court deals with over a quarter million cases and the Government feel they have a serious responsibility to ensure that these courts are managed efficiently and give the best possible service to the general public.</P>
    <P>Generally, it is true to say that almost all the district justices have set a very high standard in the way in which they deal with the business before them.  Their courts commence punctually and, if a court has to be cancelled, the earliest possible notice is given to litigants to avoid inconvenience to them.  Unfortunately, from time to time there have been some justices who fail to maintain any reasonable standards of punctuality and who show a persistent lack of consideration to litigants when cancelling courts without giving reasonable notice of their intention to do so.  This has given rise to unfavourable comment both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>Last year on the Estimates for my Department and again this year on a Supplementary Estimate for the District Court the failure of some justices to hold courts was raised by the Leader of the Opposition.  I have confirmed that over the past few years there were <Col N="1062" /> particular justices who showed an unusually high proportion of courts not held.  In one case the proportion was as high as 32%.  I consider I would be failing in my duty to the public and to all the justices whose conduct in this respect is beyond reproach if I did not bring to the notice of justices my concern at the failure of some of them to observe reasonable standards of timekeeping and regularity in holding their courts.</P>
    <P>I have in fact done this but I would have preferred to have been able to utilise the machinery now being provided in the Bill, that is to say, to bring the facts to the notice of the President of the District Court who is being charged with the duty of ensuring the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the court.  It would be a matter for the President then to take the necessary action, either informally or by way of the inquiry provided for in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of Section 36.  From every point of view it is more desirable that a judicial person should undertake the task of improving judicial standards. I want to emphasise again that it is in relation to only a small minority of justices that complaints about unpunctuality and cancellations of the appointed courts are made but of course the actions of that minority do disproportionate damage to the good reputation of justices as a body.</P>
    <P>Equally as important as the President's powers of inquiry will be those for securing as far as practicable general uniformity of practice and procedure in the administration of justice and the standards to be adopted in fixing the amount of penalties.  The Bill authorities him to convene meetings of justices periodically to discuss matters of this kind.  Some time ago, there was evidence of public disquiet at what appeared to be a serious lack of uniformity between district justices in dealing with habitual offenders, notably in what seemed to be the overuse of the Probation of Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>When I investigated the matter I was made very conscious of the difficulties of bringing to the notice of justices generally the bad effect on the <Col N="1063" /> standing of the Court brought about by lack of uniformity.  I found that there was no machinery available. Now, under the provisions of sub-] section (3) of Section 36 the justices will be able to discuss these matters among themselves.  There is no question of interfering with the freedom of individual justices to award the penalties they consider appropriate to teh particular circumstances of each case; but the justices will have the benefit of the views and experience of other justices at these discussions and can, if they wish, take them into account when exercising their jurisdiction subsequently.  Careful consideration has been given to the question of the constitutionality of this provision and I have been advised that it is not in any way contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Apart from the statutory responsibility being given to the President for the prompt and efficient discharge of Districts Court work in the State as a whole, he is being made responsible, in particular, for the distribution of business among the justices of the Dublin Metropolitan District and for determining the class of business to be transacted in the various sittings in that District.  The present three Divisions of the Dublin Metropolitan Justices are being abolished, but the existing Principal Justices of Divisions will hold posts as Principal Justices of the Dublin Metropolitan District and will be consulted by the President of the District Court before he arranges for the distribution of business. There will be no change in the present arrangements in accordance with which the places and times of sittings in country districts are determined by the Minister for Justice, but he will now be obliged to consult the President beforehand.  The President will be consulted also in the event of the Minster determining the number of days in each week on which Dublin Metropolitan Justices shall normally sit.</P>
    <P>If the idea of a Presodent has been good for the Circuit Court and the High and Supreme Courts it should be good, in greater degree, for the District <Col N="1064" /> Court where, owing to the large number of Justices and the diversity of the work, judicial leadership is needed to co-ordinate the work of the Court and so secure as far as practicable uniformity of practice and procedure in the administration of justice without interfering with the discretion of the individual justice.</P>
    <P>A new kind of jurisdiction over justices is being vested in the President of the High Court by subsection (4) of Section 10 of the Bill.  This sub-section empowers the President to interview a justice privately whenever he is of opinion that the justice's conduct in the execution of his office is such as to bring the adminstration of justice into disrepute.  It is designed for the type of case where the formal inquiry by a High Court or Supreme Court judge provided for in Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, would not be called for or would not be the best or most appropriate procedure.  The view has always been taken&mdash;and I think rightly taken&mdash;that the elaborate machinery of the 1946 Act should not be set in motion by the Minster for justice unless the allegations against the justice, if proved, would make it necessary for the Minster to move in the Oireachtas for the justice's removal from office.  The result has been that there is no redress available to the public or their representatives in less serious cases where, for example, offensive statements are made gratuitously by justices in regard to individuals or organisations or in relation to the legislation passed by the Oireachtas. All that is needed, the Government feels, is for some judicial person of the necessary standing to advise the justice or justices concerned to conform to the standards of behavious followed by their colleagues in the execution of their office.  I have little doubt that the friction which has been created from time to time&mdash;fortunately not very often&mdash;between justices and the public will be reduced, if not entirely eliminated, by the influence which the President will exercise on the conduct of justices generally.</P>
    <P>The opportunity presented by this Bill has been availed of to make a <Col N="1065" /> number of other amendments in the present law.  Section 26 contains a provision requiring at least seven days' notice to be given of an application by an accused person or by the Attorney General to have a trial transferred from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court.  Since 1924 an accused person has had an absolute right to have his trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court if he were charged with an offence the maximum penalty for which exceeded one year's imprisonment or five years' penal servitude. This provision enabled an accused person who felt that he could not get a fair trial from a local jury to have the trail transferred to the CEntral Criminal Court which has always sat in Dublin.  Since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act of 1951, however, the necessity for transferring trials to Dublin has diminished as Section 19 of that Act empowers the circuit Judge to transfer a criminal trial from one place in the circuit to another, if he was of opinion that a fair trail could not be obtained in the former venue.</P>
    <P>I say that the necessity has diminished rather than ceased because even a change of venue within a circuit may not be sufficient in some cases to enable an impartial trial to be obtained.  For this reason, it is not proposed that this right of an accused person should be taken away.  The Bill does aim. however, at going a little of the way towards removing some of the abuses to which this provision has given rise.  Cases have been transferred, it has been said, for no better reason than to secure an adhournment which had been properly refused, or to suit counsel, or because the accused wanted to postpone the evil day.  The abuse is particularly noticeable in Dublin because jurors for the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal court are drawn from the same jury book so that an accused in Dublin has not the excuse of a country accused that by applying for a transfer he can avoid having to appear before a local jury.  As a result, the intention of the Oireachtas that the Circuit Court should deal with all criminal matters except murder and such serious <Col N="1066" /> offences is being nullified and much of the time of the High Court is being needlessly taken up with criminal trials which are proper to the Circuit Court. In addition a great deal of unnecessary expense and inconvenience is being caused to witnesses and jurors who have to be present at the Circuit Criminal Court, there being no provision for prior notice of an application to have the trial transferred; and the period spent by accused persons in custody before trial is being unnecessarily prolonged. Notwithstanding that a strong case could be made for drastically curtailing the accused's rights of applying for a transfer, particularly in Dublin, I am aware from the views expressed in this House when the matter was discussed on the 1953 Courts of Justice Bill that any such proposal would not be generally approved and accordingly Section 26 is confined to providing that the accused or the Attorney General should be required to give at least seven days' notice of intention to apply for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that Judges and Justices are to be addressed in court in the Irish forms.  Under the present law the mode of address of Judges and Justices is left to be determined by rules of court.  The rules of the Superior Courts and of the Circuit Court permit the use of &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; or of the Irish equivalent.  The rules of the District Court authorise only the English title &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo;  I think that most people will agree that we have arrived at a stage when we should cease using terms such as &ldquo;lord&rdquo; in the Courts and instead use the Irish forms of address as we have been accustomed to do for so long here in Dáil Éireann when addressing the Ceann Comhairle.  The Courts, Judges and Justices have also been styled in Irish in the Establishment and Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to mention two other amendments proposed by the Bill.  The first of these, which is contained in Section 47, provides that judgement debts due on circuit court judgments will carry interest in the same way as judgement <Col N="1067" /> debts due on the judgements of superior courts.  This provision will apply to proceedings by or against a State authority.  The second amendment is contained in Section 52 and has the effect of extending to all proceedings whatsoever (other than the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence) the power of a Justice to state a case for the High Court on a point of law. The extension applies both to an appeal by way of case stated, i.e. a case stated which is applied for after the Justice has made a determination in the proceedings, and to a consultative case stated, i.e. a case stated by the Justice in the course of the proceedings either on application or of his own motion.  Under the present law, contained in the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1857, appeals by way of case stated can be made only in respect of a determination by a Justice of an information or complaint.  There is thus no power to have an appeal by way of case stated from any other decision of a Justice, e.g., a decision in a licensing case, such as there has been in Britain since 1879.  As regards consultative cases stated, doubts have been expressed as to whether such a case may be stated in a licensing matter and the proposed amendment will remove these doubts.  Section 52 also provides for the suspension of any determination made by a Justice on an application being made for a case stated.</P>
    <P>I have said so much about the Supplemental Provisions Bill that I may have tended to obscure the fundamental character of the Establishment and Constitution Bill.  The courts we have had since the struggle for independence began&mdash;both the Dáil Courts and those subsequently set up&mdash;have served us well and have always commanded respect. They have fully proved themselves to be what the Constitution intended them to be&mdash;Zealous protectors of individual liberty and of the other fundamental rights guaranteed by that Constitution.  It is true that, happily, they have been able to operate in relatively stable conditions since the Constitution came into force but I <Col N="1068" /> believe that the very existence of independent courts, always prepared to vindicate the citizens' fundamental rights, ahs been an important factor in contributing to the measure of stability we have enjoyed.  This is the appropriate occasion for paying a tribute to the existing courts and I am sure all parties in the House will join with me in doing so.  I am confident that the new courts will continue to discharge their constitutional responsibilities in the same manner and thus maintain and even increase the respect in which the existing courts have always been held by the community.</P>
    <P>I commend both Bills to the House and ask that they be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two pieces of legis lation are being  put before the House by the Minster for Justice.  One is called the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, 1959, and the other the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Bill, 1959. I last saw these two pieces of legislation in the year 1954.  They were put into my hands after being taken from a safe where, I presume, they had been left for a number of months.  There was an earlier draft which bore the date 1953.  Whether that was the first effort to carry out Article 58 of the Constitution or not I do not know, but these are obviously the second effort.</P>
      <P>Article 58 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>On or after the coming into operation of the Constitution and, until otherwise determined by law, the existing courts in existence before the coming into operation of the Constitution shall continue to exercise the same jurisdiction as before and any member of such court shall continue to be a member and shall hold office in like tenure.</P>
      <P>The date of that is the 29th December, 1937.  If I am right that the first two proposals were put into draft form in 1953 for 1954, apparently no successful attention was paid to the provisions of Article 58 of the Constitution until that Constitution had been 16 or 17 years in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> When those two drafts came under my notice in 1954, they were taken from a safe and they certainly went back in there again and remained there.  I never saw them agian except for some cursory reading until 1957. Listening to the minster to-day, the thought struck me that I should like to record the number of columns of the debate which he devoted to the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill and the number he devoted to the Supplemental Provisions Bill and how much of his time and attention was addressed to the district court and to the procedure there.  It would be an interesting calculation which I shall make for myself one of these days.</P>
    <P>I do not really know why, when the matter was in draft for so long, there is so much agitation about it at the moment.  The existing courts have not found themselves handicapped by the new Constitution and ther have been decisions of the courts which indicated that the existing courts had full powers, that they had power to appoint new judges to the old courts even though Article 58 did not make provision for the filling of vacancies.  The courts found, in the case where one appointment was challenged, that the appointment was a proper appointment, that the judge had been a properly appointed judge and that he had fulfilled the duties of his office in a proper way.  It was established that the existing courts were properly operating under the Constitution, even though their authority was conferred on them by the previous Constitution.  They were bound to administer the law as they found it.</P>
    <P>There was a clear-cut decision from the supreme Court in 1953 that the courts were running smoothly and that vacancies could be filled and that there was no difficulty.  They found that the old courts could administer the law as they found it and could adminsiter it according to the provisions of the Constitution of 1937.  It was discovered that the old judicial bottles were quite capable of containing the new wine of the Constitution of 1937.  In view of that, what is <Col N="1070" /> to be gained by establishing the courts anew?  They have been able to carry on, they have been functioning properly and constitutionally and filling any gaps that occurred in their ranks.</P>
    <P>There is a Constitutional difficulty in what is being done now and that is indicated by the change of one word in the title.  That change is being carried out through Sections 6 and 7 of the main Bill.  Under the 1922 Constitution and under the 1937 Constitution a judge, once appointed, may leave office under different conditions.  He may retire on reaching the age limit. He may vacate his office by resignation in writing and, if he does that before his time is expired, there are certain provisions that relate to his pension.  If he serves for 15 years he is entitled to the full pension of two-thirds of his salary.  If he serves for less than five years and vacates his office, he is not entitled to any pension whatsoever. If he serves for more than five years and less than 15 years he gets a limited pension.  In that section of the 1924 Act which deals with that matter the vacation of office by a judge may take place by resignation in writing but the reason must be either age or permanent infirmity.  A judge could retire on those grounds or on reaching the age limit and that was a matter for the law to determine.</P>
    <P>A judge before reaching the age limit might retire on grounds of age or permanent infirmity.  He would do that by what is called vacating his office by resignation in writing.  Outside of that, there is power to dismiss a judge.  That is to be done on foot of motions passed by both Houses for stated reasons of misbehavious or incapacity. There is no other way while a judge is living of getting rid of him except on these three grounds: retiral on the age limit, resignation in certain circumstances and dismissal.</P>
    <P>Now we are finding a new way. Once the precedent has been established, it can be again operated.  I do not know if there is any special reason for bringing in these Bills or if they have nay special value.  If the existing courts had failed or found themselves <Col N="1071" /> hampered by the jurisdiction and powers given to them, I could understand a chance being taken.  But where the courts operate not merely freely but perfectly, we now bring in a piece of legislation, at the end of the title of which the phrase occurs &ldquo;to abolish the offices of the judges and justices thereof.&rdquo;  Later the phrase comes to be used that the official posts may be vacated and the courts disestablished. When the courts disestablished, then the holders of the offices fail to hold them any longer and those offices are abolished.  This is introducing a new method of dealing with judges.  The courts may be disestablished and the offices may be abolished.  In those circumstances, this is a new way of getting rid of a judge.</P>
    <P>The relevant Article of the Constitution, having stated in rather precise terms that judges were to be independent in teh discharge of their duty and subject only to the Constitution and the law, went on to fortify the judges in respect of that by giving them security of tenure.  In my opinion, this breaks that.  It may be that the chances are worth taking and it may be that hereafter nobody will want to abolish an individual judicial office and get rid of an individual judge, but a new avenue is being opened in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself referred Section 7.  I do not know whether the words have been precisely chosen or not, but the Minister said, so to speak that if a judge retires, the office he has held and the courts in which he functioned stood partly or completely abolished.  But the peculiar situation I find in Section 7 is that &ldquo;When every person who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts has ceased to hold that office&mdash;(a) the existing courts have ceased to be established, (b) every such office shall stand abolished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From a literal reading of that it would seem that if some recalcitrant district justice decided not to put himself in a position in which he ceases to hold the office&mdash;suppose he said he <Col N="1072" /> would not accept an appointment in the new courts&mdash;does that hold up the whole disestablishment of the courts system?  The phrase is used: &ldquo;When every person who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts has ceased to hold that office....&rdquo;  The effect of the section only comes into operation when every person has ceased to hold that office. It may be that there would be some sort of partial disestablishment, but that does not seem to be so at the moment.</P>
    <P>The phrase that I believe was used in the draft of the legislation I saw was that the offices of judges and justices were to be &ldquo;terminated&rdquo;.  The whole matter was to be in terms of termination. Now, we are going into a new terminology&mdash;the abolition and the disestablishment of the courts.  I do not think it gets it away from the constitutional point whether it is called termination of office or whether it is called disestablishment or abolition.  I do not think that matters.  This is not dismissal.  There is no stated misbehaviour or incapacity.  It is certainly not resignation on grounds of age or infirmity.  It is not retirement on the groiunds of the term of appointment having expired.  Whether some new avenue will be opened in the future or not remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second piece of legislation, the Minister talked about important provisions.  I say that the value of the whole of this second piece of legislation will be measured in this way.  Look at the Minister's speech and see how much time was devoted to what I think are trivial amendments, like the method of addressing the courts, and secondly, to certain matters that have ben adjusted in connection with the District Court.  Did it ever refer to Section 7 of the second Bill, the Supplemental Provisions Bill, where the matters discussed include the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court?  I drew attention to the fact that there is provision for a court of five, that the nominations may be as many as five.  The Minister pointed out that the Constitution only requires a full court to sit in two sets of circumstances: <Col N="1073" /> first, when an approach has ben made to have the President impeached for stated misbehaviour; and, secondly, when a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court under an Article of the Costitution. In these two sets of circumstances, and in these only, is there a requirement of a full court.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that it was unthinkable that a constitutional point should be decided by, say, two judges out of three or that it might go to a draw by two judges being lined up on either side.  That is a good comment. It is a pity it was not made when the Constitution was being passed, because it seems to me it was a necessary provision of a good Constitution that if ever any question arose concerning teh validity of any law in connection with the Constitution, it should be tried by a full court and that there should be no possibility of anything less than five judges hearing any such point.  We know that the case to which I have referred was a case where only three judges sat, although it examined a constitutional point.  There may have been four, but it certainly was not a full court.  It is no longer constitutional unless we are going to amend it. Whatever is brought in here is a mere matter of law.  It is to be emphasised that we are not attempting to change the Constitution and whatever is here set out is merely law that can be changed by later pieces of law overriding it.</P>
    <P>The Minister then brought out for special comment the position of the new functionary, the President of the District Court.  As far as I am concerned, I object completely to any such office being established.  I object entirely to a person of, say, the District Court being given such powers over his colleagues as is given to this person in Section 36.  In Section 36 this power is given to the President of the District Court when it appears to him that the conduct of a justice of the District Court is prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the court.  He then shall inquire into the matter and may report the result of the inquiry to the Minister. The one good thing I saw about the <Col N="1074" /> section when I first read it was that it kept the minister and the Civil Service out of this whole matter.  This was to be somewhat inter-judicial, but now, having made thin inquiry, the matter is to be reported to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (3), the President of the District Court is empowered to convene a meeting of his District Court colleagues, the purpose being to discuss necessary matter relating to the discharge of the business of the court &ldquo;including, in partiuclar, such matters as uniformity in the exercise by the justices of the jurisdiction of that court and the general level of fines and other penalties.&rdquo;  Then there is a later sub-section which says that every justice must attend any of these meetuings, the only excuse being illness or any other unavoidable cause.  He must inform the President of the District Court of whatever reason keeps him away.  If there is such a power to be given to anybody, it should not be given to the President of the District Court.  It might be given to some higher authority in the court system.  In addition to this, Section 7 empowers the President of the High Court to make inquiries in respect of certain matters connected with district justices.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the President of the High Court power to enquire into the matter of district justices and the District Court.  Subsection (4) of that section says:</P>
    <P>Where the President of the High Court, having considered the conduct of a jsutice of the District Court in executing his office in relation to a particular matter, is of opinion that the conduct of the justice was such as to bring the adminstration of justice into disrepute, the President may interview the justice privately and inform him of such opinion.</P>
    <P>First of all, the President of the High Court has not, as far as I know, any close touch or contact with the justices of the district court or their business. How is he going to make his inquiries? Who is supposed to provide the President of the High Court, second in the judicial hierarchy of this <Col N="1075" /> country, with the report on which he will base his enquiry into the work of any particular district justice?</P>
    <P>The subsection says that the President of the High Court has to consider the conduct of a justice.  It does not way who is to bring the conduct of the justice to the notice of the President of the High Court.  Is it where the President of the District Court has made inquiries, and is the President of the District Court to report to the Minster?  I do not see from this how the President of the High Court gets any information about the district court.  When the President of the High Court enquires into the conduct of the district justice, if he is of the opinion that the conduct of the justice is such as to bring the adminstration of jsutice into disrepute, the President of the High Court may interview the justice privately.  I suggest these two sections should be tied together.</P>
    <P>If there is any disciplinary action to be taken in the district court there are many ways of enquiring into them provided in the various Courts of Justice Acts.  In his statement the Minster said he had received notice of certain matters.  One was in respect to the conduct of certain district justices in connection with certain criminal matters, that there was a lack of uniformity in these matters, particularly in the cases of certain justices in their treatment of habitual offenders, to whom they applied the Probation of Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>Such scandal as there was in these matters was not so much in the application of the probation Act but int eh application of the Act comnined with a statement by a justice that the Probation Act would be applied if the offender put money into the Court poor-box.  The amount that had to be put into the poor-box was more than twice the amount of the maximum fine that could be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minster says he found he had no power to deal with that.  If the Minister had not any power to deal with the matter of that sort, it must have been vested in somebody because <Col N="1076" /> it was dealt with and the thing was rectified.  We do not require these elaborate sections such as we have in Sections 10 and 36 which subject the district justices to these inquiries.  I have not discussed this with any of my colleagues but I know there is a general dislike of Section 36 which provides for the appointment of a man to described as President of the District Court.</P>
    <P>While it is recognised there is a lack of uniformity with regard to sentences and that there are certain areas where justices do not, of instance, attend punctually or where they call off without sufficient notice certain court sittings which have been advised, I do not see how the President of the District Court will get over what is described in the section as any lack of prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the district court.  A complant was voiced by a member of the Opposition and I think the minisdter said he had made inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Minster said he did nothing about these inquiries because he was confronted with the excuse that the justice had an attack of illness round about the time when the district court should have been held or that the justice was in some other way suffering from some incapacitating illness, and I understood the minster to say he could do nothing about it in views of such excuses.  I do not know whether such excuses will now be regarded as reasonable.  I want to give my own private notice that Section 36 is abhorrent not merely on the question of impacting on his district court colleagues by one man.  I do not know how uniformity in teh district court is to be secured, but I would point out that there are in England such a thing as Judges' Rules which are circulated to members of the different courts and which call attention to any lack of uniformity there may be in the different grades, particularly in respect of sentences. Something the same might be adopted here.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had asked for advice and had ben fully advise that Section 36 is not against the Constitution. That we can inquire into at a <Col N="1077" /> later stage because certain doubts have ben expressed to me by many people in connection with the proposals in this section.  Section 26 is one on which the Minster said he had spent a certain amount of time.  It deals with the transfer of trials.  I shall not devote any time to discussing it because to my mkind it is a trivial matter.  The main defects found in earlier legislation in this respect were removed by the 1951 Act.</P>
    <P>In Section 45 we deal with the most important matter of the mode of address in court.  On that subject, the Minister said it was as easy to learn a bit of Irish to be applied in our courts as it was for members of this House to say &ldquo;Ceann Comhairle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leas-cheann Comhairle.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ceann Comhairle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rdquo; are methods of addressing the Chair in this House established, I would point out, not by legislation but by Standing Orders.  Surely, the rule of addressing people in the courts might be left to the discretion of the bodies concerned&mdash;the solicitors and counsel?  I know that the Bar Council have reacted very strongly in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the constitution it is said the head of the Supreme Court is to be referred to as the Chief Justice.  There is an Irish version which  says&mdash;I am translating&mdash;the title of the president of the Supreme Court is to be: &ldquo;An Príomh-Bhreitheanmh.&rdquo; Now we are told in an English Act, and it is transferred into English and we are not speaking Irish at this time, that we must call the Chief Justice &ldquo;A Phríomh-Bheithimh&rdquo; and every judge &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; and to a group of them, instead of saying &ldquo;your lordships&rdquo; we are to say &ldquo;A Bhreithiúna&rdquo;.  I do not know whether, after getting over the compulsory method of address, one may drop afterwards into the ordinary usage.  It is very difficult to get our tongues disaccustomed to saying, when a judge intervenes, &ldquo;Your lordship has said something,&rdquo;&ldquo;I did not gather what your lordship says.&rdquo;  Must it be the &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; that is to be used in all connections or is it merely the opening <Col N="1078" /> invocation, if ever one is addressing a court?</P>
    <P>Is it not ludicrous that in a small piece of legislation running with these various schedules into 55 pages, that we spend six or seven lines saying what is to be the method of address in court?  If there is any objection to the old-time phraseology then let us have it out root and branch.  I would have thought that more obejction would be taken to the clothes, the robes, that have to be worn by members of the Bar.  Some people are very fond of them.  Some people dislike them very much.  But, seeing that they are, in fact, an old court dress I would have thought there would have been more hostility directed to the robes than to the method of address.  The vocative that we use to anybody is not a very important matter.  Why should we get into solemnly proclaiming that people must be addressed in court in a particular way?  I do not know whether it is every time the Chief Justice is addressed or every time a ny judge is addressed or every time a group of judges are addressed that these phrases in Section 45 have to be used.  However, we will talk about that at a later stage.  At the moment it seems to be a trivial matter and one that might have been left entirely to the judgment of members of the profession.</P>
    <P>If we want to insist on Irish in the courts and want to give any impetus to advancement, even step by step and very small step by very small step, to Irish, I would suggest that when a witness comes to take the oath he should be sworn in Irish and in Irish only.  I think it would lead to a better appreciation of the Irish language than merely asserting that a judge should be called &ldquo;A Bhreithimh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 47 again shows the triviality of this Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill in that the Minister should spend time in telling us provision is now being made for the charging of interest on the judgment debts of the Circuit Court.  Whatever importance is in it, we will see how much time will be spent on Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>Section 52 also is to my mind a <Col N="1079" /> trivial matter.  This is the question of a case stated.  If there is anything to be dealt with in connection with a case dealt with in the High Court on a question of law, it arises only in connection with a small matter that is dealt with in subsection (2) of Section 52 where, having got a case stated to the High Court, there is a limited right of appeal granted to the Supreme Court, but that right of appeal is only by leave of the High Court.  That matter was thrashed out in a case reported in the 54 Reports. It is the case of <i>O'Sullivan and Robinson.</i> It is there declared that the old prohibition that came in one of the Court of Justice Acts, amended by later Acts, still prevails.  This is again to be written into subsection 2. If there was anything to be done with regard to cases stated to the High Court and the possibility of appeal thereafter, to my mind, the amendment should have been to leave out the necessity of having the leave of the High Court before the further step of appeal to the Supreme Court could be taken.</P>
    <P>These are the matters that the Minister is discussing in connection with the Supplemental Provisions Bill. It is not much of a Bill.  I just want against to refer to the time-point.  The constitution came into operation in December 1937.  These Bills date from 1959.  The drafts appeared round about 1953 and 1954.  They have been held up all this time.  They could easily have been kept in limbo for a further ten years.  We were promised in respect of the Supplemental Provisions Bill, whjich is not very necessary, that it is not going to be very long-lasting.  That once it is got through, we have, so to speak, renewed the ground on which we treat and then there is to be a consolidating Bill to put together all the matters affected by various Courts of Justice Acts and Court Officers Acts.  We are going to have a consolidating Bill sometime later.  Let us hope that it will be another 20 years before we see that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just <Col N="1080" /> like to add a few words to what Deputy McGilligan has said in relation to the two Bills we are discussing together and which the minister has introduced. I take it that the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, the first Bill, late and all as it appears, is a Bill which the Government feel it is necessary to introduce.  Its purpose has been mentioned by the Minister as firmly establish under the Constitution the courts which, in fact, have been functioning since 1922.  That is done in the form of this Bill by a notional abolition of the existing courts and an establishment of other courts of the same name with the same judges to exercise the same jurisdiction with careful provision that the proceedings of the different courts shall be carried over.  So that, really, we are engaged here at the moment in playing different parts in a kind of legal drama and a legal fiction which may be necessary and which, I suppose, must go on.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill there is the new departure which has been referred to by Deputy McGilligan of the appointment of a President of the District Court.  At first, I may say, when I heard that such a functionary was to be appointed I reacted very much against it.  I felt that it was not a good thing and that such an office was unnecessary.  Frankly, I must say that I listened carefully to the case made by the Minster in that regard and the Minister has succeeded in convincing me that probably there is need for such an appointment.  Assuming that there is need for such an appointment, I am concerned in relation to the Supplemental Provisions Bill by what that judicial officer may do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has referred to the exercise of certain supervisory functions in relation to district justices. To me, it is disgraceful that such a statutory provision is necessary.  I accept that it may be and I am not going to discuss it further but I am concerned to see that under Section 36 of the Supplemental Provisions Bill the President of the District Court may summon twice a year all the justices in <Col N="1081" /> the country to a meeting and each justice must attend that meeting unless he is ill or <i>bona fide</i> unable to attend. At the meeting there is to be a discustion on various matters such as uniformity in the exercise by the justices of the jurisdiction of the courts and the general level of fines and other penalties. I should like to makie my own personal protest in regard to that provision.  It is contrary to natural justice that there should be in a proposed Act of Parliament any provision whereby the level of fines and penalties can be discussed behind closed doors by those who are supposed to administer justice in open Court.</P>
    <P>It shocks me that anyone should suggest that a provision of this kind is desirable or proper.  Here in the Legislature we have our responsibilities.  If we decide that a particular thing should be an offence it is the duty of this Parliament to name a penalty for it. If we wish that there should be no discretion as to the penalty, as we do sometimes, then it is our duty and our responsibility to provide to that effect in the bIll we are passing.  In some cases in relation to certain offences this Parliament has decided in its wisdom that one a person is convicted there should be no discretion on the part of the Court in relation to the penalty which may be imposed and there are automatic penalties provided by legislation which has gone through this House.  In most instances our legislation merely provides a maximum penalty but, in relation to a fine, that a fine not exceeding a particular sum may be imposed.  It is then the duty of the district justice or whoever tries the case to decide, in accordance with his conscience and oath, what is the proper penalty within the limits imposed by the act in question.</P>
    <P>Surely any unfortunate person who may be charged with the commission of an offence is entitled to expect that the penalty to be penalty to be imposed upon him will be imposed in accordance with the facts of his case and the gravity of the offence in the eyes of the Court. It shocks me that ther should be a move now in this Bill to have the particular penalty decided at a <Col N="1082" /> bi-annual meeting of justices presided over by this new functionary, the President of the District Court. We are getting very far away from the canons of natural justice if we permit that kind of legislative proposal to pass through this House without being challenged.  I doubt very much that that kind of provision in Section 36 would be accepted as according with the principles laid down in the Constitution and I earnestly suggest to the Minster that he should reconsider that matter.  There will certainly be an opportunity of considering it further when the Committee Stage of the Bill comes along.</P>
    <P>In relation to other provisions in the courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, there are details which we can discuss on the Committee Stage of the Bill. However, I would like to say a word or two in relation to Section 45 of that Bill.  That is the section which relates to the mode of address of judges and justices.  It is pertinent to record the fact that this Bill containing this section is introduced here by a very respected and well-liked member of the Government and of this House, but a member of this House who, so far as I know, does not know a single word of Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and this member of the Government introduces a Bill here containing a section in which it is to be made obligatory in a court of law that the Chief Justice shall be addressed as &ldquo;A Phríomh-Bhreithimh&rdquo; and ordinary judges as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh.&rdquo;  For what purpose is that introduced?  Is it just to give a slap in the face tot eh legal profession and to the courts or is it intended to give a helping had to the promotion of the Irish language?  If the latter is the intention behind this, then I would suggest that the mind that conceived this idea should be locked up in Grangegorman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an insult to the Irish language that we should have this kind of nonsense forty years after this State was formed.  I could well understand, in <Col N="1083" /> the early days after the War of Independence, when the blood ran far hotter in the veins of many people in this House, a provision of this kind being introduced, but surely forty years later most of those people have got over their salad days and should have grown up?  Surely we can now realise that moves of this kind achieve nothing except enormously to irritate a whole lot of people whom there is no reason to irritate?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in relation to this section: does he think this House is entitled to amend the Constitution, because Section 45 (1) says the Chief Justice shall, in effect, be called &ldquo;Priomh-Bhreitheamh.&rdquo;  There is a provision in the Constitution which says precisely the contrary.  Article 34 of the Constitution, which defines the laws we may pass here, says: &ldquo;The president of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice.&rdquo;  Does the Minister think, or has he been advised, that he or this House has the authority to amend the Constitution and to provide directly contrary to what the Constitution itself lays down as being the designation and description of the President of the Supreme Court?</P>
    <P>As regards the other provision in relation to the mode of address of ordinary judges, &ldquo;A Bhreithimh,&rdquo; there is a certain esteemed colleague of mine at the Irish Bar who might easily mispronounce that word &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; and might find himself, being quite unaccustomed to the Irish language, calling the person presiding in the Court rather an offensive name.  I do not know whether, if that happened, the person concerned would be helping or harming the Irish language.  Certainly if it did happen it would be a very good plot for some future Gilbert and Sullivan play.  Seriously, however, this section has been introduced into the Bill without any consultation with the legal profession, so far as I am aware, and without any consultation with the judges, so far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>It appears to me to be a most unwarranted interference in a matter which would be better left to the good sense and common sense of those who order conditions in our courts.  The <Col N="1084" /> Rules of Court have always provided for the form of address and the way in which business shall be transacted. The Rules of Court are designed and intended to ensure that the business of the courts shall be carried on with due diginity and in the interests of justice. So far as those Rules are concerned at the moment they make ample provision for the conduct of cases in Irish and for the proper mode of address of judges in Irish.  I cannot see why this matter should not continue to be left to the rule-making committees of the different courts to be properly considered by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, has incorporated this section without any consultation.  I should have thought if we were proceeding for the first time to make it mandatory for petitioners or other persons in the courts to address the judges in a certain fashion that one reasonable exercise of good manners would be to seek the views of the Irish Bar and the solicitors' profession on the matter.  It is in no way a sign of weakness to exercise good manners and politely to consult effective professions in relation to a matter of this kind.  That, apparently, was not done.  Perhaps the Minister or his colleagues felt: &ldquo;We shall not bother consulting the Irish Bar or the solicitors.&rdquo; One would imagine that some sense of politeness would suggest to the Minister that perhaps the views of the Irish Bench might be ascertained to see in what way they would wish the courts established under the Constitution to be addressed.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but, so far as I am aware, the judges were not consulted.</P>

      <P>Without consulting anyone we have this provision introduced.  I have said as much as I find it necessary to say in regard to this section at this stage.  We can <Col N="1085" /> discuss it again on Committee Stage. In my view it is a most regrettable section.  I cannot see the sense of it; I do not know what good it achieves. It has been pointed out here that under our Standing Orders we ourselves decide in what way we shall address the occupant of the Chair.  As regards the present occupant, under our Standing Orders we address him as &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo;. In relation to the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we provide that we should address them as such but there is no Act of Parliament that says we should do it.  We do it because, to us who take part in the business of this Assembly, it appears to be the seemly and proper way to conduct our business. In the same way I suggest that also should apply to the courts as, traditionally, it always has done.</P>
      <P>As regards other matters in the Bill there is no question that we find it necessary to raise at this stage and we shall discuss matters of detail at a later stage.</P>

      <P>The legislative history of the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly in relation to enactments which touch upon constitutionality, is a very sorry one and I am not at all certain that this is not another leap in the dark and a measure that will again unnecessarily and ill-advisedly cost the Irish taxpayer and extra number of thousands of pounds.  This, the latest attempt to bring our courts into line with the provisions of the Constitution is, as has been said by Deputy McGilligan, something that is really ephemeral. Deputy McGilligan addressed himself from a constitutional point of view to all of this matter with an informed adequacy just as Deputy O'Higgins who has concluded his address preserved all through it an almost incomprehensible moderation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the provisions that propose to set up a new personage under the name of President of the District Court, we are almost prompted to ask at once: who is the person in mind of whom we must make a beneficiary of what we have to bestow, by giving him a few hundred pounds extra per annum merely as President of a District <Col N="1086" /> Court, fulfilling the functions of a headmaster, as it were, calling up recalcitrant boys to be punished or to be exhorted as the case may be, and who has the power under this Bill, if it is ill-advisedly passed, to force justices from distant parts of the country to come to Dublin or some other arranged spot twice a year&mdash;it is mandatory on them&mdash;to discuss matters like uniformity of penalties?</P>
    <P>The distribution of wealth is not uniform; the distribution of education, if we might put it that way, is not uniform.  There is very little uniformity in any country or community except in the constant factors of the type of soil, the type of economy that we pursue. A man in my constituency found guilty of an offence which can be dealt with under the district court might have neither the knowledge, nor the capacity to pay, which a fellow-offender in a better-off situation and with more knowledge might have.  Is it to be said, then, that because a district justice in a poor area imposes a fine of a few shillings for a relatively minor offence he has to alter that practice because his learned brother exercising similar jurisdiction in an area which is better of imposes a much higher amount by way of punishment on an offender whose position generally in regard to education and means is much better?</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has said, a district justice takes an oath to administer the law having regard to all the circumstances, and with justice, as best he can, and uniformity in the matter of penalties is a matter for individual conscience and individual circumstances. It is not for this House, after we have enacted some piece of legislation in which we set out maximum terms of imprisonment, maximum fines or both together, to say how a district justice shall exercise his discretion in the application of those punishments which have been laid down.</P>

      <P>If it is as effective as that sort of gathering it might be well if the powers behind this Bill were to take stock at once.  I do not think that it is right that a person styled as President of the District Court should have that power&mdash;indeed I do not think it is essential that there should be any such functionary at all.  After all the Government should have sufficient confidence in the people appointed that they would, in their areas, according to the oath they took and the discretion they are allowed, administer the law as it stands without having them subjected to the headmaster's study performance, being compelled to come twice a year to Dublin and undergo strictures, possibly punishments and exhortations.</P>
      <P>That might lead to very great irritation and discontent.  It is bad enough at the moment that we have in this country at least four&mdash;I am not sure of the number&mdash;district justices who have been allowed to continue in their practise while acting as justices and now have to return to them when they become redundant at the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of address in Section 45, it is difficult to speak with moderation particularly when, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, the Minister responsible for this piece of legislation, so far as we are aware, knows no Irish with the exception of the words &ldquo;A Cheann Comhairle.&rdquo;  He has not, in all the long time he has filled the office of Minister, and has spoken from the Front Benches of this House, ever used a word of Irish.  He now seeks, at the end of upwards of a period of 30 years in this House, to impose upon the legal practitioners of this country the manner and mode in which they should address judges.  There is no power vested in the Minister for Justice to compel me or any other practitioner or any citizen of this country to address the Chief Justice as &ldquo;A Phriomh Bhreithimh,&rdquo; a judge of the High Court or any other court as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh,&rdquo; or any combination of judges as &ldquo;A Bhreithiúna.&rdquo;  There is no <Col N="1088" /> power in this country vested in the Minister for Justice or anybody else to compel me or any other citizen in this country to address them other than &ldquo;Chief Justice,&rdquo;&ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Irish is the first official language of the Constitution in which the words &ldquo;Priomh Bhreitheamh&rdquo; are used but English is also an official language of the Constitution and that says &ldquo;the President of the Supreme Court shall be called Chief Justice.&rdquo;  What is going to happen, if this stupid section in this Bill goes through, if any practitioner or group of practitioners still refer to judges as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo; and to the justices as &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;?  What power have we to compel them to do otherwise?  It might not be readily acceptable to the Minister or to many other people that there is a very clear-cut distinction between a person who is sitting there as a person presiding over the court, and the idea of Court which he represents; it is when one leaves the concrete address to the person who represents the Court and proceeds into the abstraction of the Court itself that the difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>What are the phrases to be used when one has to refer for instance to the judgment of some other judge? What is the equivalent mode of address you are going to have in this piece of tomfoolery when you have to use the phrase &ldquo;Their Lordships&rdquo; in referring to another case, or &ldquo;His Lordship&rdquo;?  What is the phrase then? Why is that not covered?  I suppose it is not covered because the people responsible thought they would be going too far with this codology to have people get up in Court to say: &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; and then proceed: &ldquo;The facts in this case are...&rdquo;  What is to compel a person who does not know these terms and who cannot understand them to use them?  There are people who have linguistic difficulty, who never learned Irish and who have difficulty in getting round words of that kind.  &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; is not an easy thing to say.  Not every person in this country would find it too easy to say, and when it is mispronounced, as it inevitably will be if it is persisted in, it will cause a serious loss <Col N="1089" /> of dignity to the Court because it will only bring the Court and the language into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency which embraces part of the Gaeltacht in this country.  The people of the Gaeltacht are my people; the language is my language.  I am not using it here and I shall use it here only on very select occasions because it gives rise to a measure of indignation in me when I hear of legislation being brought in to compel, without consultation, members of the community to use certain terms of address in our courts when the Irish language is being used at the same time both inside and outside this House as a method to cover up very serious omissions indeed.  Any Government that seeks to impose Irish terms of address or any terms of address upon any body of practitioners be they members of the Bar or solicitors&mdash;or, mind you, be they witnesses; witnesses will have to learn all this rigmarole&mdash; is not serving the cause of the language. This is the equivalent of that gigantic effort to preserve the Irish language that began with, &ldquo;A chara,&rdquo; and finished with &ldquo;Mise le meas&rdquo; and an English letter in between.</P>
    <P>When will we realise that it is this kind of lip-service which is killing the language and making those genuinely interested rather despondent about it, if not deciding to give it up altogether? It is unconstitutional to try to make people do something that is provided for otherwise in the Constitution. Mark you, this Government, and the Party which supports it, are always talking up and down the country about their Constitution.  It seems that, while they talk about it, they regard themselves as entitled to make every legislative effort they can to wreck it, when advantage would seem to lie that way.  How will this be enforced? In the first place, it is unconstitutional and there is therefore no method of prescribing its enforcement.</P>
    <P>What can a judge do to me or to any other citizen if he is addressed as &ldquo;My lord&rdquo; after this Bill is passed, if it is passed?  What can he do?  Will he regard it as contempt of court if he is <Col N="1090" /> referred to in the manner in which he has been referred to over the last ten, 20, 30 and 40 years?  Will it amount to contempt of court to say &ldquo;My lord&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;?  What will be the remedy?  What is the meaning of this particular piece of lip-service to the language on this occasion when, within recent months, we had to get in our courts on a constitutional issue an interpreter to assist the presiding judge, and at least one counsel appearing for the Attorney-General, representing the Government? When will this hypocrisy cease?</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to enforce this provision.  It would be foolish to try particularly if, as Deputy O'Higgins says&mdash;and, as far as my knowledge goes, what he says is true &mdash;there has been no consultation with members of the Bar, no consultation with the solicitors' profession, and no consultation with the members of the Bench.  If it is the intention of the Government to legislate for the good of the community, and all legislation should be governed by that objective, they should at least consult the interests vitally affected and consider, in particular the dignity of our Courts, the prestige they have, instead of bringing them down to the level of ridicule, using the Irish language as the medium through which to achieve that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>So far we have had the lawyers' point of view.  It is as well to remember that they are interested parties in this matter because some of them may be future judges. Recently I read a book dealing with the history of Fleet Street.  The various editors looked up to their bosses as the big fellows.  They were big fellows to the people in the jounalistic profession.  To the outsider they were not big fellows.  In the same way, members of the legal profession here may have a certain bias.  Ordinary people may think differently.  The people outside, who may in a sense, perhaps, be victims, should have their point of view put equally well here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, first of all, in the question of the discipline of justices. <Col N="1091" /> Justices are human like the rest of us.  We are none of us perfect. Neither are justices.  Very often we read reports in the papers of speeches made by justices, speeches which have no bearing at all on the case at hearing. It is a fact, too, that the method of dealing with cases varies considerably. I was in the dance hall business at one time.  If we wanted a licence, we were almost certain to get it from one justice, but we knew we had very little chance of getting it from another. Why should that be?  I remember a justice refusing a licence for any dancing during Lent.  He forgot that a number of people are employed in this business.  There are musicians and all sorts of people who earn a livelihood and their livelihood is just as important to them during Lent as it is at any other period of the year.  We went to another justice on that occasion and he granted the licence, with the exception of Holy Week.  In the country one may be refused a licence in one area.  One appeals and gets the licence somewhere else.  There should be some uniformity of practice.</P>
    <P>I think it is an excellent idea that these justices should come together and agree as to the best approach.  I am sure due allowance is made for different capacities, environment, and so on where the various litigants are concerned.  But there should be some sort of discipline and I am in agreement with the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the questions asked as to what the President of the High Court would know about a justice, is it not possible that the President of the High Court might be a friend of one of the justices?  The other justices might think it would be a good thing to inform the President of the High Court along certain lines and in that manner ensure some sort of discipline or some method of making complaints. I think it is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>With regard to the mode of address, last year on the Minister's Estimate I protested against the present form of address.  Whether or not that had anything to do with the Minister's decision I do not know.  It is all very well for members of the legal profession to argue that we should continue with <Col N="1092" /> the present form of address.  This is a Republic.  The term President is a republican term.  I regard such terms as &ldquo;worship&rdquo; and &ldquo;lordship&rdquo; as craven.  When Lord Norbury, and Lord Jeffries were officiating it was well known that if a litigant literally felt over himself addressing them as &ldquo;My lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your lordship&rdquo; he got off; those who failed to observe these niceties received a very stiff sentence.  It should be possible for people to respect our Courts without having to &ldquo;worship&rdquo; all over the place.</P>
    <P>I have seldom been in court.  I do not like courts.  I had a case some years ago and I asked the solicitor as to how I should address the court. He told me to say &ldquo;Your worship&rdquo; I said I did not like addressing anyone as &ldquo;Your worship&rdquo;.  &ldquo;This fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is very choosy and, if you want a fair crack of the whip, you will have to address him as I told you&rdquo;. That was the solicitor's advice.  Why should I, for the sake of getting justice, be literally required to go down on my knees?  Surely it should be possible to address such a man as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;.</P>

Judgement should be based on the evidence. The Constitution lays it down that titles of nobility shall not be used. It is a feudal title.  Those men are just like you or me.  What we want is justice and it should not be based on how one addresses a judge.  I fully agree with the Minister and the proposal he has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had some difficulty in understanding the full provisions of these two Bills.  My legal knowledge, which was never very great, has become even less than it used to be.  I am at a loss to understand how many provisions of this Bill involve amendment of the present situation.  It would have been helpful if we had got more guidance as to whether sections were new sections and <Col N="1093" /> as to the exact meaning of the legislation now submitted.  In particular, I would like to know whether any change in the jurisdiction of the lower courts is provided for in the schedule to the Supplemental Provisions Bill.  If there has been some alternation in the jurisdication of the lower courts.  I would like that to be brought to our attention.  If there have not been any changes in jurisdiction a good opportunity may have been missed for reviewing that whole question.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the problem which may arise under the present law so far as the number of judges sitting in the Supreme Court is concerned.  I agree with him that it is advisable that, as often as possible and in all the more important decisions such as appeals and constitutional matters, the full bench of five judges should be present.  It may be impossible to provide that the court should only sit with five judges but emphasis should be laid on the importance of having five judges sitting as often as possible.</P>
      <P>Some comment has been made by previous speakers on Section 10 sub-section (4) which refers to the President of the High Court having some jurisdiction over a justice of the district court.  In Deputy McGilligan's mind, there was some confusion between subsection (4) of that section and Section 36, subsection (2) (a).  As I read those two sections, it appears to me that Section 36 refers only to the conduct of a district justice in the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the Court whereas Section 10 subsection (4) refers to the conduct of a district justice likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is only right that the two matters should be kept distinct as they have been in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is mercifully rare but it does happen that sometimes a district justice may, in an injudicious moment. make a remark which does tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  In such a case it would not be right that any other justice of the district court should be given any responsibility for administering a reproof. <Col N="1094" /> At the same time I feel it is right that the Chief Justice should not be troubled with such a matter and I support the proposal that the President of the High Court should be authorised to interview the justice and inform him of his own opinion as to his conduct.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been offered that the phrasing of this subsection is unsuitable but I cannot see any alternative to the phrase as it is.  The President of the High Court has no jurisdiction over any justice of the district court and he will be acting more in an advisory capacity.  He will not be able to discipline the district justice in any way but, at the same time, a district justice who is sent for by the President of the High Court and who is informed of the opinion of the President of the High Court will feel himself to be very severely reprimanded.  I feel that this is a matter which is much more properly left to the members of the judiciary themselves rather than that any Government intervention should be called for.</P>
    <P>So far, all Government have resisted any suggestion that they take to themselves power to interfere directly with the judiciary except where both houses of the Oireachtas can be satisfied that some judge is not fit to hold office.  That is a principle that must be supported and backed to the limit but that does not mean that individual members of the judiciary should not be subject to discipline of some sort and it is only right that that should come from senior members of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>My own knowledge of Irish is negligible, but I do notice in Section 10 that the new Irish title of the Central Criminal Court is misleading. From my own slight knowledge, the English title of the Central Criminal Court does not appear to be a translation of that title in Irish.  It does seem to me to be a more correct English translation to refer to the Central Criminal Court as the Criminal division of the High Court.</P>
    <P>On this question of titles there is going to be difficulty.  Here we have the old traditional name of the Central <Col N="1095" /> Criminal Court though we try to phrase it rather differently in Irish. I think it is a pity that we should have these discrepancies and we should make up our minds more clearly as to whether we are trying to cut adrift from traditional altogether of whether we are trying to allow a certain amount of tradition to be retained.</P>
    <P>As far as Section 36 is concerned, it seems to me to have drawn some quite unnecessary criticism.  I agree with Deputy Sherewin that it is all too common to hear solicitors who practise in the District Courts tell their clients: &ldquo;If you are before Justice so and so you are home and dried, but if it is Justice someone else you are bunched.&rdquo;  That, in itself, inevitably brings the law into disrepute.  I would be the last to suggest that we should have rigid uniformity because, if there was not some discretion left to judges either in the district court, the circuit court, the High Court or the Supreme Court, we might as well just have some sort of electrical computer which would produce a decision, a sentence and everything else.  We must keep some discretion in the individual members of the judiciary, but at the same time we must not let them run riot.</P>
    <P>In that connection subsection (3) (a) is a particularly good idea.  I do not feel with other speakers that these meetings of justices of the district court will be similar to meetings of small boys in the headmaster's study.  I think Deputy Lindsay was grossly misleading himself by so describing them. I feel these meetings must essentially be conference meetings where the justices meet together.  Unless the President of the District Court is going to turn out to be a ruthless dictator, which I think is unlikely, I cannot imagine these meetings being other than friendly and helpful.</P>
    <P>It must be a very difficult matter for district justices, with the variety of cases which come before them, even to satisfy themselves that they are being strictly fair, just and uniform in their own judgment.  As Deputy Sherwin said, they are very human men not endowed with any superhuman gifts of <Col N="1096" /> patience and insight, but men of considerable experience.  It may well be helpful to them to come together at least twice a year, discuss the problems they have faced during the previous six months and accept, or at least consider, the advice they may receive from their brethren on the bench, and then go back supported by the knowledge that some of their doubts may have been wiped away, supported by knowing at least that other justices are finding the same difficulty.  Even that, in itself, would be a tremendous help.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made, and I think rightly, to the fact that certain district justices have at time fallen considerably short to the standard of efficiency which was expected of them when they were appointed.  I am afraid in isolated cases a man, when he is appointed a district justice, begins to feel he is at least a very close relation of Almighty God and has completed freedom to do as he pleases, to hold courts when he likes, to adjourn courts when he likes, and, sometimes, not without some consideration of hunting fixtures and fishing.  There may be a temptation for an occasional district justice to do that.  At the moment there is no quick way in which such a man can be brought back to a correct realisation of his responsibility. I think it is very right that this decision has been taken to recommend the appointment of a President of the District Court, a senior member of the district court, to whom a report of inefficiency or lack of zeal in office may be made, who may investigate any complaints of that nature, may consult with the justice concerned and, if he feels that the complaint is justified, may take action.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of subsection (2) (a) of Section 36 is that the President of the District Court may report the result of the inquiry to the Minister. I feel that in this case the report to the Minister is an unfortunate way of dealing with any case of indiscipline.  I would much prefer that the report should be forwarded to the President of the High Court so that the matter would still be left entirely in the hands of the judiciary, unless and until a situation arises where a district justice <Col N="1097" /> is becoming so chronically inefficient that Government action is called for in his dismissal.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to consider whether it might not be possible, and might not be more advisable, that the report of any inquiry by the President of the District Court should be furnished to the President of the High Court and not to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We now come to Section 45.  We were bound to have a bit of a row about this.  I am afraid I find myself much more in support of Deputy McGilligan, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Lindsay in this matter.  We should try to get the main reason for the instruction of a statutory provision into a matter which is much more properly within the scope of the Rules of Court, clearly stated.  Up to now, the ordinary Rules of Court have made provision for the correct form of address in each court.  I personally cannot see anything particularly feudal in referring to a judge as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;. Maybe that is because I was accustomed to doing it and accepted it because everybody else did it.  I cannot see anything particularly republican in describing a judge as &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; Neither can I see anything particularly republican in addressing him as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh.&rdquo;  The question of monarchial rule or republicanism does not arise.  Nor, I think, does any question of any previous domination by the British Parliament arise, simply because in Britain they use the same word.  But if there was any desire that members of the Bar in future should address the judge with an Irish title, the worst way in which that desire could be put into practice would be by putting it into this Bill.</P>
    <P>Members of the Bar and all court officers are always very jealous of their independence of the Executive in the State.  The very fact that the Government say: &ldquo;You shall do it&rdquo; will make any barrister do the absolute opposite.  If these titles were introduced by rules of court I think they would be accepted without question by every member of the Bar, but, as Deputy Lindsay said, this House has <Col N="1098" /> no jurisdiction over procedure in the courts, and by making a provision in this Bill that judges shall be addressed only by an Irish title I would say we are sticking our necks out and inviting the comtempt which we will get, because I think no members of the Bar would discontinue the practice, not out of malice but out of habit, of using titles such as &ldquo;his lordship,&rdquo;&ldquo;my lord&rdquo; and even &ldquo;sir&rdquo; in some cases.  I think we are putting ourselves in a false position if we attempt to do something which in fact we cannot do.</P>
    <P>We say here that the Chief Justice shall be addressed in a certain way, but we cannot force anyone to address a justice or a judge in any way other than that acceptable to the judge or justice concerned.  There is possibly something pompous in this mode of address of &ldquo;your lordship,&rdquo;&ldquo;my lord&rdquo; and so on, but at the same time I would support its continuance very strongly indeed.  I would not agree with Deputy Sherwin that we should ever regard a judge on a bench as purely one of ourselves.  There is a tendency, possibly influenced by films which we see in cinemas and television shows, to look on some court procedure as a bit of a laugh.</P>
    <P>About six months ago I was speaking to an American lawyer in this House who informed me, after a short visit to the Four Courts, that our legal system was entirely crazy.  He based that simply on the division of the legal profession into barristers and solicitors, but he also informed me, with complete certainly, that one of the craziest things he noticed was that we were so frightened of judges.  I asked him how he had reached that decision&mdash;that even the members of the Bar and the solicitors were frightened&mdash;and he said he was conducted round the Four Courts by a solicitor and after he had been shown the building he said he wanted to see a judge but the solicitor said that could not be arranged.</P>
    <P>I asked this American whether he could just walk in to see a judge at his home in America.  He said: &ldquo;Sure, if we want to see a judge we go to his office, knock on the door, walk in and <Col N="1099" /> say `hello judge' &rdquo;.  That is not the system I would like to see in this country.  I tried to explain to the American, with what success I do not know, that it was not a matter of the Bar and the solicitors' profession being frightened of judges but that they had a great respect for them and that they showed that respect by their attitude when the court was sitting and by respecting the judges' privacy when the court was not sitting.  I pointed out to him that the profession approached judges and justices with diginity, reverence and respect in court.</P>
    <P>I feel that robes which are worn by members of the bench, the same as those worn by judges in many other countries&mdash;in republican France for instance&mdash;are a help to the profession to realise that when a man is sitting on a bench he is not one of themselves but a man apart, carrying out a function which is of the utmost value and importance in the life of the community. When we are trying to ensure that the diginity of our courts shall be maintained, I think this suggestion that the method of address of judges should be put down in black and white in an Act of the Oireachtas is something which is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>I cannot feel that the use of these Irish titles will do anything for the language at all other than create resentment.  I am absolutely positive that there will be a terrible titter around the courts when these titles are used for the first time.  There will be considerable self-consciousness at least and people will begin to get unsure of themselves in the matter of keeping on using the Irish titles instead of lapsing back into English time and again during an argument.  They may even become embarrassed when in the middle of an argument they find they have already lapsed unintentionally. Like Deputy Lindsay, in particular, I hate this business of mixing Irish and English.</P>
    <P>If anybody wants to go in for Irish let him, but let him do it 100 per cent. This business of putting in a word of Irish here and a word of Irish there just makes me sick.  I have never used <Col N="1100" /> the phrases &ldquo;A chara&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mise, le means&rdquo; at the beginning or end of a letter nor do I intend to do so.  If and when my Irish is sufficiently good to write the whole letter in Irish, I should be only too glad to get the form of address right.</P>
    <P>Let me say again that I regard this as an unfortunate instrusion in a matter that would be much more properly left to the Rules of Court.  If the intention is to strike a blow for the Irish language, a much better blow would be struck by deleting Section 45 of this Bill altogether.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a Cork Deputy, I should like to welcome the provisions of Sections 23 and 27 of the Bill, which deal with the local Courts of Admiralty and Bankruptcy.  Whether the sections go far enough I cannot say from the time I have been able to give to reading the Bill&mdash;and there is a fair amount of reading to be done in it&mdash;but at least it does show that at last cognisance is being taken of the fact that the local Courts of Admiralty and Bankruptacy have been neglected by legislation for a long time past.</P>
      <P>Not alone have they been neglected by legislation, but they have also been neglected by those responsible for the making of the rules.  The rules should have been brought up to date many years ago and I might have something to say on that matter under Section 27 when we reach the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all distressed by the provisions of Section 36 as some of my colleagues in these benches would appear to be.  I am very glad that at last the Minister is taking a strong hand in the matter of the behaviour of district justices.  More than one district justice in this country has shown complete disregard and disrespect for the people whom they are obliged to serve. I can honestly say that these men brought the district court, which is, generally speaking, of a high standard, into absolute disrepute by their contempt through lack of punctuality.  I myself sat for an hour and a quarter waiting for a district justice to arrive to hold a court.  I am accordingly glad <Col N="1101" /> to see that the Minister has at last become sensitive to such a problem. It is not before time that this is being done; it has been going on for years, and I am glad that justices are being put on notice that they will have to do the job for which they are being well paid.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to be apprehensive about subsection (3) (a) of Section 36.  It does not mean the justices, when they come to talk with the President of the District Court, have to bow the knee or even pay any attention to what the learned President of that court may say.</P>
    <P>The subsection says:</P>
    <P>The President of the District Court may convene meetings of the justices of the District Court for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of the business of that Court, including, in particular, such matters as uniformity in the exercise by the justices of the jurisdiction of that Court and the general level of fines and other penalties.</P>
    <P>It does not impose upon any district justice any obligation to pay the slightest attention to what the President of the District Court says.  As far as I can see, the section simply envisages getting the district justices together under the learned President of the District Court in the hope that somebody will say something of use to his colleagues during the course of the meetings.  They can go home as they came up.</P>
    <P>I do not think the meetings envisaged in this Bill will be as useful as the Minister seems to hope because any ordinary district justice should be able to keep himself up to date and should be able to know what jurisdiction he has.  Apart from the ordinary mistake any judicial personage may make, from the Chief Justice down to a district justice, the ordinary justice of the district court knows the jurisdiction he holds and the administration should not after very much from district to district.</P>
    <P>One thing I feel some anxiety about is the reference to the general level of <Col N="1102" /> fines and other penalties.  Whilst it is true in practice that district justices need not pay any attention to what the President of the District Court says about the level of fines or other penalties, we should be practical in our approach and we should realise that in any human society the personal outlook of any person who is appointed to any position whatever, be it Minister, district justice, Ceann Comhairle or anything else, is bound to be coloured by the human failings or the human attributes of the person concerned. It is a bad thing to try to effect uniformity in a matter of that nature where it is so pre-eminently a matter for the individual conscience of every district justice.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer.  Many of the complaints made about district justices were made about district justices who were appointed temporarily and the funny thing about it is that some of them who were the subject of most comment were solemnly reappointed and solemnly sworn in again after they had committed grave offences, which were grave from every point of view and certainly grave in the eyes of the public.  I am glad to feel that that will not happen again and that the Minister and the Government at last have decided to talk plainly to the few erring district justices who brought disrepute upon a most reputable body of men.</P>
    <P>I want to deal shortly with Section 45.  Again, it is quite possible to talk with moderation about this section and to call it stupid and to call it unconstitutional and to regret that the Minister should follow or attempt to follow or attempt to make the courts follow the system which evidently has recently been installed in the Army of using only Irish appellations, much to the distress of many officers and to the disrepute of the Irish language among many Irishmen who have the honour of having a commission in the Army of our country.</P>
    <P>In regard to subsection (1) of Section 45, the Minister must be convinced by now that it is absolutely unconstitutional, that you have Article <Col N="1103" /> 34 of the Constitution saying one thing and Section 45 (1) of this Bill trying to say something else.  It is unconstitutional to try to force somebody to address the Chief Justice as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; but not unconstitutional to try to force people to call all other judges &ldquo;Breithiúna&rdquo; but it is most unrealistic.  It is most unrealistic to suggest that every witness who goes into court is going to remember he is breaking the law if he says &ldquo;your lordship&rdquo; or &ldquo;sir&rdquo; or anything except &ldquo;A Bhreithimh.&rdquo;  Efforts of this nature are doing more damage to the language than anything that could be done by any Sassenach that would like to come in and try to destroy the growth of the language.</P>
    <P>If we are going to call a judge &ldquo;A Bhreitheamh&rdquo; are we going to have a glossary of terms for &ldquo;for your lordship,&rdquo;&ldquo;with your lordship,&rdquo;&ldquo;from your lordship&rdquo;?  Can we say all these things in English but must we call him when we stand up on our feet in court &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; and must every unfortunate witness who comes into court do the same thing and go back into the Béarla afterwards and say &ldquo;for your lordship&rdquo; or &ldquo;if your lordship&rdquo;?  For heaven's sake let us be practical and sensible in this House where I can call a Deputy &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Teachta.&rdquo;  Surely it is equally sensible that I should be able to go into court and call a judge &ldquo;your lordship&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Bhreithimh.&rdquo; I would suggest to the Minister that he should quietly forget about that section in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that some people sitting behind the Minister have similar views on this matter.  I do not wish to appear as an enemy of the Irish language.  I am not any such thing and I do not want anybody else in this country to be any such thing but the Minister and others on the Front Bench are going to do the language a great deal of damage by insisting on this sort of ridiculous, stupid and, in this case, unconstitutional, lip-service to a language which we should all be <Col N="1104" /> glad to encourage in sensible, practical ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may offer another layman's contribution to this debate which has been taken up practically exclusively by lawyers, it may be a help to them to see themselves as we outsiders, laymen, see them.  It may help to curb the natural narcissist tendencies which are always seen in the professions whether medical, legal or anything else, and show them that the outsider's, the layman's, opinion of the courts is probably much different from the one they have.</P>
      <P>There are a few points which relate mostly to Part V of the Bill.  Apparently, with the exception of the appointment of a President of the District Court, which seems to be, listening to the lawyers at any rate, a very desirable inclusion in the Bill, there seems to be little change, at least of any significance, in the other provisions of the Bill.  In Part V, however, there are certain provisions to which I should like to refer, which concern to a considerable extent this question of titles.</P>
      <P>The Minister has concerned himself with the new titles for the judiciary. I would like to draw his attention to a defect in the court procedure which was first referred to in this House, to my knowledge at any rate, by a very respected Deputy, Deputy Dan Breen, on an occasion about two years ago when he pointed out the apparent disrespect with which the ordinary civilian is treated in the courts by the lawyers in particular.  On the whole I think judges and justices treat the laymen in the courts with reasonable respect, but there is the practice in the courts of dropping the prefix &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; before the surname of the person.  While the lawyers are very conscientious about addressing one another in the most pretentious and flowery language&mdash;&ldquo;my learned and distinguished colleague,&rdquo; and so on&mdash; they tend to drop this politeness when it comes to the civilian, particularly where the civilian in court is not a very wealthy person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of titles is an <Col N="1105" /> absurd one.  It is silly that we have to discuss it at all, but when we are discussing it we should consider the question of the main in the street when he is in court.  In his ordinary day-to-day business transactions in industry or other business activities, it is possible for him to be accorded this simple prefix &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; to his surname. The Minister should seriously consider whether he should try to ensure that the lawyers in court would accord this simple privilege to the man in the street.  He might say that it should be left to the good sense of the court. We have done that for 100 or 200 years and so far they have not got around to doing it.  I am sorry Deputy Breen is not here to support my plea in this regard because I remember his speaking with very great feeling on this matter.  He himself had been subjected to this discourtesy in court and he rightly resented it very much.  If they behave in that manner towards a person like Deputy Breen I am certain they behave in the same manner, if not worse, towards less respected citizens in our society.</P>
    <P>This practice may be carried out unconsciously but in the beginning there was a conscious idea behind it. We have it to some extent in the medical profession.  One finds it in the wards of hospitals.  The private patient is given the prefix &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; while it is dropped in the case of the public or non-paying patient.  It is, of course, the remains of the old social distinctions between the classes.  The legal profession are very conscious of these distinctions and jealous of prefixes and titles where it concerns themselves.  If they are so conscientious in retaining their own titles I do not think they should be allowed to continue to treat the ordinary person in the court with the disrespect which they offer at present.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point which Deputy McQuillan and myself have raised on a number of occasions.  It is the question of guards of honour for members of the judiciary in the courts on circuit.  This again is a hang-over from the old days when the judge was a hated person.  Then there was considerable justification for this <Col N="1106" /> practice, but the necessity for protection no longer exists.  There is not now this conflict between the judiciary and the people and this is part of the pretentious and unnecessary paraphernalia of the old establishment. The Guards are busy men.  Most of them have plenty of important work to do in protecting the people and preventing crime.  They could be better employed than standing around, often in miserably cold conditions, waiting for the judge to come along in order to escort him to the court.  This unnecessary precedure should be done away with.</P>
    <P>There is one other consideration which occurs to me as a layman, that is the absurd and archaic dress of members of the judiciary generally.  This is yet another hang-over from the old days.  The British still have this tradition of wigs and gowns of various lengths and various qualities, silk, cotton or linen; some wigs are curly and some are straight.  I can understand the British carrying on this old tradition, but I do not see why we cannot get rid of it.  The main reason for this practice was that the judiciary were dealing with illiterate people and sought to create a feeling of fear or tension between judges and the people and to perpetuate the difference that Deputy Booth wants to maintain between them.</P>
    <P>I do not accept his view that the judge is not to be considered as one of us.  Nothing in the world can make him anything else but one of us.  Where does one stop in this business?  Is a district justice one of us?  Is it the High Court judge or the circuit court judge who is not to be one of us? Which of the Supreme Court judges is not going to be one of us?  Are they going to be men apart?  Will they go to different cinemas, different public houses, different race meetings, enjoy themselves in different ways merely because one or other of the political Parties makes them judges?  That is a completely absurd suggestion.  It must be realised that it is not the individual that is important in this connection; it is the law that is important; it is the administration of the <Col N="1107" /> law that is important.  Respect for the law&mdash;I can go along with that 100 per cent, but this fealty to an individual I do not understand at all.  To suggest that a man cannot dispense justice or fight a case in court without a false head of hair is absurd.</P>
    <P>One of the few changes made was made here in the Dáil when we were establishing the positions of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle. We left him as he was and any suggestion now that we should put a false head of hair on him or give him a wig would meet a chorus of objection, including, I am sure, an objection from the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle themselves.  The idea would be ridiculed out of the House.  But we can respect the Ceann Comhairle and observe their rulings to the best of our ability and I do not think they have any great difficulty in keeping order in the House and winning our respect without that kind of dress.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable thing that when youngsters wear remarkable cloths, drainpipe trousers and Edwardian coats &mdash;poor devils trying to express themselves&mdash;they are pilloried and headlined in the newspapers.  They are accused of all sorts of crimes and kept out of dance halls because they wear these cloths.  Yet we see these old men who should have more sense going round in these absurd garments, lawyers and members of the judiciary, wearing these extraordinary clothes which would get them locked up if they were seen wearing them in Grafton Street.  If they go up on the Bench we say it gives them special authority which they would not otherwise have. I think it is about time we used some sense in this matter.  The American judges and lawyers do not wear wigs in court.  They may wear gowns and to that I do not very much object although I do not think it is necessary. These lawyers talk to the judges and have evidently the same respect and regard for the judges and for their decisions as our lawyers have for our judges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> It seems a pity that we should try to continue to perpetuate the idea that the judge should be sort of bogey-man to frighten the poor fellow in the dock and a pity also that the barristers should wear wigs as if that would make certain that justice would be done.  This curious clothing and headgear contributes nothing to ensure that justice will be dispensed by the members of the judiciary or that the cause of justice will be fought any better by the lawyers.  The best proof of that is that the greatest criminals in the country were probably the members of the judiciary in the old days, the people whose habits we have adopted, whose wigs we continue to wear.  It did not stop there.  They went to the extent of outraging the most elementary principles of justice and making a travesty of the laws they were supposed to administer.</P>
    <P>The Minister or the legal profession could think up a better reason for continuing this practice of wearing this archaic clothing in the performance of their duties.  Perhaps the lawyers could apply their legal, forensic and dialetic skills in that direction.  I am glad to see that the medical profession are tending to become a little less hidebound in this matter and do not find it necessary to go around in top hats and tail coats and I am sure are none the worse as doctors for that.</P>
    <P>As regards the titles, the cases has been made by people much abler than I and with much greater knowledge. This is so soon after the rejection of the Electoral Act in the High Court that I feel slightly sorry for the Minister that he should have this provision here.  Apparently, it is quite clear that this provision is unconstitutional, making it mandatory that the Chief Justice or the justice shall be addressed in Irish.  It is wrong that there should be this compulsory clause&mdash;&ldquo;shall be addressed in court.&rdquo;  There should be an English alternative and I hope the Minister will see that it is provided.</P>
    <P>This compulsory clause it seems is symptomatic of a bad attitude to the language, that compulsion is the only way to get the language spoken. Forty years of that policy of compulsion must have shown the most <Col N="1109" /> dedicated believer in the idea that it will not work.  It is an extraordinary misjudgment of the members of the Bar who are, if anything, a more independent-minded body of men than the medical profession, and it is an outrageous feat of wishful thinking to suggest that merely by passing a section of a Bill here we will get all the members of the Bar to become Irish speakers to this extent overnight. And it must be overnight because, as far as I can see, it is mandatory on them to use the Irish titles and they do not have any alternative.</P>
    <P>If they had wanted to use Irish titles they had forty years in which to do so: they have not done so and it is now proposed to make them do it. I do not think the Minister will succeed and, of all people, the Minister should not have allowed himself to be put in this very awkward situation from his point of view because obviously he is not going to get away with it.  I should be completely behind the lawyers in that.  They should be given an English alternative and the word &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; suggested by Deputy Sherwin, is to me certainly an acceptable one.  We use it here occasionally addressing the Chair and I think it does not derogate from the diginity of the office at all.  It is a title which everybody has accepted as being one applied to a person for whom one has a certain regard and respect.  The trouble is the compulsory aspect of it, the one most repugnant to most of us. It is sad that the generation which is most dedicated to the language has not yet understood that the emotional overtones which were associated with the language revival movement and which moved most of them to learn the language&mdash;the protest against British occupation&mdash;have not been carried through into the next generation; compulsion certainly is not an alternative.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to maintain the present position in relation to the language we shall be lucky, but certainly the imposition of compulsory clauses of this nature in relation to the courts is not going to be effective. We must find out from the Minister <Col N="1110" /> what is the penalty.  I do not see any penalty referred to for those who refuse to accept the Irish titles.  Is a lawyer or is a member of the public who refuses or is unable to use the Irish title&mdash;it is quite a difficult term, &ldquo;A Phríomh Bhreithimh&rdquo;&mdash;to be penalised?  Is the layman who can not get round the intricacies of it going to be treated as being in contempt of court and punished?  What is going to happen to the member of the Bar? Is he going to be disbarred?  Is he going to be refused admission to the Court until he learns to use these words?  I think it is a most unfortunate provision.</P>
    <P>It would have been made perfectly acceptable to me by putting in whatever the Minister likes in Irish and having a simple alternative name. Certainly whether we pass this here or not, it will be, as has most of the compulsory Irish legislation that has been passed here, ignored.  I do not know whether I am in order in discussing the system of appointments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point that I have raised on other occasions.  I have never understood why there has not been some system of appointment established for members of the judiciary whereby the best qualified lawyers will find their way on to the Bench. I do not think there is any doubt in anybody's mind at the moment that, with a few exceptions, most of the appointments to the Bench are made on a political basis.  There are a number of fine judges who have been appointed on a political basis but, in relation to most of the other professions, the attitude of the State is that we want to get the best possible and best qualified doctor, architect or <Col N="1111" /> engineer for the public services.  In order to do that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was responsible for&mdash;it was one of its few notable achievements&mdash;the establishment of the Appointments Commission which is one of the fairest operating bodies that one can see.  I do not think it should be outside the bounds of the ingenuity of the members of the Government, or the civil servants who advise them, to devise some system whereby the judiciary are appointed in some way under which we will be certain that the appointments are completely independent of any political bias.</P>
      <P>It must be technically wrong that the Government of the time should have the exclusive function of nominating individual lawyers to the Bench. It clearly must lead to abuses; it is not easy to demonstrate the abuses, but they are abuses which cannot be in the best interests of the administration of justice in the courts.  It is obvious that the judge who is appointed by a political Party must feel a certain loyality to that Party.  This could tend to colour his decisions in the courts, whether they are on an issue which is being advocated by a lawyer who belongs to the same political organisation as himself or whether he is called upon to make a decision of political importance affecting the future activities or prosperity of the organisation to which he belongs.</P>

      <P>One of these Bills, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, is an enormous measure.  There are 56 sections with, I believe, seven schedules. It sets out to do a lot and apparently the only section that has come under fire is Section 45&mdash;the part of the Bill that sets out the style of address: &ldquo;The Chief Justice shall be addressed in court as `A Phríomh Bhreithimh' and each other Judge and each Justice of the District Court shall be addressed in court as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; and where a court consists of more than one judge they shall be addressed as &ldquo;A Bhreithiúna&rdquo;. Now, altogether it must be a fairly satisfactory piece of legislation when the only section that has been severely criticised by the lawyer members of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;and there are many of them as we know&mdash;is Section 45.  Many of them have expressed concern because it is proposed to abolish forms of address like &ldquo;My lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;if your lordship pleases&rdquo; and &ldquo;may it pleased your lordship&rdquo;, and all the rest of the unctuous ballyhoo handed down to us from the days of the &ldquo;Red Robes&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hanging Assizes&rdquo;, and the other trappings that the British left behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say but very little on this Bill.  I agree with it in general but because of the views that have been expressed on one particular portion of it it is obvious that there are two views, one from the left and one from the right.  I would agree with the view expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne that whether we give the judges their titles in English or in Irish the question still remains: what will their judgments be?  It is more important for us to remember, and again I agree with Dr. Browne in this respect, that we have too much nonsense in our courts between the wigs and the gowns.  We should be more realistic in our approach in bringing these people back to earth.  We should let them understand that their knowledge and the positions they hold, the barristers as well as the judges, are at the service of those for whom they are pleading, the plaintiffs and the defendants, and that it is more important that they should act in a more natural manner.</P>
      <P>It is quite true to say that we are merely copying the procedure in Britain.  Could we not forget that? If we did forget it and if we broke away from that system, we would be doing much more important work than arguing about whether we are to give them their titles in Irish or in English.  I agree with the principle of the Bill but I say it is about time that the Minister for Justice should make these people understand that we should have less trouble in our courts with the wigs and the gowns.  The ordinary people who run the country are panic-stricken and horror-stricken by the appearance of these people in their wigs and gowns and it is time that all that was dropped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNJByrne" hpid="Mr. T. Byrne Mr. T. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Ó Ceallaigh has left the House <Col N="1118" /> because, initially, I would like to say how nice it is to hear Irish spoken by such a competent speaker as he. Having said that I would plead with him that he should drop the emotional approach to the question of reviving the language.  I am always remainded of Edmunde Burke's definition of emotion as the seducer of reason by the rabid enthusiasm and utter irrationalism of the approach to Section 45 of the Bill before us.  I regret that the Minister has permitted the inclusion of Section 45 in this Bill. He is a man of the utmost commonsense and I do not believe that he can really have any heart for it.</P>
      <P>He must be convinced, as all of us are, that compulsion of this nature will not inculcate any love or respect of the language amongst those who are not willing to be coerced.  If any citizen does not wish to address a judge as &ldquo;A Bhreighimh&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Phríomh Bhreithimh&rdquo; why should we force him to do so?  It is regrettable that we should have to waste time discussing a matter of this nature because the whole thing is deplorably nonsensical.</P>
      <P>The tradition of the courts has served only to instil respect for law and the judges in the people.  The British occupied this country for many centuries but we should not lose our heads about matters such as this and we should face up to the fact that there are some things which they have left behind which are not so bad at all. We should face a up to the fact that there are, in the British mode of civilisation, some things which we can imitate to our dignity and advantage. We are all familiar with the farcical procedure in Government correspondence of having the introduction of a letter in Irish with the words &ldquo;a chara,&rdquo; the body of the letter in English and the conclusion in Irish, &ldquo;Is mise le meas.&rdquo;  The average person does not understand the introduction or conclusion but that is beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This mode of address the Minister is inflicting on the Courts is obviously something that the Bar Council are not in favour of.  It is regrettable that they have not been consulted on the <Col N="1119" /> matter.  I want to add my voice to the protests that have been made about this further effort to coerce us and to inflict compulsion on our litigants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke about what he termed the amount to trivia in the Minister's opening speech.  He told us that later on he would make a calculation of how much of that speech was devoted to trivia and how much to fundamental matters.  I think on this side the Minister might be entitled to make his analysis and his calculation as to how much of the debate has been devoted to Section 45 and how much to the fundamental matters contained in this legislation.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that from an Opposition which is fairly dominated by lawyers, such as we have in this House, one would have got a reasoned contribution to this debate. In these Bills we are dealing with matters which could not be more fundamental: the establishment and constitution of our Courts.  We have among the Opposition some of the leading members of our Bar.  Surely, in that situation, the Government would be entitled to expect from the Opposition on this stage of the Bills constructive suggestions, reasoned criticism and an informative discussion on the merits of the Bills and of the main principles enshrined in them? Quite frankly, I am particularly disappointed that the Opposition have almost exclusively devoted their attention and criticism to one comparatively minor aspect of these Bills.  It forces one to the conclusion that a careful study of these important legislation has not been made opposite, and I think the Opposition could really be accussed the neglecting their duties as such in their approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the merits of the proposal itself.  Certain Deputies seemed to get the impression that this is an attempt to propagate compulsory Irish. It is nothing of the sort.  It has nothing whatever to do with the advancement of the Irish language.  We came to the <Col N="1120" /> question of examining the modes of address in the Courts.  We decided&mdash; and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying here that 90 per cent. of the people of this country will agree with us&mdash;that the form used at the moment is out of date, archaic, a hangover from the British times and unsuited to our democratic way of life.  Having come to that conclusion, having decided it was more in keeping with our democratic traditions and set up to substitute some more modern titles for the existing ones, we had to ask ourselves what would we substitute. From every point of view, from the point of view of the Construction and from the point of view of the tradition of the Brehon Laws, which we had in this country before the common law, it seemed obvious that the judges' modes of address which we should adopt should be the ones in the Bills.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the lawyers in this House to suggest that learned senior counsel will be incapable of adapting themselves to the use of these titles.  They are asking this House to believe that it would be a hardship on these men&mdash;men who are capable of interpreting the most complex statutes and of giving learned opinions on the most involved legal problems&mdash;to adapt themselves suddenly to the new mode of addressing judges we suggest in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very natural about the present mode of address.  Deputies spoke about compulsion.  They said we were going to compel people in court, witnesses and barristers, to use these new forms.  Surely they are compelled at the moment to use the existing forms, which, if anything, are less natural than the ones we propose? &ldquo;My lord&rdquo; and so on come from the time when judges were in fact lords and promotion to the Bench ordinarily brought a title with it.  To-day it is the use of the existing forms that is unnatural.  Apart from this, they offend against most people's ideas of democratic courts.  If there is any compulsion, it is in compelling the people who have access to the courts at present to use the existing unnatural forms rather than the ones we propose. <Col N="1121" /> We propose now to call judges by what they are.  &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; means &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;; and &ldquo;A Bhreithiúna&rdquo; means &ldquo;Judges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The argument as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the proposals was, I think, the most fantastic argument advanced.  Deputy Lindsay attempted to suggest that the very fact we are insisting on Irish usage only was unconstitutional.   I am not a constitutional lawyer by a long shot, but I think I can very easily demolish Deputy Lindsay on that particular ground by pointing out to him that Article 8. 3. of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>Provision may, however, be made by law for the exclusive use of either of the said languages for any one or more official purposes either throughout the State or in any part thereof.</P>
    <P>It is crystal clear that what we are proposing to do in this Bill is absolutely within the provisions of the Constitution.  Lawyer Deputies have concentrated their attack on this proposal exclusively on the ground that we are going to compel the Bar to do this&mdash;that this was being forced on the Bar without consultation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that the Government, in its approach to this matter, was not so much concerned with the Bar as with the people who use the courts.  The barristers do not own the courts, nor are the courts their private preserve.  These are the people's courts where the people can go to get justice.  The Bar are privileged to be allowed practise in these courts.  No one has a greater admiration for the Irish Bar than myself, but I refuse to be bamboozled about it.  I want to look at the thing in its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>The Bar are a profession like any other profession.  They practice the law in the people's courts but, basically and fundamentally, the courts belong to the people and the people go to them to secure justice.  I repeat that in prescribing this matter the Government is primarily concerned <Col N="1122" /> with the people who have to attend the courts and address the judges.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan criticised the Government for the fact that we were bringing in these Bills without there being any real demand for them. Where was the necessity, he asked, for these Bills.  To my knowledge, Deputy McGilligan in this House over the past few years asked the Minister on several occassions when these Bills were to be introduced.  Surely there is an inconsistency there.  By putting down questions on these matters, surely he has given the impression that this legislation was necessary.  Yet, when we do bring in a Bill of this sort, he asks whether it is really necessary, when the courts are functioning smoothly and when appointments of judges to them are being made in the normal way.  Of course, he has changed his ground at the last moment.</P>
    <P>There is no question about the necessity for these Bills.  The Constitution stipulates that courts are to be set up. For one reason or another they have not been set up until now.  The necessity for setting up these courts has been clearly in the mind of everybody since the Constitution was passed and it is just as necessary now as it was immediately after the passing of the Constitution to have these courts established. Accordingly, we are doing no more than fulfilling the obligation laid upon us by the Constitution in bringing in these Bills now.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan and others were inclined to criticise the provisions of Section 36 with regard to the President of the District Court.  I think I might at this stage reiterate what the Minister said in his opening statement with regard to the duties and functions of the proposed new President of the District Court.  He made it quite clear that there was no question of interfering with the freedom of the individual justices to impose the penalties which they consider appropriate to the particular circumstances of each case with which they have to deal.  But under this section they can have the benefit of the views and experience of other district justice in the discussions pro <Col N="1123" /> vided for in the Bill.  I think nothing could be clearer than that.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether or not the House is aware that in fact some district justices, of their own volition, have held meetings, because they realise the need for something like this.  What we are proposing to do is to give meetings of justices a statutory basis, enabling them to come together and have their discussions, not at their own expense, but at the expense of the State.  I feel quite certain that nothing but good can come from this proposal.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies who spoke were in agreement with the disciplinary proposals with regard to district justices. We all know that there has been a minority&mdash;a very small minority&mdash;of district justices who have not done their job and an effort now is being made to make them do it.  There have been cases&mdash;Deputies on all sides have mentioned them and there have been Parliamentary Questions about them&mdash; where courts were adjourned without due notice and where the public were inconvenienced by the conduct of district justices.  Apart from that there have been cases where district justices flagrantly interpreted the law in a manner which it would be very difficult to find justification for.</P>
    <P>In my own recollection there was a case where a district justice in a licensing case fined people found on the premises one penny and the publican one shilling.  Surely, that was bringing the law into contempt.  There have been district justices who have pontificated from the District Court as if they were Supreme Court judges.  There have been district justices who, in excesses of zeal, have made the application of the law more rigorous than it should be.  There have been others who have made the application of the law too lax.  Generally speaking, there is ample evidence of a need for general co-ordination in the working of the District Court.</P>
    <P>I should say in connection with this proposal that district justices will now be able to have ready access to High Court judgments and Supreme Court judgments.  These will be made readily available to them, and they will be <Col N="1124" /> able to keep the practice in their own courts in line with the practice throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the length of time the Bills were in preparation, I should like for the record to point out that the first draft of these Bills was prepared in 1950.  I admit that from 1950 to today is a long time but these are very important and very fundamental matters.  If there has been delay in bringing them in, that is not entirely a bad thing.  Now that we have got to the point of having them before the House the House can be assured that any delay incurred was in giving the matters most careful scrutiny and in trying to bring the very best possible pieces of legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>There is no validity in Deputy McGilligan's criticism to the effect that we are now providing a new way of getting rid of judges.  We are establishing courts in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  As a result of that operation, certain judicial offices will be vacated.  On the vacation of the offices, the offices will be abolished.  That cannot be a precedent because that comes about as a direct result of the establishment of the courts under the Constitution.  The courts can be established only once. Therefore, the rest of the procedure can never occur again.  So, it is clearly wrong to suggest that in these measures we are establishing a precedent which may be resorted to again for the purpose of removing judges from office.</P>
    <P>I feel a little sad at Deputy Desmond's approach to the matter.  He obviously agrees that some of the practices in the courts are archaic and outmoded and would like to see them brought into line with modern trends and modern requirements but when we are making one small attempt to do that he does not give us any support. In fact, he goes on to suggest that we should have done other things.  Whatever the merits of the other proposals that Deputy Desmond makes, such as doing away with wigs and gowns and so on&mdash;Deputy Dr. Browne wants us to do away with guards of honour&mdash;if Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Desmond take that view about the <Col N="1125" /> courts, they might have given the Government a little credit for this moderate reform which we are bringing in now with regard to modes of address.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins is also worried about the fact that the district justices would now be meeting behind closed doors.  He was shocked at the idea that they would be fixing penalties and deciding sentences there rather than in open court.  Of course, that is not so. Again, I can only repeat what the Minister said in his opening remarks, that these meetings which will be called by the President of the District Court are entirely for the purpose of enabling district justices to get together twice a year to discuss their problems and generally to co-ordinate their practices.  There will be no question of district justices fixing rules of procedure or any fixed level of fines or any standard punishments, or anything like that.  Every district justice in his own court will still exercise his individual discretion.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Lindsay, I would say that naturally a district justice will take all the circumstances into account in imposing a sentence. He will undoubtedly be influenced by the part of the country, the prosperity or poverty of the area, and so on.  All these factors, naturally, inform the mind of a district justice when he is exercising his individual jurisdiction in his court.  That will continue as heretofore and there will be no interference whatever with that.  The only thing is that they will have those meetings which I am quite certain will be very useful from the point of view of the district justices themselves.</P>
    <P>There were some points of detail made in regard to this Bill and I do not propose to deal with them in detail now.  We will, of course, be going into all the technical details of the Bills on Committee Stage.  The form the debate has taken and the fact that the Deputies who have spoken concentrated almost exclusively on a couple of minor issues proves, I think, that the Bills are sound in principle and that the House is in favour of the main principles of the Bills, <Col N="1126" /> which are, that courts in accordance with the Constitution must be established, that the existing courts should be disestablished and existing judicial offices abolished when the judges have been appointed to the new courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about that.  I shall try to co-operate but I am not a party to any such agreement.  If such an agreement were made it was not made <Col N="1127" /> officially by the Party of which I am a member.  However, I do not want to take any advantage of other speakers.</P>
      <P>Before the adjournment of this debate on the last night, I was drawing attention to the problem confronting the Cork County Council in the coming financial year.  I pointed out that increased rates are being levied in other respects and that a further imposition on the ratepayers in connection with roads will create a very serious problem. If the Minister is still determined to give his loyal support to C.I.E. in connection with the proposed close down of the railway line in West Cork the people in Cork county will be faced with an extraordinarily heavy burden in the coming year, particularly if the Minister for Local Government will not see his way to be as financially helpful to them as he has been to his own county, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>It must be evident to all of us that the Minister's approach is identical with that of the C.I.E. Board, that is, that financial considerations alone and the possibility of profits to the company are of importance.  If that is so, it is important to draw a comparison between the views of the Minister and his friends the Board of C.I.E. and the views already expressed by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and some of the proposals embodied in a report by people at least as experienced in the problems of railway management as those issuing subsequent reports. Speaking in the Dáil on 27th November, 1957 the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, at column 1050 drew particular attention to the rates and fares of C.I.E. which were then, as he said, at saturation point if not beyond it.  Many of us agreed with him on that statement on that occasion. Again to support the views expressed by the present Taoiseach on that day we have the view of those who signed the 1948 Milne Report which drew particular attention to the wisdom.  I should even say the necessity, of C.I.E. giving intermediate fares in rural areas at one penny per mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did hear the Minister stating here <Col N="1128" />&mdash;or read his contribution in the other Chamber where he also expressed these views &mdash; the advantages of the bus. However, he did not tell us the disadvantage of the bus from the financial point of view in regard to overcharging as mentioned by the present Taoiseach and as condemned by the report of 1948 when it was recommended that a penny a mile should be charged in respect of intermediate fares.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the accounts of C.I.E. as presented here to us are boosted due to over charging by C.I.E. which is being supported by the Minister. Take one area in County Cork. Workers travel daily from Rockingham to Monkstown in order to get to Rushbrooke, a distance of two miles.  C.I.E. charged nine pence on the bus for the two miles, that is 4½d. per mile, which is far removed from the recommendation of a 1d. per mile and far removed from what the just charge should be. They have gone a little further.  Because of the pressure there, they are now offering a weekly ticket to these men at 6/- a week but again the irony of it is that people who get into that bus at Rochestown and travel to Monkstown, though it is two miles each trip longer, still get it for 6/- weekly. Apparently the Minister is not interested in those charges because he says C.I.E. is flourishing.  Why would they not be when they are robbing the people on the bus routes?</P>
    <P>Let me give another example of the wonderful services of C.I.E.  In a place just beyond the town of Kinsale people were aware of a bus service passing two miles away.  They asked C.I.E. would they be prepared once a week to route the bus around their village, an extra distance of two miles.  C.I.E. said the road was not suitable.  Some of us were foolish enough to approach the Cork County Council, and the county engineer who has been dragged into this and attacked by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;did his part, improved that road and brought it up to the standard required by C.I.E.  Now when the people say to C.I.E.: &ldquo;Please give us a bus once a week,&rdquo; C.I.E. write back and say that it would be inconvenient, <Col N="1129" /> that it would upset their timetable to go two miles around this area between the old Head of Kinsale and Cork.  It is easy to see that the Minister does not know much about C.I.E. bus stops.  These are the wonders of C.I.E. that the Minister talks about.  Is he aware that through the negligence of C.I.E. some seven or eight weeks ago part of a road, the property of C.I.E., collapsed in the town of Bandon? C.I.E. had been told of the danger, but of course they were too busy plotting and planning to close all the railway lines in West Cork to bother about the danger of a road collapsing.  Thank God, it happened at a time when nobody was using it.  That is more of the history of C.I.E.</P>
      <P>We are all anxious that C.I.E. should prosper because, as a national undertaking, if it succeeds it will benefit the people as a whole.  It was because of our anxiety in that regard that early last Summer I rang the local manager of C.I.E. in Cork informing him of the position on the route between Cork and Crosshaven.  I said I knew as did everyone else that C.I.E. were overcharging because they had added mileage to the journey.  I told him of an Englishman who had come to Ireland and lived in Crosshaven and who was thinking of putting a minibus on the road.  I did not want that and I suspected that the Manager would not want it.  I asked him to measure the distance and see where they were overcharging.  What happened?  I am still waiting for a reply but of course C.I.E. are still charging the same fares.  This is the wonderful bus service the Minister talks about that will stop at people's doors to pick them up.  They do&mdash;at very high prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may still say the weekly tickets have been reduced on the roads &mdash;no thanks to C.I.E.  When they increased fares some of us drew attention to it at the time.  Does the Minister know why they had to reduce the weekly fares, at least in areas around Cork?  Deputy MacCarthy will know of it.  The Minister may well look behind because Deputy MacCarthy has stood loyal in this matter.  The people from Crosshaven and Carrigaline coming in to work in Cork found they were being robbed by these increased fares and <Col N="1130" /> they decided it was better for them to travel in a car belonging to a friend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Include Bandon in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The result was that morning and evening between Cork and these places every car on the roads was full.  Then the financial wizards of C.I.E. realised their mistake and told us they were making such great profits that they were being extra generous &mdash;with the full support of the present Minister, no doubt&mdash;and were offering reduced fares.  They should have been honest enough to say as the present Taoiseach said in 1957 that they had gone beyond the saturation point and found the demand in regard to bus travel is governed by the price the people can pay.</P>
      <P>The present Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on 27.11.57, at Col.  105, drew particular attention to the fact that the elimination of the services on these branch lines would not make any financial difference to C.I.E.  The figures submitted by C.I.E. themselves at the time showed that the cost of the railway service was £8 million, whereas it would be £11 million by road.  The Minister may say we are wrong.  He had that answer last week. It was a grand one&mdash;just like a person sticking a pin in the list of horses for the Lincoln to-day&mdash;C.I.E. had a new costing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  And if C.I.E. ever want to make a raid again we shall probably be told that they have another new costing system.  The Minister should examine the system carefully and not try to pull the wool over the eyes of the people by saying C.I.E. have a new costing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, I drew attention to the fact that in the costings of C.I.E.&mdash;which, according to the Minister, are not correct&mdash;they found that for every £1 of gross receipts they paid 4/- for maintenance by rail.  2/3 by bus and 2/5 by lorry.  Naturally, the Minister said: <Col N="1131" />&ldquo;Why should C.I.E. use the railways if the roads are cheaper.  Are they not as much entitled to use the roads as other users?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That may be so, but it is necessary to compare the mileage of roads here against the mileage in England and Scotland.  That was shown in the Milne Report.  In this country we have 1,633 road miles per 100,000 of the population.  In England they have 360 and in Scotland 520.  Closing down these branch lines inevitably means extra transport on the road. May I ask the Minister, who is always interested in the economic side of every discussion, what part of the overall cost is being contributed by the owners of vehicles?</P>
      <P>We all know that with the cost of modern maintenance of roads the amount contributed by the owners of vehicles is only part of the overall amount that must be provided.  In West Cork, in closing down the railways the Minister said: &ldquo;Put on the C.I.E. lorries.&rdquo; Is not that in itself encouraging other sections of the community that are able to do so to secure more lorries?  We are building up a vicious circle and encouraging those now using road transport in West Cork to go deeper into it, to buy bigger and heavier vehicles.  That is happening everywhere.  Not many years ago the six- or seven-ton lorry was considered a fairly big vehicle. Now, with trailers it is no trouble to them to carry 20 or 30 tons.  Naturally the result is that the roads suffer as compared with the traffic in the past but the Minister is not worrying about the cost of road upkeep in County Cork, no more than are the people on the board of C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why the Minister glossed over this subject.  That is why the Minister came in here and expressed in a most vicious manner criticism of responsible officials in County Cork for presenting an honest figure here for comparison purposes.  He went out then in the other House on a line of his own, showing what the cost would be to the people.  I do not worry <Col N="1132" /> about what the Minister said there, but it is time the Minister understood one thing&mdash;that is, that he is helping C.I.E. to make profits for themselves &mdash;so-called profits&mdash;solely at the expense of the people in County Cork. We object to that.</P>
    <P>I do not know just at the moment the total number of C.I.E. lorries, but because so much of this is based on the position of C.I.E. in 1948 I think it is essential to make a comparison between the position then and the improvement afterwards, between 1948 and 1957 and 1958.  On the 29th August, 1948, C.I.E. had 573 lorries taxed.  In that week, as recorded by C.I.E. themselves, the daily average of lorries idle was 80.  Out of 573 taxed lorries, because of break-downs and so forth, there was an average of 80 idle.  Add to that 219 untaxed lorries.  Now, having a total fleet of 762 lorries, C.I.E. had 219 untaxed or 29 per cent of the fleet in the last week of August 1948.  If we add to that the average of 80 idle lorries it shows that there were 38 per cent of the fleet ready to cover fluctuation.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the position is now. Is it because C.I.E. find themselves with a few lorries to spare; is it because in a few different parts of the country they think they can rope in enough lorries of the type Deputy Manley mentioned here last week that C.I.E. believe now that by dumping these down in Cork to meet the situation that may arise in West Cork, and other affected areas, that will help them? Of the fleet of 762 lorries at the time mentioned there were 93 over 12 years old; there were 302 up to 12 years old; and 367 up to 4 years old.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us now, of course, that all that must be forgotten, that C.I.E. are now showing a wonderful change in their accounts, but it is only since 1958 that these began to materialize and, in the last year, things were really wonderful, thanks to the Bill introduced apparently by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, and thanks, too, apparently to the ability of the people on the Board.  No credit is given for the work done from 1948 when this report was presented <Col N="1133" /> to the House, and for the amount of money spent as capital on the improvement of C.I.E. from that up to 1954 when dieselisation was introduced as a further help to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want to mention that.  He just wants to speak of the last twelve months.  Of course, in 1948 we saw another side of the picture, a side which undoubtedly was not beneficial to C.I.E. in relation to the possibility of making profits.  In July of that year, under old agreements, they had to sign for the purchase of 500 monstrously heavy Leyland lorries.  It was a good job they did not get them all.  I am sure the Minister knows as well as I do that they were the most unsuitable type of lorry that could be put on the road here.  The Minister may want to forget the fact that many a merchant in parts of Cork who did not have the opportunity of getting his merchandise by rail, who had to depend on C.I.E. monsters and matadors was paying dearly for it because the costings of C.I.E. then showed that, in order to secure their profits, no matter how small the little parcel may have been or how big the load, they passed the cost and added the profits on to the running cost of lorries which should never have been put on the road here.</P>
    <P>In England, of course, they were wise.  They had a fleet which was composed of lorries and vans of much lower weight than these monstrous Leylands.  They had Austins and Bedfords, and so forth.  But the irony of it was that these lorries and vans cost on an average £650 each whereas our agreement with Leylands made us pay £1,600 to £1,700 for each of the monsters of lorries planked on us here because of this agreement with Leylands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the 1959 report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  The present financial position of C.I.E. is to a large extent based on the capital expenditure of the board between 1951 and 1954, and 1954 and 1957 but the Minister will not give credit for that.  The Minister may now wish that some of these things should not be said.  The Minister was very gullible in this House and even more so in the other House, where <Col N="1134" /> perhaps the members are more refined and more respectful than some of us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, indeed they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, he came up and told them that the disgraceful people of West Cork made no proposals; he got very few complaints he said; nobody offered any suggestions. The Minister knows that is all wrong. The Minister surely knows of all the important proposals and recommendations submitted to C.I.E. by important organisations in West Cork.  No wonder he shakes his head.  I suppose the Minister was around Europe looking at transport systems when these recommendations were going in to C.I.E.  The answer C.I.E. gave to all the recommendations and proposals was that the manager&mdash;the other manager&mdash;was looking into them.  The Minister knows as well as I do that that manager never bothered his head since.</P>
      <P>What strikes me most forcibly is the set-up of the figures submitted by C.I.E. in connection with the accounts that we are now discussing because strangely enough many of these recommendations were submitted in the Milne report of 1948.  There were 40 or 50 recommendations altogether. With some of them we might not agree. Some of them were very wise.  Apparently the present Board were aware of the usefulness of some of the recommendations. It was recommended in the 1948 Report that there should be a reconstruction of the balance sheet, with effect from January, 1945; that reconstruction would have the effect of turning a debit balance of £811,901 into a credit balance of approximately £75,000.  The Minister is aware that the Milne Report was not satisfied with the amount allocated for depreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know what happened in the interim.  Things went on more or less in their own careless fashion. Then the Minister's Board got down to work.  I am entitled to assume that many of the recommendations in the Milne Report were accepted and helped in no small measure to get C.I.E. out of the red by improving their financial position.  The Minister <Col N="1135" /> may say that did not happen until last year.  We know it did not happen until last year and we will show where the money went between the years 1950-1954 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play in the other House about the number of people travelling on the West Cork railway.  He said it was not fit to be described as a railway.  Let me give my own experience.  A few years ago I had occasion to use the West Cork railway.  The train left at 8.30 a.m. and there was a train out from Cork at six or half past six in the evening.  At the same time C.I.E. buses were running in competition with the railway.  The buses started from Parnell's Place which is much nearer to the centre of the city.  Whose fault was it if the people used the buses instead of the railway?  Apparently the Minister has not seen fit to query that.  Apparently he is quite satisfied with everything presented to him by the Chairman and the Board of C.I.E. That scandalous duplication of services was operated by C.I.E. with one train back out in the morning and one train back in the evening people had very little choice.</P>
    <P>The Minister is acutely anxious that we should be grateful to C.I.E. in regard to the figures presented to us. I admit there is a three per cent. increase in traffic.  I admit that any increase is a help.  What of all these items which were originally part of the recommendations of the 1948 Report?  In my opinion these recommendations were put into operation last year in a very clever manner.  The Minister proudly informs us that C.I.E. losses in 1959-60 were £709,000; in the year 1958-59 they were £1.2 millions more; in the year 1957-58 they were £1.6 millions more as compared with last year.  Why would they not be?  C.I.E. were building up a service which could not be expected to show profits straight away. They were improving&mdash;they believed they were&mdash;their general condition.</P>
    <P>There are some items here which I wish to question.  At column 1231 of the Official Report of the Seanad for <Col N="1136" /> 15th March, 1961, the Minister enumerates the four questions he posed to the Chairman of C.I.E.: (1) Was the Chairman absolutely satisfied with the depreciation allowed?  (2) Was he satisfied that sufficient allowance for maintenance had been made?  (3) Had maintenance decreased as a result of the closure of branch lines?  (4) Had a large amount of maintenance works been completed?  The Minister proudly informed his listeners that he got a positive answer from the Chairman.  We will see now what that positive answer means.</P>
    <P>Accepting the figure of £709,000 as the final figure, the Minister realises, of course that the questions he propounded to the Chairman of C.I.E. were directed, first of all, towards maintenance and works.  In the accounts for last year we find a reduction on maintenance and works of £267,000.  In connection with fuel consumption, as a result of dieselisation, there is a reduction of £133,000. Depreciation was referred to in the 1948 Report and the present Board obviously thought they had a way out. They took full cognisance of their rights and slashed depreciation.  It came down by £100,000.  Incidentally, the life of diesel coaches and engines is based on a 20-year period and they figured out from that that they could afford to do with £100,000 less in the depreciation account.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction of £50,000 in the Board's contribution to the workers' superannuation scheme.  I wonder what part of that is accounted for by the fact that there are 1,000 fewer people employed on the railways. With a lower wages bill of £500,000, plus all the other items, we get a total of £1,050,000.  That was a nice tidy sum for C.I.E. to show, but it was not provided by increased revenue or extra commerce.  It was provided by reductions under the various headings I have mentioned.  It is grand bookkeeping. Any firm which can reduce under these headings will have no trouble in showing a profit at the end of the year.  If C.I.E. keeps on this game for another year or two they will probably be giving some money to the Road Fund to keep the roads <Col N="1137" /> going.  The Minister must know that that cannot go on all the time.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the Minister, the Chairman and members of the Board of C.I.E. were ashamed or afraid to meet the different organisations and the men in public life in South and West Cork and His Lordship, the Bishop of Cork, to show how they arrived at that figure of £56,000 loss on the West Cork line?  Are they afraid to come out in the open and show that?  They had no trouble in producing figures that suited themselves in their last report but they have no answer to the unfortunate people who asked to meet them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the people were dictators.  I know who the real dictators are in this case.  They are the Minister and the Chairman of C.I.E. There is pure undiluted dictatorship for you.  They have entirely ignored the reasonable requests of the people whose livelihood is involved. It is late in the day for the Minister to come to this House and say that the 1958 Act went through without any undertaking that C.I.E. would give a fair hearing to local interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused, and backed C.I.E.'s refusal, to give any information to the people of West Cork about this so-called loss of £56,000.  However, speaking in the Seanad on the 15th March, 1961, in column 1228, the Minister is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>It is up to C.I.E. to apportion the overhead costs over the whole system if they so desire.</P>
    <P>That is a nice answer to give.  That is the answer that would have been given to the people of West Cork if the Minister or the Chairman of C.I.E. had allowed them to go to their offices. Will the Minister say what part of the costs are apportioned to West Cork to show the loss of £56,000?  Speaking in the Seanad on the same day the Minister said:</P>
    <P>C.I.E. have no special obligation to split up and try to separate the overhead costs in regard to one part as against another.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary statement for the Minister to make, that there is no <Col N="1138" /> obligation upon C.I.E. to try to separate the overhead costs.  No wonder we find ourselves in the appalling position that we are in at the present time, trying to make a case for the retention of a line when the economics of that line are not shown to the people.  The Minister tells us that it is not our business to know what way the costs are apportioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>They gave it in their report in a general way but they were afraid to meet the deputation from West Cork and give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not tell the public.  They were afraid to meet the people on the deputation and to show them how the loss amounted to £56,000 even with their great new costing system.  The Minister, speaking in the Seanad, and referring to the wonderful improvement in C.I.E., spoke of the massive operations involving a great many people.  The Minister forgets that 1,200 people are not now in the employment of C.I.E. Some people have been speaking of the pensions of these men.  I will give three cases of married men who are now on the redundant list of C.I.E. and in receipt of those pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is a married man with a wife and one child whose rent is 23/9d. a week.  The next is also a married man with a wife and child whose rent is 17/6d. a week and the third is a married man with a wife and child whose rent is 7/8d. a week.  Their pensions vary from 23/6d. to 36/- a week.  That is nice when they have the rent paid for their houses and it is not a very great consolation to them to know that the reports of C.I.E. show that they are progressing at a time when these men are only getting from 23/6d. to 36/- a week.  Worse than that is the case of the man who is getting 36/- a week.  C.I.E. offered to buy a quarter of his pension for a capital sum of £405.  That would <Col N="1139" /> mean that they recognised that his pension of 36/- would be equal only to about 17 years' outlay.  The men who are now redundant and who are getting from 23/- to 36/- a week are now in the happy position of knowing the wonderful improvement being made with the introduction of the costing system of which we hear so much from the Minister and the Chairman. I am sorry if I am keeping other Deputies from speaking, but I shall do my best to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>Whatever agreement was made I know nothing about it.  I want to make that quite clear. To go back to the wonderful methods in operation in C.I.E., I suppose the Minister is proud when he sees the big advertisement &ldquo;Anything, anywhere, any time.&rdquo;  I suppose that advertisement has relation to the package deals brought in by C.I.E., the package deals that the people of West Cork were not interested in because C.I.E. did not bother about them.</P>
      <P>To draw attention to the wonderful package deals of C.I.E. and the momentous success the Minister speaks about, I have here the latest copy of <i>Nuacht</i>, a little paper from C.I.E., dated March, 17th.  There is a paragraph here under the heading &ldquo;Anything, Anywhere, Anytime.&rdquo;  It states:</P>
      <P>Remember that phone number we gave you recently, 71871?</P>
      <P>They ask the readers of this paper:</P>
      <P>Do you know of any kind of usual or unusual traffic being handled by us in your area that can be translated into news and pictures which the national newspapers would publish as items of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now they are asking every railwayman in the country to let them know of anything in their area so they can get pictures and articles into the national papers, and the <i>Southern Star</i>, to show <Col N="1140" /> the wonderful improvement of C.I.E. Surely the Minister should think twice before lauding the people responsible for that policy, the Board of C.I.E.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that in the past, but this so-called national concern is now going around trying to get some little man in some little place to get a picture into the papers.</P>
      <P>I have an item here which I suggest the Minister might pass on to <i>Nuacht.</i> Perhaps it might result in getting a picture on the papers.  The Minister should have a look at what is happening outside Cork City in regard to portion of the West Cork railway threatened by this decision of C.I.E. In the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Wednesday, 22nd February, 1961, there is a short article dealing with Cork Airport and improvement of the road to it.  It states:</P>
      <P>One phase that is now being undertaken lies in the county and is being carried out by Cork County Council.  The other part is within the city boundary and is to be done by the Cork Corporation, who have at least a speculative eye on the permanent way of the threatened West Cork railway.  If the Board of C.I.E. cannot be persuaded to change their minds about closing down the West Cork railway line, Cork might have the nucleus of a perfect road from outside the city boundry right into the heart of the city.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he might get the members of the Board of C.I.E. and the staff of <i>Nuacht</i> to go down and take a couple of aerial photos of this area just inside the city boundry which apparently, if the West Cork line is to go, is to be handed over for improving the road to the airport. It is poor recompense for the people in West Cork to know that a fine road to the airport is being provided at their expense and the expense of the other people in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If C.I.E. are so anxious for news and pictures, perhaps they would publish this.  It is taken from the Milne <Col N="1141" /> Report, paragraphs 222 and 223.  It says:</P>
    <P>Branch lines are part of a national system of highways and should not be closed if their retention is necessary and desirable in the public interest, which can only be determined by holding a public enquiry.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would inform the Board of that and ask <i>Nuacht</i> to publish it for the benefit of all concerned. Then we will know that the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1957, the present Taoiseach, and the views expressed by the present Minister, were completely false and at variance with the facts.  In 1957, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce said there was no need to have it enshrined in the Bill&mdash;of course, two months would be allowed and within that time C.I.E. would meet and discuss with the local people whether or not a branch line would be closed.</P>
    <P>The Milne Report was prepared, written and signed by people who had much more knowledge of rural affairs than the people connected with the later Report, about which we heard so much, and much more knowledge than the present Chairman of C.I.E., who admits he knows nothing about transport, and the present Minister, who in spite of his trips around the Continent and of the impression he tries to give that he knows so much about it, apparently knows nothing about this extraordinary economic imposition on the people of West Cork to the detriment of the future industrial development of that area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few weeks, we have been listening to the Deputies from Cork attacking the Board of C.I.E. <Col N="1142" /> at a time when it is up to everybody to give all the help and encouragement to an undertaking set up by this House.  We must be fair to the Board of C.I.E.  We have given C.I.E. five years in which to pay its way and we all know that it has been costing the taxpayer of this country a lot of money during the years that have gone by since its establishment.  It would appear that the Deputies from Cork did not want anybody to enter the debate but themselves.  They wanted it free for Cork and Cork alone.</P>
    <P>I do not think they should be particularly proud of the case they presented to this House.  The important question before us is whether or not this railway in West Cork has been paying its way during the past few years.  The answer is that it has not. From what I can gather there have been practically no travellers on that line over a number of years.  Surely if the C.I.E. Board are to make their services pay, they must cut out uneconomic lines such as this one and encourage the lines that are paying their way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of the disadvantage to the railway of having buses running alongside the West Cork line over a number of years.  Surely must admit that the greater proportion of passengers who travelled on those buses would not have travelled by train anyhow&mdash;that if there were no buses they would prefer to hire a car rather than travel on the train. In my constituency there was a railway line which was closed down in 1935.  I lived by the side of that line and I know that it had become a ghost railway in its latter years.  I feel sure the Cork line has also become a ghost railway line.</P>
    <P>The modern system of transport by bus is much more convenient for people who avail of the public services. They can be set down or picked up at their own doorsteps.  All the Cork Deputies spoke about the sums of money they have been told by the County Engineer it would cost to bring the roads into such a condition that they would take the bus traffic. The same thing was said when the line <Col N="1143" /> in my constituency closed down in 1935 but I have not seen any great increase in the estimate for road maintenance as a result.</P>
    <P>Mind you, all this talk about the disadvantage the farmers would suffer through the closedown of this railway does not seem evident in other parts of the country.  In my constituency there is a greater preference for transport by lorry.  Produce can be picked up on the roadside near the farmers' homes with the latest methods of loading available.  If that traffic had to go by rail the farmers in many cases would have to take their produce anything up to ten miles to a railway station.</P>
    <P>I repeat it is unfair to condemn C.I.E., as the Cork Deputies have done, without giving them a fair trial. Instead of condemning C.I.E. we must give them every encouragement, in our own interest, to make their services pay.  Deputy Desmond referred to the Leyland Matador trucks used by C.I.E. I think his criticism in that respect was very unfair.  In my area C.I.E. have got a number of these trucks.  They are on the road to-day in nearly as good a condition as they were when introduced eight or nine years ago.  I do not believe that the types of truck suggested by Deputy Desmond would stand up to the same treatment.  It is well known that C.I.E. take good care of their trucks. Week by week they are taken in for overhaul so that they will not let people down on the roads.  In conclusion I would suggest that we should be more anxious to make the railways pay in the interest of the taxpayers than to criticise C.I.E. in the manner that has been done here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The West Cork issue is one more example of the manner in which C.I.E. are crippling the business of the people in the rural districts. At the moment we have no adequate service for the cattle trade. <Col N="1144" /> Heretofore, private lorries in every parish gave an excellent service.  There was no difficulty in earlier days in getting private lorries to collect cattle or pigs or sheep along the roadsides and to take them to the various markets and fairs.  There is no such service now, thanks to C.I.E. Now farmers are completely out on a limb. Perhaps C.I.E. are trying but they are not able to give the service to the rural districts that the private lorries could give.</P>
      <P>Taking Mullingar, one of the biggest cattle and sheep rearing districts in Ireland, as an instance of the inability of C.I.E. to give farmers an adequate service, I should like to tell the House that in that town C.I.E. have only three lorries.  Mullingar has a cattle fair and a cattle mart.  At the fair, stock must be in at six in the morning and in the mart at ten in the morning. C.I.E. are not able to cater for these regulations.  Heretofore, private lorries were able to have the stock in the mart at 9 a.m. and at the fair well before 6 a.m.  Two or three years ago we put up a scheme to C.I.E. that they would collect cattle for the Mullingar mart and fairs.  The farmers submitted their names to C.I.E. and in the morning C.I.E. sent out a call saying the lorry would call at 6, 7 or 8 a.m.  I am not complaining about the charges made.</P>
      <P>The charge was reasonable enough, 5/- up to five miles, 6/- up to ten miles and 7/- for 15 miles.  When we sent in the list we received a phone call at four in the evening during which it was arranged that three cattle would be taken up here, another three there and so on but we discovered later that they were not brought.  The excuse given very often is that it is not economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C.I.E. have a monopoly and should give a service to the people.  They have only three lorries in Mullingar.  To cope with a big market or fair they bring lorries from Kells or Longford or other places.  The farmer may get a postcard instructing him to have his cattle ready for collection at five in the morning.  He has to get up in the middle of the night.  That is victimisation. <Col N="1145" /> It is no wonder that people are leaving rural districts.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. cater for tourists.  Deputies from Cork are shouting about losing railways.  Where a railway line is closed down a good service is provided. It is only a short distance from Mullingar to Kells but there is no service.  C.I.E. have done more to sever north from south than any organisation.  There used to be a line from Mullingar to Cavan.  Now one has to go via Dublin.  Northern lorries used to come to every fair in the west. C.I.E. ran them out of the country. They should provide a service for the people.  If I get an order from Yorkshire for cattle I have to make arrangements with the farmers and then I may find that C.I.E. will not provide a lorry when required.  C.I.E. have an advertisement &ldquo;Any time, anywhere&rdquo;. I would ask them to take it down until such time as they buy sufficient lorries to give the service required.  It is a shame and disgrace that they should have a monopoly.  It reminds me of Hitlerism.  They have taken over the entire transport of the country and are leaving the public without a service.</P>
    <P>There was a rush to get lime delivered. Every farmer wanted lime at the same time.  I phoned Amiens Street and pointed out that a lorry would be required at Ballinasloe.  I was asked did I think that C.I.E. had lorries on the shelf.  I replied that they should have lorries on the shelf when all the private lorries had been driven out of the business.  It is no wonder that Dr. Lucey and others are talking about the position in rural districts. C.I.E. are responsible for all this.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. would not buy a map for the office in Mullingar.  They have a big map showing the main roads but no map showing the small roads.  A week ago C.I.E. sent a postcard to a farmer instructing him to have his cattle on the road at a certain time.  They told a farmer in an adjoining townland to bring his cattle a distance of five miles, although they were passing his gate.  If there had been a map of the townland available, which would not cost 5/-, that would not have happened. <Col N="1146" /> These are matters which annoy people and people will not put up with them any longer.</P>
    <P>I suggest that pens could be made out of the sleepers where cattle could be kept.  In that way plans could be made to bring cattle to the fair in Mullingar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to refer briefly to what Deputy Fagan <Col N="1148" /> said because nobody else in the debate raised the question of the transport of cattle as a matter for serious complaint.  I have had no complaints from the Mullingar area.  If the Deputy gives me a case which shows that C.I.E. are providing a bad service or an inadequate number of lorries I promise I will have it investigated but I should say in addition to C.I.E. lorries there are a thousand licensed carriers many of whom carry cattle.</P>
      <P>I am going to start by answering the detailed statements made by Deputies rather than repeating over again what was said at the initiation of this debate. It seems to me better to deal with particular matters which have been referred to here, namely, the recent closing of two railway lines and the proposed closing of the West Cork railway line.  Let me give a few facts about the West Cork railway.  In a recent period the average number of passengers carried per train on the West Cork railway was 30.  There is a bus service running alongside the line and the bus service was required for people who knew they could get down at numerous stops along the road adjoining the railway line.  I am absolutely certain if C.I.E. were to abandon that bus service Deputy Desmond would be quickly on his feet protesting against it because he would have representations made to him by people to whom the bus was preferable to the train.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the average West Cork goods train takes only 45 tons of goods.  The average goods wagon carries from 10 to 12½ tons and Deputy Wycherley calls that a railway.  That is not a railway in the modern sense of the term at all; it is a bus and lorry service compelled to go along rails and stop at frequent stopping places.  I do not think anybody could contradict that statement.  A train that carries only an average of 30 passengers and which entrains only 56 passengers at Cork station is not a train in the modern sense and cannot be so regarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The receipts on the West Cork line at a recent date were £113,000 and the <Col N="1149" /> losses were £56,000.  No overhead costs relating to the repair of stock or any other overhead costs were included in the loss.  The loss was a genuine one.  There was no stepping up of the figure for the purpose of seeing that the line was closed.  C.I.E. state they can make a saving of £54,000 by closing the railway and providing a substitute service of buses and lorries. If you lose £56,000 on receipts of £113,000, that is not a borderline loss; that is a branch railway line making a very heavy loss which would require many tens of thousands of pounds of additional traffic by way of compensation so that the railway could be profitable.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested that if C.I.E. added the gross figure of the value of beet that might be taken by the railway to the loss there would then be a profit.  The Deputy forgot to point out that the costs of carrying beet would have to be considered and the net profit of carrying any extra beet would not materially affect the loss on the line.  As I have already stated, the total loss on the three railways which we have been discussing amount to something like £80,000.  To give some other figures to show the character of these lines, the average tonnage per day, exclusive of beet, taken in goods on the West Cork line, is of the order of 170 tons; it was 40 tons on the West Clare line, and it was negligible on the Waterford-Tramore line.  The average number of passengers carried on the West Clare line on 53 miles was 353 per day.  The average number on the West Cork line on 92 miles was 400 per day.  As I have said, neither of these lines is what I call a railway.  These are really bus and lorry services forced to travel along rails.  I want to make it absolutely clear that there has been no stepping up of the costs on these lines by C.I.E.  I had an absolute assurance from the Chairman of C.I.E. that they did not want to close the lines.  They would like to keep open the maximum rail lineage in the country but they were compelled to face realities in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is very important to state that there are only two dictators in regard <Col N="1150" /> to this question of closing railway lines. First of all, the Dáil made a very definite decision that C.I.E. must pay and that it was permitted to close uneconomic lines.  Secondly, the people, and the people only, have dictated that these lines should close in those districts, by not making use of them.  It is perfectly evident that 90 per cent. of the clamour against C.I.E. is by people who do not use the railways, because if all the people who protested and signed petitions actually used the railway it would be in a better way than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are no different in this country from other countries in regard to the clamour that takes place when it is announced that a railway line is going to close.  Perhaps it is because of the prestige which formerly applied to the existence of a railway line in a district and this feeling is still retained in the minds of the people.  We have had the same experience here as in other countries of a very widespread clamour against the closing of a line. Then the line is closed and the substitute service is provided.  Within six months there are no further complaints and I am perfectly certain in the case of these lines that are now closing&mdash; and I know indeed from reports that have been made to me&mdash;that a great many of the criticisms were by those who do not use the lines.  One of the Members of the Oireachtas recently attended a protest meeting in a certain town in West Cork.  He asked all the 20 people present whether they used the railway and only one of them could pretend he used the railway line against the closing of which they were protesting.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made by Deputy Murphy that there was some sabotage action by C.I.E. with regard to the proposed closing of the West Cork line.  There was no sabotage of any description.  The package deal programme of intensive selling inaugurated by C.I.E. after the 1958 Act applied to the whole country and applied to the areas about which there has been discussion during this debate. The result in the case of West Cork was that after an intensive selling campaign <Col N="1151" /> to all the people who might be likely to give traffic to the railway the total value of the package deal was £722 in so far as the West Cork line was concerned and the total value to the service as a whole was some £1,320.  When, as a result of a package deal campaign of that kind one can only secure £722 goods traffic and over all the remainder of the country it is possible to secure very substantial traffic, all one can say is that if receipts are £113,000 at present and if the losses are £50,000 the effort to secure new traffic failed because the people did not want to avail themselves of the service offered.</P>
    <P>The commercial manager of C.I.E., I am informed, went to a number of areas where these lines were either closing or about to close.  He spoke with the business community.  He went to Clare in May of 1960 and he said he would be back in September, 1960.  He hoped that in the interval they might have some proposals for increased traffic in addition to those that might be secured in the ordinary package deal campaign.  When he came back they had nothing to offer, no proposal for increased traffic.  Yet, in other places where C.I.E. apparently served a more useful purpose to the community, in other districts throughout the country, there have been very big increases in traffic because in those districts it paid to use C.I.E.</P>
    <P>At present there are 13 industrial undertakings in West Cork.  An investigation was made by C.I.E. and it was found that out of 41,500 tons of goods moved by these 13 undertakings, only 3,200 tons were taken by C.I.E.  All efforts to secure more traffic from these undertakings failed. I should also point out that the Industrial Development Authority was consulted in regard to industries that had been mooted for West Cork and C.I.E. were informed that none would be affected by the closing of the line. Industrialists in these modern days when they examine transport facilities, consider only the cost, efficiency and frequencies of the service, and there is no longer any sentiment for a railway <Col N="1152" /> as such.  There are thousands of industries all over Europe, and in Great Britain, that have no dependence whatever on railway lines, industries that started in areas where they never considered the available communications because they were determined from the very outset to use road vehicles, either their own or lorries hired for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to point out that the people as a whole have been satisfied by the substitute services that have been provided in areas where railway lines have already closed.  Once the weekly tickets were provided on the bus services, once reasonable fares were arranged for the schoolchildren and students I had virtually no complaints of any note.  C.I.E., to date, have shown that their estimates of the additional number of buses and lorries required to replace a railway that was closed down have proved remarkably accurate.  It is also interesting to note that in certain cases buses were supplied, the traffic carried by those buses, which were adequate for the purpose, increased to a remarkable degree.  I was told that in a recent four-week period on the Cahirciveen-Tralee bus service as compared with a four-week period on the railway before the line closed the number of passengers carried has risen by 62 per cent.  Some 1,200 season tickets have been sold on that route.  C.I.E. is making a small profit on that bus service which was substituted for a rail service.</P>
    <P>I have inquired from leading traders myself when in the Kerry area as to the character of the lorry service substituted for the rail service and I was told it was excellent.  I was given a very clear intimation that the individuals running the lorry service were liked and supported by all the people of the neighbourhood and carried out their duties excellently.</P>
    <P>These dire predictions are always made that when railways close some town or other will become a ghost town.  It is just as well to mention the example of Bundoran which, we were told, would become a ghost town when the railway line from the Six Counties <Col N="1153" /> closed.  The most terrifying statements were made by everyone in the area that the town was finished.  It is very consoling to read an article in the <i>Free Press</i> in April, 1958, in which it was pointed out that the time taken for the visitors to come from Belfast was 80 to 110 minutes less than when the train service operated.  There were new bus services operating from mid-Ulster to the advantage of Bundoran. Visitors from Scotland arrived six hours earlier and there were more excursions. In fact it is quite evident that Bundoran is not suffering from the closing of the railway and has enjoyed an excellent season in spite of the weather last year.</P>
    <P>I should like to record this in view of the statements that were made at the time of the closing of West Clare Railway. It is an extract from the <i>Clare Champion</i> of 25th February this year. This is a good answer to all those who make such a desperate plea that a railway should not close.  The headline is &ldquo;A Good Job&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    <P>Even though many still mourn the loss of its railway service it is generally appreciated that C.I.E. has done a good job with its freight and passenger replacement services. Indeed, in comparison some of its new services far exceed that of the old.  Both Ennistymon and Lahinch are well provided for by a daily freight service and a half dozen or so additional buses.  In the long run the initial shock of the change-over seems by far to have been the worst.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley suggested that the C.I.E. staff over the remainder of the country should be reduced by 30 per cent.  Since his colleagues have been complaining about those who will no longer be employed on the West Cork line I think he might consult them before he puts that forward as a possible suggestion for saving the West Cork railway.  Apparently he wants other people to lose their employment in order to save a particular railway. That seems to be a rather selfish suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley also mentioned that on some previous occasion a loss of £100,000 on certain branch lines <Col N="1154" /> was mentioned.  I should make it clear that there has been a change in the costing system of C.I.E.  The observations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1957 in regard to branch lines were as a result of information that was then available to him.  There is now a much more elaborate costing system which reveals truly and accurately the value of branch lines and their contribution to main lines and it is on the basis of the new costing system that decisions have been taken by C.I.E. to close the lines which have been the subject of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond made a foolish, jeering speech about C.I.E. which I deplore but I know he feels keenly about the loss of the West Cork line. He and Deputy Manley have what I think is a feeling of out-dated sentiment about the value of a railway. They are entitled to hold their opinions but there is no use in going back to the report of the Milne Committee because the fact remains, whether or not the terms of that report were adopted, that C.I.E. has lost, in all, some £24 million since that report was published.  Moreover there was not the searching inquiry into the railway system that was carried out by what is known as the Beddy Committee and that report, so far as I know, has never been seriously criticised by anybody in this House.  Nobody has suggested that that report was not an excellent document containing valuable information and with an authentic tone.  There was no criticism of the Beddy report to speak of at the time of the discussion on the 1958 Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the rates of compensation.  I should say that they were worked out in accordance with the agreement with the trade unions and I have had very few complaints in regard to them.  There does not seem to be any great reluctance on the part of certain classes of C.I.E. workers to apply for redundancy.  In the case of the three railways that have been closed or are about to be closed, there were 279 workers in all, of whom 140 are to be retained; 122 workers received compensation which would <Col N="1155" /> total £127,800 a year.  Of course, that sum will diminish as the years go by because some of the workers are of an advanced age and that will be a gradually disappearing liability on the public purse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond criticised the services of C.I.E.  Of course they are not perfect.  The fundamental organisation commenced only after the 1948 Act came into operation.  The appointment of area managers is of very recent date. The whole of the work-study operation which is of an immensely complex character is not even completed; many of the recommendations by the experts remain to be implemented.  Many will have to be considered before they can be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the Kanturk line and asked why that was still open for certain classes of traffic. The answer is that C.I.E. made a calculation and found that to substitute the present limited occasional Kanturk service for goods would be more costly than to leave the line in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear, but they tried to close it.  That was not the case made at the inquiry in Kanturk by C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also referred to the fares charged on the bus services.  Fifteen million passengers travel on the buses and I am quite sure, if C.I.E. think it would be advantageous to reduce fares in certain cases they would do so, but they have to pay the cost of materials, wages and the operation of the buses themselves. They have to allow for depreciation and I should make it clear that the road passenger working does not show an excessive profit when all those factors are taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also cast a reflection on C.I.E. by making an analysis of the accounts in which he referred to the fact that railway receipts had increased only by 3 per cent.  He made other references to decreases that have taken place in depreciation and maintenance.  As I have already said in the Seanad, I am satisfied and have trust in the Chairman in regard to the realistic character of all charges <Col N="1156" /> upon the accounts of C.I.E.  I am satisfied that the charges have been honestly presented and have not been written down for the purpose of trying to reduce the loss on the undertaking. But I should give the real answer to many of the sneering comments made by Deputy Desmond who, I think, perhaps was overcome to some degree by his feeling of sadness at the proposed closing of the West Cork line. The best answer is that the total revenue of C.I.E. in the current year has gone up by some £963,000 up to March 8th.  That indicates there is a real growing vitality within the concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal objects of the work study programme has been to try to secure better utilisation all round of lorries, wagons and coaches, because the utilisation was found by the Beddy committee to be the lowest in Europe.  The labour cost per ton mile was three times the average in Europe.  That was one of the major jobs that had to be tackled by the work study experts who came in.  One Deputy tried to make a comparison between the loss on these C.I.E. lines and the expenditure on roads.  Well, when one considers the fact that C.I.E. lost about £24 million in 10 years and that if the whole of the railway were closed down we are told by the Department of Local Government it would draw only three per cent. more traffic on to the roads, it can easily be seen that the losses of the concern bear no relation to the fact that there will have to be some moderate expenditure in certain places on certain roads as a result of railway lines closing down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I next want to deal with the observations made in regard to roads.  I state again definitely and without any reluctance that for the three lines that have been the subject of discussion there will be required ten buses and seventeen lorries together with some trailers, together with some extra buses in the case of the Waterford-Tramore line during the summer period, together with some 40 lorries <Col N="1157" /> to be used during the beet season in West Cork.  I again state without fear of contradiction that the extra traffic on the roads concerned, as the percentage of the total traffic is negligible and that is why the railways are being closed down&mdash;because the extra traffic is negligible.  If the roads were going to be broken up by the vast number of lorries and buses, the railway, under the new management, would be making a profit and it is because the traffic which will be put on to the roads is negligible that the railways are being closed down. The expenditure mentioned by County Council engineers, so far as I can find out from making inquiries, beyond all doubt included backlog expenditure on the roads in question and in no way related entirely to expenditure incurred through the extra number of buses and lorries that would travel on the roads as a result of the closing of the railways.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that, when I examined the report of the Clare County Engineer more carefully and read the <i>Clare Champion</i> in detail, I found evidence that he had included backlog expenditure on several roads and that the total sum proposed of £600,000 required allegedly as a result of nine extra vehicles travelling on the roads had therefore no relation to the closing of the West Clare line.  It was a case of the last straw breaking the camel's back; it was a case of the county engineer saying to himself, with the help of some county councillors, that now was the time to get ahead with as much of the backlog work on these roads as possible; the argument is this: there will be a few more vehicles and everyone will highlight the importance of the roads as a result of the railway closing down; let us try to get £600,000 spent with as big a grant from the Government as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the single straw in Donegal cost £375,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already spoken about that.  That was based, first of all, on the closing down of the Great Northern Railway and <Col N="1158" /> on the closing down of all the Donegal railways.  Now, in the case of County Cork the figure worked out at £920,000 for 90 miles because of an additional 14 vehicles and trailers and an additional 40 vehicles during the beet season.  I am quite convinced those amounts include backlog work.  In the case of the Waterford-Tramore line the Minister for Local Government has clarified the position.  He has stated quite clearly that the technical information available to him shows there will be no appreciable damage by the passage of additional buses.  He also made it clear that the relief of flooding is a matter which has been long considered by the Waterford County Council and has no relation whatever to the closing of the railway.  In actual fact a huge number of vehicles already travel on the Waterford-Tramore road, as everybody knows.</P>
      <P>In order that nobody will have any illusions in regard to this matter, I made a little calculation of my own. I calculated that if you have an additional 24,300 vehicles travelling on the roads in the whole of the country in 1960 as compared with the previous year and you have an additional £200,000 available from the Road Fund&mdash;and the roads do not appear to be in any immediate danger of collapse&mdash;and you apply the amount required on the basis that some 27 vehicles would require the total sum suggested by the county engineers, then the amount required in 1960 to put the roads of the whole country into a state of additional order would be £4,500,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with wages and prices.  If the Clare County Engineer really wanted £600,000 for his mileage of roads in order to provide for a few extra vehicles, and that includes no backlog, to do the same work over the entire country to cater for the 24,300 vehicles in 1960 would cost a huge sum.</P>

      <P>Now the Minister for Local Government has made grants to other counties besides Donegal.  He has made a grant of £50,000 to Kerry over a four-year period.  He has made grants to County Longford and to Leitrim and Sligo.  I understand he intends to consider applications for what might be described as once-for-all additional grants to cover some expenses involved in the closing down of the railways and he will base his decision on the authorities' capacity to pay and on the kind of work proposed.  At this moment he is examining the position and I have no doubt he will make a reasonable decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like particularly to comment on the Cork City Engineer's statement relevant to the effect of the closing of the West Cork railways on the Western Road.  He was quite realistic.  He made it clear that when he said a sum of £25,000 would be required for five years in order to put the road into proper repair he was referring to blacklog work and he simply decided that, as there would be some 65 trucks during the beet season passing through Cork at a given rate per day, they might as well begin on the Western Road.  He pointed out that during the beet season&mdash;not during the normal season, mark you&mdash;there would be eight vehicles per hour.  This would add 1.5 per cent. to the existing peak load of traffic.  That was a carefully worked out estimate.  It indicates the measure of the problem in so far as county councils are concerned.  He implies that, as they have to spend some £25,000 to improve the roads in Cork city because of the increase in traffic&mdash;I presume Cork has its share of the 24,300 extra vehicles launched on the roads last year&mdash;they might as <Col N="1160" /> well begin on the Western Road since it will be taking, among other things, some additional beet traffic.  That was an intelligent, reasoned statement.  I commend him because he made it clear from the beginning exactly what the position would be.  It is also true that he had available to him a method of taking a road census.  That would be difficult and expensive for other county engineers and I should not make a comparison which is not, perhaps, quite valid.  It would be very difficult to take a census of vehicles over all the roads over which more buses and lorries will pass with the closing of the railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe many of the statements made are without foundation. There has been over a long period a gradual transfer from rail to road.  In 1954, 10 per cent. of the beet traffic was carried by road.  In 1959/60 it had increased to 50 per cent.  I should make it clear, too, that a great many farmers do not appreciate the ramp system for loading and unloading.  The fact that ramps have not been provided everywhere is not evidence that, if they were provided, there would be any great improvement in rail carriage of beet.  One of the best proofs of that is the fact that there have been ramps at Bandon for some time which would enable three or four lorries to load or unload simultaneously.  In 1954/55 the number of tons of beet taken at Bandon station was 6,950 and in 1950/ 60 it was 3,217.  The existence of ramps did not apparently have very much effect on the beet traffic in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that farmers are more and more inclined to avail of a single handling of their beet.  It is untrue to say that C.I.E. have deliberately <Col N="1161" /> tried to sabotage the beet traffic in Cork or anywhere else.  In some areas C.I.E. succeeded in making package deals but in West Cork apparently the cost of drawing beet is about 12½ per cent. less owing to the very large numbers of hauliers in West Cork and the fact that it is undertaken by the beet growers' association itself.  In that particular area in West Cork there are 130 lorries and of these 55 are engaged in the beet traffic.  It is obvious that C.I.E. in West Cork have met very heavy competition from a particularly successful group of hauliers.  That, with the growing number of farmers who prefer a single handling of their produce, has resulted in a decline in rail beet traffic.  Everybody in Cork knows that.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to face criticism by certain people who spoke about beet traffic and who, all their lives, never made any use of the railway line.  These people who are now criticising me did not themselves avail of the facilities offered by C.I.E.  I have nearly reached the end of this matter now and there is no need for me to go back on all that was said at the commencement of the debate.  It would take me a long time to deal with the individual points raised.  I have notes of them, but under the agreement made I would not have time to deal with them.</P>

      <P>The whole of the debate has been based upon the idea that there is something wrong about substituting a bus service for a railway service.  The Beddy Committee made it abundantly clear that there should be no favouritism for rail as against road.  The whole sense of the 1958 Act could only be interpreted as that there was to be drastic action taken by C.I.E. to reduce their losses.  I do not believe that there is any sanctity for the existence of a railway line.  If the majority of the people in any area <Col N="1164" /> find it more convenient to use the bus, if they find it gives them a more adequate service through stopping at various places at which they want to stop, if they prefer single handling of the goods in the vast majority of instances, I see no sentimental reason for preserving the railway in that district.  I am perfectly satisfied that future conditions in West Clare.  West Cork and in the Waterford-Tramore area will prove that to be true.</P>

      <P>May I make a submission which is designed to save time in the House in future?  There are three motions on the Order Paper which condemn the closing of the railway lines in Clare, West Cork and the closing of the Waterford-Tramore line.  The gist of the discussion from this side has been that these lines should not be closed down without prior consultation with the Chairman and Board of C.I.E. Surely this would be an appropriate time to take a decision on these motions in view of the fact that the Government have put this motion on the Order Paper in order to allow a discussion on the closing of these three lines?</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Telephone Call charges.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that when I intimated to-day my desire to raise this matter on the Adjournment I was informed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1167" /> that he had an appointment in Clonmel to-night.  Unfortunately, however, it would be impossible for me to raise the matter on the Adjournment to-morrow evening and I thought it was, in the public interest, very important that it should be raised before the Easter Recess.  It was not my intention to embarrass the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in any way.</P>
      <P>To-day, Deputy O. Flanagan asked a question of the Minister for Post and Telegraphs and he referred to a letter written recently with reference to grievous overcharges imposed by the Department.  Deputy O. Flanagan went on to say that, in view of the fact that the Department had admitted serious overcharges, the Minister should advise the general public to keep their own check on all calls made.  The Minister, in the course of his reply, failed to deal adequately with that very important question. The Minister endeavoured to give the impression that the difficulty regarding overcharging was confined solely to subscribers at the Dundrum exchange.</P>
      <P>It is most important that every subscriber on the series beginning 98 should know there were grievous technical faults in the Dundrum exchange all throughout the year 1960&mdash; so grievous in some cases that it has been brought to my notice that every subscriber ought to take up his charges with the proper authorities.  The Minister undoubtedly gave the impression that these were confined to Dundrum.</P>
      <P>Information at my disposal indicates that similar excessive charges are being levied at several exchanges throughout the length and breadth of Dublin.  A subscriber in the Sutton area, whose exchange has the series beginning 32, points out that in the January-March period of 1960 she made 30 calls and was charged for 259&mdash;an 800 per cent. excess charge.  When she asked for a refund or a reduction on that she was refused and received a threatening letter that she would be disconnected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period April to June, 1960, the same subscriber, on keeping a check of all calls made, was able to establish she had made 18 calls only <Col N="1168" /> but she was charged for 290 calls.  A refund was refused and she paid the account only because the alternative was disconnection.  In the July-September period of the same year the same subscriber made 29 calls and was charged for 58.  It would appear there would have been some check made of the recording equipment at the exchange in the last case and there was accordingly a reduction in the overcharge.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about this subscriber is that in August of that year she went away for 14 days and before going on holidays she had the reading of the meter checked at the exchange. She locked the house and tied up the equipment, yet when she came home, although the house had not been entered, it appeared from the exchange that 60 calls had been recorded there in the interval and when she refused to pay the phone was disconnected.  Later on, when she paid for the calls she had never made, her phone was reconnected. Another interesting thing about this was that there was no charge made by the Department for reconnecting the phone.</P>
    <P>Another case has been brought to my notice in relation to the exchange which begins with the series 61.  There, the average charge over a long period for each quarter was £20 and recently, for no reason known to the establishment concerned, a bill for £33 was received.  Another case has arisen.  I am not at the moment in a position to release the location of it.  A person who suspected that he was being overcharged was going away for a long period.  He tied up the telephone and put a seal on it in the presence of two witnesses.  When he returned after a period of some months the equipment was still tied up and the seal was unbroken but there was a bill awaiting him from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He asked that officials from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs attend at his premises, which they did.  In the presence of these officials the seal was broken.  Then, to the astonishment of the officials, the bill was produced.</P>
    <P>Another subscriber on the series beginning &ldquo;92&rdquo; has been able to establish that in a recent quarter there <Col N="1169" /> was an overcharge of 33? per cent. Another subscriber in the series beginning &ldquo;68&rdquo; fundamentally believes that she has been overcharged by as much as 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In his reply today the Minister gave the opinion to this House that the account between the Department and the person who in a public-spirited way raised the matter in the Press, had now been settled.  Yet, the Minister must know that that person still maintains that in relation to the last two accounts furnished there are overcharges. One overcharge, he maintains, is in respect of 95 calls and the other is in respect of 39 calls.</P>
    <P>The general picture shows that the recording equipment, even if it is as the Minister alleges the best available, is very, very faulty.  It is so faulty, indeed, that I believe the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can boast a profit on its telephone account simply because of the serious degree of overcharging which there is.</P>
    <P>There are several members of this House who have come to me since this matter was raised by Deputy Flanagan today.  Four members, in fact, have come to me to give their own personal experience of overcharging in respect of their own accounts.  The Minister gave the impression that there were only about 100 complaints per quarter and the effort on the part of the Department to ease public uneasiness is to say, &ldquo;Well, if there was any increase or any substantial increase there would probably be a complaint from a subscriber&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that in a bill which would cover, say, 200 calls, there could easily be an excess charge in respect of 50 calls and the average subscriber would not think of checking because he would have no reason not to have confidence in the departmental equipment.  The sorry situation as disclosed in a public-spirited way by Mr. Plunkett is sufficient to give every telephone subscriber food for very serious thought.  The whole matter is so serious that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs ought to make <Col N="1170" /> available free of charge recording meters on every telephone.</P>
    <P>We are told that the charge for recording meters on private telephones would be a rental of 18/- per quarter but if the few cases which have come to my notice are in any way typical of what is happening it would appear that it would be well worth the while of the average subscriber to pay this rental of 18/- a quarter because of the serious overcharges which have come to light.  These overcharges have come to light only because people kept a check.  It is common knowledge, of course, that the vast majority of telephone subscribers do not keep a check on either their private or business phone.  In the case of a private phone if there is an increase of 25 per cent. in the number of calls the average subscriber will not notice it or will presume that the reason is that the wife is phoning the grocer or butcher more often than formerly.  The amount of improper charging becomes a serious matter in relation to large firms where the quarterly bill may be as much as £100 or £150.  When you calculate the errors which we know of in relation to any large account the matter becomes exceedingly serious indeed.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, no check is kept on individual meters unless and until there is a complaint from a subscriber and then the subscriber may or may not have a check on the meter all depending upon the whim of the official who receives the complaint in the first instance.  That is very, very bad.</P>
    <P>I do not want to digress but it would appear from another reply to-day that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is under-staffed from the engineering point of view and that that is one of the reasons why the various telephone exchanges are recording wrongly.  I appreciate that this equipment is very sensitive and that a small electric impulse causes a meter to turn over and to register a call.  There have been cases, I am informed, where two adjoining meters have been recording at the same time, that is to say, a person dials a number <Col N="1171" /> like 97863 and not only will the call record on 97863 but will also record on 97864 and that that is one of the reasons why there is over-charging&mdash;the meters are recording on the double.</P>
    <P>All this clearly shows that the public ought to be warned to keep a very careful check on their calls.  I am aware that the Minister's reply may well be that nobody knows who is using the phone, that when the man is out the mistress may be using the phone, that when the mistress is out the maid or the children may be using it.  That is all very well but there are not maids and children in all houses where there are complaints of the type which I have disclosed here this evening.</P>
    <P>It may be said by the Minister that there are 100,000 subscribers and only 600 complaints a year.  I do not think that is due to the fact that the equipment is recording accurately.  I believe it is due to the fact that most people are prepared to accept the recording as disclosed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is quite apparent from the evidence of Mr. Plunkett over a year that there are serious errors on many exchanges. After all, the Department was on notice that the man in question was keeping a very careful check on them and one could be quite sure that the departmental officials were up morning, noon and night watching that man's meter and that no stone was left unturned to make sure that there would be no errors in his accounts in future.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions that apart from the accounts there were clerical errors.  I cannot believe there were clerical errors in relation to the account of that man who had been complaining consistently over such a long period.  There were no clerical errors.  You can be quite sure that if five persons read the meter, 10 persons checked the account.  The meter was recording wrongly on a new exchange, a modern exchange, where there was the most up-to-date equipment.  If that was recording wrongly, it is quite reasonable to believe that in the older <Col N="1172" /> exchanges in Dublin and elsewhere the meters were also recording wrongly.</P>
    <P>I know of a subscriber in Lusk who before being put on the automatic exchange was in the happy position that he received no telephone account for six months.  He was in the fortunate situation that his phone was not recording at all.</P>
    <P>All this shows a shocking degree of laxity, a shocking degree of indifference by a public Department which should be meticulous in the manner in which it administers its accounts. Therefore, people need to be warned most solemnly that they must keep a check on their telephone calls and I would exhort each and every telephone subscriber to query the account if he has any reason whatsoever to doubt that the account is right.</P>
    <P>A most important matter arises, that is, the attitude of the Department in the light of the knowledge they have that their equipment is faulty, again allowing for the fact that it may be the best available.  Considering that they know it is faulty, their attitude of summarily dismissing claims and disconnecting telephones is deplorable, to say the least of it.  No private concern, no business man or woman, could afford to treat his clients in the manner in which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs treat the public.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need to collect accounts which are properly due, but where a reputable citizen legitimately queries an account which has been running at an average of £5 per quarter over a long number of years, it is most high-handed, improper, unfair and discourteous for the Department to refuse to give such a claim proper consideration and to insist upon immediate payment with the alternative of immediate disconnection. We are aware that that has been the policy and is the policy of the Department at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there should be a reasonable approach to this matter. In such cases the reasonable approach would be to insist upon payment of the average amount and to leave over the amount that is in doubt, that is <Col N="1173" /> controversial, until there has been a proper and thorough check over at least another quarter of the meter in question by the Department, together with a check by the subscriber at his or her residence.  In such cases the Department could easily attach to the telephone of such subscriber a meter which would record calls, which could be checked against the exchange.  We know that in relation to these matters civil servants are acting properly, if rather high-handedly, in their discourteous approach to the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Neither had anything that Deputy Flanagan had to say.  This debate has, of course, arisen out of the reply given by the Minister to this Parliamentary Question. In that reply it was admitted that over-recording had occurred in this particular case and in other cases. The provision of a telephone service is an essential thing in a modern community. There must be some system of charging for that service.  The only reasonable system appears to me to be a charge per call.  Obviously, where you have a large number of subscribers&mdash;I believe the number is well over 100,000 in this country&mdash; you cannot have a manual system of recording each charge and, just as in the case of other services and commodities that are made available to the public, you have to depend on some mechanical means of recording charges.  E.S.B. current, gas, telephone and water are charged for by means of meters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the recording equipment, the meters, in use here are of the most modern, most up-to-date and most efficient type available.  Perfection is a thing which, I suppose, has never been achieved and, in the nature of things, probably never will be achieved.  As everybody knows, a mechanical apparatus is subject to faults but the apparatus that is used for this purpose in the Post Office is of the best quality available and <Col N="1176" /> experience has shown that the number of faults compared with the number of operations that are recorded is infinitesimal.</P>
    <P>In the particular case that gave rise to this adjournment debate the fault, in fact, was discovered by the Post Office engineers in one of their routine checks.  These instruments are checked periodically by the Post Office engineers and that is how this fault was first discovered.  The complaint was made by the subscriber and that was dealt with by the accounts branch of the telephone service and an agreement was arrived at.  That adjustment was made on the assumption that there had been a mistake made in the reading of the meter but, independently of that, it was discovered in the normal operation of the technical branch of the telephone service that there was a fault in the meters and that the meters were over-recording. As a result of that a further reduction was made in the account.</P>
    <P>Therefore the case in question shows that while faults can occur it is unlikely that any fault will go undetected over a considerable period.  Nobody can give a guarantee that any mechanical apparatus will operate without fault.  All that can be done is to check and try to ensure that faults will be kept to the absolute minimum and that in so far as possible nobody will suffer any financial or other loss due to any fault.  I am sure none of the other organisations that have to depend on metering arrangements in selling their products would attempt to give any such guarantee either.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has already given the assurance and I can only repeat that assurance now that the metering instrument used in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is of the highest quality and standard of accuracy obtainable and is identical with that used in other telephone administrations. Due to the fact that there is a system of periodic checking carried out the public can feel reasonably certain that any faults will be discovered and that they will not suffer financially because of any fault that may develop in the metering apparatus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> As I have said, experience shows the number of cases in which mistakes have occurred is only a small fraction of one per cent. and I think that is as much as we can hope for in this imperfect world.  With regard to whether people should keep a check themselves on the number of calls made, that is a matter for themselves but I think anybody who has attempted to do so will agree that it is a very difficult thing indeed for any person, whether it is a person in business or a householder, to keep an accurate and reliable check on every call that is made on his telephone.  However, in any case where there is a sudden and inexplicable increase in the number of calls charged for, the Post Office authorities are always willing to investigate it thoroughly and if in <Col N="1178" /> the final analysis there is some doubt, the customer is usually given the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>Some other cases were raised here by Deputy Ryan and since they were raised without any prior notice being given, I cannot be expected to be in a position to deal with them.  The public can be assured that any such cases will be thoroughly investigated and there is no need for any public uneasiness in regard to the operation of the telephone service.</P>
