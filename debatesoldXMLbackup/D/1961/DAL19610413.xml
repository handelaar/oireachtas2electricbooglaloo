      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4 be discussed together.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 12, to substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo; for &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three amendments all relate to the one proposal which is to increase the number of medical personnel on the Council from two to three and to provide that at least two of the three shall be Fellows of the Royal College <Col N="342" /> of Physicians.  As the House is aware, for almost threequarters of a century the administration of the Poisons Act has been very largely regulated, one might say, by the Royal College of Physicians.  When speaking on the amendment to increase the number of people directly chosen from the farming community, Deputy Dillon awakened my attention to what was a possible defect in the Bill&mdash;that on occasions, by reason of the limited specialist personnel available, the Council might be hampered in its deliberations.  Also, the Royal College of Physicians would wish to have that possibility avoided and so, for that reason, I propose to increase the number of Fellows on the Council from one to two.  That is, in fact, what the proposal in the three amendments taken together will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has fully met the point I raised.  I concede he has come part of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I came all of the way.  The Deputy was good enough to announce his satisfaction with the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, he has certainly come part of the way to increase the representation of agricultural interests on this Council but it has to be borne in mind that there are to be two persons representing farming interests on a relatively large body.  I want to draw a comparison between this and another council that we have just set up.  This body which, after all, has serious responsibilities cast upon it now consists of 17 persons.  On another occasion I was arguing&mdash;and I shall argue again&mdash;that where adequate and equitable representation of farming interests is required, it would not be unreasonable to extend the membership of a council of this character from seven to nine.  I was told by a colleague of the Minister for Health that it would be out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the ridiculous situation on another committee to be established by a Bill which is at present going through the House that we shall have seven <Col N="343" /> members, three representing manufacturers and two representing farmers. If it is possible to operate this Bill with 17 and if it is possible for the Minister for Health to meet the pharmaceutical chemists and extend their representation to five, as he felt it his duty to do and again to increase by his amendment the representation afforded to physicians&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of representation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning it.  If it is desirable to increase the representation of physicians that is all right by me if it makes the body more effective and efficient for its purpose. All I want to say is that, if it is possible to do that in the context of this Bill, one would have imagined it would be possible to do far less in the context of the other Bill which the House is at present considering.  It is a source of some mitigated satisfaction to me that the Minister for Health has been persuaded to show some consideration of the claims of the agricultural community to be represented on a body of this kind which does control so many things of intimate concern to that community. I compare this consideration with the categorical refusal of the Minister for Agriculture to provide adequate representation for farmers with bacon curers on the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board which deals much more intimately with the affairs of the rural community than this poisons body can ever do.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister for Health, who is so strong a protagonist for the proposition that Governments all have a common mind, that in connection with this other Bill which is now in progress through this House he should approach his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, and remind him that, if he considers it expedient to make this concession to the agricultural community, the Minister for Agriculture might follow his example with regard to the community for which he is responsible to the House.</P>

      <P>There is no analogy whatever between the functions of this <Col N="344" /> advisory council and the other board to which the Leader of the Opposition referred.  The other board is an administrative body, a regulating body, a controlling body and, in some instances, a trading body and it would be quite inappropriate to have such a body with a membership of 17 as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When he tries to establish a false analogy between the functions of this board and the functions of the board to which he refers the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that the other board should have the same number of members which is 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That it should be nine members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is seven or nine, there is no analogy between the two bodies.  This Board is an advisory body to which the Minister for Health, whoever he may be, when he proposes to make an order with relation to poisons, may submit that order for the comments of the Council. When he receives those comments he will consider his order in the light of them.  He need not necessarily accept their comments.  He may modify or accept the whole or part of them.  It is desirable that all those who have a special knowledge of the subject, not a special interest in it, should be represented as far as is reasonably possible on such a Board in order that all the aspects of the Minister's proposal might be examined and that he might have available to him the joint wisdom of all knowledgeable persons.  That is the purpose of this council which has no function in any way similar to that to be discharged by the Pigs and Bacon Board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 37 and 38 and to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) two persons nominated by the Minister for Agriculture each of whom is a person whose main occupation is farming, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand that this amendment meets the wishes of the Leader of the Opposition in part.  He did make a very strong point that if only one person with special knowledge of poisonous substances was nominated to represent the agricultural industry, such person might not always be in a position to attend.  This does not mean that because there are only two people whose main occupation is farming directly appointed on the nomination of the Minister there will not be other people on the board who will have a knowledge of farming.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that this amendment comes part of the way to meet me and I recall that the Minister said that the possibility of some other people having agricultural experience would not exclude them from membership of the Board.  I recommend the Minister's example in this matter to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture. The approach of the Tánaiste to the dilemma is more constructive and helpful than that of his colleague. It is not yet too late for his colleague to mend his hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Minister if periodic reviews are made of duties?  Some years ago there was an arrangement whereby duties were reviewed periodically and in that way the rate of duty and the effect of it on particular commodities were kept under constant review, the result being that not merely was the rate of duty considered but the quality and strength of the various articles produced were reviewed from time to time.  If such an arrangement is still in operation, can the Minister say how frequently these reviews are carried <Col N="347" /> out and if not, will he consider adopting a scheme under which effective review will be carried out at regular intervals of the rates of duty of the various commodities?</P>

      <P>Apparently it was always the intention that these tariffs would be reviewed from time to time, in the first instance by the Prices Body, as it then was, and subsequently by the I.D.A.  I understand that, in fact, such review was not carried out.  However, as the Deputy knows, latterly we have had, under the trade agreements with Britain, requests from the British Government to have certain blocs of tariffs reviewed.  That review has been taking place.  The Board of Trade submitted two lists of tariffs, the first of which was undertaken by the I.D.A., and that list having been completed, the second list is now being reviewed by them.  I understand a third list has been prepared by the Board of Trade now.  While the original intention may not have been carried out, as a result of recent talks between my Department and the Board of Trade, reviews are now taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no examination independently of existing tariffs on other goods?  This review applies only to lists submitted.  There is no independent separate review of all tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment. I should like the Deputy to understand that this is a pretty arduous and onerous task.  All aspects of the trade concerned have to be taken into account, not only here but in Britain as well.  Those interested are entitled to make their submissions.  These submissions have to be heard.  As the Deputy appreciates, the task is a lengthy one.  It would certainly be difficult to handle a complete review of all tariffs side by side with the reviews I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is an earnest of the Government's intention, as stated in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> to ensure that the development of agriculture will not be hampered by lack of capital.  It follows similar action already taken in the case of capital for industry.</P>
      <P>The subject of credit for agriculture has been under close examination for some time past.  This examination has been greatly assisted by the survey of agricultural credit in Ireland made by Mr. F. W. Gilmore, Deputy Governor of the U.S.A. Farm Credit Administration, which has been presented to the Dáil.  At this point I wish to express the Government's appreciation and thanks to Mr. Gilmore for his very valuable contribution.  His task was not an easy one but he approached it with great energy and determination and completed his report on a complex subject in a matter of a few months.</P>
      <P>The modifications of the law which the Government consider desirable as a result of the examination of Mr. Gilmore's survey are contained in the Bill now before the House.  The various changes proposed are summarised in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill for the convenience of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's aim is to enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to play a leading part in financing the development of agriculture and to create conditions in which arrangements can be worked out for participation by farmers in the ownership, and ultimately in the control, of the Corporation. The Government accept that the Corporation must have adequate financial <Col N="349" /> resources and be free to lend money for all agricultural purposes. While it must continue to operate as a sound commercial organisation, it should be placed in a position to undertake such lending and other investments as are clearly in the national interest, even though at times, the degree of risk may be higher than is normal in ordinary banking operations.  On the other hand, all unnecessary hindrance to prudent borrowing by farmers from the Corporation must be removed.</P>
    <P>The present authorised capital of the Corporation is £300,000 which is all issued and is held by the Minister for Finance except for a few shares held by his nominees.  The Corporation has for some years past been paying a dividend at the rate of 4½ per cent. per annum.  The Bill provides for an increase of the authorised capital to a maximum of £2,000,000.  As the magnitude of the increase indicates, the Government have in mind a greatly increased future scale of activity for the Corporation.  Such increased activity will entail heavy investment of capital.  There is no doubt that increased investment by farmers in their land and buildings, in equipment and stock, is a pre-requisite for expanded production at lower unit cost.  The farmer's capacity to invest depends on the grant and credit facilities available to him in addition to his savings.</P>
    <P>The availability of funds in the form of share capital will provide greater flexibility for the Corporation in dealing with the increasing demands on it for credit.  While it is expected that a very big part of these demands will come from the individual enterprising farmers who are the backbone of the agricultural industry, there will also undoubtedly be an increasing demand by co-operative and corporate enterprises undertaking investments in specialised forms of agricultural production and processing.  These enterprises will not be operating against the individual farmer but can be used constructively to strengthen the individual farmer's position in production and marketing.</P>
    <P>In countries with advanced economies, the pattern of agricultural <Col N="350" /> production and distribution is undergoing profound changes involving new techniques and processes and integrated forms of development requiring the investment of large sums designed to give vast increases in production and productivity.  If we are to expand, or indeed even maintain, our sales to export markets we must be in a position to meet the challenge presented by these developments.  It is the Government's intention that we will not fail to do so for lack of reasonable credit facilities.</P>
    <P>Some agricultural co-operative societies are, of course, already engaged in, or are proposing to engage in, specialised or integrated forms of agricultural production involving close co-operation with farmers in their areas.  These co-operatives are setting a progressive example and I hope that it will not be long before many other co-operatives follow this example in ways best suited to local farming needs and prospects.  There is a vital need for development of the co-operative movement in this way throughout the country, particularly in the interest of smaller farmers who, such is the need for heavy investment in farming under modern conditions, may find it very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to prosper without the help and guidance of the co-operatives.</P>
    <P>For their part, the Government are now taking steps to ensure that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have sufficient funds to enable it to consider applications from co-operatives for credit for all soundly based projects which cannot be financed from other sources.  I may add that the Corporation is itself considering what special scheme or schemes it can introduce to facilitate and stimulate development by the co-operatives in the desired direction.</P>
    <P>The Corporation will not be expected to pay a greater dividend on share capital provided from the Exchequer than it is in a position to pay when it has met its various obligations, including provisions for reserves and for the remuneration of any special credit officers who may be appointed to the staff.  This will meet the recommendation <Col N="351" /> made by Mr. Gilmore that the Corporation should be enabled to employ credit officers so as to improve its services to farmers.  The extra resources now being provided should enable the Corporation to invest in, or lend to agricultural enterprises which, while profit earning eventually, may not prove remunerative for some time.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation shares of the Corporation may be held by the Minister for Finance only, except that the directors may hold qualification shares and other nominees of the Minister may hold one share each for the purpose of complying with the requirements of the Companies Acts. The Bill empowers the Corporation to issue shares or stock to persons other than the Minister for Finance but the Minister's consent is necessary so long as he holds not less than half the issued capital.  The Minister is also being given a general power to purchase and sell shares of the Corporation.  These powers in addition to the increase in the authorised capital which is being provided for will enable arrangements to be made for the purchase of shares by farmers when it becomes opportune to provide for this.</P>
    <P>However, as is proper for an institution which is primarily of a banking nature, most of the Corporation's capital will continue to be raised by borrowing. At present the borrowing powers are restricted in form as well as in amount.  It is proposed to confer power to borrow money in any way the Board thinks fit and to raise the effective borrowing limit of £8.3 million to £10 million.  Certain guarantee powers are available to the Minister for Finance under the existing Acts to guarantee borrowing by the Corporation but they are too limited in form.  Provision is, therefore, being made to enable the Minister to guarantee the Corporation's borrowing and to make direct advances from the Central Fund to the Corporation.  The total of such guarantees, advances and any other borrowings is not to exceed the figure of £10 million already mentioned.  Provision is also being made for the guarantee of the Corporation in approved cases against losses on agricultural <Col N="352" /> credit schemes subject to a maximum of £5 million at any one time.  The new powers should facilitate greatly the financing and operation of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Corporation has hitherto been somewhat hampered in its lending activities by certain restrictions which are not appropriate to present day conditions.  These are being rectified in the Bill.  The principal objects and powers of the Corporation are being re-enacted in more general form and are being widened in certain respects. Under the powers now proposed the Corporation will be able to lend or advance money or to guarantee credit for any purpose which the Board consider likely to increase the productivity of or be otherwise of benefit to agriculture.  The definition of the expression agriculture is being widened. In addition to covering all the usual farm operations, it will also cover such activities as horticulture, tree planting, fish farming and the marketing, processing or completion for sale of any farm produce.  The existing limit of £10,000 on loans other than to co-operative societies is being abolished and the Corporation is being explicitly empowered to issue and accept bills of exchange and to engage in hire-purchase arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Corporation will also be able to take up shares and, if necessary, to sponsor special projects and companies for the benefit of agriculture. It is hoped that such activities and the further development of co-operatives will be of particular assistance and benefit to farmers in meeting the challenge of modern conditions in agricultural production and marketing and will result in increased exports of agricultural produce and goods derived from such produce.  The Corporation will be able, and has indicated its intention, to draw on the specialised knowledge and experience of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and of the Department of Agriculture in the development of production, processing and marketing enterprises, and such consultation will ensure that these projects are in the interests of the individual farmer.</P>
    <P>To simplify loan procedure the <Col N="353" /> Corporation is being given power to make orders charging loans on land, subject to the consent of the owner, or of the occupier, if the loan is for work of permanent improvement.  Loans so charged will be a personal liability of the owner or occupier of the land for the time being.  Charging orders made by the Corporation may be varied with the consent of the owner or occupier.  The Corporation will make no charge for its services in ordinary cases and neither stamp duty nor Land Registry fees will be payable.  I am confident that this arrangement will facilitate farmers greatly in borrowing from the Corporation.  It follows the system used in the administration of Gaeltacht housing loans and for the fertilisers scheme operated as part of the Land Project in which charging orders are made by the Office of Public Works and the Land Commission respectively.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to assist in the provision of credit for farmers the system of chattel mortgages, that is mortgages on livestock, crops and agricultural equipment, is being extended to cover contractual liabilities generally.  Up to now a chattel mortgage could be used as security for a direct loan only but under the new provisions it can be used, for example, to secure a guarantee given by or to the Corporation covering the supply of agricultural goods on credit to a farmer.</P>
    <P>In the existing legislation loans charged in favour of the Corporation on registered land the title to which is marked &ldquo;subject to equities&rdquo; are given priority over the &ldquo;equities&rdquo; up to a limit of £400.  There is a similar priority over the corresponding burdens in the case of unregistered land. The limit of £400 was fixed as far back as 1928 and the Gilmore Survey recommended that it be increased to £800.  In view, however, of the decline in the value of money since 1928 an increase to £1,000 is justified. This figure, which is adopted in the Bill, is larger than the great majority of loans for which the Corporation is asked.  The change will, therefore, simplify procedure in connection with most loan applications.</P>

      <Col N="354" /> In order to enable the Board of the Corporation to be strengthened as necessary to cope with the increase in its activities, provision is being made to raise the maximum number of directors from five to seven.  It will be possible to avail of this provision to give greater representation to farmer interests according as may be justified by investment by farmers in the Corporation.  At present there are no effective arrangements in operation by which farmers or other members of the public can invest in the Corporation. Under its new powers the Corporation intends to launch a scheme of investment specially designed to appeal to farmers and I hope that there will be an enthusiastic response.</P>
    <P>While it is not a matter that it is necessary to cover by legislation, I may add that the Corporation proposes to amend its Articles of Association to enable it to consider applications for loans on the security of land up to 66? per cent. of the market value of the land instead of 50 per cent. as at present. This will enable the Corporation to give larger credit than hitherto in worthwhile cases.</P>
    <P>As regards the scale of the Corporation's activities, I may mention that the aggregate of loans issued since it commenced business in 1928 up to 1960 was £9.4 million, an average of £300,000 a year.  The present level is of the order of £800,000 a year which approaches three times the average. This, however, is far from being adequate and I hope that as a result of the enactment of the Bill the Corporation will enter upon a new and expansive phase of activity, performing to the fullest extent its due function in the provision of credit for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Before I close, I should refer to the commercial banks who have, within their own province, been implementing progressive policies.  They have introduced various special farm credit schemes and are improving their relations and contacts with farmers. These developments are very welcome as there is still vast scope for investment in better farming.  The banks as well as the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="355" /> have their own role to play in making that investment possible and fruitful.</P>
    <P>In recent years increasing attention is being paid by the agricultural advisory services to farm management problems, including the use of credit. Educational work in this sphere is also being undertaken through the agricultural classes organised by the County Committees of Agriculture and the Winter farm schools organised jointly by these Committees and the Vocational Education Committees. Increasing numbers of farmers are approaching the agricultural advisers for advice on farm management plans and are being helped to place their programmes on a sound financial basis. The farmers' organisations have also been doing good work in educating their members and farmers generally in the use of credit.  It is essential that farmers should realise the importance of the wise use of credit in farming so that they will benefit from the improved arrangements which are now being provided.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main provisions and principles of the Bill.  I am satisfied that it will provide improved, simpler and more effective machinery for the Agricultural Credit Corporation in channelling credit to farmers. I am sure that its principles and intentions will commend themselves to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a Bill for the stimulation of credit for agriculture and the way in which it works out in practice can be two very different things.  The Minister indicated in his opening statement a lot of what I might describe as high-sounding theory but talking of vast increases in production, having regard to some of the experience of the past, is to put it mildly a little fanciful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister did not indulge in that fight of fancy anyway.  The real trouble in relation to agricultural credit is to acclimatise, so to speak, our people to the advantages that wise use of credit can bring.  It has taken a good many generations, naturally enough, to get farmers to realise that it is wise at times to avail of credit. In any country those engaged in agriculture are likely to be the most conservative in the community.  Here, we have had over the years a very particular and a very special problem. Farmers know that if their grandfathers in their time used credit for the improvement of their holdings all it meant was that it brought an increase in rent.  They can remember their fathers finding at the end of the first world war that those who had expanded were hit overnight by the collapse in the post-war period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can remember also the position that arose in the economic war when the more a man had the more he lost.  Therefore, it is only in the last 20 years that the present generation of farmers have had any opportunity to consider expansion on a <Col N="357" /> more rational basis.  If, therefore, people who do not understand the problem are apt to criticise the Irish farmer for being too conservative they should look at history and see the reason that arose in generation after generation for that conservatism.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of credit for agriculture must be to increase production and to increase productivity. I am particularly shocked by the livestock enumeration for January of this year which was published the other day.  The White Paper on Economic Expansion following the Grey Book on Economic Development was published in November, 1958, and on page 15 we find this paragraph:</P>
    <P>The objective of policy will be to increase cow numbers progressively to at least 1,500,000 by 1964.  The retention for breeding of an additional 50,000 heifers per annum would enable this objective to be attained without undue disturbance to the farming economy or to the export trade.</P>
    <P>It goes on further to deal, properly so, with the difficulties that may be created from the necessity to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>What is the position that we see? That was published in November, 1958, and the nearest figures statistically that we can get to that time are those compiled for January, 1959.  As I said a moment ago, the position as it was in January this year was published about three weeks ago by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>In January, 1959, there were 1,219,000 cows.  This year there are 1,237,000&mdash;virtually no change at all. In January, 1959, there were 184,900 in-calf heifers.  This year there are 190,800&mdash;virtually no change at all. The stagnation that there is in relation to our cattle population is something that must cause everyone to think very carefully.</P>
    <P>I understand that the banks were operating a heifer scheme in the last couple of years.  More credit to them for so doing but it does seem without question that the scheme did not produce much results because, in fact, <Col N="358" /> in January, 1961, there were 25,900 fewer in-calf heifers than there were the year before, and the change in the year 1960 has gone entirely the wrong way.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that I do not mind very much about the total cattle numbers in January each year; the total cattle numbers in June are the important figures to consider but in relation to milch cows and in-calf heifers they are of vital importance.  Once the heifer has become a cow she is not going to be taken out of the herd except for sale, except for breeding somewhere else or to go to the cannery and unless the replacements of in-calf heifers are coming in year by year there is no hope and no prospect of building up our cattle population.  Unless we can build up our cattle population in a satisfactory manner there is no hope of the attainment of a real sound basis of improvement for our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>What I want to ensure is that the system and the scheme of agricultural credit will really operate towards that end and will not fail, as one clearly sees there has been a failure in 1960, in that degree.  The drop of some 17,000 in our breeding stock is a serious matter.  It means, if the figures are correct, and I have no reason to challenge their accuracy, that we are bound to have fewer calves this year.  The figure for calf mortality has, thank goodness, dropped very remarkably, largely due to the work Deputy Dillon did in the 1948 to 1951 period, to the groundwork that was laid then. However, even though it has dropped, it is self-evident to all of us, even to the person of the city, that there is no way of bringing up the cattle population except by increasing the number of cows by increasing the number of in-calf heifers.</P>
    <P>The year 1960 was a disastrous one in that respect.  The trend went violently the other way.  The drop in in-calf heifers is 11.9 per cent. on previous years, according to the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office.  As I have said, I do not pay a great deal of attention to the total cattle figures for January because June <Col N="359" /> is a more significant month, but it is also noticeable that in this livestock enumeration that has been circulated the drop in sheep numbers has been quite substantial also.  One would have thought there should have been an increase in sheep because of the unfortunate experience of farmers in relation to cattle prices last year.</P>
    <P>No matter how advantageous may be the credit schemes or the technical arrangements the Minister may make in relation to agricultural credit, the more important thing is to convince the farmer that he will have reasonable stability of price.  It is a fact many farmers who did borrow last year for livestock got a very bad burning, if they were unfortunate enough to sell their stock before Christmas.  Once that happens in a parish to any one farmer, it acts as a deterrent to other farmers in the neighbourhood who are endeavouring to expand.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that stability in price is far more advantageous than anything that may be done by way of legal process or Acts in respect of agricultural credit.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear of certain changes the Minister has outlined but whether they will be successful or not depends entirely on their utilisation. It has long been a habit of certain people to provide very large figures either in Estimates or in Bills of this nature, because figures themselves sound grand, well knowing that there is little or no possibility of the theoretical permissive amounts being taken up or anywhere near taken up.  I hope that the scheme which will presumably be brought out now by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in relation to hire purchase, in particular, will be one not merely that offers accommodation at a reasonable cost but that works in a comparatively simple way.  The simplicity of the working of such a scheme is of even greater importance than the cost of the facilities, within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>I am not terribly happy that the extension of the limit up to which the Corporation can make an advance <Col N="360" /> without title may not defeat itself. There is no doubt whatever that the advance that has been made by the Corporation will be of advantage but what I am afraid of is that the existence of as high a priority right of charge as £1,000 in favour of the Corporation may mean that in other cases banks who want to make accommodation available to their farmer clients will, for their own protection, have to insist on a rigorous title examination and put up the cost on persons seeking accommodation from banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree with me at once when I say that if one farmer out of five gets accommodation from the Corporation and the other four get accommodation from banks of the size of loan we are discussing, there is no benefit to the community as a whole if the one farmer who is getting accommodation from the Corporation is facilitated and pays less, while the other four have to pay more because of the necessity to protect the banks against this priority charging order to be made by the Corporation.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a scheme or a system must be operated in such a way that there can be protection for the genuine charge that may be made in respect of the other four cases I have described, while properly providing that the Corporation can get over title difficulties in a much cheaper manner for the one borrower out of five who may approach them.  I think the manner of working that is more an administrative matter than one for inscription in the Bill.  I do want to stress that it is of the greatest importance that in making the job simpler and cheaper for the borrower from the Corporation, we must not, at the same time, make it dearer and more difficult for the person who prefers to get his accommodation, because it is far more temporary, from a bank or similar institution.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister visualises, when he includes bills of exchange, that there will be any great promissory note business by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  A promissory note business depends more than anything on knowledge of the <Col N="361" /> person concerned.  It is very difficult to deal with that type of business by remote control from Dublin, utilising only the services of the Garda for character reports.  In that type of business, there would be no question of the inspector the Corporation normally send in the larger case.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the essential thing is to ensure that the agricultural credit that is necessary and desirable is channelled towards an increase in production and an increase in productivity.  Administration is of far more value than legalistic phrases in the Bill, in the explanatory memorandum or even, with respect, in the Minister's opening statement.  What we want to do is to ensure that this is not just an airy-fairy plan, or an airy-fairy announcement, but that the solid business of increasing production is made easier for the farmers as a whole.  It is particularly obvious that, in relation to livestock, credit is essential if farmers are to be enabled to have more heifers in calf in their herds, and to build up their herds rather than sell them to meet their other annual commitments.  It is certainly clear from the figures I quoted from the January, 1961, livestock enumeration that that has not happened up to date, but that on the contrary, the reverse has happened. I hope that in the years ahead we will see an improvement in that respect and a change from the declining trend we saw this year to a steady increase in our cattle population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three comments I should like to make on the question of credit for the agricultural community.  I subscribe to the views expressed by Deputy Sweetman that there are reasons for farmers being conservative and that those reasons belong to the past.  We have now had experience of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and of the banks and since the Corporation was established many years ago, I am satisfied that there were two points lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, a large number of the farmers who sought credit from the Corporation had no plan, or did not plan exactly what they would do with the <Col N="362" /> money when they had it.  They were not trained and had no knowledge of what the financial transactions meant.  When the interest charge was taken into account, I regret to say very often the farmers did not think of the repayment charge.  When they were told they would get money at five per cent., lacking knowledge, many farmers thought that five per cent. was the sum total of what they had to pay.</P>
    <P>When they found, as they were bound to find&mdash;but too late&mdash;that from their increased production, they had to provide for interest and sinking fund, the repayment of the loan &mdash;when that was taken over a period of five or seven years or whatever was the repayment period&mdash;they found that they had no cash for themselves.  The total profit they made on the transaction was eaten up in the interest and sinking fund payments.  I challenge contradiction on this: there is not a Deputy who does not know full well that many farmers who got a substantial loan were much worse off after getting the loan than they were before.</P>
    <P>What is my object in citing that now?  It is simply that I consider the Agricultural Credit Corporation must make money available at a much lower rate of interest.  If they do not, there is no difference between them and the commercial banks.  Farmers who could get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation could get it from a bank. It is strange that a farmer who went into a bank to borrow had a keener appreciation of the responsibilities he was undertaking than had the farmer who was getting the loan from, believe it or not, the Government, not the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Many farmers took it that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was part of a Department of State.</P>
    <P>If progress is to be made, the farmers must get credit and money must be made available at a lower rate of interest.  That means a loss and I realise that, but it should be the responsibility of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, before they advance substantial sums to farmers for increased production, to make sure the farmers fully understand the responsibilities <Col N="363" /> they are undertaking. The Corporation should make some calculation for the farmer, ask him what he is going to purchase, what profit he hopes to make and then, if the interest and sinking fund charges exceed the profit he calculates he will make, I think he should not get the loan because there is no provision for losses if he is dealing in livestock. If cattle die, the farmer is in a very bad position.</P>
    <P>We all know that, owing to weather or other conditions, losses can be very substantial.  I have no solution to the problem I visualise except that an advisory service should be included. A series of lectures should be given to the farmer on how to use credit to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not want to travel the ground Deputy Sweetman has travelled with regard to the fall in the number of in-calf heifers and cows.  That matter is well established.  It is disheartening that there is no great improvement but, on the contrary, a worsening in the situation.  However, let us hope for the best.  I would stress that the Government should take every step to maintain price stability.  It is one of the greatest benefits to the agricultural community and one of the greatest incentives to increased production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we should bear in mind in discussing credit for the farming community is the position of our farmer <i>vis-á-vis</i> his opposite number on the Continent.  We find it very difficult to maintain our foothold on the British market, in competition, particularly, with Denmark. One would think the Government would be most anxious to give facilities to the farming community to enable them to compete in a reasonable manner with their opposite numbers on the Continent.</P>
      <P>There is no possibility that the majority of our small farmers can obtain credit at a reasonable interest rate, whereas the small farmer in many European countries can get credit at from three to four per cent. to develop his land and purchase machinery,</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very often at less.  The Irish farmer may have to pay interest of from 12 to 20 per cent. How can he compete with his opposite number when he is hamstrung with regard to credit?</P>
      <P>I do not object, for instance, to hotels getting interest-free loans.  That is desirable if we wish to expand our income from the tourist industry. There is no limit to the amount of money being made available to our hoteliers to reconstruct their hotels. Very often, the money is being made available free of interest for a period of five years.  Surely nobody can complain if the Government make arrangements to provide credit for the farming community, especially the small farmers, at a rate of, say, two to three per cent. to enable them to compete with their opposite numbers in other countries?</P>
      <P>The Government pay lip service to the fundamental importance of agriculture. They should prove their sincerity by providing the necessary credit for the farming community.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has been functioning for some time.  It is a joke in the west of Ireland that in order to get credit from it one must have money in the bank.  Because of the strict investigations into the status of the applicant for credit, it is not worth his while to look for the loan. Where, then, is the incentive to the small farmer to increase production?</P>
      <P>We can take it that in present circumstances the farmer, in the main, goes to the commercial banks for credit.  The commercial banks are not suited to that purpose.  Very few men attached to the banks are skilled in agricultural science or have a knowledge of the problems of farmers. Bank managers and bank clerks are noted mostly for their achievements in sport.  I do not think they know the first thing about problems on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme was put forward to enable farmers to expand production, to increase the number of cattle on <Col N="365" /> their holdings, by looking for credit in the banks.  That experiment was not successful : I disagree with Deputy MacEoin on the reasons he put forward. I think the reason was that the banks are not suitable agents for dealing with agricultural credit.  The best arrangement would be for the Government to nationalise one of the commercial banks and to ensure that in it and its branches men would be available with a knowledge of agricultural problems.  In conjunction with parish agents and agricultural experts, they could advise on who should receive credit and advise the farmer on the utilisation of the credit he receives. Most important of all, the credit should be available at a reasonable rate of interest.</P>
    <P>There is no competition whatever between the commercial banks.  There is no difference between the credit facilities they offer.  The position is as if there were four or five post offices in a town.  The only competition between them is which of them can shake hands in the most friendly manner with potential customers and, with a big smile, bring them into the bank.  There is no competition with regard to credit, rates of interest, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that industrial output is going up.  We admit it is going up so far as certain products are concerned&mdash;products which are mostly imported and processed in this country.  That is not a healthy or safe expansion unless backed by solid achievements in the agricultural sphere which cannot take place unless credit and educational facilities are made available to the farmers.</P>
    <P>This new attempt is a waste of time, so far as the farming community are concerned.  The schemes put forward for credit were aimed solely at increasing the cattle population.  There was no question of making credit available for the farmer who wished to go in for horticulture or gardening.  The whole slant tended towards the store cattle trade&mdash;in other words, that we should be a ranch to supply the needs of the British farmer.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised that the intelligent men in the N.F.A. did not <Col N="366" /> realise that this alleged generous support of the banks in regard to credit for expanding the cattle population was prompted not so much in the interests of the British community. The headquarters of all the commercial banks are across the water.  All the strings pulled in regard to financial matters and the control of our commercial banks are pulled from London.  Any policy changes made in our banking system emanate from London.  That position obtains because the commercial banks here are not under the supervision of the State in any way.  That is why I suggest the necessity for an agency controlled by the State that will produce a policy and a credit system for the Irish community.</P>
    <P>We cannot have a credit easement solely to increase the cattle population. I believe that is the wrong approach. If credit is to be made available, it should be for the purpose of processing our agricultural production.  Unless we can get down to that and have intensive farming, we shall not have the output necessary to solve many of the problems facing the small farmer.  All the credit in the world to enable the small farmer to purchase cattle is a waste of time.  In my opinion, a small farmer is a man with a valuation of from £15 to £20.  Most of the farmers are in that category.  In the constituency I represent up to the moment, Roscommon, 80 per cent. of the farmers have a valuation of less than £25. The average valuation per acre is around 9/6d.  You can average from that what size the holdings are.  Such a small farmer can have, at most, only three or four cattle for sale in the year.  The significant thing that has emerged in recent years is that when the cattle population went up in Roscommon, the pig and poultry populations fell and the number of people living on the holdings declined.  Those are not my findings; they are the findings of an expert in the Statistics Branch, Dr. O'Connor, who produced an excellent paper recently on that subject.</P>
    <P>Unless we direct credit to the small <Col N="367" /> farmer, not so much for the purchase of cattle but to allow him expand in other agricultural spheres, we shall not get the development necessary.  As far as this measure is concerned, therefore, it is not worth tuppence to the small farmer.  I doubt if we are going to get from this Government the inspiration and lead necessary if the small farmer is to remain here.  I doubt if the Taoiseach would recognise what a small farm is, but apparently it has been brought home to him at last by some of his own supporters that the situation is desperately serious in rural Ireland so far as farming stock is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address at the exhibition on rural water supplies in the Mansion House he said the Government had under consideration further plans to improve conditions for the small farmer.  I suggest to him that one of the first things to be made available to the small farmer is credit, cheap money, so that he can diversify his activities rather than have his activities channelled, as they have been for the last few years, into one line of production&mdash;store cattle.  If that is allowed to continue the small farmer will disappear, and in a short time we shall find that, once again, Westmeath, Meath and elsewhere will be turned into a major ranch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking at the earlier figure.  It is now down to six and one-quarter per cent.  At the same time, a number of schemes were operating under the Department of Agriculture by which loans were provided for the purchase of agricultural machinery, for the purchase of cattle, sheep and bulls and by which credit was made available for the purchase of fertilisers and ground limestone under a guaranteed loan scheme.  In all those schemes the charge for credit is one per cent lower.  I am again <Col N="368" /> quoting the July figures for the rate quoted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to its own customers.  On July 29th, 1960, the rate in the Agricultural Credit Corporation was six and three-quarter per cent. and the rate prescribed for the loans to which I have referred, guaranteed by the Department of Agriculture, was five and three-quarter per cent.</P>
      <P>One of the most urgent requirements in connection with agricultural credit is that it should be made available to farmers at a rate they can afford to pay.  As far as I know, the practice in most Continental countries is to make credit available for approved projects at a rate substantially below the current bank rate.  When I say the current bank rate, I mean the current rate charged by joint stock banks for loans.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that our own practice has been that where the Department of Agriculture have stood guarantor for a loan, the money is made available to the farmers at one per cent. less than the ordinary charge of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I understood the reason for that is that the Credit Corporation say that the element of risk is removed where the Department of Agriculture guaranteed the loan.  My recollection is that our experience of loss under those guarantee schemes was virtually nil.  Yet the fact that the loan is channelled through the Department of Agriculture saved one per cent. to the farmer.  I have often wondered whether it would not be possible to take our courage in our hands, for a period anyway, and determine that for five or ten years a very attractive rate of interest would be offered to farmers borrowing for approved projects of expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed, and I believe now more profoundly than I ever did before, that the root of this whole problem of a provident credit expansion for the farmers of this country is to be found in an adequate agricultural advisory service.  I know that from my own personal experience and from the experience of living among my neighbours.  Agricultural <Col N="369" /> practice has been going through a revolution during the last 20 to 30 years.  Many discoveries of fundamental importance have come to light and those of us who are familiar with these discoveries, owing to our contacts with sources of information, very often forget how slowly this knowledge percolates down to the men who are actually operating the land. One of the great difficulties in the Department of Agriculture when I was there was to get the farmers to know what the schemes were.  You would produce a scheme which appeared to you to be immensely advantageous for the installation of water but it would be two or three years before you would get the farmer to realise that the scheme was available.</P>
    <P>I remember coming in for considerable criticism because I used to publish advertisements on a large scale.  I did it because I could not get the farmers to wake up to the fact that these schemes were available.  I want to give an instance of my own personal experience with regard to this matter.  The Department of Agriculture was continually exhorting the farmers to make more silage.  Now all of us with any knowledge of farming realise that one of the most heartbreaking operations on an ordinary farm, particularly a small farm, is making hay.  About once in every four years, you get a straight hay harvest in which you can save hay and get it into the shed without getting caught by the weather.  In many years, by the time you have the hay in the shed, it is scarcely worth bringing there because it has become so weathered and battered by rain and storm and everything else.  In a country with an average rainfall of 42 inches, there is a perfect set-up for the making of grass silage.  How many farmers make silage?  About two per cent.  To those people who are fully informed on this matter that often gives rise to exasperation but the facts and the explanation of that situation are quite simple.  They do not know how to make it.  I recall quite distinctly when I started making it.  My great difficulty was that I did not know how and for two or three years after <Col N="370" /> I had come fully to realise its value in the set-up I had on the small 50-acre farm, it was not for the want of the will but for the want of the know-how.</P>
    <P>To cut a long story short, ultimately an agricultural inspector in our area, the Lord have mercy on him&mdash;he has since died&mdash;a man named Smith, came down to my farm and showed them how to do it.  Quite obviously, there was still a good deal of doubt and scepticism about it&mdash;it was a revolutionary idea to put green grass in a pit&mdash;and finally he threw off his coat and got into the pit and did it with them.  He said: &ldquo;Look, when you are going to open this pit, let me know and I will come back and open it with you.&rdquo;  We made the pit of silage, covered it with one foot of clay and a good deal of our neighbours were very concerned to tell us that we would get a queer shock when we opened the pit and saw what was in it.  They said they would like to be there when we opened it, like to be a fly on the wall.</P>
    <P>Of course the time came when we did open it and even at that stage you would find a good many of our neighbours, small farmers in County Mayo, who said: &ldquo;My goodness, do you get the smell of that?&rdquo;  It was not until they saw the cattle eagerly consuming it that it suddenly dawned upon them that this was something which they had never known before and which would work.  I do assure the House it would never have been made and never have been used but for the fact that that man came with the prestige of an agricultural instructor, took off his coat, got into the pit himself and helped to make it, and was prepared to stake his reputation as an agricultural instructor that what he was there making would come out as a valuable product.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, they make it readily in the spring or in the autumn as circumstances suggest.  Now they put out nitrogen and increase the protein content.  Now silage is as familiar to them as an old shoe and it would be unthinkable to save the grass on that small farm without its due proportion going through the silage pit. Every Deputy should think of his own <Col N="371" /> experience, particularly amongst the farmers about whom Deputy McQuillan spoke, the small farmers west of the Shannon.  In my opinion, they are the farmers who should be the first care of this House because they are the farmers who work for themselves.  I heard one member of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;recently saying that farmers west of the Shannon could not afford to pay their labourers an economic wage.  He has just not wakened up to the fact that west of the Shannon there are not any agricultural labourers&mdash; they are all working for themselves. Every man is on his own farm and works it with his own family.  Unless we can wake up to the fact that what is urgently necessary for these small farmers is to bring within their reach the most important modern know-how that we can bring to them, we will never get anywhere at all.</P>
    <P>I want to make this clear if I can, that the changes and developments have been so great in the last twenty-five to thirty years that it is ridiculous to imagine that they can be explained unless very special measures are taken to bring them to their knowledge.  Do Deputies realise that only within the past twenty to thirty years have we come to know what aphosphorosis in cattle is?  When I was young and starting at home and a cow's joints began to creak, they said it was rheumatics.  Finally, they began to lie down, and the better the cow, the sooner she lay down, and unfortunately had to be destroyed and buried.  It was only recently that we discovered that it was due to a lack of phosphates and can be corrected by the appropriate use of phosphates.  That knowledge is now gradually seeping down to the country, but only in recent times have people associated lack of phosphates with diseases in cattle.</P>
    <P>There are large areas in Connemara in which knowledge of that does not exist.  I remember going out in Connemara to try to sell the appropriate food supplement, or indeed to give it away to farmers out there, whose cattle were manifesting symptoms of aphosphorosis, <Col N="372" /> in order to try to bring that knowledge to them.  I want to put to the Minister for Finance, who has some knowledge of agriculture through having been Minister for Agriculture for many years, that providing access to credit, while in itself an excellent thing, is virtually useless unless, at the same time, we put within reach of the farmer the know-how to use it.</P>
    <P>I say quite deliberately that if you make available to the farmer unlimited credit without giving him any technical assistance on how he can profitably use it, far from helping him, you are putting a noose round his neck.  If you advise the small farmer to borrow all he can get for any idea that comes into his head, you will find fellows borrowing to buy tractors and elaborate outfits or equipment which lie idle for nine months of the year and which they discover too late are not earning and never can earn what will enable them to pay the half-yearly instalments due upon their debt, while, at the same time if they borrowed that amount of money, or more, and used it in accordance with a sensibly-devised plan they would find that they could lift themselves up from relative poverty into modest comfort.</P>
    <P>In present conditions, it is eminently possible on a farm of 50 acres of very moderate quality to make a profit of £800 a year.  That is not a gross profit but rather a net profit, if you allow nothing for wages.  In working a farm of 50 acres, unless his family is half-grown, a small farmer may have to get some help from time to time and may have some bill for wages at time of haymaking or harvest or for hiring a contractor to cut his corn or something of that kind.  But if every small farmer with 50 acres had an income out of that land of £700 or £800 a year, rural Ireland would be a very different place to live in.  That is possible, I know, provided the farmer has access to unlimited capital adequately to stock and fertilise his farm in order to bring it to its full capacity and adequately to crop it.  That could be done on every small farm in Ireland.</P>
    <P>On a 50-acre farm, it is possible to carry about 38 cattle, 40 ewes and their lambs and five to seven sow pigs and <Col N="373" /> at that, buy in little over and above the barley one can grow oneself.  If you got a top yield of barley&mdash;which few do get&mdash;I doubt if you have to buy in anything except protein supplements when you could not get skim milk.  I do not say that is going to be realised on every 50-acre farm but that is possible. The essential prerequisite is technical know-how and on exactly similar farms if you make unlimited credit available to ambitious enterprising young fellows who have not technical know-how, they can sink themselves in a morass of debt and end up on the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Why can we not try to face that problem and deal with it?  Every country in the world, as far as I know, has accepted the necessity of a national agricultural advisory service.  If, in every rural parish in Ireland, we had a competent agricultural scientist whose function would be to provide leadership to the farmers and whose job would be to be readily available to every farmer to maximise the production of his holding and to bring him to the Agricultural Credit Corporation if he required credit or to the bank or wherever credit is available and help him as Mr. Smith&mdash;Lord have mercy on him&mdash;helped me to do the job, we could revolutionise the whole face of the country and&mdash;what is more important, I believe&mdash;we could nearly double the output of the land.</P>
    <P>I want to differentiate clearly between the small farmer, the man who is living on 60 acres of land or less, and the big farmer with 100 acres to 500 acres.  Most men farming 100 to 500 acres, if they have not know-how, have the means to get it for themselves and if they will not do that, you cannot force it on them and I do not think we should try.  You will always get an odd fellow who has more land than he is able to work and just is not fit for the job.  I do not belong to the school of thought which says that entitles the State to take that man by the neck and throw him out of his own home and take over the land.  I think security of tenure for all of us is cheaply bought by allowing an occasional oddity to retain his land and we must suffer in <Col N="374" /> patience even if the land is not being well run, in the hope and belief that whoever comes after him will do a better job.  But the larger farmer usually can get technical help if he wants it.  I would make it much more readily available to him under a national agricultural advisory service but I would not expect to see as dramatic a change or development on the relatively large farms as I am convinced we would see on the small farms.</P>
    <P>It is the danger of these small holdings being abandoned that I consider to be the greatest menace confronting the country at present.  To me, the deep tragedy of that situation is that it is wholly unnecessary because, if these holdings are effectively used, they can provide a decent living for the people who live upon them and an opportunity of raising a family far superior to the opportunity they will have in Britain or elsewhere.  It is perfectly true that many of these small farmers might be able to go and, by labouring in a big industrial city, get a larger monetary reward but when it comes to sending their children to school, supervising the company their children keep and when it comes to a variety of other considerations infinitely more enduring in value than the actual money income, we shall find plenty of people who will have the wisdom and perspicacity to see that if they get a fair living on their own holdings at home, they will be much better off rearing a family in this country than they would be if living in two or three rooms in London, Birmingham, Manchester or elsewhere. But they will not get a fair living without technical know-how coupled with the availability of credit.  I must say it is a thing that exasperates me to see, in various parts of the country, one farmer who is getting the maximum return from his land surrounded by a dozen neighbours, none of whom is getting much more than half what he could get if he knew how to go about it.</P>
    <P>Anything which makes credit more readily available to the farmers is welcome to me but I warn the Minister that credit without know-how will <Col N="375" /> achieve very little and may, instead of proving a benefit, prove a great stumbling block to the small farmers of this country.  Provided that we had an adequate national advisory service, I want to make some suggestions in regard to the details of the proposals of this Bill.  Heretofore, the Agricultural Credit Corporation was restricted to advancing 50 per cent. of the value of the holding.  The Minister now says that that is to be raised to 66 and two-thirds per cent.  I think that limit is too low if the advance is going to be properly used.  I can readily see small farms where an advance of 100 per cent. of the value of the holding could be advantageously used.  I would provide such an advance if I were convinced that the man knew how to use it.  I suggest to the Minister that that limit is too low and I think that an arbitrary limit is probably a mistake. I think it would be better to leave it to the Corporation to determine for itself what it is prudent to advance in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The second thing I want to say to the Minister is on the question of guarantors.  I know that under some of the Department's schemes, a guarantor is stipulated for.  I had a very queer experience in that regard.  We had an Agricultural Advisory Council which advised the Minister for Agriculture from time to time when I was Minister.  On this matter I had a long and bloody encounter with the Department of Finance but finally they said that, as I seemed to be set on it, they would be prepared to agree to a scheme on an experimental basis under which there would be no guarantor.  I went in triumph to the Agricultural Advisory Council and asked them what they would think if we abolished the whole business of guarantors.  Rather to my horror and amazement, there were loud cries of protest.</P>
    <P>I accepted that advice but the more I thought about it since, the more convinced I have been that I was wrong. Small farmers simply will not go to their neighbours and ask them to guarantee them.  If a neighbour came to me and asked me to guarantee him, I would not do so.  I have never done <Col N="376" /> it in my life.  I would ask him how much he wanted and, if I would be prepared to guarantee him, I would say that I would lend it to him myself if I had it.  I will not guarantee to pay £50 because when the time came, I might not have it.  I think that any man who guarantees his neighbour in the bank is a foolish man and many people enter into guarantees of that kind who have not the means to meet them.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the system ought to be persisted in and I would be interested to hear what the Minister thinks of that.  I should like the Minister to say how often does the Corporation have to have recourse to the guarantor to recover.  I should also like to know if, where that recourse has to be had, the Agricultural Credit Corporation can say with a clear conscience that they have made adequate inquiries.  If you are going to give a man a loan of money and if you cannot depend upon the borrower, you had better not make the loan at all.  I think that if a man is worthy of credit and if he satisfies the Corporation that he is going to make good use of it, the necessity for guarantees does not exist.  I would nearly go so far as to say that where a man is worthy of a loan only where a guarantee is provided, he is not worthy of a loan at all.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should review that position and, if he is satisfied with my suggestion, that he should suggest to the Corporation that they drop the system of guarantees. Some of the best men in rural Ireland, particularly west of the Shannon, will not ask their neighbours to guarantee them.  A chancer, who has not the slightest intention of paying the debt if he can avoid it, will not have the slightest compunction in searching the whole townland for two dupes.  The man who is reluctant to ask his neighbour to guarantee him is the man who will pay his debt.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider that matter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could reinforce that suggestion by drawing the Minister's attention to the anomaly that if a <Col N="377" /> small farmer wants to get £100 to invest in his holding, the procedures associated with getting it are prolonged and complicated.  If he takes it into his head to buy a T.V. set, all he has to do is to walk down the street to the shop, select his set and the T.V. dealer puts a form in front of him to which he signs his name and he can bring the set home with him.  He can fill the kitchen with T.V. sets, radios, washing machines and cookers and involve himself in nothing more complicated than signing his name to a form.  We all know that it is true, of course, that in these contracts he is paying a relatively high rate of interest.  I suppose that is part of the penalty of having recourse to that method of raising credit.  It seems to me we ought to be able to simplify the procedure for borrowing in the case of farmers who want to buy something to expand production.  The problem is how are you to find out, with any degree of certainty, how the man will use the money that he seeks to borrow?  I do not see that there is any means of doing that without an adequate national agricultural advisory service which will provide a sufficient number of what I like to call parish agents&mdash; call them what you like&mdash;to provide ultimately, in the areas where they are most needed, at least one effective agent in every parish who, over the years, will acquire both with banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation the reputation that, if he countersigns a plan of campaign for any particular small farmer, that is a <i>bona fide</i> proposition and deserving of the credit requisite to support it; and the understanding will remain that he will be constantly on call in the immediate neighbourhood of that farmer's holding to help him carry the plan to completion.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are inclined to answer to that: &ldquo;But you will get bad and you will get good agricultural instructors.&rdquo; That is true of us all; you will get bad Deputies and good Deputies. But there is the difference that, if you have an adequate agricultural advisory service under which each officer is responsible for his own area &mdash;a limited area like a parish&mdash;it <Col N="378" /> should be possible for the control of that service to go to him and say: &ldquo;Look at this parish for which you have been responsible for the last three or four years.  It is worse now than when you came into it.  It may be that the farmers will not co-operate with you.  It may be that they do not like you or that they do not trust you.  The only solution is to move you elsewhere and get in someone else who will command their confidence and support in putting into operation on their holdings the know-how and the work requisite to improve each holding and consequently the whole parish for which you are responsible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ultimately one could create a situation in which the appearance of the district under the control of each parish agent would be his testimonial or his condemnation.  When we get that I believe these provisions in regard to agricultural credit may bear fruit but, unless and until we get that, I very much doubt that they will.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister in the course of his speech refer to increased credit facilites for co-operative societies.  I never remember any co-operative society being refused money by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  My experience was that I could not persuade the co-operative societies to go and look for it.  All the time I was there I never remember a single case of a co-operative society being refused credit by the Agricultural Credit Corporation but I remember several occasions on which I urged co-operative societies to go and borrow money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to expand further the output of their own members, and their refusing to do so. I do not fully understand, therefore, what the Minister has in mind when he seeks to improve facilities of that character.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in any effort he makes to expand credit for the farmers, always providing that, hand in hand with that, he makes available to those who want it access to the know-how as to how best it may used. If we could achieve that I believe we could precipitate a substantial revolution in the livelihood of the farmers of this country but, without the know-how, <Col N="379" /> credit will not serve the purpose we have in mind.  We have in this country hundreds of first-class agricultural graduates who are looking for work.  Many of them are emigrating to get it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should suggest to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, that these men should be mobilised forthwith for the assistance of our own people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to conclude without referring to the question of horticulture. I think there is probably a very fine future in front of specialised branches of horticulture.  There is in this country, however, an acute shortage of competent horticultural instructors. I know that when we were expanding the apple co-operative in Dungarvan we would never have got anywhere, if we had not provided centralised services, advisory and technical, from the co-operative committees to help the farmers over the initial stages of changing their marketing methods.  Even with all that help, we experienced very considerable difficulty in persuading the farmers to remain loyal to their own co-operatives and not sell their stuff elsewhere when it appeared temporarily convenient for them to do so.</P>
    <P>If we are to have any effective expansion in the production of soft fruit, hard fruit and vegetables, it is urgently necessary that we should have an adequate horticultural advisory service.  I do not believe you will ever get that under the present system because it requires very highly specialised direction.  It is not ordinarily true that the local authorities' chief agricultural adviser is a horticulturist. Indeed, it ought not to be true.  He ought not to be usually a horticulturist.  The average agricultural instructor is not competent to direct an advisory service primarily designed for horticulture.  That is an added reason for a national agricultural advisory service where the requisite technique and direction of such a service can be obtained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but, in fact, the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks that credit could be sought for the development of horticultural enterprises and that there might be diversification.  In fact, he said one of his hopes was that there would be substantial diversification from the ordinary branches of agriculture, as we know them, into a more intense development of horticultural pursuits. There is no doubt that there is scope for expansion there but there is no branch of the agricultural industry in which a man can more rapidly ruin himself than intensive horticulture, unless he has adequate technical advice as to how to go about it and how to market the product of his labour.  I do not want to dwell unduly on that aspect of the situation, beyond saying that there is no branch where technical advice is more urgently necessary than horticulture.  Most of us have plenty of experience of that.</P>
      <P>The only way to provide it is under a national agricultural advisory service properly organised and in a position to maintain constant and effective contact with the Agricultural Research Institute for the purpose of bringing the fruits of its research activities to the farmers in the shortest possible time.  I should like to expand on that but I do not wish to try the patience of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude by saying this: One of the great dangers with which we are confronted here is that we will get so wrapped up in providing credit facilities and this and that that we will allow the Agricultural Research Institute to get immured in its own ivory tower and forget that one of its principal reasons for being is that the results of its research should be communicated to the farmers at the earliest possible moment and in the most effective way possible.  Credit, yes, by all means, but let it be informed credit.  Let <Col N="381" /> those who avail of it have the knowledge how best to use it.  Give them that and I think there is great hope for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few observations to make with regard to this Bill.  At the outset, I should like to say that I regard its introduction as a very important step in the efforts by the Government to improve the agricultural industry and, moreover, to bring about a state of affairs in the industry where a greater volume of employment will be available from it.</P>
      <P>I think there have always been very mixed opinions in regard to the credit facilities that should be available for agriculture.  The policy of the commercial banks in that regard has never been very flexible up to recent times.  There was a period, of course, many years ago, during the first World War, when, evidently, the commercial banks lent money to agricultural interests without much difficulty.  Apparently, that experience led to a rather unsatisfactory state of affairs in later years. Perhaps that was one of the reasons why the banks rather tightened within the period 1930 to 1958.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, the commercial banks have been as co-operative as one could reasonably expect in the circumstances in regard to the credit requirements of the agricultural industry at all times.  Some years ago, in order to have some semi-State organisation to take care of these requirements, the Government of the time set up the Agricultural Credit Corporation and assigned to it functions with regard to agricultural credit.  Here I should like to pay a compliment to the directors and management of the Corporation in general for the very efficient and helpful manner in which they handled the problems given them at the time.  One is inclined to get irritated with the Corporation because of the conservative policy they seemed to adopt up to now in the lending of money.  In that regard it is only fair that cognisance should be taken of the terms of reference and regulations which apply to the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government meant well <Col N="382" /> by tying up the Corporation in a way they thought it was safe to do, but in practice, the hands of the Corporation were tied altogether too much.  If that was not so, then the Corporation tied their own hands.  There have been complaints among agricultural interests for many years that the lending facilities of the Corporation were not satisfactory.  Indeed, public representatives and others who had some experience of dealing with the Corporation on behalf of their constituents and others, found that their attitude as a whole was one of caution, but there were difficulties in which they found themselves occasionally and which made it impossible for them to facilitate applicants.</P>
    <P>Within recent years and within the past three years in particular, the commercial banks, in my opinion, have loosened out considerably in the matter of providing agricultural credit.  One particular bank led the way in that regard by introducing a scheme in the early stages of the bovine tuberculosis eradication drive for the purchase of stock which had to be replaced as a result of the tuberculosis tests at that time.  That was a very praiseworthy arrangement.  It was one which set a headline for the other commercial banking interests in the country and I am glad that the other interests followed. I am quite sure, however, that little would have been done at the time, were it not for the fact that one bank had the courage to come out and offer these terms to farmers on a flexible basis.  I am told by people in a position to speak upon the subject with some authority that the banks' experience in that connection is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The time has come when most people intend to pay if they get a loan. I have never taken the view that people in general obtain loans with the idea of not paying them.  I think every borrower intends to pay a loan except a very small number.  What in practice prevents a borrower from repaying a loan is that he obtains it for a purpose which does not give the results that appeared possible at the time the loan was obtained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon touched on that point <Col N="383" /> when he suggested that advantage should be taken more fully of the services of agricultural advisers in the matter of obtaining loans.  The advice of the agricultural advisers should be taken very seriously by concerns such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation or commercial banks in the matter of loans for the general improvement of agriculture.  I feel the time is at hand when agricultural instructors and advisers should be encouraged to initiate proposals for the general improvement of agriculture for individual farmers.  The approval of the local advisers should be sufficient guarantee for the lending agency concerned.</P>
    <P>The general attitude of banks towards giving credit is necessarily cautious.  It is much easier to give out money than to get it in.  The banks have moved pretty well with the times in recent years and it is true to say that at the present moment no worthwhile project, whether agricultural or industrial, is held up for want of financial accommodation.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are in business know that banks can be pretty difficult in connection with certain proposals at certain times.  Because of their unsatisfactory experience in one direction or another, their attitude can stiffen, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse, in a short time.  By and large, the attitude of banking concerns and lending agencies has been generally the same so far as agriculture is concerned. Land, however, has always been considered a better security than industrial property in general.  The main difficulty that the banks have had with agriculturists is that they were often careless to attend to the details involved in obtaining and renewing loans.</P>
    <P>I think it is unlikely to happen but it would be a bad thing if any lending agency were to lend money for purposes other than those which would be likely to be highly reproductive.  I am quite sure we can depend on the judgment and wisdom of the Agricultural Credit Corporation to ensure that money is not made available except for purposes which would tend to improve <Col N="384" /> national productivity, as required by Government policy of the day.</P>
    <P>It will be a good thing if this extension of agricultural credit will help to increase the employment content of the agricultural industry.  There has been a decline in the number of people employed in agriculture in recent years.  That tendency is beginning to worry people who have responsibility for such a state of affairs. Machinery and mechanisation have been responsible for some of the decline.  There is a problem there that will have to be tackled and perhaps it should be tackled now that facilities for the extension of activity in agriculture are being afforded through the medium of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is quite a lot of work to be done in agriculture which has had to remain undone because money was not available to pay for the labour and material required. The attitude of farmers, particularly of those in the older age groups, has been rather conservative in that connection.  A farmer usually thinks it unwise to borrow money for the purposes of his farm whereas a businessman under similar conditions would have no hesitation in obtaining a loan for the purpose of his business. The farmers' mentality in that connection can be appreciated.  They have not the same possibilities of turnover as exist in business and naturally, they have to be somewhat cautious and avoid incurring liabilities which it may not be easy to discharge.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that schemes of agricultural development having a high labour content submitted for loan accommodation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation should have very special priority. There is a pattern of priorities in existence in some Departments of Government.  There is in the Minister's Department the Employment Schemes Office which administers works in connection with minor drainage and roads.  They have a very good system in that special consideration, one might say special priority, is given to schemes having high utility value and, above all, high labour content.  That is a very important consideration.  It has <Col N="385" /> been fortunate for the workers that such a condition has applied to most schemes sanctioned by the Employment Schemes Office of the Minister's Department.  Otherwise, of course, many schemes might have been sanctioned and public money spent on projects that would be of little value from the point of view of employing labour.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that the Corporation under its new powers should get special directions from the Minister to consider as favourably as possible schemes which, on the advice of the local agricultural adviser, have a high labour content.  In other words, the fact that a scheme has a high labour content should go a long way to qualify it for the accommodation that is sought.</P>
    <P>We are told that this Bill has been introduced as a result of the Gilmore Report which was presented to the Government following a survey of agricultural credit in Ireland.  Every Deputy got a copy of that report and it was a very interesting document. Generally speaking, I considered it was a fair report of the investigation of our existing agricultural credit system.  I notice, however, that there was a tendency to work out calculations on the American system.  In America credit is accepted as an everyday experience, both in agriculture and industry.  I do not think we could ever hope to establish a credit system based entirely on the American pattern.  If we had a simple system, such as we have had up to the present, whereby agricultural interests can have recourse to accommodation facilities without too much red tape and difficulty, we will have what we want.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Minister has seen fit in framing this legislation to provide that agricultural interests themselves may subscribe to the share capital of the Corporation.  The fact that they are now offered an interest in the financial structure of the Corporation will encourage them to invest in the Corporation to the best of their ability and, also, will make them more favourably disposed towards obtaining <Col N="386" /> accommodation from the Corporation. In other words, the farmers who want accommodation are going back to themselves for whatever money they require. The facilities provided under the new Bill will give farmers and agricultural interests generally an effective means of greater expansion in their activities and it is to be hoped they will avail of these facilities.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned the question of guarantors.  In the past, the Agricultural Credit Corporation were somewhat sticky on that point. I agree with Deputy Dillon that we must get away from that idea.  Most people nowadays have enough to do to guarantee themselves without guaranteeing their neighbours and they are not inclined to do it.  This business of guaranteeing was introduced in bank practice many years ago and has never been changed with the times.  I submit that the borrower's integrity is as important as any security he may offer.  If he is not a man of integrity, security is not of much importance. Once a man's integrity is accepted, it must be decided whether he is the type of person who will settle down and get the return he should get from the money borrowed.</P>
    <P>This requirement on which the Corporation has insisted of having guarantors, particularly for small loans, was very objectionable to farmers and militated considerably against agricultural credit arrangements.  In the circumstances, I sincerely hope the Minister will be able to persuade the directors of the Corporation to get away from this idea of guaranteeing in all cases and substitute some other qualification which would probably give results as satisfactory, if not more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Hire purchase is mentioned in this Bill.  It is about time the Agricultural Credit Corporation arranged hire purchase facilities in respect of equipment and machinery for agricultural purposes. We have quite a number of commercial hire purchase concerns and this Bill proposes to add another.  In the ordinary course of events, there is <Col N="387" /> no need for another hire purchase company if it is to follow the pattern of those already in existence for the buying of machinery etc., and for the provision of transport facilities and all the rest.  I hope the Agricultural Credit Corporation in embarking on this hire purchase business will strike out on a new line altogether.</P>
    <P>The credit arrangements already in force through the Department of Agriculture in respect of the purchase of machinery, and so on, could hardly be beaten.  What impressed me most about it was that it was a simple procedure whereby a decision was given without undue delay.  The merchant who handled the deal was usually familiar with the procedure and made all arrangements for the borrower and was able to supply the equipment in a short time after the application was made.  It worked out very well.  I had experience myself of selling equipment to farmers under that system and it was most satisfactory.</P>
    <P>If that system is to continue, there is not a whole lot the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be called on to take on.  I am assuming that the Department will gradually get clear of the existing loan facilities and that same will be taken over by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If that is so, I hope the terms and provisions for that type of hire purchase will be as favourable under the Agricultural Credit Corporation as they have been under the Department.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in relation to the hire purchase of farm equipment is that the rate of interest is considered by farmers to be too high.  The machines and equipment they purchase are such that they do not give a very high return for a number of years and the amount the farmers can repay to a hire purchase company is, of necessity, rather limited.  If there is a high rate of interest charged for the accommodation, a farmer is not inclined to avail of it.  He would rather do without the article than pay as much interest as principal to have it.  There should now be a new approach to this problem by the Agricultural Credit Corporation otherwise it would be as well <Col N="388" /> to let the Department's agency and the commercial banks handle the farmers' requirements in that regard. Something very useful could be achieved if the procedure I suggest is followed when this Bill becomes law and the Corporation set up the hire purchase organisation.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the number of directors is to be increased.  I presume those who subscribe the capital will have some representation on the new board.  What is important, in my opinion, is that people with specialised knowledge of agriculture and in regard to agricultural machinery and equipment should be represented on the board.  If the board is to take wise decisions on applications coming before it for accommodation, it can only do so if it is manned by that type of person.  There are a large number of existing interests that could give valuable assistance to the board, if they were represented on it.  Now that the opportunity is presented to the Minister of increasing the personnel on the board, I hope that suggestion will be taken into consideration.  It is highly desirable also that an agricultural adviser with some years of experience should be available to the board, preferably as a member, but, if there is any objection to that, certainly as the head advisory officer.</P>
    <P>I do not know if such people are already on the staffs of the board, but if they are not, I think they should be brought in under this new arrangement. The time has come when farmers realise how important it is to accept the technical advice now available to them, and in practice they now do so. The advisers are in close touch with farmers and can give them invaluable advice on the seeking of loans for the improvement of their economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rate of interest on these loans, as I said at the outset, the commercial banks have met the requirements of the farmers generally for the past few years.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has been in existence and will be in existence in the future, but unless they provide loans to farmers at a much more favourable rate of interest than the commercial banks, I do not think they will <Col N="389" /> be availed of.  Unless there is a change in their approach to applications for accommodation during the years to come, the Corporation will not be serving the purpose it was set up to achieve.</P>
    <P>There is one way the Agricultural Credit Corporation could attract applications from farmers and naturally farmers would prefer to deal with them because of their particular set-up. They should reduce the rate of interest to an appreciable extent.  The prevailing rate of interest of the commercial banks is high and it is, of course, related, to some extent, to the price at which money can be obtained on the market.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation will find it possible to attract their requirement in capital at a more favourable interest because they are regarded as a very secure investment. Anything agricultural is regarded as of the highest security.  The Corporation can obtain their capital requirements at a reasonable rate of interest because of the gilt-edged type of business they would be conducting.  They have a small expense ratio and they should be able to make loans available to their borrowers at a reasonable rate of interest and well below the commercial banks' rate.  That matter should be examined because, if the loans are made available at the same rate as the commercial banks' rate, the average man, thinking of local convenience, will more or less avail of the commercial banks for his requirements.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Bill is very satisfactory indeed.  The increase in Corporation borrowing potential from £8.3 millions to £10 millions is welcomed, and the increase in the share capital from £300,000 to £2,000,000 indicates that the Government realise that a greater demand will be made in future on the resources of the Corporation for the purpose of financing schemes in connection with agricultural development.  I sincerely hope that the accommodation now being provided for the agricultural interests will enable them to forge ahead more successfully than in the past, and provide a greater volume of work, and <Col N="390" /> employment in general, than was possible in recent years.</P>

      <P>Any measure designed to increase agricultural output and prosperity in our main industry must be welcomed in this House.  When we examine the method by which this increased credit is to be made available, we must consider where the State will look for the capital which will go into this project.  It is only right to assume that quite a lot of the Post Office Savings Bank finance can be used for the purpose of expanding the credit to be made available now by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>I mention that because of the rate of interest proposed to be charged in respect of loans made available for agricultural purposes through the Corporation. We know ourselves the low rate of interest which is being paid for hard cash in the Post Office Savings Bank.  We know that the people who put their surplus money in the Post Office Savings Bank are getting a very small return by way of interest.  Having got the money, apparently the State will now get the benefit of it by making it available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation at a very high interest rate.  In other words, the difference between the Post Office Savings Bank interest and the interest to be charged by the Corporation will show a profit of approximately four per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has been mentioned many times in this House and outside it that, with money values as as they are at the moment, the rate of interest payable by the Post Office Savings Bank should be increased, but that has not been done. Here we have an example of how the Minister will make a profit by using this money through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering that agriculture is our main industry, this is a very welcome <Col N="391" /> measure, not only in this House but outside it.  We know that huge areas of land, thousands of acres, were laid bare in the years before the war, particularly by the policy of Fianna Fáil at that time.  The increased capital will enable the agricultural community to increase their stock on the land in the form of machinery, housing, livestock or any other type of investment which will result in the increased output which is so necessary.  It has taken private enterprise to demonstrate to the Agricultural Credit Corporation the great possibilities which exist for the expansion of agricultural output by lending money, and by increasing credit to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Nearly 1,000,000 acres of land are stocked by private enterprise, by companies which have set themselves up and devised a scheme whereby livestock can be purchased, produced and marketed under a lending scheme.  The private companies engaged in these projects are making a very valuable contribution to agriculture because they are making available to the farming community a type of credit which previously they have been unable to get.  It has been difficult for many farmers to get sufficient credit from the commercial banks which would enable them to increase their stock on the land, or their output from the land, such as seeding and harvesting all fertile land, apart from the production of livestock.  The banks are business people and naturally when they look at the average earnings of the people engaged in agriculture they can see for themselves that the prospects of getting interest, or a return on loans for agricultural purposes are not very rosy.  A prosperity must be created there which will enable the loans to be repaid, with interest, to the commercial banks concerned.</P>
    <P>A State concern, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, was established and intended to be operated for the expansion of agricultural output. Between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 is spent by the State every year in the form of capital investment.  We must examine what proportion of that £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 capital investment goes into productive agricultural <Col N="392" /> enterprises.  A very large part of that capital investment is in the nature of a permanent investment which is not productive.  Here we have an example of an organisation such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation intended to stimulate production by the issue of the necessary credits and loans.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy who mentioned that the loan ceiling of 66? per cent. is on the low side.  I do not suggest that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should go into competition with the hire purchase firms who, in respect of certain articles, are prepared to give a 99 per cent. loan, because the hire purchase firms can make good their losses through that policy by charging a very high interest rate.  Naturally, we could not expect the Agricultural Credit Corporation to increase the loan ceiling because the interest rate would be a burden and would prevent those engaged in agriculture from seeking the necessary finance.  Therefore, while advocating a lower rate of interest and a higher ceiling to be made available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, I do not suggest they should go up to the high percentage which is made available by various hire purchase firms for the purpose, in many cases, of consumer goods, which explains the high interest rate.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the past has been conservative. They could not be blamed for that.  The policy of the State and the Government determined exactly what the policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be.  The Corporation depended on the State and the Government to provide the necessary machinery to enable them to engage in a system whereby credit and loans could be made available to those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Travelling through the country, one can see thousands of acres of derelict land.  The sod is not turned.  It is producing nothing.  It is not carrying cattle or sheep.  The farmsteads are bare.  You will not find pigs or poultry there.  The reason is economic.  This country has huge acres of fertile land and capacity for a vast surplus of food, be it meat or vegetables or any other <Col N="393" /> type of production from the land we could expect.  That fertile land is lying there waiting to be used.  Its wealth is not being used because under our present system those huge surpluses could not be disposed of.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall see the day when capital investment in agriculture, through the Agricultural Credit Corporation or any other State concern, will be geared to such an extent that we shall be able to avail of the fertility of this land to produce a huge surplus which could be marketed to 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 people in the Common Market pool.  I consider that the Government have been too timid in examining the possibilities in the Common Market.  There are wonderful opportunities and possibilities there for the sale of our huge surpluses from our fertile land.  The Government are afraid to look at those possibilities or even to consider taking advantage of them because they feel that our participation in the Common Market might interfere with the industrial side of our economy.</P>
    <P>We have seen demonstrated in recent times that those of our people engaged in industry are well capable of meeting and beating competition.  We cannot expect our industrialists to counteract or defeat a system of dumping, but, with our manpower and the intelligence and capacity of those engaged in industry from the lowest to the highest in those factories, I feel certain our industrialists can meet and beat competition on an equal basis in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when considering making more credit available for agriculture to expand our output, we should take a proper look at the possibilities in the Common Market and should not be afraid to participate in it.  This fertile land of ours can produce vast quantities of food at a reasonably low price which would be available to the consumers in that Common Market. I am not afraid of our industrialists in this country in relation to that Common Market.  There is provision to ensure that the industry of any country will not be destroyed or upset by unfair trading such as a policy of dumping.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> When considering the making of credit available which will obviously result and should result in increased output, we must immediately consider where we shall find a market for the surplus output.  With a dwindling population and with surpluses already available in various classes of food from our land, we must look to an export market.  In considering extra credit and finance, we must immediately seek a place where the increased output will be marketed.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture in the first inter-Party Government, he took a step in the right direction towards the expansion of agriculture through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but, even at that time, it was a conservative step.  We did not at that time have the prospect of a huge market available to producers such as the Common Market now offers.  There is amongst the agricultural community, particularly the progressive farmers, a great anxiety that they should be given an opportunity of participating in the benefits offered by the Common Market, with its millions of consumers.  Following the expansion of credit for agriculture, we must seek an outlet for the increased production that will result.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the reluctance of neighbours to guarantee a farmer seeking a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Anyone familiar with conditions in the rural areas knows that a farmer hesitates when asked to guarantee a loan for a neighbour. The Agricultural Credit Corporation should insist that any farmer seeking a loan from them should open a bank account.  Instead of guarantors, a quarterly account from a bank manager should be required so they can see what progress a man is making.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of short-term loans rather than long-term loans for agriculture. In the case of long-term loans, too much money is tied up for too long and there is, if you like, a long period of taxation imposed on the output of that holding.  When the Agricultural Credit Corporation make a loan, they should follow a policy of <Col N="395" /> specifying the purpose for which that money will be used.  For instance, I would not be in favour of making credit available for the production of some commodity which is already surplus on the home market.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation can play a large part in determining output and production in agriculture in relation to goods that can be exported and marketed abroad, and I believe they should concentrate on that.  However good the security may be for a loan, if the purpose for which it is required is not one with an export potential, they should be hesitant about making credit available.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation can bring great advantage to this country if they can point the way in the matter of finance for production and if they can determine the purpose for which this money is to be used.</P>
    <P>When this credit and finance is made available, it will be of great advantage to those who obtain it to have technical advice.  We have committees of agriculture employing agricultural, horticultural and other instructors whose advice would certainly be a great benefit to the farming community, whether it be in connection with loans for livestock, for agriculture or even for ordinary crop production. I hope it will be possible for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to act in liaison with these committees.  In these days organised effort is absolutely essential to meet and beat competition in any field.  That is being demonstrated very effectively in industry at present.  The farmers are ready to do their part if somebody will step in between them and the consumers to ensure that, as a result of their efforts, the increased output can be profitably marketed.</P>
    <P>If we get good results from this proposal&mdash;and I believe it should be only the beginning of an expansion in credit for agriculture&mdash;we can be certain that a good measure of security and prosperity will be created in the rural areas.  At present, emigration is mainly from the rural areas.  Emigration takes place from the urban areas <Col N="396" /> only when people are absolutely forced out to keep body and soul together or, perhaps, to maintain a family at home.  In the rural areas, the average earnings are low.  In fact, the average earnings of those engaged in agriculture are barely above subsistence level.  So long as that situation exists, the enterprising and energetic members of the community will seek to improve their lot and go where they can find better conditions.  They will not remain in a situation in which they have no opportunity of attaining a reasonable standard of living.  That is why I feel this measure, or any other measure to provide credit for agriculture and promote greater output and better marketing, is one that should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>A large field for the expansion of credit for agriculture still remains.  I hope the Government will take another look at the possibilities offered by the Common Market.  This effort to improve credit facilities will be wasted, if it is not followed up by a search for further markets to absorb increased output.  If we do not get an increased average income for the people engaged in agriculture by this measure, or by any other means, we cannot expect greater prosperity in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the private enterprises which have already made millions of pounds available in the form of loans, particularly in the livestock and dairying industries, have contributed a great measure of prosperity to the people to whom those loans were available, having regard to present circumstances and the demand for meat.  This Bill is, of course, going to make loans available in other fields, apart from livestock.  It will make loans available to agriculture.  I can envisage this scheme making loans available for the erection of glass-houses. Many people wishing to engage in horticulture, and particularly those wishing to avail of loans for glass-houses, must look to the bank manager and, as I say, the bank manager, without the necessary security, is hesitant about providing the money because the export market at the present time is <Col N="397" /> not as good as it could be if we changed our attitude towards the Common Market.</P>
    <P>With those glass-houses, many people engaged in horticulture can produce two or three crops in the space of 12 months.  I have mentioned glass-houses because not all of our landowners have a large area of land.  I feel that their output from a small area of land could be very great, if it were in the form of the concentrated output which we could expect from glass-houses.  This scheme will also enable farmers to provide suitable farm sheds.  In many farms at present, the one noticeable thing is that there are very few outbuildings or sheds.  I feel that every farm should have at least one large, sound shed in which agricultural activities can be carried out, regardless of the weather. Many farms are without proper housing, but if we went on the principle that every farm should have at least one large, sound shed, it would be of great advantage.  The small Land Commission holdings are provided with such sheds because the necessity for them is realised.</P>
    <P>There are many farmsteads, however, where there are very old houses and very bad accommodation because they are very small holdings and because credit is not available to the owners which would enable them to build a good utility shed in which the various activities of the farmstead could be carried on.  This measure, with the alterations it proposes to make, will afford great opportunities to those engaged in agriculture, but it is up to the Government to take immediate steps for the purpose of absorbing the increased output which is the only hope those engaged in agriculture can have.  If their output is not to go up, and go up dramatically, we shall not have prosperity and emigration from rural areas will continue.  When we are considering increasing our output and creating surpluses, we must immediately find a market for those surpluses. I feel the market is amongst the countries of the Common Market and we would be wasting our time if we did not, first of all, make sure there was a market for that output.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>We who are farmers welcome this Bill, especially if it goes as far as we hope it will.  Some of us have had experience of going to the Corporation and I know of a farmer who looked for £800 and who, although his farm was worth £8,000, was refused.  It is natural to expect that such lands will not be well stocked or well financed; otherwise, such people would not be looking for a loan.  Therefore, I hope that some freedom will be given in that direction.  I am not advocating free credit or throwing the doors wide open and having the money &ldquo;dished&rdquo; out freely.  We know of people who had to suffer heavily for years trying to catch up on their commitments.  It is a sorry thing when we see some farmers buying machines which they could do without and, indeed, some of the money which they obtained on loan goes to purchase motor cars.  That is all very fine until the day arrives when they have to pay the money back.  In regard to the question of paying instalments at a certain time, I think the month of May is a bad time.  It is a time when farmers are trying to get stock.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Sweetman to the decline in the cow population since 1st January.  One could nearly see that coming because people were inclined to get rid of their stock, especially cows, because the time was coming when they would not be getting their headage grant.</P>
      <P>In regard to heifers, I have known heifers going on the market at £70. I wonder where they are going because farmers are trying to get store heifers to keep for breeding purposes and I am surprised that there should be a decline there.  As I say in-calf heifers are making £70 and perhaps more.  I do not see many short-horn heifers offered for sale, but the point is that if they are failing in the test, perhaps they are being sold off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition spoke about agricultural advice and about having an inspector in every parish.  I do not agree with him there.  We in North Tipperary are very well serviced and we have two of the parish plan <Col N="399" /> agents and we are fully supplied with all the service we can get, if we want to avail of it.</P>
    <P>Many of our farmers are handicapped through lack of capital and the question was raised by Deputy McQuillan with regard to small farmers, even small farmers with 40 statute acres with a valuation of only £10 to £15, which averages at 9/6d. a statute acre.  They are lucky enough in that because it comes to about 25/-or 30/- an acre in my area, with less acreage, and they are still making a living.  There is a good scheme operated through the Sugar Company and the Beet Growers' Association for growing fruit and vegetables which is very advantageous to the small farmer and it would be a great help even to the cottiers.</P>
    <P>Stability of prices is very important for farmers.  I have been listening to farmers complaining for the past five or six months, even when cattle were selling for as little as £5 10s. a cwt., but if they had sold at that time and got in stock, they would have far more money now.  If they go out to buy now, they will pay £6 or £7 a cwt.  If they had sold and re-stocked, they could have reaped a good profit.  This is similar to the case of some farmers who failed to save their crops.  Deputy Rooney spoke of acres of land left idle and that is quite true.  The farmers said they had no way of keeping cattle through the winter and now they say they are not able to buy them.  No Government can cope with that sort of thing.  Practically everybody could see the time coming when cattle prices would go up again.</P>
    <P>It is true that farmers have increased production, but they become discouraged when they find they cannot sell their produce.  Deputy Rooney spoke of farmers leaving the land and that is a big problem down in my area.  These farmers find they do not make sufficient money out of their produce to pay a decent wage to the workers.  They cannot compete with Bord na Móna or the Sugar Company where men can get £10 or £12 a week. If we seek increased prices for our <Col N="400" /> produce, we put up the price of milk and sugar and so on and there is an outcry: &ldquo;See what the Government are doing now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in the hope that it will assist trustworthy farmers to obtain credit more readily.  Surely a man seeking an £800 loan and having a farm worth £8,000 has good security?  I think this Bill will help towards solving these problems.  I am not surprised that the cow population has gone down because people are now inclined to get rid of them more quickly but the drop in heifer population surprises me.  Heifers are a very paying proposition even if kept for the farmer's own use as milking cows.  On the market a two and a half year old heifer will make £70 today.</P>
    <P>The man who goes borrowing goes sorrowing, it is said, and we have had some experience of that.  I believe that the farmers are not grousing about the interest they must pay; they are willing to pay the increased interest if they can get the money for their produce. All the borrowing in the world, however, will not make the farming community happy if it is not spent in the right way.  I trust that this Bill will mean some relief to creditworthy farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this Bill is to provide means for an increased output of agricultural produce.  I think that is intimately bound up with the stability of the prices the farming community can get for their produce. They have had a rather unfortunate experience over the last few years in that respect.  They have to face the possibility of the markets not coming up to expectations as well as the vagaries of the weather.  Farmers nowadays are inclined to be sceptical about the benefits of increased production, if it does not mean more money for them, an increase in their real income and a rise in the standard of living on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers west of the Shannon have been mentioned but we also have a very large number of these small farmers in the south and there we have also the immense problem <Col N="401" /> lem of the eradication of bovine T.B. because the basis of the southern economy is the dairy farm.  One thing that struck me in regard to the Minister's statement about the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is the fact that they are able to pay a dividend of four-and-a-half per cent. It is nice to be able to say that and I am sure the Minister, holding practically the entire capital of the Corporation, is very pleased, but I would plead with him to impress on the Corporation that they can afford to make credit available more cheaply to the community for whom they are supposed to cater.</P>
    <P>If, on State money, they can declare a dividend of four-and-a-half per cent. it might be pointed out that some of the money they obtain from small investors earns those investors only about two per cent.  The State, on one hand, through some of these bodies is using that money and able to earn a dividend of four-and-a-half per cent.  Therefore I think the case could be made that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should so amend their schemes as to make credit more easily available and at a cheaper rate of interest.  I cannot see why the interest rate should be six-and-a-half per cent., when they are earning a dividend of four and a half per cent. at the same time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fanning spoke of a farmer owning a farm worth £8,000 and seeking credit of £800.  We all know that we have had approaches to make on behalf of people to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and through speaking to people seeking these loans, we know that not alone have they to offer that type of security but that they have to find guarantors also.  That is something that might be examined.  Otherwise, the farmers would practically be in as good a position, or perhaps better, to approach a commercial bank to obtain credit, whereas the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the scheme which the Minister is now proposing are designed to enable the farming community to obtain credit more easily for the expansion of agriculture that we all hope will come about.  It was mentioned previously that if a <Col N="402" /> farmer is regular in the payment of his annuities over, say, a five-year period, there is no reason why, having proved his ability and his <i>bona fides,</i> the value of the advance should not be stepped up in his case to almost 100 per cent. of the value of the security he offers.</P>
    <P>There is, and will continue to be, great need for these facilities and in the area I represent, where reactors have to be taken out of herds and where farmers will be involved in large capital expenditure, I think the State, through the operation of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, should be able to come more readily and more easily to the assistance of those farmers.  If the scheme which the Minister now envisages and the regulations to be made under it will provide for a more ready and easier availability of capital to the farming interests, I gladly welcome the scheme.</P>
    <P>Other points have been covered by previous speakers and I do not believe in repeating them.  However, I hope the Minister will consider the point of cheaper credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I want to say that we have had a very interesting and helpful debate on this Bill.  The points raised by speakers from all sides of the House are mostly points that we have had under consideration ourselves. While I, too, would like to find a solution for many of these problems, it is not easy to find one.  Take the points raised by Deputy Sweetman. He spoke about the reduction in the numbers of heifers and cows. I admit that that is a disappointing feature of the statistics and I know that the Minister for Agriculture is also concerned about it.  He is trying to find the cause of it; if one knows the cause one may have some hope of finding a remedy.  One point we must bear in mind, however, is that a considerable number of cows and heifers disappeared from the herds under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  That would not account for all of the reduction, however, so that farmers who breed heifers for sale must not be finding it remunerative.  Deputy Fanning said that he found it very remunerative but surely, if it were, <Col N="403" /> very many more people would go in for it.</P>
      <P>I am not troubled too much about the slight drop in the number of sheep mainly because there was an artificially high number of sheep on the hands of farmers in January, 1960.  At that time we had more cattle and sheep on hands than we would ordinarily have because farmers were unable to find a free market for their products. The fact that there has been a slight reduction in the number in January of this year as compared with January of 1960 does not cause me any worry.</P>
      <P>The next point raised by Deputy Sweetman was the question of raising the limit that can be put on a holding free of equity charges from £400 to £1,000.  He said that might do harm because it would interfere with a man's credit otherwise.  I just want to tell the House that these charges on equities apply to unknown claims that may be made such as in the case of relatives where an estate has not been administered. This charge will come in spite of them even though some unknown or lost brother or sister may appear and make a claim on the holding. However, these charges do not take precedence over any charge made by a bank or any loan of that kind and it does not interfere very much with bank credit.  Deputy Sweetman also asked about bills of exchange which are referred to in the Bill but we shall leave that over to the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>One thing we must bear in mind is that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are only lending to the farmers a small proportion of the total amount lent during the year.  The amount of increased lending by the commercial banks between October, 1958 and October, 1960 was £12,000,000.  That is a huge sum compared with what the Corporation was able to do and we must keep that fact in mind in dealing with the points raised in the debate. Another point I want to make before leaving that is that this money was not all lent for cattle raising as Deputy McQuillan has stated.  I know that loans were made, not for cattle raising, but for other branches of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the question of interest <Col N="404" /> raised by Deputy Dillon and other speakers, it is true to say that on the Continent farmers in some countries borrow at a lower rate of interest than farmers here but that is usually from their own co-operative societies. Governments may make it possible for cheap credit to be given, but that is usually done through co-operative societies.  In Great Britain farmers are paying ordinary commercial rates and they are doing that here also.</P>
    <P>It is not so easy to deal with the question of interest as only a small proportion of the money is lent by the Government.  If we said that the Government were prepared to give out money at 3½ or 4 per cent. every farmer in the country who is borrowing from a commercial bank would be inclined to change over and the Agricultural Credit Corporation could not deal with them. On the other hand, we may be giving advantages to farmers which farmers are not getting in other countries.  I do not think that other countries are giving advantages as favourable as we do in the way of particular grants for drainage, fertilisers, farm buildings and so on.  If the farmer here is worse off in the way of credit he may be better off in other ways.  It is more convenient for us to do better for him in these things, like drainage, fertilisers, and housing because it would not be possible administratively to do very much in the way of cutting down the interest rate for credit.</P>
    <P>It is true, as many speakers pointed out, that a farmer would be in a worse position by getting a loan if he did not use it properly.  That is so obvious that we all accept it.  I think you may take it that that is one of the things the Agricultural Credit Corporation would bear in mind.  Most Deputies have had the experience of going to the Corporation concerning a loan and asking why it was not granted.  I have found from my own experience that in many cases the reason given was that they did not believe that the man would be able to make proper use of it and that he would be able to repay it.  That means that they go into the matter very carefully, discuss it with the applicant and sometimes come to the conclusion that the loan would not <Col N="405" /> improve the man's position and would not be good from the Corporation's point of view because it would probably not be repaid.  Therefore, the loan is not made.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I have known farmers who got loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and they were the making of them.  They gave them the opportunity of re-stocking their lands and, perhaps, buying a few extra machines and getting into a full programme of production which enabled them to make the necessary profits to repay the loan and make a decent living on the land.  Eventually, when they were free of the loans, they were much better off.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Agricultural Credit Corporation go very deeply into the circumstances of anyone who applies for a loan.  They calculate, in their own way, what benefit the loan will bring to the prospective borrower, whether he is likely to be in a position to pay the interest and repay the capital in the stipulated time.  Deputy MacEoin need have no fear that this body would hand out loans without making full inquiries.  As far as I am concerned, the only fault I ever had to find with them was that they were too conservative and were not, if you like, optimistic enough about the possibilities of farming paying.  I think we need have no fears they will hand out money irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the two-thirds.  At the moment the rules laid down for the guidance of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in its Articles of Association stipulate that they must not lend more than half the value of the holding to any particular applicant unless he has additional security.  I mentioned in my opening speech that the Corporation have told me they intend to amend their Articles of Association to enable them to give two-thirds of the value in future.  I think Deputy Dillon asked why not remove it altogether?  Of course, the Corporation will decide in every case how much they should give.  There is, however, a good deal to be said for Deputy Dillon's suggestion and I will convey it to the Corporation.  But I <Col N="406" /> would not seek to influence them.  If they think the limit should remain at two-thirds, well and good.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of discussion about guarantors.  As far as my experience goes, they do not ask for guarantors very frequently.  Up to this, their practice has been to take a mortgage where they can get land for security.  Where it is impossible to get a mortgage, or where there is some other reason in the nature of certain exceptional circumstances, they ask for personal guarantees.  In this Bill, we are making it easier for them to lend without the necessity for a mortgage or guarantors, because we are giving them power now, first of all, to enter into hire purchase, which will make it easier for them to lend on new machines, and so forth, and we are also giving them power to charge the land.  Charging the land will be a very simple procedure.  They will merely get the consent of the borrower to charge the land and that charge will be registered.  That will normally obviate the necessity for guarantors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that he took it from my introductory remarks that the Corporation would lend to co-operative societies.  He said&mdash;I know this to be quite true because it was my own experience also&mdash;that co-operative societies had not borrowed to any great extent from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I recollect in my time as Minister for Agriculture one very large transaction, however, between a co-operative society and the Corporation.  I was not actually referring in my opening speech to co-operatives as we know them.  I was not referring, for example, to co-operative creameries.  I was referring to an expected development in co-operatives for the processing of farm produce. Every Deputy is aware that a great deal of thought is being devoted at the moment to the processing of fruit and vegetables.  There is a very big market available for all the fruit and vegetables that can be processed here.</P>
    <P>The first step is, of course, to produce them and that is something which cannot be done by the farmer, unless he is a very big farmer.  It is something, <Col N="407" /> rather, which must be done through a combination of farmers, and the obvious combination is a co-operative society.  That is the type of society I had in mind when I spoke of advances to co-operative societies.  I hope there will be a development in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned interest charges and asked what dividends were being paid.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has a share capital of only £300,000.  On that, they are paying 4½ per cent. to the Minister for Finance.  In addition, they have nearly £3,000,000 borrowed money.  I cannot say at the moment what that money is costing, but I think we may take it that some of it is costing 5½ per cent. anyway.  Some was borrowed a considerable time ago and some more recently.  If we find that they are charging 6¼ per cent. for loans at the moment, there is not much more than a margin of ¾ per cent. as between 5½ per cent. and 6¼ per cent.  Not much could be done to reduce the rate of interest because the margin is so small.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said he understood there was an element of risk attaching to this rate of interest.  Every bank in calculating interest rates always takes the question of risk into consideration. Now and again, a borrower does not pay up and that default must be covered.  A small part of the interest, therefore, must be devoted to covering such risks.  The same principle applies in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They have no more bad debts than the ordinary commercial banks, but there are some and they must cover them.</P>
    <P>I said in my speech that I thought the Corporation would have to take more risks in the future if the intention is to expand.  I inferred&mdash;I may not have put it too plainly&mdash;that if they take the risks I am encouraging them to take and if they lose a certain amount of money, I, in turn, will be prepared to take a little less interest. I shall be putting up to £2,000,000 into it now.  Deputy Jones can make the necessary calculation himself.  If they take these risks and fail to get the <Col N="408" /> money back, we will say they took the risks and failed.  That is all right.  I will meet them by saying I will take a little less interest.  If they take the risk, it does not mean they will have to charge an increased interest on their loans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said he preferred short-term loans to long-term loans.  It depends on what you lend the money for.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation lend money to a man to build a hayshed, we all know that is a long-term loan, because a hayshed will last for a very long time.  Usually, we give 15 years and, perhaps, a little longer to pay off that loan.  If a man says: &ldquo;I want to buy half a dozen heifers in calf.  I am going into the dairy business,&rdquo; they will get that money back in five or six years.  That is fair enough. If a man says: &ldquo;I have a very big tillage farm and I am short of money to buy seeds&rdquo;, they could give him only a year because the seeds will mature into a crop in a year.  Therefore, they should get the money back in a year.  The determination of what is to be a long-term or short-term loan depends on what the loan is for.  We can leave the practice as it has been in that respect.  I never heard anybody complain about a loan being too long or too short.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fanning mentioned a point which, indeed, I heard from some other quarter quite recently, that is, the date appointed each year for repayment. He made the point that they may appoint the month of May and the month of October and they may not be convenient months.  I think the Corporation would be reasonable in that regard.  If a man gets a loan and everything is fixed up and says: &ldquo;The months of May and October are not suitable for me; I would much prefer July and January&rdquo;, I am quite sure that is a matter that can be arranged. I certainly would not put it into the legislation.  It is a matter for administration. I am sure they would be very reasonable about it.  It is a matter that could be arranged between them.</P>
    <P>I said in the beginning that we had a very interesting debate on this problem.  There were points raised <Col N="409" /> such as the rate of interest, the time of repayment and the amount that should be lent in relation to the value of the property.  These are all interesting matters which can be debated at another stage, but, on the whole, the Bill appears to be acceptable.  If there are details, we can discuss them on the next Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in Deputy McGilligan's contribution to this measure last night.  I find myself in agreement with him on a number of points which he posed to the Minister.  The first and most important point at the moment is whether the Government intend, after the passage of this Bill through the House, to have it tested in the courts as to whether it is sound with regard to the Constitution or otherwise.  I think the Minister should tell us, when he is replying, whether the Government intend to take that step. We have enough legislation as it is and enough controversy in the courts without having this measure, when it becomes law, brought again before the court by a private individual of this House or a Senator or, perhaps, by somebody outside who has no connection with this establishment.  Therefore, I think the Government should, in the circumstances, have the matter clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perturbed as to whether it is <Col N="410" /> the immediate census which was taken last Sunday night or the previous 1956 census upon which this Electoral Bill is to be based.  That will have to be clarified.  That is why I was very interested to hear the views of a very prominent legal man in relation to the census taken last Sunday night.  Apart from that, my views on the question of representation in this House have not changed in the slightest degree since I spoke on the 1959 measure. There may be a question or doubt about which census, namely, the one taken last Sunday night or the previous census of 1956, this Bill is based on. I do not think we should worry about whether, if it was based on the one last Sunday night, we would have about 140 Deputies possibly instead of the 144 Deputies envisaged under this Bill.  I think that would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>I think we could do with between 80 and 100 Deputies to represent the Twenty-Six Counties.  I often wonder whether the Government ever take into consideration that if we had the Six Counties back on the present system of representation in the Twenty-Six Counties, we would possibly have over 200 Deputies to represent this small island.  I do not like having to draw comparisons very often in this House between ourselves and our neighbour, but in this instance I think it is no harm to point out that this little Parliament is almost an exact replica of the British House of Commons.  We have made one substantial change in relation to the ratio between the number of people a member of the House of Commons represents and the number a member of Dáil Éireann represents. To put the matter in a nutshell: if Britain had the same proportion of the population to each member as we have here in Dáil Éireann, I doubt if Wembley Stadium would hold all the members of the British House of Commons.</P>
    <P>The argument was put forward by Deputy Dillon and by the Taoiseach in the discussion on the 1959 Bill that it was not only desirable but necessary to have the maximum number of Deputies.  The argument was based on the case that in order to have suitable <Col N="411" /> Cabinet material, it was necessary to have a large pool of Deputies to draw on.  It was further argued that a large number of Deputies was needed in order to man the various Parliamentary committees, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the fact that very excellent work is done by these committees, but when considered carefully it is a terrible condemnation of the members of this House for the leaders of the two major Parties to suggest that it would be impossible to recruit good Cabinet material within the House, if the numbers were reduced from the present strength of 144 to, say, 100 or less.  It is a condemnation of the members of their own Parties and it would appear to leave the leaders of both Parties open to the criticism that the best material available in the country is not coming into the Dáil through the political Parties.  The argument put forward by Deputy Dillon and the Taoiseach that it was necessary to have a large pool of Deputies from which to draw Cabinet material would indicate that only a limited number of the men elected to the House are capable of or suitable for positions in the Government.  If that is true, we must trace back to find where the fault lies that leaves a situation like that to be considered.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Parties themselves, in their conventions and selection procedure, do not select the best material, that it is the individual who has the best grip on the locality or on the organisation who is selected as a candidate and is jet-propelled into the House.  If that is the case, and it would appear to be the case if we accept the argument put forward by the leaders of the major Parties, it is time these political Parties reviewed their own organisations.  That is something that has to be solved outside this House, not inside.</P>
    <P>The argument that suitable Cabinet material could not be obtained if the number of Deputies were reduced is no justification for the existence of 144 Deputies.  It is a condemnation of democracy as we know it in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> That brings me to what has been described to this House as the rural bias which was contained in the 1959 Bill.  At that time, the Minister and the Taoiseach expressed great solicitude for people living in the rural areas, particularly the inhabitants of the constituencies on the western seaboard. It was suggested that in view of the terrain, the geographical features, it was highly desirable to have a larger number of Deputies in the western areas than in the city areas.  That argument was bluntly put forward.  It was no longer correct to say that we should have the principle of one man one vote, but that a man in, say, Spiddal or Oughterard, Donegal or Kerry, would have one and a half votes to every vote the man in a city area would have.</P>
    <P>That was tested in the courts.  I should like to say that I have a great regard for the individual who, on his own, took the necessary action which brought about a change of mind in the Government, forced the Government to change their attitude in that regard.  I refer to Senator O'Donovan. I do not think he got much support from his own Party, for the simple reason that a number of them were highly embarrassed by the idea that the numbers in rural Ireland would be reduced.  I think the Senator was in more danger of political execution by members of his own Party than he was by members of Fianna Fáil for a while.</P>
    <P>I mention that because when the 1959 Bill came before this House, I personally took the view that even if it meant that only one Deputy would represent the whole of the West of Ireland, in the long run we must accept that fact on the basis of population. The judge in the High Court made a very excellent contribution as a neutral person.  In a capacity that could not be described as favouring any political Party in this House, he brought us all back to earth with regard to what the functions of a Deputy are under the Constitution, not what has grown up in the years as a result of the activities of particular Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> When the rural bias in the 1959 Bill was brought to the attention of the House, some Deputies were prepared to accept that the Government were sincere in that, that they were interested in all rural areas, but it is very significant that the areas in rural Ireland where the old representation was kept, where no change or reduction was made in the number of Deputies, were notorious as Fianna Fáil strongholds.  Fianna Fáil may not like that description &ldquo;notorious.&rdquo;  I will alter it slightly and say that they were well known to be Fianna Fáil strongholds.</P>
    <P>Donegal was discussed at length in the debate on the 1959 Bill.  It was discussed in the High Court at a later stage and the same arguments were put forward there by the Minister for Local Government as he put forward here in the House, that there were mountain ranges, long distances to be travelled, scattered population, the necessity for a Deputy being available to meet his constituents in the most out of the way places for the purpose of filling up forms for housing grants and rural improvement schemes and telling old people that they would get the old age pension, that he would make representations on their behalf. That bluntly was the line of country pursued here as the justification for keeping up the representation in Donegal over and above what it should be, if we accept the principle one man one vote.</P>
    <P>Great difficulty was experienced in this House by a number of Deputies in finding out whether the mountains in Donegal run from north to south or from east to west.  I think Deputy McGilligan at the time suggested that he would volunteer for service there with a couple of sherpas so that it could finally be decided in what direction this range of mountains runs. That range of mountains figured very prominently here as far as representation was concerned.  You could not have a Deputy crossing this high, dangerous range of mountains to interview a constituent on the far side.</P>
    <P>I distinctly remember listening to the Taoiseach pointing out that the reasons for holding the strong representation <Col N="414" /> in Donegal were the geographical features and the difficulties involved with regard to the mountain ranges.  I asked the Taoiseach, in the course of his contribution, where the range of mountains came into the picture as far as County Galway was concerned and, naturally enough, he turned a deaf ear to that question.  The same solicitude was displayed by Fianna Fáil for Galway as they displayed for Donegal, but there was no range of mountains in Galway which might cause difficulty to Deputies in crossing when they wanted to meet their constituents.  Therefore, uncharitably, I suppose, I assumed that the reason there was no change in the representation in Galway was that it was known to be a Fianna Fáil stronghold.</P>
    <P>At that time my own constituency, Roscommon, lost a seat.  It was reduced from a four-seat to a three-seat constituency at a time when Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government, and the Taoiseach had said their sole aim was to preserve sufficient representation in rural Ireland. I do not think they stayed awake any considerable length of time worrying about the decision to lop off the seat in Roscommon.  Fianna Fáil realised that if they did lop off a seat in Roscommon it would make no difference to their Party.  The seat that would be eliminated would be a seat that would normally go to somebody who was not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, so it was no harm so far as they were concerned to get rid of some thorn, whatever that thorn might be, in their side.</P>
    <P>It is beyond dispute that Galway at that time had nine members to represent the county.  Roscommon had four. On a strictly mathematical basis, Roscommon was not entitled to four in the light of the population figures and it was reduced to three.  I said in the House at that time I was quite satisfied with that, that on the figures available we were not entitled to it.  I also pointed, out, however, that if the same yardstick of mathematical calculation were applied to Galway as was applied to Roscommon, Galway would have had not nine seats but seven.  Nobody <Col N="415" /> can deny that there was gerrymandering there, not with regard to boundaries but with regard to manipulation of population figures.  The sole idea in relation to Galway was not to look after the interests of the poor unfortunate person out in Rossaveal, Clifden or any other part of Connemara but to preserve in this House the number of Deputies who would be well disciplined to obey the Party Whip.</P>
    <P>The judgment in the High Court was such that that little manoeuvre did not come off and now, even on the 1956 census, Galway comes down from a nine-seat representation to an eight-seat representation but if the actual population in Galway were taken into consideration they would be entitled, at the maximum, to seven seats.  If this Bill were postponed for another two or three months there would be another casualty in the Fianna Fáil camp as far as Galway was concerned. They do not want that.  I suppose it is human nature to try to hold as many as they can.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the judgment of Justice Budd.  It was highly desirable that somebody with the standing of a judge should make the position clear as to what the duties of a Deputy are supposed to be.  The argument has been put forward in this House and outside it that it is desirable to have Deputies available all over the country for the purpose of listening to grievances night, noon and morning.  It has been pointed out by that learned judge that there is nothing in the Constitution to suggest that a Deputy's duties were to interfere as a grievance officer in the administration of the various Departments.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years this system started to grow and grow to what it is today.  It would be very difficult now, I presume, to change the system. It is almost accepted now that a Deputy's main function is to listen to grievances, act as ombudsman and then, when he is free from all these duties, he can come into the House and vote whenever his Party puts on the Whip.</P>
    <P>I want to make my position clear. <Col N="416" /> I have no objection in the world to listening to a grievance from a constituent. It is my duty to listen to him and, if I feel that he has a genuine grievance, to do what I can about it, but I do not think it is the duty of any Deputy to go around the country to cumann meetings, craobhacha or anything else you like to call them, and infuse into people's minds the idea that the only way to get a housing grant, an old age pension, a land project grant or any other grant or facility made available by this House, is to make representations to a Deputy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as blaming any particular Party for that.  That seems to be accepted all over.  I have seen examples myself, for instance, with regard to bog development schemes.  I am talking strictly of rural matters which are no concern of city Deputies, but I should like to give them an idea of what happens in rural areas.  For instance, Deputy X belonging to a political Party goes down to his local town and holds a meeting at which he distributes rural improvement schemes forms, or minor relief schemes forms for the making of roads or for drainage.  Six months afterwards, two or three drains are inspected by the engineers of the Board of Works or the Special Employment Schemes Office, and the local political group who support that Deputy put a notice in the paper thanking the Deputy for getting Scheme A, B, C, D, E, F or G on the list and carried out. What effect has that?  That gives people in rural Ireland the idea that the only way to get your rights is to go to a Deputy.  People come to me and ask me will I make representations to get them old age pensions.  After examining their case to the best of my ability, I often find, with my limited knowledge of departmental procedure, that they are entitled to the old age pension without any representation at all.</P>

Surely I am entitled, in so far as I can do so, to rebut the arguments put forward by the Minister when he suggested that a Deputy's main function was to act on behalf of the public, as a person whose job it was to remedy their grievances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say to the Minister is that I read very carefully his contribution in the High Court when he was cross-examined on this matter.  I do not for a moment want to misrepresent him in any way, if he suggests that he put a different view.  Perhaps, when replying, he would comment on it.  I can only go on the statements he made in the High Court.  I do not want to start quoting at length to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely asking the Deputy to give to the House the reference where I have been recorded as saying that that is the main function of a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to his contribution in the High Court before Mr. Justice Budd where he said that a Deputy's job in rural Ireland was to spend his time listening to grievances and telling people what he would do for them.  The Chair has said that I am perhaps going into too much detail, but I feel that if a Deputy spends his time at that type of <Col N="418" /> performance, any initiative the people have will be killed.  They are left in the position of saying: &ldquo;I will write to Deputy So-and-So about this and see what his view is.  If I get no answer from him, I will write to another Deputy.&rdquo;  It is like chain letters going round the countryside.  I do not want to deny anyone that right but I feel a Deputy's main function is to study Bills and administration, and if his time goes on grievances and other issues, he is not capable of coming into this House and making a contribution on a measure which might need a good deal of study, even by an expert.</P>
      <P>The result of the system in operation up to now has been that only ten or fifteen per cent. of this House take an active interest in the legislation that is churned out week after week.  I do not blame Deputies for that.  Every morning, when we open our post, there are new Bills to be examined.  If each Deputy were to examine each Bill conscientiously and try to make himself familiar with and expert on all aspects of it, it would possibly take him a week or a fortnight. We get these Bills every morning and I would nearly be willing to put on a substantial bet that the majority of Deputies, after a very superficial glance at the green paper, either throw it in the wastepaper basket or put it aside, and so far as they are concerned, that is the end of it.  A Deputy's main function should be to examine all that potential legislation, but he is caught in a cleft stick as a result of the other system.  I suggest that, because there are so many Deputies, parish pump politics are never very far from the surface, and it is parish pump politics which will do the harm when it comes to a question of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to seem uncharitable to what I shall call the higher-ups in the major Parties when I suggest that it is very often an advantage when the Shadow Cabinet or the actual Cabinet know that many of their members are up to their eyes working down the country or in the cities, listening to grievances about housing grants, evictions, old age pensions, roads, <Col N="419" /> drains, and everything under the sun. While Deputies are so occupied, they cannot be a thorn in the side of the Government or the Shadow Cabinet, with the result that power is no longer in the hands of individual Deputies. The power, the reins and the control are exercised by the limited group at the top, and they can, in turn, suggest whatever measures they feel should be brought before the House.  They know they have a well-disciplined team to accept their views and that the Deputies concerned have neither the time not the opportunity to make a prolonged study of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I think the best possible way to solve that problem is to reduce the number of public representatives, and when it comes to a question of grievances and acting as a go-between for the public and the various Departments, those functions should be left to a grievance officer.  That has been carried out successfully by the most democratic country in the world today, Sweden.  Sweden has given the highest standard of living in the world to its people.  So far as the parliamentary representative there is concerned, his function is to study legislation and deal with conditions in general.  Grievances and rows between members of the public and State Departments are dealt with by neutral individuals described as grievance officers.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not objecting to the idea of a Deputy meeting his constituents and discussing grievances with them.  There is nothing wrong in a Deputy moving around his constituency, absorbing the feeling of the people and hearing in general the difficulties of the locality so that he will be properly armed when he comes to this House to deal with legislation that may have an effect or bearing on their welfare.  That is far more important for the public good than dealing with individual grievances on whether a man should get 12/6d. or 17/6d. old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my replies to previous questions regarding the provisions of hearing aids for persons in the lower income group, an approved scheme, applying generally, for the supply of these appliances by health authorities, free of charge, to persons in this group has not yet been introduced.</P>
      <P>The Cork Health Authority have, however, with my consent, supplied a limited number of hearing aids for children maintained in, or referred to, recognised institutions for the deaf where they are fitted with a suitable aid and are properly instructed in its use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the introduction of a properly organised general scheme for the supply and maintenance of hearing aids to persons in the lower income <Col N="421" /> group, the provision of an aid for a person in that group would be approved in exceptional circumstances, for example where it was clear that the appliance was required by the applicant to enable him to obtain, or continue in, employment.</P>
    <P>The organisation of a scheme for the supply of hearing aids, which will ensure that approved applicants will be provided at reasonable cost to health authorities not only with suitable aids but, scarcely less important, with the necessary maintenance service for these appliances, is a matter of some difficulty and requires very careful consideration before being approved for general adoption by health authorities. I am not yet in a position to say when such a scheme will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are two types of old age pension, the non-contributory pension and the new contributory pension which came into operation on 6th January last and which is not subject to a means test. The abolition of the means test for non-contributory old age pension would not bring any advantage to the <Col N="425" /> vast majority of non-contributory old age pensioners, over 90% of whom already qualify for the maximum rate of pension under the existing means test.  The purpose of the means test is to ensure that such money as can be made available for social assistance goes to those whose need is greatest. Its abolition would benefit only the small minority of non-contributory pensioners receiving payment at reduced rates because they have some means and those whose means are sufficient to exclude them altogether from entitlement to non-contributory old age pension.  Many of the last mentioned category would, of course, be people well able to maintain themselves and, therefore, not in need of assistance from the State.  Moreover, having regard to the limited resources of our community, which in turn limit the amount of national product available for social assistance, I feel that the Deputy will appreciate that payment of non-contributory old age pensions without a means test to all such persons could only be made at the expense of those who are truly in need of the maximum pension the community can afford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to all roads.  Is the Minister not aware that there is continuous friction in Kildare between tenants and the county council in relation to roads that have been laid down by the Land Commission in new estates because the tenants want to get the county council to take over the roads?  Would this friction not be completely eliminated, if there were adequate consultation beforehand between the Land Commission and the county council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to roads constructed by the Land Commission which are intended to be declared public roads, there is a standing instruction to officials to have prior consultation with the county council.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the local authority who is the judge of what is or what is not to be a public road and, therefore, should not the local authority be consulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the Deputy, there is a standing instruction in connection with roads we consider to be public roads to consult with the local authority.  If the Deputy has a particular road in mind, which he or the local authority consider may become a public road, and if he would give particulars of it, I shall have discussions arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the debate I find it rather difficult to be more charitable than to say that most of the contributions were nebulous and irrelevant to the measure under discussion. I have been looking through the notes which I took during the debate and I find no evidence whatever of any common approach among the critics from the Benches opposite, not to mention the absence of any commonsense comments with regard to most of the matters under discussion. The keynote of the debate, and it is the common policy&mdash;it is common all right&mdash;followed by the critics of the Bill in the Opposition was abuse and accusations of gerrymandering.  This of course was to be expected once we had the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition who, with his tongue in his cheek and a smile from ear to ear, spoke for about five minutes.  He said nothing concrete really, but made many accusations in regard to gerrymandering, abuse of the House, and the rights of this Parliament and so on.  Having done that, he rose and left the House and thereafter we had the tone of the debate set and its uselessness established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Leader of the <Col N="446" /> Opposition one was reminded of the story of the old woman who was schooled in inter-neighbourly rows and discussions.  On seeing her son and another young fellow from the neighbourhood having an argument she said to her son: &ldquo;Go on, call him a cheap skate and have the first go.&rdquo; That role of old woman was played to the full extent by the Leader of the Opposition.  Certainly it was followed to the full by those who came after him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish who succeeded the Leader of the Opposition did not go quite so far.  He found it difficult to go so far as to back up the full charge of gerrymandering in this case and talked about legal gerrymandering.  It is rather difficult to interpret just what Deputy Corish meant by legal gerrymandering unless one refers to his own statement that, in fact, he could justify Wexford having five seats by various arguments that he could advance. That may be the yardstick by which he measures the charge of legal gerrymandering.  Deputy Norton on the other hand, from the same Party as Deputy Corish, did not follow the lead given by Deputy Corish.  He said that the position since 1922 was that the constituency of Wexford was never entitled to five seats, that it did not have a population of 100,000 and that therefore since 1922 the whole position with regard to that constituency had been unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The only other remark I would make, and I need not apply it to Labour members any more than to members of the other Parties in the Opposition, is that it is a pity they did not make up their minds on which foot they were to stand, come in here and give us some sensible and constructive criticism, rather than wander around with contrasting phrases and contradictory statements.</P>
    <P>Another speech to which I would like to refer was that of a Fine Gael Deputy who also spoke on the 1959 Bill.  This was Deputy O'Donnell, a former Minister for Local Government, who in 1959 said, and I quote from Column 415, Volume 177 of the Official Reports:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> It is most difficult to arrange such a revision of constituencies without a charge of political corruption or gerrymandering...</P>
    <P>I agreed with the Deputy then.  I agree entirely with those sentiments now and anybody who approaches this matter in a sensible manner will realise that, no matter what sort of Bill is brought in to deal with this matter of rearranging constituencies, regardless of what Government is in office or what Minister is there, whoever introduces it will be charged with political corruption, gerrymandering and all the rest.  That is the true context in which this matter should be placed.  Deputy O'Donnell's contribution of 1959 should be applied in this case.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have asked what the position will be in regard to the reference of this Bill to the Supreme Court.  That is not a matter for me, for the Taoiseach, for the Government, or for this House.  It is a matter, as laid down by the Constitution, in which the President after consultation with the Council of State may refer any Bill to the Supreme Court for determination as to whether or not the whole or any part of it may be unconstitutional or repugnant to the Constitution.  That is the position and I trust that will clear the air as has been requested.  It is the best I can do to satisfy those who raised that question.</P>
    <P>Before I forget it, I should like to reply to the charge made by Deputy Corish that the Government are now introducing a measure which, in the circumstances as he puts it, will bring about, whether we like it or not, a prolongation of this Dáil.  He suggested that we are wilfully bringing in a Bill that is known to be, from his point of view, repugnant to the Constitution, or failing in some way that will nullify the operation of this House in passing this Bill and that we are doing this so that we shall be enabled to prolong the life of the Dáil.  From the various things said by other Deputies in Opposition I think Deputy <Col N="448" /> Corish may well be doing some wishful thinking that there will be this further respite for those in the Opposition before they face the next election. But in actual fact the position is far different from what Deputy Corish has alleged.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to bring in this Bill with all speed after the Court had given its judgment on the 1959 Bill.  The main reason for doing that was given by the Taoiseach when he said that he wanted to have the decks cleared so that we may have an election within the five-year period and not be compelled by force of circumstances to prolong the life of the Dáil to seven years as this House would be entitled to do, if Deputies so wished. Far from Deputy Corish's charges being correct, in fact the opposite is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>If we were to listen to all the doubts that have been created here, we would be here until eternity, so far as Opposition Deputies are concerned, and to start raising hares on this matter is surely not conducive to the fulfilment of the desire expressed by the Leader of the Opposition: &ldquo;Let us get this Bill through and let us get to the people of the country and see what they think about it.&rdquo;  That seemed to be his tone but it does not seem to be the tone of those whom he leads.  Rather was there some discord when we heard&mdash;as we did hear &mdash;from those who had reasons why the life of the Dáil should be prolonged. That seems to be the general wish of the Opposition and whether they voiced it or not that seemed to underlie many of the contributions they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy Lindsay criticising statements I made in Court on the <Col N="449" /> desirability of keeping to county boundaries. I said nothing that has not been said by Deputies opposite. Deputies Norton, Kyne and Manley argued strongly for keeping constituency boundaries in line with county and local authority boundaries.  I still believe that is what we should have but whether I believe or not, my opinion is not what counts.  The Government have accepted the judgment as expressed by the High Court regardless of what we believe.  I still think it would be far better to stick to county and local authority boundaries. There is nothing inconsistent in my bringing in a Bill that departs from these boundaries, nothing inconsistent in the views I expressed in advance of, and during, the debate on the previous Bill and in the courts in defence of that Bill.</P>
    <P>I still believe what I said then but I am facing the fact that the court gave its judgment and, in accepting that judgment, we are coming in here to adhere to the lines laid down by the court on its interpretation of the Constitution.  It is not a question of my opinion; it is the court's interpretation on which we are working and if, in operating that interpretation of the High Court, there appears to be a contradiction of what I believed or what I expressed in the past, that contradiction is not real.  It may appear to be there but in fact it is not there.</P>
    <P>The charge has been made that we are now breaching the county boundaries and contradicting what we wanted to do heretofore, but it all stems back to the judgment of the High Court on the interpretation of the Constitution. The interpretation was not challenged in this respect from the foundation of the State until last year.  If on that judgment our Bill of 1959 has been declared to be and is accepted as repugnant, so, it seems to me, was every other Bill that went before it, but such Bills were not challenged. Charges of gerrymandering and corruption are bandied about, backed up by pointing at Sligo-Leitrim.  That is taken as the choice example and the reason suggested for the alleged gerrymandering in that case is that Fianna Fáil were <Col N="450" /> disappointed, that they were beaten in the by-election recently held there.</P>
    <P>Do those who make these charges stop to think for a moment that Sligo-Leitrim as we had it, and as it has been up to the present, holding five seats within a territory of two counties, according to the judgment given in the High Court is not entitled to those five seats and that Sligo-Leitrim, as a constituency unit of five seats, was specifically mentioned by the judge in the High Court?  It is not entitled under the High Court interpretation of the Constitution to five seats.  We were, therefore, faced with the prospect of either adding part of a county or counties to Sligo-Leitrim to maintain five seats or reducing Sligo-Leitrim, as we have done, to four and giving the surplus of that constituency to some other county to make up the number of seats there, as we have done, in putting South Leitrim in with Roscommon. There is no question of our having any choice in this matter.  Sligo-Leitrim was not, and is not, entitled to five seats on a population basis.  That is why the representation has been reduced.  Let us be quite clear about that.</P>
    <P>Attention has also been drawn to the extraordinary appearance of the new constituency of Kildare.  We had Deputy Sweetman talking of the origin of the word &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo; and saying that it arose from the similarity of some of these constituencies to some queer sort of bird.  Apparently, Deputy Sweetman has got the bird in the constituency of Kildare at the moment. Kildare had so much population that it had too great a ratio per Deputy for three Deputies.  Side by side with Kildare, we had the constituency of Longford-Westmeath which had a little more population than entitled it to four Deputies and we had Meath with slightly more than it should have for three Deputies.  Those two parts of Westmeath and Meath brought the number of Deputies to Kildare up from three to four and brought that constituency nearer to the national average.</P>
    <P>Again, it may be said that the taking of that piece of Meath away from that constituency will disfranchise the <Col N="451" /> people of that locality, but that has been done in accordance with the decision of the High Court.  I should be inclined to believe that that is likely to be the case but I have no option in the matter.  It does not satisfy me any more than it satisfies the Deputies who criticised it, but we are working within the terms of reference as laid down by the High Court and this is the solution.  Instead of criticising the breaking of boundaries where that breaking had to be done, this House should be congratulating the Government on breaking so few county bounds, despite the fact that we have been tied down by very narrow limits.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that one may pick out one part of a constituency that would be better placed if it were put into another constituency.  That may be so, but if we look further we may find that in moving one bit of a constituency and putting it in with another, we may disturb a whole pattern and that is the overall situation we have got to look at.  In making these charges of gerrymandering, the general intention is to show that from a political point of view, that type of arrangement is more favourable to the Government Party.  However, take a look at Galway.  Who is likely to lose the seat in Galway?  Who is likely to lose the seat in Wexford?  There is no criticism of the fact that Fianna Fáil are apparently going to lose both those seats but there are all sorts of grumbling about the seats Fianna Fáil are going to preserve for themselves.</P>
    <P>We have a greater number of seats than ever before, greater than all the other Parties put together.  The mere fact that we will preserve more of our seats than the Fine Gael Party is no basis for a charge of gerrymandering. The greater the number of seats a Party has, the greater number it will retain, on the assumption that the allegiance of the electorate does not change.  The smaller the Party, the smaller the number of seats it will retain, again assuming a static mind on the part of the electorate, but, of course, there is no such thing as a static mind of the electorate in this or in any other country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> In so far as gerrymandering is concerned, unless you have some static, stable and indestructible political allegiance on the part of the electorate &mdash;and there is no such thing&mdash;there is not the slightest possibility of gerrymandering in this country.  It cannot be done and the Deputies opposite know that well.  In this country, we are not so laid out in various groups of political allegiance as to make that charge worthy of consideration.  The charge has been made on the basis of the old story that if you throw the mud long enough and often enough, some of it will stick.  I should like the House to appreciate the position in which we find ourselves in trying to frame legislation such as this within the narrow confines of the judgment of the High Court, confines more narrow than they ever were since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went very low when he was speaking yesterday, but, with his usual training in legal phraseology, he kept away from making the charges which his innuendoes carried.  The Deputy can have a present of that.  There is no point in the Deputy quibbling in a legal way.

      <P>The confines within which this Bill has been framed are much more narrow than the confines in which any of the previous Bills were introduced and passed by the House since the foundation of the State.  It should be realised by any of those who have the slightest understanding that to bring a Bill before the House in these narrow confines is not an easy task and the charges of breaches of faith and of corruption should not be lightly bandied about. There should be a commonsense approach to this Bill and no such commonsense approach or appreciation of the situation has been forthcoming from the Front Bench opposite, with one notable exception.  The whole tone of the debate was based on these charges.  The Leader of the Opposition released that here and it has been chased around here since then.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned one matter in relation to the memorandum accompanying the Bill.  He said it was misleading to state that the Blackrock district electoral division was being returned to the county, because it had never belonged to the county, to his knowledge.  I think there is a certain misunderstanding there.  The Blackrock division is in the administrative area of Cork county and it is in that context that I referred to its being returned to the county and not in the context of returning it to the county constituency.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman suggested, and his suggestion has been supported now by Deputy Lindsay's interjection, that Fianna Fáil broke their own rules and are now annoyed, that we are whinging and crying because we were caught out.  We have been quite aboveboard in this matter.  After considerable delay, the issue was taken to the courts.  We did not deny the right of anybody to move this matter to the courts.  In the courts, a decision was arrived at and judgment was pronounced. We accepted that judgment so completely that we are now back in the House, after a very short interval, with a new Bill drafted in accordance with that judgment.  So much for the charge of being annoyed, whinging and crying.  We are neither whinging nor crying, and we are certainly not annoyed.  We have accepted the judgment of the courts and are acting accordingly.  The suggestion that we are reluctantly doing something because we were driven into doing it, possibly by the Opposition here, is quite without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan said that the court, amongst other things, had defined the functions of Deputies.  He said that the judge&mdash;and he was glad of this&mdash;had defined what a Deputy should or should not do.  He went on to say that my mind, as expressed here and also in the court, was that the main occupation and functions of a Deputy were that he should go round seeing what old age pensions he could promise, what minor employment forms he could fill up and what rural improvement grants he could get.  I want to deny categorically that I ever said here or in the court that that was the main function of a Deputy.  I said, and I still hold to it, that, whether we like it or not, whether we believe that it is the function of a Deputy as laid down by the Constitution, the practice has grown that a Deputy, in addition to being a representative as required by the Constitution, gives to the people <Col N="455" /> the service which they have come to expect, a service which is now traditionally established, of helping them in any and every matter, whether it be advice, form filling, visits to Departments, to county councils, to urban councils, to corporations, or wherever it may be.  That is the established pattern. It is there and I do not see any prospect of its disappearing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Norton, Deputy Coburn, Deputy Rooney, Deputy <Col N="456" /> Manley and some others&mdash;expressed the opinion that there should be an all-Party committee, or some similar body, set up to deal with this matter of the revision of constituencies.  It is heartening to realise that people are now coming round to that point of view.  Strong opposition was raised against a similar proposal in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. It was suggested then that a commission should be set up presided over by a High Court judge.  That was unacceptable because, it was suggested, no matter what High Court judge might be appointed to preside, he would inevitably be a political hack or lickspittle of Fianna Fáil and the findings of such a commission would not be worth the paper they were written on.</P>
    <P>It is good to find this change of heart in a matter vital to the interests of every member of this House over the next ten or 12 years.  It is good to know that the Opposition are now of the opinion that some arrangement by way of committee, or otherwise, would be the most satisfactory method of determining constituency boundaries. Unfortunately, some doubt is raised in my mind about this change of heart where Fine Gael are concerned because of the contradictory statements to which we have listened.  If they were to participate in such a committee, the question arises as to whether they have within their own Party the necessary discipline to ensure that all their members will agree.  That is a problem for the future and, in particular, it is a problem for the Fine Gael Party, but it might be well if they thought about it in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it be reluctant or otherwise, you did come to agree and it might be a very good thing for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing I might mention. <Col N="457" /> There were two satisfied customers who expressed their satisfaction in this House&mdash;Deputies Sweetman and Sherwin.  They feel that they are all right, if the rest of the House who spoke did not indicate they were satisfied.  I can recall no others in the Opposition who expressed themselves as being satisfied with their role.  However, there are those who are feeling happier now than they were as things were under the 1959 Act.  Again, I suppose there are a few who will be feeling worse off now than they did under the 1959 Act.  Whether they feel themselves well or ill in regard to the various positions in which they found themselves under the respective Acts. it is not really something that someone set out to do to them.</P>
    <P>Nobody sat down to try to see whether or not he could put them on the spot.  The outcome of this Bill is very largely dictated by the conditions in which it must be brought into the House and the conditions with which it must conform.  There is little or no case whatsoever for all the near-slanderous statements made here as to the reasons for doing this, that or the other thing.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  It is not so important but the Deputy who made it and flogged it with enthusiasm through the House last night seems to consider it important.  I am referring to Deputy Ryan.  His plea was that there should be one man, one vote and all votes equal.  There is nothing wrong with that statement.  There is nothing wrong with that idea or principle but I am surprised that Deputy Ryan, who was so concerned with the legality or otherwise of this and the previous Bill should fall into this misstatement because we are not dealing with the question of the electorate related to Deputies.  We are obliged to deal with the population in relation to the number of members. Even if it were possible to have an absolutely accurate mathematical ratio per Deputy throughout the whole country, you would still not have one man's vote absolutely equal to another man's vote in any part of the country, nor would all votes be equal.  In fact, under this Bill, confined within a very <Col N="458" /> narrow differential as between the lowest and highest ratio per member in various parts of the country, a disparity arises wherein, basing the matter on the electorate which would be referable to voting strength and the value of votes, we can find between the two extremes as will arise under this Bill, that a vote in one part of the country can be equal to one and a quarter votes in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>No matter how this matter can finally be determined, no matter how near mathematical accuracy it can be brought in relation to the ratio of the population to member, we cannot ever ensure that, by that mathematical population ratio accuracy, we can bring about a situation wherein each vote will be worth exactly the same in all parts of the country.  So much for Deputy Ryan's enthusiasm; so much for the energy with which he flogged this through the House last night; and so much for the argument that, under the 1959 Act, a vote was worth one and a half votes in the country as against one in the city.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the extreme still exists.  Votes can be as to one and one and a quarter between the two extremes and there is nothing that Deputy Ryan, with all his legal training and exactitude, can do about that.  I am not saying that because I like to think that is so, I am stating it as a fact.  Absolute parity in all parts of the country cannot be brought about, even if we were strictly to divide the country so as to have absolute mathematical accuracy as between constituency and constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's complaint last night&mdash;I think he will agree with me in this; I do not think I am misinterpreting what he said&mdash;was that the 1959 Act brought about a situation which negatived the fine principle enunciated by Deputy Ryan of all votes being equal, no matter what part of the country they were in.  That is not the case.  In fact, there is no way of ensuring, no matter how it were done, that <Col N="459" /> that would be the case in any case the Deputy cares to mention.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell, naturally enough, referred to Donegal and the division of Donegal.  He asked why not leave it as he had it.  Does Deputy O'Donnell seriously suggest that the division he suggested there was an equal division, a good division or whether it was a better division than the division now made?  Does he further propose and suggest that all the other supposed and proposed proposals of his at the time, if they had come before this Dáil and were passed, using the same yardstick of population ratio per member, would have been more acceptable to the court than the Act of 1959 which was thrown out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy brought up this matter of Donegal last night. I am merely putting this to him and to the House.  The Deputy, who is well versed in the law, will have read in great detail the judgment of the High Court.  I assume he knows what he proposed to do in 1956.  I am suggesting that he should have a word with the other members of his Party&mdash;he need not tell the members of this Party&mdash;whether those proposals would have been any more acceptable to the courts in regard to the population ratio per member than were the proposals in the 1959 Act.  I am suggesting that so that some of the Fine Gael people may sleep better in the future and not worry now about what the proposal of Deputy O'Donnell would have done for them or what the 1959 Act could not do for them. They would be much happier as a result, although I do not really think they would.  That is a matter of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another point but I do not think I should bring it up.  I am reminded of a charge made during the course of the 1959 Bill through this House that the four seats were being retained in East Donegal as a method of payment to an Independent Deputy from East Donegal because of his <Col N="460" /> support of Fianna Fáil.  Now we have the other side of the coin.  Under this proposal, it has been said that we have now succeeded in doing what we wanted to do, that is, to get rid of that Independent Deputy.  All I will say to the House is: just check up on the statement in regard to this Bill with reference to that Independent Deputy and then go back and check up on the charge of corrupt practice, if you like, of paying the Deputy for his support of Fianna Fáil by leaving four.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will get it on the records.  It was not the Deputy, if that is any relief to him, but it was said here by one of the Deputies opposite, by way of interjection.  That was the suggestion now, that we wanted to get rid of him and were succeeding in doing it.  I am asking the House to compare that with the charge made on the 1959 Bill, that we were providing a Bill which obviously would have given that Deputy an excellent chance of retaining his seat. We were charged then that we were doing that as a matter of payment for his support of the Government in the previous three or four years.  I am merely bringing out the contradiction of attitude in regard to this matter as typical of the contradiction of attitude expressed on several other aspects of this matter when compared with the views expressed on the 1959 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little, indeed, that one can say that would help to clear the minds of the Opposition.  They seem to be cluttered up with wild ideas that anything is possible under this Bill, that any form of &ldquo;doing them down&rdquo; can be arranged at my behest and that as a result of manipulation by me, we can do all sorts of things to them.  That is wrong, but if the Deputies opposite want to continue to think that that is <Col N="461" /> being done, I can only say to them, as was said to them by some other speaker from this side of the House last night, if the conscience is guilty, if the mind of the Opposition is that if they were here, that is what they would do to us, if that is what is prompting them to make all these wild, unestablished charges, then we can only feel sorry for them.  But, in feeling like that, they should not push the thing so far as to make the unestablished charges, the charges without proof, that have been made here.</P>
    <P>Remember, it is not a matter of criticising the Minister for Local Government or the Government.  The serious charges that have been made here in regard to gerrymander, these wild charges that do not stand up, are harmful and damaging, not to the Government or the Minister, but to the country.  It is that aspect of these charges that I deplore most and it is that aspect of these charges that I should like to be nailed now so that when we come to discuss the remaining Stages of this Bill, we will not have a repetition of them.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to have a go at the Minister or the Government&mdash;that is the prerogative of the Opposition at all times&mdash;but, when the charges are of the nature mentioned here, they can be harmful in a way that we may not readily see at the moment but which might come to hurt us in later years. So let us be careful in this matter.  If there are charges which can be proved, then prove them, but do not make charges, such as a charge of gerrymander, in this House against any Government or any Minister that cannot be proved, established and stood over.  Such charges damage the country more than they damage the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the House to have done with this question of gerrymander, now that this Second Stage is concluding and when we come to the Committee and Final Stages, we can discuss them with a rational, commonsense approach, realising that what is done has not been brought about by any manipulation on my part but has been largely determined by the interpretation of the courts of the Articles <Col N="462" /> of the Constitution which refer to this matter.</P>

When we look at this Bill, particularly at parts of it with which we ourselves are intimately concerned, each of us can immediately see what, in his view would be a better way of doing it, but do remember that in many instances the amendment that might be proposed and that would appear to be better and to create a better immediate situation in relation to that area than now exists, can have and very likely would have the effect of putting many other places out of line.  Therefore, in that type of thought and in the suggestion of amendment, consider the repercussions of the amendment, if carried, in relation to adjacent constituencies, rather than in isolation.</P>
