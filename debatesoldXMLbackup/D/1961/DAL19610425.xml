      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the estimated increase in the cash income of farmers in 1960; if he will indicate in tabular form the principal factors contributing to the increased cash income; and if he will give corresponding information for the previous year.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out for 1959 and 1960 estimates of the values of sales off farms and consumption by farm households of the principal items of agricultural produce, together with particulars of the changes between the two years.  When the estimated totals of farm expenses (including feed, fertiliser, seed, hired labour and other costs) are deducted from these, the residue, which may be termed &ldquo;cash income of farmers and their relatives&rdquo; is estimated to have increased between 1959 and 1960 by £15.5 million.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that to arrive at a total income of farmers and their relatives, related to agricultural activity in a particular year, account must also be taken of the value of changes in livestock numbers between the beginning and end of the year.  The value of these changes is estimated to have been an increase of £11.0 million in 1959 and a decrease of £0.5 million in 1960, so that, as shown in the table, the resultant total income from agricultural activity rose by £4.0 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether there is a scheme in operation in (a) the county of Offaly and (b) the county of Laois for the supply of dentures to adults; and, if not, why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy's question refers to the supply of dentures, under the Health Acts, to persons in the lower income group in the two areas named.</P>
      <P>I am informed that dental services provided by Offaly County Council for such persons do not include the supply of dentures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A restricted service for the supply of dentures to persons in the lower income group is in operation in County Laois, preference being given to expectant and nursing mothers, tuberculosis patients and other patients who are <Col N="947" /> specially recommended dentures on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>The supply of dentures to persons in the lower income group is primarily a matter for the health authority concerned but it is only fair to the health authorities for the two areas, named above, that I should point out that they, in common with most other health authorities, are concentrating their limited resources mainly on the provision of dental services for children as that group stand to benefit most from dental treatment.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that in our circumstances, particularly having regard to our limited resources in personnel, this is the right policy to pursue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if in view of the hardship caused to injured workers who are compelled to repay to the Social Insurance Fund benefits received by them pending settlement of their claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, he will take steps to abolish such requirement, particularly in view of the fact that such workers pay weekly insurance premiums to entitle them to such benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of making advances of disability benefit to an injured insured person pending the settlement of his claim for compensation under the workmen's compensation Acts is to alleviate any hardship that may exist due to loss of earning power in the interval between the accident and the settlement.  The advances are refundable if the compensation claim is successful and insured persons are made aware of the fact that benefit is advanced on this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schemes of workmen's compensation and disability benefit are designed to replace loss of earning power due to incapacity.  If, therefore, advances <Col N="948" /> of disability benefit were to be retained by a successful claimant to compensation, the effect would be that he would receive double payment in respect of his incapacity.  This would place him in a better position than a person who is paid his weekly compensation immediately following an industrial accident and in whose case disability benefit is not payable.</P>
    <P>As all aspects of workmen's compensation are, at present, being examined by a commission, I do not propose to take any action in matters of this nature until I have received the commission's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the difference in payments where sickness benefit enters into the question?  For example, a man injured in the course of his employment who has a wife and, say, five dependent children, would, if he were receiving sickness benefit, receive substantially more than the maximum of £4 10s. from workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be, but the position is that a commission has been appointed to examine into this matter.  It would be quite wrong for me to make any change until I have their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister must await the recommendation of the commission before he can make any change in the position in regard to workmen's compensation.  I have come across the case of a man who, if he were on sickness benefit, would receive £5 12s. 6d. but, being on workmen's compensation, receives £4 10s.  Could the Minister not introduce legislation whereby such persons can get the balance from the insurance fund?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that if a protracted time elapses between the initiation of the proceedings under workmen's compensation code and the final award, if a man is obliged to refund the social service payments advanced, a situation can be created in which there has been dissipated away in weekly payments <Col N="949" /> over the period of litigation a large part of the sum intended as a kind of capital endowment to provide for his future?  I do not say it is not a difficult problem.  Perhaps the Minister would require those examining this matter to look at the question at least from this angle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that Cork West consists of the Rural Districts of Bantry, Castletown, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Skibbereen and Schull.  All Urban Employment Schemes and schemes authorised in non-urbanised towns have been implemented. Nineteen Minor Employment Schemes, costing £2,300, were originally authorised.  Consents were refused for one of these, costing £260, but three other schemes were authorised in lieu thereof and these three alternative schemes have been carried out.  Three small schemes, totalling £150, included in the original list for Dursey Island were not implemented. The farmers concerned refused to permit these works to be proceeded with and the grants are now being cancelled.  Seventeen Bog Development Schemes, costing £2,155, were authorised.  All these have been implemented with the exception of a small road work, costing £60, which it is hoped to put in hands in the next week or two.  Twenty-four Rural Improvements Schemes, costing £6,576, were authorised last year.  As the Deputy will understand, the date the contribution is lodged largely determines the progress of these works.  Of the five schemes not implemented, the contributions in two were not received until late in March, a third was a bridge work and the fourth was a drainage work, neither of which could be put in hands during the winter period.  I shall inform the Deputy of the position regarding the fifth scheme, a road work costing £264.  As regards miscellaneous schemes, one archaeological work was carried out and the position regarding minor marine works is as set out in my reply to the Deputy's Question of the 23rd March last regarding West Cork piers.</P>

      <P>The draft referred to was received in December, 1959, but it was not accompanied by any evidence that the existing clause, which has been in operation for many years, has proved inadequate to protect the rights of workers and has given rise to serious abuses.

      <P>The case was recently inspected and it was found that no action had been taken by the applicant to remedy the defects.

      <P>History and Geography were so combined in the arrangement set out by the Dáil Commission of 1924, and this arrangement has obtained ever since.</P>
      <P>At the Intermediate level the courses prescribed are of a general nature, including a certain amount of general knowledge, and are to a substantial degree complementary.  At Leaving Certificate level each of them becomes more specialised.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in a tabular statement, which, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the official report.</P>
      <P>The figures given relate to enrolments in the various continental language classes.  It may be that a number of individual pupils were enrolled in more than one language class.  My Department's records do not contain any information in relation to this matter.</P>

    <Title>Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the establishment of machinery to enable seven voluntary hospitals in Dublin city to form themselves into a group; the hospitals concerned being the Adelaide, the Meath, Mercer's the National Children's the Royal City of Dublin, Sir Patrick Dun's and Dr. Steevens hospitals.</P>
      <P>Initially, the form of association envisaged is a federation, but the Bill contains provisions to enable the hospitals subsequently to amalgamate, if they so desire.  I should emphasise that the measure is an agreed one and that its terms have been approved by the hospitals concerned.  Moreover, its introduction at the present stage in the development of our health services is, I think, highly opportune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in the period from 1947 to date, a number of important and fundamental changes have taken place in the organisation of the services for which the Minister for Health is responsible.  The funds which are available for health purposes, whether from voted moneys or from the Hospitals Trust Fund, are now very fully committed, and during the past few years, I have had to take steps to rationalise and improve the existing services, in order that the community might obtain the maximum benefit from our expenditure upon them.  The <Col N="979" /> Health Authorities Act, 1960, which provided a more compact and logical form of control over health services at local level, was one such measure.  The Bill now before the House is another. It is designed to enable the hospitals to which it applies to continue more effectively the important contributions which they have been making heretofore to the provision of health services in the Dublin area, and indeed for the country generally.</P>
    <P>Since the early part of the eighteenth century, all the hospitals in question have played a notable part in the development of medicine in Ireland. The first in point of time, the hospital bearing the name of Richard Stephens, and founded on his beneficence, was established in the year 1720, and Dean Swift and John Wesley, amongst many other notabilities, are known to have taken an interest in its affairs.  Indeed, in the early days of the hospital's existence, Swift was a Governor, and in her will &ldquo;Stella&rdquo; with whom his name is historically linked, left £1,000 for the advancement of Christian worship in the institution.</P>
    <P>Mercer's Hospital, founded by the illustrious Mary Mercer and situated upon the site of the ancient Lazar House of St. Stephen, followed in 1734.  It may be of interest to the House to know that the first public performance in 1742 of Handel's &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; in the Fishamble Street Theatre was for the benefit of this hospital.</P>
    <P>The Meath Hospital was opened in 1753.  Originally, it was to serve particularly the surrounding district of the Coombe, where lived the woollen weavers of Dublin.  Incidentally, at that time the plight of these operatives was pitiable, for their livelihood had been ruined by the calamitous laws which the English Parliament had enacted for the protection of the English woollen trade.</P>
    <P>Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital may, perhaps, justify a more extended notice.  Its founder, Sir Patrick Dun, a native of Aberdeen, came to Ireland towards the end of the 17th century <Col N="980" /> as Physician to the Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Essex.  He remained to win a reputation as a successful and highly esteemed physician, and became President of the College of Physicians in 1681.  By his will he provided a trust in perpetuity to endow a Chair of Physic in the College of Physicians. The Chair was duly established; but the administration of the trust became the subject of an investigation by a House of Lords Committee in 1799. The Committee's report disclosed a fantastic but fascinating state of affairs.  &ldquo;Your Committee,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;hold themselves bound to notice a present of claret to the President of the College of Physick annually; an immoderate purchase of books, in some instances twice paid for; lawsuits carried on in which the said College were both plaintiffs and defendants and actually paid from said funds the expenses of both; the loans to indigent members of said College which were never repaid in many instances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, therefore, that one of the last statutes passed by an Irish Parliament provided that most of the trust funds should be sequestrated and devoted to the building of a hospital to perpetuate the name of Sir Patrick Dun.</P>
    <P>The National Children's Hospital is a modern successor of two earlier institutions, one of which, the Institute for Sick Children, was founded as far back as 1821.</P>
    <P>In the year 1832, the Royal City of Dublin Hospital, Baggot Street, was founded, with the distinguished medical practitioners Henry Marsh, Abraham Colles and Samuel Wilmot as consultants.</P>
    <P>This was followed in 1839 by the establishment of the Adelaide Hospital, with which Isaac Butt was connected. It is interesting to recall also that in its early days one of Miss Florence Nightingale's young ladies of the Crimea was a nurse tutor here.</P>
    <P>I must resist the temptation to dilate further on the history of the hospitals. I hope that I have said enough to indicate <Col N="981" /> their long and proud records of service to the community.  So I revert to the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The federation or amalgamation of hospitals, such as it proposes is by no means a recent idea.  In the course of the last century legislation for coordinating Dublin hospitals was mooted from time to time, but nothing effective was ever done.  It was not until 1947 that a definite legislative proposal for an amalgamation emerged under the title of the St. Luke's General Hospital Bill.  That measure provided for the amalgamation of three of the hospitals now to be dealt with, to wit, Sir Patrick Dun's, Mercer's and the Royal City of Dublin.  It was given a First Reading in Dáil Éireann in June of 1947, but the general election of 1948 supervened and for one reason and another the measure was not revived.</P>
    <P>About two years ago it came to my notice that certain hospitals had this question of federation under consideration. I contacted them and invited them to send representatives to a meeting to discuss this possibility. Arising out of this meeting it was decided to set up a Committee under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department to work out a scheme for legislation.  The present Bill is based on the work of that Committee and I am happy to say that it has received the unqualified assent of all the hospitals to which it relates.  I should say, certainly at this stage, how indebted all those concerned must be to the Chairman and the members of the Committee for the time and patience which they gave to working out this solution to a very difficult and intricate problem.  If the measure fulfils our expectations a major re-organisation of a substantial sector of the Dublin hospital services will be accomplished as the figures which I am going to give indicate.</P>
    <P>In 1959, which is the last complete year for which figures are available, out of a total of less than 3,100 beds in all the Dublin voluntary general and children's hospitals there were some 1,200 beds in the seven hospitals concerned. During that year, some 20,000 <Col N="982" /> patients were treated in these hospitals and their total expenditure was approximately £750,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent federation, the initial step which this Bill proposes, will operate to reduce costs. It should tend to do so, however, at least in a relative sense.  For one thing, with the pooling of knowledge and experience and a measure of overall control by the proposed Central Council, it is to be expected that the unnecessary and wasteful duplication of facilities will be avoided; and where duplication of this kind now exists, we may trust that in due course it will be eliminated. The great advantage of the federation, however, should manifest itself in a better over-all service to the community from the rationalisation which is being aimed at by the individual hospitals concerned.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer in brief to the salient provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the usual necessary definitions.  Section 2 provides for the appointing of a day by order to be the establishment day.  This will be the day on which, under Section 4, the separate hospitals will come together in a federation, while retaining their separate identities.  On this day also the new Central Council, referred to in Section 5, will be established.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the appointment of a day to be the transfer day. The transfer day is the day on which, at some time in the future, not too far distant I hope, the hospitals concerned will, if they so decide, amalgamate completely.  An order fixing this day cannot be made unless the Central Council so requests, and to make such a request the Council must have the consent of two-thirds of the individual hospital boards which are represented on it.  If, at this stage, a hospital wishes to opt out of this ultimate step of amalgamation, there is provision in sub-section 3 of the section whereby it may do so.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of a Central Council for the new federated group.  The Council is charged with the performance of all the functions set out in Section 14 of <Col N="983" /> the Bill.  The usual provisions conferring corporate character on the Council are included.</P>
    <P>In Section 6 there is provision for replacing by hospital boards the various governing bodies of the participating hospitals.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes provision for membership of the Central Council.  It will consist of five members elected by each of the participating hospitals and five elected by the Dublin Health Authority, so that, basically, there will be forty members.  The section also makes provision for the representation on the Council of a university, college or institution with which the Council has entered into agreement regarding the clinical education of medical students.  The term of office of the members of the Council appointed by the hospital boards will normally be three years and that for members elected by the Dublin Health Authority five years.  The latter period of five years has been determined by the fact that it is the period intervening between local elections.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the section for the Minister to vary by order the composition of the Council, but only at the request of the Council.  I should mention that in Committee I shall propose a few drafting amendments to this section.</P>
    <P>Section 8 makes provision for the membership of hospital boards to be established under the Bill.  Those on the governing bodies of the hospitals will, on the establishment day, become members of the respective hospital boards and will retain such membership until death, resignation or cessor of membership through continuous failure to attend meetings without sufficient explanation.  Vacancies on a hospital board will be filled by cooption. These provisions, however, in regard to membership will not apply to the Meath Hospital Board, appointments to which are governed by the terms of the Meath Hospital Act, 1951, as amended by the Health Authorities Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 contain provisions on the usual lines relating to the time and place of meetings, the tenure <Col N="984" /> of office&mdash;in general three years&mdash;of the chairman and vice-chairman and the procedure at meetings of the Council.</P>
    <P>In Section 12 there is provision for the appointment of committees of the Council.  It is provided that where members of a committee contain persons other than members of the Council such members shall not exceed one-fourth of the total membership of the committee.  Section 13 provides for the employment by the Council of any necessary staff for its purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 14 defines in some detail the functions which shall be performable by the Central Council.  In the initial period of four years after the establishment day, the Council will have the function of examining the estimates of expenditure by the individual hospitals and of suggesting amendments.  After the expiration of that period, the Council's financial powers will be strengthened, Thereafter its approval will be necessary to the adoption of the annual estimate of each hospital board.  The functions of the Council will also include the determination of the form of accounts of the individual hospitals and the control of capital expenditure.  Another important function of the Council will be the appointment of visiting medical staff. After the establishment day, such staff will not be appointed by the boards of the individual hospitals, but by the Council and further, they will be appointed not to the service of any individual hospital but to the group as a whole.  After appointment, the Council will assign them to the hospital or hospitals in which they are to work.</P>
    <P>Other functions of the Council will be the determination of the location of particular clinical units, the assignment of professorial units, the apportionment of beds amongst the visiting medical staff, the co-ordination of activities in relation to medical education and the control of activities in relation to nursing education.</P>
    <P>In respect of the assignment of medical staff and nursing education, there are safeguards respecting the denominational character of a hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Section 15 sets out the functions of the hospital boards which, in brief, will be the functions performable by the governing body of the hospital concerned before the establishment day, other than those reserved by the Bill to the Central Council.  One important limitation is imposed by sub-section (3) of Section 15.  It provides that moneys collected by a hospital board by public appeal shall not be used by the board for capital purposes without the consent of the Council.</P>
    <P>Section 16 makes provision for the amalgamation, with their consent and that of the Minister, of two or more hospital boards.  In such an event representation of the amalgamated board on the Central Council would be aggregated so as to be equivalent to the sum of the number of representatives accorded to each of the boards which it replaced. Under Section 17 the Council will have power to dissolve a hospital board and take over its functions, provided that the board in question and the Minister consent.  In both Sections 16 and 17 there are provisions providing for the necessary modifications (including modifications of the provisions of the Bill) to effect the amalgamation or dissolution concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 18 will allow the Central Council to make arrangements, with the consent of the Minister, for joint action with a hospital which is not a participating hospital concerned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 is included so that, on the decision being taken to amalgamate, the hospitals can be taken over by the Central Council on the transfer day.  The section provides for the dissolution of the hospital boards on that day and for the application of the usual provisions regarding the disposal of assets, liabilities, choses in action, etc.  There are safeguards in regard to the position of persons employed on the transfer day and also provision for compensation by way of superannuation for any person whose employment is terminated through amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill provides for the payment of the expenses of the <Col N="986" /> Council before amalgamation.  These will be met, in so far as they are not met from other sources, by contributions from the participating hospitals and will be divided in the ratio of the number of beds available for patients in a hospital to the total number of such beds in the group.  Such contributions will rank, <i>pari passu</i> with other legitimate charges in determining the payment to be made to the hospital concerned from the Hospitals Trust Fund on foot of a budget deficit.</P>
    <P>In Section 21 of the Bill provision is made for the membership of the Central Council after the transfer day, that is after amalgamation.  On the transfer day, the hospital boards will be dissolved but the representatives on the Council of such boards on the transfer day will be members until death, or resignation or termination of membership for failure to attend meetings. The provisions in Section 7 regarding the Dublin Health Authority representatives and members appointed by the medical schools will continue to apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Section 22 provides for the making, by order of the Minister, of any necessary modifications in the Acts and instruments relating to the foundation and constitution of the participating hospitals and Section 23 for the making, also by order of the Minister, of any necessary changes before the establishment day in the constitution of any of the present governing bodies of the hospitals, except that of the Meath Hospital, which, as I explained already, is governed by an Act of the Oireachtas. Such Orders may be made only, in the case of Section 22, at the request of the Central Council and, in the case of Section 23, at the request of the governing body concerned.  All orders made by the Minister under the Act, under Section 24, must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas; and there is the usual provision for their annulment, if a resolution to that effect is made within 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 25 is a provision to indemnify <Col N="987" /> the Board of Directors of the Royal City of Dublin Hospital against debts of that hospital.  There is some reason to believe that under the Deed of Co-Partnership of 1875 relating to the hospital, the Directors might personally be held liable for such debts and the section will merely put them in the same position as members of other hospital boards.</P>
    <P>I propose on Committee Stage to introduce an amendment which will have the effect of giving statutory force to an agreement which is in course of execution between Trinity College, The Royal College of Physicians and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital relating to the disposal of the estate of Sir Patrick Dun and to the making of certain appointments in Trinity College, Dublin, and in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. This agreement is rendered necessary by the proposed association of that hospital with the other hospitals in the group.  I shall explain it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned how much we owe to the members of the Committee who made it possible for me to put this measure before the Oireachtas. I wish to place again on record my sincere appreciation of the help rendered by the representatives of the seven hospitals, and by their boards, in drawing up the scheme of this Bill. I know how proud those are who constitute such Boards of the long and honourable record of their institution, of its traditions and its practice, and of the services which it provides.  I know that they devote a great deal of their time and energies to ensure that their hospital continues to be an effective instrument in the relief of suffering and the restoration of the sick to health; and yet they are giving up to the proposed Central Council a large measure of their autonomy in the running of it. I am sure, too, that even though they have assented to the scheme underlying this Bill many of them must feel that the separate identity of the foundation in which they are most particularly interested will in time be lost.  And I feel also that many of them must have had very considerable misgivings about the whole idea underlying this legislation. It is a notable demonstration <Col N="988" /> of their sense of public duty that they submerged their personal feelings in this matter, which touches them so intimately, as soon as they were convinced that by this measure a better service would be provided for the public whom their hospitals exist to serve.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Dáil will agree our thanks are due to those who revived the idea of a closer association between the hospitals covered by this Bill, and to those also whose predilection may have been for a continuance of their present independent position but who, when convinced that current developments in medical science and medical teaching made the present step desirable, if not indeed absolutely necessary, gave the proposal their unqualified support.</P>
    <P>I recommend this measure to the Dáil for Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case it is a <Col N="989" /> machinery Bill and, as I understand from the Minister, an agreed Bill.  It provides the hospitals with an opportunity of doing something which they are not being compelled to do but which, all things considered, they have apparently made up their minds to do from the point of view both of the public and their own convenience.</P>
      <P>There are certain points I should like clarified in connection with the Bill.  It may be that a lesser number than 40 will not meet the exigencies of this special situation but it does seem to me that, if a council is established which consists of anything between 40 and 50 members, if we allow for representation of a university college and other persons on the board, and if that council has, as part of its job, the appointment of consultants and the apportionment of beds between doctors, it would be an extremely unwieldy body, every group of which must naturally have its personal allegiance and predilections.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge however, that inasmuch as this is an agreed measure and that it really would not be possible at all except on the basis of agreement, the Minister may have found himself in the position that substantial agreement could not have been secured except on the basis of so large a number of representatives on the council. I would be glad to hear from him when he is concluding whether he thinks the numbers here provided for are not somewhat excessive, whether they might not with advantage be restricted owing to the administrative work they would be charged to do. I am prepared to concede that, if this number is the price of goodwill and agreement, we would be best advised to pay that price, albeit against our better judgement from an administrative point of view.</P>
      <P>If we are to accept that view, we must consider Section 12 which provides for the appointment of a subcommittee of a council now consisting of anything between 40 and 50 members and which provides for the contingency that the council cannot constitute its own committees from its own membership, but must go outside.</P>

      <P>They are making provision to allow the Council to appoint other persons to committees apart from those on the Council.  It does seem to me strange, if there is a body of anything between 40 and 50 people charged with a specific task and they think it desirable to delegate any of their functions, that it is not possible to envisage the Council finding amongst its own personnel a sufficiency of persons to constitute a sub-committee. There may be some obvious reason which does not present itself to me for subsection (3) of Section 15:</P>
      <P>Moneys collected by a hospital board by public appeal shall not be used by the board for capital purposes without the consent of the Council.</P>
      <P>Is there any reason why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the simple reason that one of the purposes of the Central Council is to exercise a degree of control over capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that. Still, I do suggest we may be a little too rigid in this matter and discourage desirable charities by an excessive solicitude to secure economy.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne worked himself into a frenzy here on one occasion because nurses and other hospital personnel walked the streets on a wet day to sell flags.  He deplored it and thought they could be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Better occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Better occupied doing real work.  Of course, one of the reasons that people sell flags on the streets is not to raise money, but to discharge the corporal works of mercy. It is a very good thing for people to go out and do servile work, even ignoble work, in the cause of charity. I quite agree with Deputy Dr. Browne there may be much more efficient and effective ways of raising money, but I am not at all sure it is not a good thing <Col N="991" /> to provide people with an opportunity on occasion of going out and discharging the corporal works of mercy for their own spiritual welfare.  I concede the Minister is concerned to protect the funds of the Hospitals Trust and to ensure the highest point of efficiency and to avoid any extravagant expenditure of money, but that is not the end and the beginning of life, and we can go too far.  I can imagine a hospital wanting to add some amenity to the services they are in a position to render and making an appeal to their ex-patients and ex-students to put their heads together to find a means of providing this additional facility for Sir Patrick Dun's, Baggot Street, Mercer's, or whatever hospital it may be.</P>
      <P>I can imagine a council of 40 or 50 people saying that is an expenditure which cannot be justified, and I can imagine the hospital concerned replying: &ldquo;Look, our ex-patients, our ex-students and staff are prepared to put the money together to provide it, and we do not think our discretion to use the money raised to that purpose should be restricted by the Council.&rdquo;  Of course, the Minister may say the Council would not restrict in those circumstances. Ought they to have the power in respect of moneys collected by the Board by public appeal?  I think we could delete that proviso.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, what the heck are we discussing?  It is worthy of consideration.  We can get to the point that it is becoming so rigid that all individual initiative is subjected to supervision and control. I do not think that is a good thing, any more than I think the utilitarian soul of Deputy Dr. Browne, in driving everybody off the streets for discharging the humble task of collecting for charity, is the right reaction.  Both Dr. Browne and the Minister are allowing themselves to be dazzled by an excessive subservience to the false god of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to something in respect of which <Col N="992" /> I do not think this House can divest itself of responsibility on the ground that this is an agreed measure.  This is a matter of some importance.  In the Second Schedule to the Bill, there is provision in paragraph 6, sub-paragraph (1) (c) for the compensation of a person on the ground that no suitable position is available for him under the Council, and it goes on to provide that &ldquo;the Council shall pay to him such compensation (either by way of annuity for life or for a limited period or by way of gratuity) as the Council, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of the employment, the length of service, the rate of remuneration, <i>et cetera</i>) consider fair and reasonable,&rdquo; and sub-paragraph (2) of the same paragraph says: &ldquo;The determination by the Council of any matter arising under this paragraph shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a bad provision.  I do not think this House or any other authority in this country has a right to march into the middle of my life after I have made a contract of service with an employer, break the contract of service and say that my employer shall be entitled to have regard to all the relevant circumstances and determine what form and measure of compensation I am to receive and then to provide that the decision of my employer on any matter arising under this power shall be final and conclusive.  That is clearly wrong.  There ought to be a right of appeal when a person comes within the provisions of that section of the Second Schedule, if he should feel that equitable provision has not been made for him in the event of his being found redundant as a result of federation or amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say it may well happen&mdash;it is probable&mdash;that nobody will prove to be redundant because I envisage federation or amalgamation, if it comes, coming gradually and I think the gradual steps in such a development would help to avoid any redundancy at all.  Consequently, you might never have this paragraph invoked, but there is a principle here and we have never, so far as my memory goes, accepted a statutory position <Col N="993" /> which prohibited a person made redundant through legislation from having a right of appeal from the award of compensation tendered by an employer.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that the bodies whose consent has attended the birth of this Bill will not see the justice and the equity of that case and I think it ought to be explained to them that if they sought to be rigid in this matter, they might put us all in a most embarrassing position.  We have certain obligations to which we must be faithful and a grave and very fundamental principle is here involved which I would be extremely reluctant to see pressed even in what is a quasi-private Bill. I do not believe anybody will be inconvenienced by a suitable amendment. I am not very much concerned about where such an appeal will lie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to say that the appeal should lie to the Minister.  I am concerned that the person concerned has an appeal to somebody other than to the people who were actually a party to the contract of employment which it was necessary to abrogate under the terms of federation and amalgamation.  I have no apprehension that there is any serious probability of anyone suffering injustice in this matter but I know from experience that the absence of the right of appeal can create a sense of grievance and I know from my experience as a legislator in this House that here a matter of principle is involved which I do not believe we would like anybody to persuade us to jettison on the ground that we want to preserve the atmosphere of agreement which has attended the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to say I feel reasonably confident that if those who assisted in the preparation of this legislation have our difficulties explained to them, they will have no serious trouble about consenting to a provision that a suitable appeal be inserted to which any case that might <Col N="994" /> arise can refer if the person concerned feels any sense of grievance or that equity demands a reversal of the proposed compensation award.  Subject to those points, we have no objection to the Bill and will support it at this Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill because it seems to me to represent at long last a crevice or breach in the apparently monolithic indifference of the senior members of the profession in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, to the advances which have been made in medical science over the past 15 or 20 years.  It appears to me to represent a realisation on their part that some steps must be taken to try to retrieve medicine in Dublin from the position of pedestrian mediocrity and stagnation which it has now reached on the administrative, teaching and clinical level.  Because I think some faltering steps are being taken to restore the standard of medicine, and the practice of medicine, to the point at which it once stood, particularly in Dublin, I welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>Knowing the suspicious and the briar-like personalities of the individuals involved in many of these hospital boards, I think above everything, this Bill is a tribute to the remarkable abilities of the man who was responsible for maintaining contact between the members of the boards involved in the initial stages of the attempted amalgamation, the former Secretary of the Department of Health, Mr. Kennedy.  I must say that I am surprised by many of the provisions of the Bill.  The fact that those concerned have agreed to go so far is a great tribute to that man, and to his successor no doubt, who ensured that contact was maintained, and that the many progressive suggestions incorporated in the Bill were made acceptable to the different members of the boards of the various hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal very briefly with Deputy Dillon's comments on the use of funds collected by flag days, and to explain my position in that regard. I have no objection in the world to individual members of the public making their contribution to what Deputy <Col N="995" /> Dillon described as the alleviation of human suffering, by going on the streets and collecting money in that way.  Perhaps their time might be better spent, but my main objection to these flag days for hospitals and other so-called charitable purposes is that the money so collected tends to be regarded as conscience money by the individuals who buy flags.  They feel they have discharged their responsibility to whatever cause is the subject of the flag day and, thereafter, have little or no interest in their responsibility to that particular cause.</P>
    <P>The case made for these flag days is rather similar to the case made with regard to the suggestion that the benevolent employer rendered trade unions unnecessary.  That was, of course, arguing from the particular to the general on a very unsound basis. My objections are based on the same grounds, largely, because I think flag days encourage people to believe they are making a substantial contribution to finally solving a defect in our society when, in fact, they are doing nothing of the kind.  Either consciously or unconsciously they are fooling themselves and for that reason I think it is largely a waste of time, apart from the undesirable feature of youngsters going around the street with boxes of flags with all sorts of consequential undesirable results.</P>
    <P>I am mainly concerned with Section 14, in which there are some remarkable provisions, and in which the present functions of the boards of hospitals are taken over for the time being by the Central Council of Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals and, later on, by the Council of the amalgamated hospitals, should the Minister's hopes for this proposition be realised, and should there be ultimate amalgamation of the different hospitals under the one central board.  With Deputy Dillon, I find it difficult to understand how a board of 40 or 50 members could be a working board. We dealt with this question a short time ago on the Poisons Bill, and the Minister made the case that the size of a board was very important&mdash;the <Col N="996" /> smaller the size the more likely it was that the board would be effective.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that there are probably very special circumstances in this case, in so far as they are boards of hospitals, which, over their lifetime, have tended to be in competition with one another in various ways and any mitigation or any reduction in their autonomy would be anathema to all of them.  In those special circumstances I suppose a board of 40 must be acceptable to us.  Most of us hope that the subcommittees which the Council are empowered to establish will be established at an early date in order that an examination of the different facets of the activities of the Council will be undertaken and that, later on, recommendations will be put forward by the different committees, and we then will get some useful work done.</P>
    <P>The Minister very charitably suggested that the motivation or the dynamic in the creation of the federation, and later on the amalgamation, was a desire to serve the public interest. I should like to think that is true, but it is only fair to say that, in my view, quite an important contribution was made by the basic framework of the public authority health services to which many of us&mdash;over the years in the Department of Health and before that in the Department of Local Government and Public Health &mdash;contributed.  On that framework were built the district hospitals, the county hospitals and then the regional hospitals. From that framework, the present position evolved.</P>
    <P>That development or evolution came from a demand for the highest specialist services at regional hospital level. That has been one of the inevitable and most desirable results of the basis which was created and on which our public health services were developed.  The result, taken together with the establishment of the Local Appointments Commission, has been the wonderful development of the highest level, highest qualified, highest calibre professional appointees to all our hospitals and, in particular, to the ones with which I am concerned, the regional <Col N="997" /> hospitals.  I do not think that generally speaking the level of the medical man, physician or surgeon recently appointed to those hospitals could be higher, due largely to our decision to establish the regional hospitals which would employ primarily the specialist type of physician or surgeon.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is due to the fact that the Local Appointments Commission made it possible for us to scour the world for young Irish graduates who had gone away and become so well equipped that we had little doubt they were fitted to take up the appointments in many of our regional hospitals.  To a considerable extent, I think, that has had its effect on the voluntary hospitals. Putting it bluntly, we have made the pace too hot for them, and they have found out.  That is not entirely the reason, but it is a contribution.  The quality of the personnel in our local authority hospitals is so high and they are provided with such magnificent equipment and wonderful working conditions that the voluntary hospitals have had no alternative but to look about them and see in what way they could put themselves on level terms. That is a wonderful tribute to the intervention of the Department of Health over the years, and it is going to play its part in seeing that the level of medicine in our hospitals generally will be the highest possible.</P>
    <P>While, no doubt, there is a certain element of a desire to serve the public interest in this decision to federate, I do not think it would be quite fair to the activities of the Department of Health over the years, in its chequered career under different Ministers, to ignore that particular aspect of development.  It is probably true to say that in many of our local authority hospitals now, the quality of service certainly is as high&mdash;in some cases it must be even higher&mdash;as is probably generally available in many of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the composition of the Board.  The fact that there are five public representatives on a Board of 40 obviously gives the public very little representation in such a large Board.  Probably the Minister <Col N="998" /> did not have very much say in this.  I do not know whether he did or not.  I am sure he would agree with me that the pattern of the financing of the voluntary hospitals over the years has changed very much.  The time we were dependent upon public subscriptions and the flag days referred to by Deputy Dillon is rapidly passing.  That was emphasised most clearly recently by the decision of the Adelaide Hospital, which held out longest against the Sweep, to come into the Sweep, because the other sources of revenue are drying up rapidly.  It is generally assumed now by the public that the State is looking after the hospitals in one way or another, through the Sweep, subventions from the Exchequer or the rates.  That shows their revenue is tending to dry up.  The result is that a greater and greater percentage of public funds is being paid out to these hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is, then, this question of accountability.  To what extent are we justified in making available to these hospitals, either individually or collectively, in this federation, large sums of public money where we have so little powers to make any decision as to the methods by which this money is used?  I wonder if the Minister is quite satisfied with this representation &mdash;whether he felt it was the maximum that could be obtained at present or whether any improvement could be made on it?  I do not know if anybody is really clear on the method of election of governors to these voluntary hospitals, whether they approve of what appears to be a system of nomination of one kind or another?  The Protestant hospitals largely seem to depend on their association with the Freemason people and the other side on the Knights of Columbanus.  Whatever the method of appointment or nomination, there appears to be no democratic basis of election.  I do not see why, where there is a great public financial interest in the running and control of these hospitals, the public should not have a greater say in their actual running.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would try to make the case that we are not competent to do it or that any of the public <Col N="999" /> representatives nominated by the Departments&mdash;or whatever way it is decided by this House they should be appointed&mdash;cannot run hospitals as well as they can be run under this very curious system of appointment or nomination under which most of the voluntary hospitals operate at present. I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty in so far as, I suppose, he has a certain sense of achievement that he has got even this far.  At the same time, I think we could take it that they have not decided to federate solely because of the public interest.  I think they decided to federate because they must federate.  To put it bluntly, it was a question of hanging together or hanging separately.  We have put them into the position in which they had to come to the Minister and to adopt this procedure. All right; that is an historic development which everybody welcomes; but could we not go further and get greater representation for our own public representatives in the operation of these institutions?</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Health and when anybody made a complaint about something or other which had gone wrong or appeared to have gone wrong in one of these hospitals, when some individual was aggrieved by some action taken, it always struck me as odd that I had to write back and say I had absolutely no power whatever to make an inquiry or to get an answer other than an answer by courtesy. I had no official power to find out why the operation was carried out on the wrong side or why a leg was taken off instead of an arm.  I am not, of course, saying those are in fact the type of cases referred to.  But where a real or imaginary grievance by a member of the public, who is now maintaining these institutions, is brought to the notice of the Minister, as far as I know, he still has not the right to make an inquiry or insist upon a satisfactory answer.  That is a grave defect in the organisation of these voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the development of local authority hospitals, where we have this very desirable evolution of the general county surgeon and at <Col N="1000" /> the higher level, the specialist physician and surgeon in the regional hospitals, we have tended in the voluntary hospitals to develop, in my view, medically and clinically, a most dangerous in between, who is neither a general practitioner nor a full specialist, but a general specialist.  That has been one of the most retrograde developments which has followed the medical practice in our hospitals&mdash;the fragmentation of our effort in medicine in the two broad groupings of the Catholic and Protestant hospitals, the Trinity and National hospitals on the one side, and then the fragmentation within that grouping of the seven different hospitals referred to in this Bill and the many other hospitals throughout the country.  That whole fragmentation of effort has led to the deterioration of standards, to which I referred earlier, and has led above all to the evolution of these general specialists.  That largely arises from the general form of our health services as well as from the system of our hospital organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with it in passing.  The result of too many different hospitals has been that there has been an attempt by physicians and surgeons to deal with too many subjects. They have had no alternative but to do this.  The fact that there are, say, seven hospitals here up to now and that they have to provide a surgeon who can do surgery of the central nervous system, general urinary surgery. cardiac cases and general surgery, taking out appendices, varicose ulcers and so on, and a physician who does various types of medicine, results in our having seven individual surgeons and seven individual physicians who have attempted to spread their talents over too many fields.  The result is that they did not get the turnover of work in any single one of these particular aspects of medicine and surgery to allow them to become pure specialists and, of course, the end result is that the patient has suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> There should be, no doubt, that in saying this I am not criticising the basic skills or talents or intelligence of the surgeons or physicians concerned.  But the evolution of a pure specialist is dependent on his seeing enough work of one particular kind, and the differences to which I referred, the sectarian basis of the different number of hospitals in our small cities, has led to this inevitability of the different surgeons and physicians trying to practise too many different kinds of medicine.  I hope that this Bill will begin to see the development of the pure specialist physician and surgeon working in the purely specialist hospital.  That probably is looking very far ahead, but it seems to me that taking the development of technical scientific medicine, the laboratory, the pathological section, the physicians and the technocrats, the technicians, surgeons and physicians now needed to carry out properly the functions of the pure specialist will properly evolve through the development of the pure specialist hospital such as a cardiac unit, a general urinary unit, a central nervous system unit, a cancer hospital and so on, serviced entirely by specialists devoting all their time to the one pure specialty of the particular institution.  That can only occur, I am afraid, if the surgeon or physician is certain that he can make a good living from carrying out that pure specialisation.</P>
    <P>Probably, to the conscientious doctor or surgeon, one of the most distressing and upsetting things at present is the realisation that in the practice of medicine he has to occupy his time, in order to earn a living, with the carrying out of what are essentially relatively trivial operations&mdash;appendices, varicose ulcers and simple operations of one kind or another, because the individual can afford to pay for his services and he can be called upon, so that time, which he should be spending learning the specialities and practising them and getting to know more and more about the particular field in which he is interested, has to be dissipated on the carrying out of relatively simple trivial operations, which any house surgeon or registrar could carry out in his place. That is one reason why it is difficult to <Col N="1002" /> discuss this Bill without referring to the make-up of our health services generally.</P>
    <P>If the individual physician or surgeon were sufficiently well-remunerated for carrying through intensive study of his speciality, and did not have to dissipate his time with these side issues or minor operations, we would be able here in Dublin to get exactly the same level of skill and technical knowledge as they have anywhere else in the world.  Our surgeons and physicians are just as clever and able, with as high a level of skill and ability, as those in any other country; in fact, our people have generally whenever they have got the opportunity abroad, become specialists and have very often risen to the top without any difficulty.  Hence the members of the profession here are the victims of the existing scheme of things.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will make it possible for the standard of medicine for the doctor or physician or surgeon who wants to specialise, and who believes that he can become highly skilled in his own particular speciality, to be raised by enabling this Council to establish specialised units in which such a man will be able to work and see such a turnover of the one particular work that he will become highly skilled and qualified in that particular aspect of medicine or surgery, and the end product of all that will be that the patient will benefit.  Make no mistake about it, the end product of the present system of medicine in Dublin and in Ireland generally has been made at the expense of the patients.  The patient has suffered because of the quality and skill of the type of work carried out which is of a very ordinary level, to put it at its most charitable.</P>
    <P>One of the other types of hospitals which I would like to see this Council attempt to establish and which is very badly needed indeed, is the pure accident hospital.  The position as far as I know at present in Dublin and most of our cities is that the average hospital has a physician or surgeon who is on accident duty.  Then at weekends, at night-time and at other times when he would not normally be in the hospital and he is called he may or may not <Col N="1003" /> come as he thinks fit.  Again, we have the same dissipation of skill and talent. A man who is really interested in the central individual system of cardiac surgery or gastric surgery or general urinary surgery is put on accident duty.  He has to take his accident duty.  This not only happens in his own hospital.  There may be three or four surgeons attached to a hospital.  Three or four surgeons have to pretend to a skill of a high level in accident work which it itself has become merely a speciality.  That is happening in one hospital and it is also happening in every other hospital. They are all pretending to this high skill, high talent, with this particular speciality of accidents there.  Consider the position of a person with the most meagre knowledge of this side of surgery when split-second decisions taken when an accident case is brought in make all the difference between life and death.</P>

      <P>Under subparagraph (h) there is the determination of the hospitals in which particular clinical units shall be located.  I hope the Council will take steps to ensure under subparagraph (h) of Section 14 that such an accident unit is established.  I should prefer if an accident hospital were established so that there would be centralisation of accident work where a patient is certain of getting immediate attention at the very highest medical and surgical level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties which arise here is a consequence of the fact that insurance work is associated with accident work.  Some difficulty may arise <Col N="1004" /> in that regard but I have no doubt it would be possible to overcome it by some rota system.  However, the importance of getting a high level of surgical treatment for accident cases must surely transcend the financial consideration which might be a barrier to the establishment of such a clinic. There is no doubt that this is a very badly needed development.  Under this Bill it will be possible for the Council to decide on the establishment of a single separate unit for the treatment of accident work.</P>
    <P>I see also in Section 14 that the question of the establishment of professorial units and the attempted establishment of some rationalisation of the teaching methods in the hospitals will be dealt with.  This action is long overdue.  I do not know if it is quite as bad as when I was a student, but conditions under which clinical teaching was said to be carried out were quite intolerable then.  The general idea was that a consulting surgeon or physician would come in and take a victim&mdash;you could call him nothing else&mdash;in the public ward.  I never had a clinic in a private ward. Sometimes with his permission, though more often than not without his permission, he was then subjected to an examination in the public ward.  Before the end of the clinic, all the intimate details of his medical history, his family history and his personal history were broadcast all over the ward.  I always smiled afterwards when in controversy the medical profession used to refer to the sacredness of the doctor-patient relationship.</P>

      <P>Subparagraph (k) of Section 14 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>the co-ordination of activities in relation to medical education and the conduct of negotiations in regard to such education with the appropriate university, college or other institution, including the making of suitable agreements with such bodies to ensure efficient clinical instruction for medical students and to provide facilities for post graduate instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, these boards have not done this already.  I am trying to <Col N="1006" /> point that out and to suggest that because they have not done it already, in my view in the public interest they ought to do it.  That is the case I make.</P>
    <P>I believe that if they are to discharge the functions which I should like them to discharge they will take steps to see that this practice of taking a patient in a public ward and, with or without his permission, disclosing the intimate details of his personal and medical history is changed.  It is a most undesirable and unnecessary practice.  I know quite well in clinical teaching it is necessary to show a patient's condition to students.  At some hospitals they take steps to see that the rights of individual patients are observed in so far as they are asked whether they would mind an examination being carried out on them. The clinic is then held in a proper clinical theatre.  That is the practice in some hospitals but I should like to see it the practice in every hospital. I should like to see that the details of the patient's history and personal life are respected with the consideration which the medical profession have often said they feel the patient is entitled to.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I have seen from 50 to 100 individuals gathered around an unfortunate patient's bed.  Personally I think that that is very undesirable from the point of view of the patients. It can be very tiring for a sick man or women and, where it is practised, it is something that this Council could occupy itself in putting right.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised to see that it has been found possible, under Section 14, to say that appointments will be made to the federated Dublin hospitals and not to an individual hospitals.  I presume that some attempt will be made to ensure that the persons to be appointed to these hospitals will be appointed by some scheme, the aim of which will be to see that the best physician or surgeon will be appointed. In carrying out this it is important that, if we are to upgrade the quality of the physician or surgeon in the voluntary hospitals, as we have succeeded in doing in the local authority <Col N="1007" /> hospitals, the whole question of appointments will be studied with considerable care by the Council of the Federation.  The practice has grown up of making appointments on largely personal grounds, on the grounds of personal association with individual members of the staff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as one can see there are, broadly, three ways in which these appointments are made.  The first is through the Local Appointments Commission which seems to me to be the way in which the best possible physician or surgeon can be obtained. The system is not universally infallible but it goes as near as it is possible to go in order to ensure that the best possible surgeon or physician is appointed.  There is then a system under which the physician or surgeon has to make out from 150 to 200 applications and bring them around to the various members of the Board of Governors.  It seems to me that this is not a practice whereby one will get the best possible medical man or surgeon. I do not see how a layman can decide as to the technical qualifications <Col N="1008" /> of an individual doctor or surgeon. Perhaps Deputy Briscoe thinks he is competent to appoint a surgeon or a physician.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am resentful of the Deputy's attempt to disparage these hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point, that under a system whereby a surgeon or physician has to hawk between 115 and 200 copies of his qualifications to the same number of civilians, one is not likely to get the best possible surgeon or physician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not read the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the making of appointments by the medical board of the hospital.  I do not think that this is likely to get us the highest possible level of medical or surgical appointee for many reasons, the main one being that I do not think the medical board would be particularly concerned to see that a more highly qualified surgeon or physican than is included on the board itself should be appointed to the hospital.  I think that is asking too much and I think it should be possible to have some composite board from the seven federated hospitals to make the appointment.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that because of the inevitability of nepotism and jobbery inherent in the making of appointments, we here in this House decided, many years ago, to establish the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission.  I hope that, in looking for headlines as to how the best medical people and surgical people can be appointed, we shall follow the headline that we have already set in the Dáil.  I do not think anybody would suggest that the present methods used in these hospitals are as good as&mdash;they are certainly not superior to&mdash;the methods used in public authority hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the need, though I can to some extent understand it, for the retention of Section 14 (2) providing for the denominational character of appointments to the medical staff.  I <Col N="1009" /> am sorry that that sort of provision should still obtain in relation to Irish medicine.  It helps to perpetuate division and is, in my opinion, just as invidious as the division that exists in our two universities here in Dublin. Not alone that but it tends to dissipate the energies of both surgeons and physicians and also tends to fragment the efforts of medical and surgical teams.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of Irish medicine it would be much more desirable if that division did not exist, except in such aspects as midwifery and gynaecology, where certain ethical considerations enter into the picture. So far as general surgery and medicine are concerned, efforts should be collective and co-operative rather than competitive.  There is no discrimination in politics.  It is rather a commentary that this provision should have to be included in the case of medicine.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider it desirable or necessary that someone coopted to the Council should continue to be a member of that Council until death, resignation or cessor of membership under subsection (8), etc.?  The public representatives will go forward for election every five years and take their chance on their record for re-election to this Central Council.  Why should the hospital or university members of the board continue in office indefinitely?  Why should they not be prepared to take their chance?  If they have served to the satisfaction of the hospital authorities they will be re-nominated to continue their representation.  Is it desirable that a person who may be getting on in years, and who is not as active or as useful as he ought to be, should be retained indefinitely?  There should be some reappraisal of suitability at reasonable intervals in the same way as opportunity is given in the case of politicians and members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope there will not be any undue delay in amalgamation. I hope that from that amalgamation will flow an understanding <Col N="1010" /> of the common interests and the common objective these different hospitals have to serve the public in the best possible way.  This amalgamation or federation may set the headline for other hospitals and even for our universities and medical schools.  At that stage we shall once more be in a position to put Irish medicine back into the place it held in the past in the world of medicine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the board of one of the hospitals concerned in this federation.  I have been a member of that board for a very long number of years.  I was aware of the development of this idea of amalgamation or federation right from the start.  Many bricks have been thrown by Deputy Dr. Browne at both the seven hospitals concerned in the Bill and the medical staffs of those hospitals.  There was an idea at one time that regional hospitals would be set up.  So acceptable was that idea at the time that the voluntary hospitals were not encouraged to modernise because modernisation in the face of such a development would represent wasted expenditure.  It is only in recent years the idea of regional hospitals has been abandoned.  As a result of the federation of the seven mentioned in this Bill it is hoped it will be easier to develop regional hospitalisation. In that event many of these old hospitals may cease to exist.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister pay tribute to these hospitals.  I was glad to hear him detail their origins, their history and their management right up to the present day.  I know the professional people&mdash;the medical people, surgeons and so forth&mdash;of many of these hospitals, particularly the one in which I serve and I know the lay members, and I know that when the idea was conveyed to them it was considered quite seriously, not only by each hospital but by meetings between representatives of each of the hospitals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without any delay whatever in order that suspicions, if you like, or doubts might be cleared up, a request was made to the Minister for Health to receive representatives of all of the <Col N="1011" /> hospitals concerned to hear their views and to see how an approach could be made to get a proper understanding and a possible acceptance of that idea. Without any hesitation or delay such a large body of people representing the seven hospitals were received and they were very happy to have the Secretary of the Department of Health made available to them to act with them in constant and detailed discussion on every aspect of the proposed Bill and all that would flow from it.</P>
    <P>I have attended meetings of my own hospital board and they have been furnished with details of this Bill and the ideas behind it and I have on occasions been selected to meet representatives of others.  I am sorry that Deputy Dr. Browne is leaving the House because I should like to say a few things to him with reference to his own speech.  It is very easy to attack people here and then not be prepared to listen to the defence of the people who have been so unwarrantably attacked.  Obviously Deputy Dr. Browne did not read the Bill.  He did not want to read the Bill.  He is a doctor with a grievance against other doctors.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically is designed for the Council that is to be established to operate as did each hospital board. Each hospital has its own medical staff and the medical staff themselves deal with everything that concerns the medical side, including the selection of personnel for recommendation to the full board for appointment.  In the Bill, and Deputy Dr. Browne has not referred to it, five persons will represent each of the seven hospitals, making a total of 35.  Of these five representing each hospital, two will be professional gentlemen, either doctors or surgeons, but certainly from the medical side, so that in the full council there will be 14 leading professional people to decide points for the future, to negotiate and to decide with the universities and with the nurses' organisation with regard to training and educational facilities, and so forth.  Up to the present each hospital separately appointed its own personnel but it is <Col N="1012" /> envisaged in this Bill that, from now on where a vacancy occurs, the Council shall make the appointment but the appointee will no longer be an appointee for that specific hospital; he will be appointed to act for the whole seven.  That will enable them to concentrate in each case where an appointment is to be filled to obtain what might be regarded as the highest qualifications.</P>
    <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House in trying to follow all these subtle accusations, insults by innuendo, and, at the end, a direct insult and attack, suggesting that up to the present these appointments in the voluntary hospitals have been by way of jobbery. It is a shame that we in Dublin who know our voluntary hospitals, who know the service they have given and are giving to so many of our people, should hear the responsible people in these hospitals attacked so unwarrantably as has been done in this House today.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a Council of 40 would become unwieldy&mdash;35 men and women representing the hospitals, including 14 professional people, and five representatives from the health authority.  Anybody who has served on a hospital board knows that each hospital board consists of nearly that number anyway.  They have been well managed in the past and there has not been any suggestion of the proceedings being unwieldy.  The meetings of these boards are conducted in an excellent manner with no division of opinion on political or religious lines.  Nothing is considered except the concern of all, the welfare of the patients in the hospital and the well-being of the hospital itself.  In the same way you are going to have each hospital board selecting from its membership three of its lay people, and not more than two of its professional people, so that there will be no fear of the Council being over-weighted with professional people, giving people like Deputy Dr. Browne an opportunity of saying that this Council was set up for the benefit and welfare of the doctors themselves. Together with the five representatives from the health authority, there will be a majority of lay people who will all <Col N="1013" /> be concerned with the hospitalisation facilities of the city.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that in all the discussions we had at our own board, and in all the meetings we had with representatives of other hospital boards, I did not detect any resistance to the Minister's intention to bring about this federation and ultimate amalgamation.  I was at the meeting of my own hospital board when the matter was finally discussed and when they were made aware of roughly what was going to be in the Bill.  I must say there seemed to be a perfect understanding and acceptance of the situation and a belief that this, through the help of the Minister and the help of the Department, was a step forward in the development of hospitalisation in the city of Dublin and a clear acceptance that if and when the Minister, whoever he may be, and the Department are ready to announce plans for the building of regional hospitals, there will be a willingness to surrender all that is in the hands of the Council to the new regional hospital idea, if that ever comes along, and we hope it will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke about how undemocratic it was to have only five representatives of local authorities on this Council.  By implication it would appear that all the rest were either doctors or just stooges of doctors. Then he attacked the hospital boards, which are by a vast majority in each case lay people, with representatives of the local authority on the board, for jobbery in the appointment of doctors and the selection of the worst and not the best.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has visited patients in these seven hospitals, or who has been himself a patient, cannot come away with any other idea but that in all circumstances we have been very well served.  I am not competent to adjudicate on the ability of the specialists in these hospitals to act as teachers of students and young doctors but I do know and I am proud to say that in all my travels wherever I have been I have found that graduates of our Universities, trained in our hospitals <Col N="1014" /> including these voluntary hospitals, are always welcome wherever they go abroad and are always given credit for being the best qualified people and highly trained.  So that there must be some credit due to our teaching hospitals at their present level.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible thing to have placed on the records of this House, in our verbatim report, statements such as have been made by Deputy Dr. Browne, which are read elsewhere and which when read in other countries make us appear as a primitive people with the most horrible ways of going about our affairs, particularly those which concern humanity.  I have been to hospitals in other countries.  I have met professional people in other countries.  I am quite satisfied that none of the innuendoes and allegations made by Deputy Dr. Browne deserves to be given any credence whatever. The poor man is suffering from some kind of medical boil for which apparently there is no proper treatment except that it must work itself out over a period of years.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, representing that local authority on a number of hospitals, I want to say to the Minister that in this matter he has not only the acceptance of the various hospitals but also their gracious thanks for it.</P>
    <P>This Bill when it becomes an Act and when the Council is set up will bring about vast improvements.  There are various little items that have been discussed here.  Deputy Dillon referred to the prohibition against any one of these hospitals using money that they might get by collection or otherwise, for instance, a big bequest, for expenditure of a capital nature without the consent of the Council.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The idea is that only a limited amount of up-to-date expensive equipment can be purchased and it cannot be available in each of the hospitals; but, if the hospitals work together, one of these items can be procured in the use of which all seven hospitals can participate.</P>
    <P>The question of what joint appointments would mean was discussed in great detail.  If you got a first-class heart specialist, why should he be confined <Col N="1015" /> to one hospital and the other six not have his services for their patients? This appointee will now be at the service of all seven hospitals and he will be on call at all seven hospitals and if he wants a particularly expensive instrument installed in one of the hospitals which he considers most suited for it, then the seven hospitals through the Council will have much more chance of getting assistance from the Department of Health for the installation of the apparatus than exists at the present time.  The same goes for building.</P>
    <P>I think this is a temporary Bill.  I think the federation freely accepted, as the Minister has said, by agreement by the seven hospitals concerned, will in time develop into amalgamation. There will be great economies in the meanwhile and possibly the Department will be able then to indicate when it will be able to proceed with the erection in Dublin of regional hospitals which will be able to operate and to function as does St. Kevin's, which is one of the finest institutions we have from a hospital point of view, for the benefit of the people.  We will not then have these older buildings which have been built up and extended from time to time.  I do not know whether they are going to be 300 bed, 500 bed or 1,000 bed hospitals.  These are things that the combined wisdom of all concerned will decide as being the best from a utilitarian point of view.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister should have had to listen to this abuse of one section of our medical profession, but I can assure him on behalf of the seven hospitals that this Bill will be welcomed when it becomes an Act and that all concerned will be only too happy to work wholeheartedly to make the Bill, when it is an Act and when the Council is set up, a complete success.</P>

      <P>After the speech of Deputy Briscoe, I do not think it requires any words of mine to refute the allegations which have been made by Deputy Dr. Browne.  I deprecate very strongly the fact that he has seized on this Bill, which is a manifestation <Col N="1016" /> of the readiness of a section of the medical profession in Dublin to co-operate with one another and to co-operate with the Minister in order to give a better service to the public, to make an attack upon those concerned in bringing this situation about.  I merely wish to say that I do not accept Deputy Dr. Browne's assessment of the profesional standing or competency of the doctors attached to these hospitals.</P>
      <P>It is a very regrettable thing that, whenever an issue of any importance is discussed in this House, the Deputy is never able to approach it except from the point of view that everybody is motivated by narrow self-interest. That, of course, is the weakness of the Marxist philosophy which colours every pronouncement the Deputy makes in relation to any matter of public interest&mdash;the idea that every human effort is rooted in and dominated by materialistic motives.  It is a pity that the Deputy, who, no doubt, is very sincere in his approach to social questions, should be inspired by a philosophy which disregards the spiritual instincts in mankind.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that I had to say so much but I know how difficult in one sense it has been for those who were associated with these long-established traditions to come together and to turn their faces towards the idea that these traditions and the history which is behind them will be lost, as Deputy Briscoe has stated, in one regional or other institution which will supplant and replace them.  There it is, however; I have said it and I do not want to say any more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, referred to the fact that the Central Council will consist of 40 members and suggested that that would be an unwieldy body to deal with the affairs of the federation.  I have no doubt that those who compose that body, having manifested their ability to manage their own affairs and the affairs of their hospitals, will find a way of dealing with the problems which will face the federation.  It is not outside their competency to decide that, from their 40 members, they will <Col N="1017" /> elect a central committee which will deal with the affairs of the hospital and the day-to-day affairs of the federation and, at the end of a period, present an account to the Central Council of their stewardship.  I cannot see any real practical difficulty arising from the fact that there are 40 members on the Central Council.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also seemed to think it rather strange that the committees which this Council might decide to set up should include in their number some persons who were not members of the Central Council.  That is merely a precaution taken by these men of foresight to meet the situation where they might require specialist advice of a particular kind and where they might succeed in getting that specialist advice voluntarily.  A number of matters which are dealt with in Sections 7 and 14 of the Bill partake of the nature, one might say, of the memorandum and articles of association of a company. They were anxious, and quite properly anxious, to provide for every contingency which they might be able to foresee and they have provided for that in the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was one point of substance in what Deputy Dillon had to say.  I want to make it quite clear that he was not antagonistic to the Bill, that his remarks were addressed to try to elucidate matters which appeared to him to require an explanation, and that in general he wished to be helpful. When I say &ldquo;one point of substance,&rdquo; I do not wish that to be taken as a suggestion that he did not make a useful contribution to the debate.  The point to which I refer, however, is a question whether, in relation to Article 6 of the Second Schedule, there should be the right of appeal to some person. I am not so certain that it would be easy to find an appellate tribunal which would be satisfactory to everybody, but I will put that point to those who are interested in the federation and, if they agree, on Committee Stage put some suggestion before the House in relation to it.</P>
    <P>This is an agreed measure and it is permissive, as Deputy Dillon pointed out.  It allows the seven long-established <Col N="1018" /> institutions to come together and to co-operate with one another with the ultimate purpose that one day they will merge into one institution.  If they have come to an agreement on some rather ticklish matters, the House should be slow to criticise what they are proposing to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £85,940 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice and of certain other Services administered by that Office, including a Grant-in-aid; and of the Public Record Office, and of the Keeper of State Papers, Dublin <Col N="1019" /> (30 &amp; 31 Vict., c. 70; 38 &amp; 39 Vict., c. 59; and 39 &amp; 40 Vict., c. 58), and for the purchase of Historical Documents, etc.</P>
    <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle and if it is agreeable to the House, to follow the practice of previous years and to deal with the Votes for which the Minister for Justice is responsible, namely Nos. 23 to 28, as a group, so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise any particular point on a particular Vote.</P>
    <P>Taking together the group of Estimates for which I am responsible, it will be observed that the number of Estimates has been reduced from nine to six.  This reduction has taken place as a measure of simplification, and has been brought about by including the Estimate for the Public Record Office in that for the Office of the Minister for Justice, and by combining the former three Estimates for the District Court, Circuit Court and Supreme and High Courts into one Estimate for the Courts of Justice.  This does not, however, affect the total amount of the Estimates, which show an allover increase as compared with the previous year of £647,480, practically all of which is accounted for by increases in the Garda Síochána Estimate.  The bulk of that increase is due to the revision in May last of Garda rates of pay following the implementation of the findings of the Garda Arbitration Board on a pay claim and to further pay revision resulting from the acceptance of a Garda Conciliation recommendation for consolidation of rent allowance with pay.  There is also an increase of the order of £141,000 in the provision that has to be made for police pensions. This increase is partly due to the greater numbers of the original members of the force who are reaching the age for retirement, and is caused in part by the pay revision to which I have referred and by the change in the treatment of rent allowance for pension purposes.  Thus by far the greater part of the increase in expenditure is attributable to pay and pension increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> Deputies will be aware that some of the foregoing items, and some of those that follow, have already been mentioned by me when I came to the House in March last to ask for Supplementary Estimates for a number of the services administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>The first Vote, No. 23, is for the Office of the Minister for Justice, and makes provision for the staff of the Department's headquarters.  A review of activities, since I spoke on the Estimates last year, indicates a period of solid achievement, the most notable features of which were&mdash;the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act; the operation for a full year of the Garda Síochána Concilliation and Arbitration Scheme; the substantial progress made in the field of law reform; the reorganisation of the district court; and the special attention given to the traffic problem in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act made a number of valuable modifications in relation to penal procedures, and I shall deal later with experience to date of the working of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act was passed during the year after extended consideration in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As Deputies will recall, the Act made substantial changes not only in the opening hours of licensed premises, but also in the general law relating to the grant of intoxicating liquor licences.</P>
    <P>During the year a number of important claims brought by the Garda under their Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme were disposed of, either at conciliation level or as a result of arbitration.  The improvements in remuneration secured by the Garda under the scheme are reflected in the increased provision made in the Estimate for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In view of the interest taken by the general public in the incidence of crime, I am glad that for the first time for a number of years, I can report that the incidence of crime has decreased, and that the position has been improved in two respects: first, the crime figures <Col N="1021" /> for 1960 were significantly lower than in the preceding year and, secondly, the detection rate has gone up.</P>
    <P>The total number of indictable crimes reported to the Garda Síochána dropped from 17,865 in 1959 to 15,375 in 1960, a decrease of 2,490 or 14 per cent.  Simultaneously, the detection rate rose from 50 per cent. to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have said here more than once, the crime problem is, in the main, a Dublin problem.  When the total crime figures go up, we invariably find that it is in Dublin that the bulk of the increase has taken place, and, as one can expect, when the figures drop, it is in Dublin that the significant drop occurs; and so it has been last year. The total figure for indictable crime in Dublin dropped from 11,231 in 1959 to 8,756 in 1960, a decrease of 2,475 or 22 per cent.  This drop in crime is to some extent due to an increase in the Metropolitan force and also to the fact that the Garda are getting more co-operation from the general public, especially through the use of the 999 telephone emergency system.</P>
    <P>The causes of crime are complex and decreases in crime figures may well be as difficult to explain fully as increases in them.  We did, however, take special measures to increase the efficiency of the police machine in dealing with crime, especially in Dublin where the increase in crime had been a cause of serious concern. Apart from the increase in manpower mentioned, we also provided for improved communications systems, including round-the-clock motor-cycle patrols equipped with radio.  I think that we are justified in concluding that these measures have made their contribution to the improvement that I am now able to report to the House, both in relation to the total crime figure and in relation to the detection rate; and there is every reason to believe that, as regards the more serious offences&mdash;housebreakings, etc.&mdash;the contribution made by those changes was substantial.  For instance, the number of burglaries and house-breakings <Col N="1022" /> dropped by nearly a quarter &mdash;from 3,600 to less than 2,800&mdash;and the number of cases in which the Garda Síochána were able to institute proceedings increased from 66 per cent. to 71 per cent.</P>
    <P>That, however, is only part of the story.  Improved methods in the Garda Síochána have, as I believe, affected the volume of crime of the most serious kind, but these crimes, in numerical terms, and therefore in their effect on the total crime figure, are less significant than crimes such as larceny. As I have said in previous years, larcenies of pedal bicycles account for a substantial number of the reported crimes, and this is a crime which is particularly difficult to detect and in which it is particularly important that the emphasis should be on preventive measures rather than on subsequent detective work.</P>
    <P>I think that I would be doing a disservice to the public if I were to let it be thought that any spectacular improvement in relation to crimes such as these is possible solely as a result of anything that the Garda Síochána can do.  Yet, these are crimes which are in practice only too often facilitated by cyclists who will not take the elementary precaution of locking their bicycles when leaving them unattended. The same applies to articles left in unlocked motor cars.</P>
    <P>Last year, I made a special appeal to those concerned both in their own interest and in the public interest to be more careful in this respect.  Whether my appeal had anything to do with it or not, the figures for last year do show a noticeable improvement.  Larceny of bicycles dropped by over 1,000 from the 1959 figure of 3,700 approximately, and larcenies from unattended vehicles dropped by 500, from 1,850 approximately.  I am, therefore, encouraged to repeat my appeal this year: to cyclists to lock their bicycles effectively, and to car owners not only to lock their cars when leaving them unattended but also to ensure that no goods of value are left on view in them to attract thieves.</P>
    <P>I now turn to summary offences. There the figures relate to the number <Col N="1023" /> of prosecutions&mdash;not the number of offences committed.  The reason for this, of course, is that it would be impossible to say how many summary offences are committed, since a substantial number of them, such as minor breaches of the traffic laws, never find their way into Garda records.</P>
    <P>The number of prosecutions rose from 89,000 approximately in 1959 to 103,000 approximately in 1960, an increase of some 14,000, which, I may say, was due entirely to an increase in the number of prosecutions for road traffic offences.  Nearly half of that increase relates to offences against the lighting regulations&mdash;the prosecutions for those offences increased by over 6,000, to a figure of 28,253 in 1960. I think that, in the interests of road safety, the House generally will welcome this evidence of increased vigilance against breaches of the lighting regulations.  As well as that, there were increases in respect of all the common driving offences.</P>
    <P>Those traffic prosecutions amounted to nearly 67 per cent. of the total last year.  Next&mdash;though a long way behind&mdash;came prosecutions under the Licensing Acts which amounted to 14,800 approximately, a decrease of about 2,000 on the preceding year. May I at this point mention that as all these figures relate to years which ended on 30th September, the figures for licensing prosecutions would be very little affected by the enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act last year, as that did not become law until the beginning of July.</P>
    <P>The only other figures that are of any significance numerically, in the category of summary offences, are those relating to unlicensed dogs and there the number of prosecutions increased by over 500, to a total of 4,090.</P>
    <P>The number of persons killed in road accidents in 1960 was 302, a slight decrease on the preceding year's figure of 306.  The number of persons injured in road accidents in 1960 was 5,451, an increase of 962 on the preceding year's figure of 4,489.</P>
    <P>After several months of quiescence, the futile campaign of violence in the <Col N="1024" /> vicinity of the Border has recently been resumed.  For reasons which have been frequently explained&mdash;our obligation to enforce the law and our belief that this campaign is seriously detrimental to the realisation of the national aim of reuniting the Irish people&mdash;the Government are taking determined measures to bring these activities to an end.  I think it is right to mention that the measures in force impose a very considerable strain on the Garda resources and are costing the taxpayers about £370,000 per year. The Government will not, however, be deterred by these considerations in intensifying these measures if this should be necessary to bring this stupid campaign to an end.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimates were discussed in the House last year, substantial progress has been made in dealing with the considerable number of legislative proposals which were then pressing for attention.  Some of them, such as those relating to rent restrictions, had already been circulated at that time and have since been piloted through the Oireachtas.  Others had been introduced but, owing to their complex and technical character, proved to require further detailed examination before they could be approved for circulation. Finally, there were other proposals which the Department was being pressed to proceed with, but which could not be advanced owing to the general pressure of work on my officers and myself.</P>
    <P>Since then, I can report that we have passed into law the Rent Restrictions Bill, which was a comprehensive measure consolidating the existing statute law and amending it in certain fundamental and controversial respects; and a Solicitors Bill, which raised important issues affecting the public interest, including the amending of the provisions relating to the Compensation Fund.  As well as these, a Bill consolidating and amending the law relating to charities has been passed through the Dáil, and progress has also been made with the Juries Bill and the two Bills dealing with the establishment and constitution of the courts as provided for in Article 34 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> Deputies, particularly those who have had experience as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, will appreciate that very often the most difficult work connected with legislation has to be done before the text of the Bill is published.  This is particularly true in relation to Bills of the character of those recently circulated such as the Courts Bills and the Civil Liability Bill.  I am personally very gratified that with the limited resources at our disposal it has been possible to make such progress without neglecting other aspects of the administration.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the usual administrative activities of my Department. So far as adoption is concerned, the level of activity was much the same as in the previous year; during the year 1960, An Bord Uchtála made 505 adoption orders, of which just over 200 were in Dublin: 232 of the adoption orders were in respect of boys, and 273 in respect of girls.</P>
    <P>The number of aliens resident in the country in 1960 for three months or more who were obliged to register with the police was 2,849, which is slightly less than in the previous year.  The majority were from Germany, Italy, Holland, U.S.A., France and Belgium. The number of aliens who visited this country during 1960, excluding those who came through Great Britain, was almost 40,000.  The great majority were, of course, coming for holidays or for short business visits.  As I have mentioned in previous years, our policy is to facilitate the admission of foreigners in these categories with the minimum of formality and paper work; and checks at the ports are simplified as far as is possible, consistent with immigration requirements.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I mentioned last year that negotiations were in progress for the admission to Ireland, without passports, of tourists from certain West European countries who hold a visitor's card and a national identity document&mdash;the visitor's cards to be made available through travel agencies, legations, etc., abroad.  I am glad to be able to report that arrangements are now in operation whereby French, Belgian, Swiss, and Liechtenstein <Col N="1026" /> nationals are admitted to this country on production of their national identity cards in conjunction with visitor's cards.  I may also add that negotiations with a number of other European countries with a view to operating similar arrangements for their nationals are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>During the year, 35 persons were granted certificates of naturalisation as Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Just over 4,000,000 feet of films were examined by the Official Censor in 1960.  The number of films certified by the Censor as fit in their entirety for exhibition to the public was 1,170 and an additional 220 were passed with cuts.  Fifty-six films were rejected. Thirty-three were the subject of appeals to the Appeal Board&mdash;21 of which appeals were rejected.  There were appeals against cuts in five cases, all of which were rejected.</P>
    <P>The statistics for the year 1960 in respect of censorship of publications show that the Censorship Board examined 518 books and 83 periodicals, and made 357 Prohibition Orders &mdash;291 being in respect of books and 66 in respect of periodical publications.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na Míre Gaile considered 30 cases during 1960 and awarded three bronze medals and 30 certificates for bravery.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 24, is for £5,910,320 for the Garda Síochána. This sum is greater by £618,610 than the original Estimate for 1960/61 and exceeds by £181,610 the total of the 1960/61 Original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate for that year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see from the printed Estimates, the principal increases fall to be borne on the Pay and the Pensions subheads, subhead A and subhead M. In the case of subhead A, the reason for the increase, and which also gave rise to the Supplementary Estimate for 1960/61, arises from the determination of two claims under the Garda Síochána Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, one relating to pay increases and the other to rent allowances and to the pensionability of these allowances.  The acceptance by the Government of the findings of the chairman of the Garda <Col N="1027" /> Síochána Arbitration Board has given higher scales of pay to members of the Force with effect from the 1st March, 1960.  These increases will cost approximately £430,000 in respect of pay for the Force this year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £134,000, in addition to the £180,000 which would be required if rent allowance had continued to be paid as a separate non-pensionable allowance, has had to be provided in the Pay subhead in consequence of the acceptance by the Ministers for Finance and Justice of a recommendation by the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council for the consolidation of rent with pay. The Garda Conciliation Council recommended the discontinuance of the practice whereby rents of varying amounts were paid to members for whom official quarters were not available, and that, in lieu, a uniform pensionable amount for the different ranks be added to the pay of each member, the amount to be subject to a deduction in the case of a member provided with quarters.  Both these increases, that is, the pay increase proper and the increase following from consolidation, are reflected in the increased sum required to meet the cost of pensions and gratuities.</P>
    <P>As a result of the pay award, members retiring now on maximum rates of pension and gratuity receive additional sums ranging in their pensions from £29 2s. 3d. p.a. in the case of a Guard to £95 0s. 0d. in the case of a Chief Superintendent while, in their gratuities, the increased amount will be not less than £97 0s. 0d. for a Guard and £317 0s. 0d. for a Chief Superintendent. In consequence of the consolidation of rent with pay a Guard will get a further increase of £32 11s. 9d. p.a. in his pension and not less than £109 in his gratuity; the Chief Superintendent will receive a pension increase of £55 0s. 0d. p.a. and an additional amount of at least £183 0s. 0d. in his gratuity.  It is anticipated that the combined cost on subhead M of these additional increases will amount to £90,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>Other increases resulting from settlement of claims under the Conciliation and Arbitration machinery related to <Col N="1028" /> revision of the locomotion and cycling allowances payable and the issue of gloves and an additional tie as part of the uniform equipment of Sergeants and Guards.</P>
    <P>The mobility of the Force will be further increased next year by the addition of 29 cars to the Garda fleet for use in country divisions.  Provision has also been made for installing a two-way radio system in Limerick city similar to that in use in Dublin and Cork.  The re-organisation of the Force in Dublin to which I referred last year has been partly implemented. Full implementation, involving additional appointments in the Inspector rank, will require enabling legislation which I propose to introduce shortly. Increased provision has also been made in subhead D to send selected members of the Force to attend courses abroad with a view to keeping them abreast of the most modern methods of crime detection and prevention.</P>
    <P>During the year, 215 members will be leaving the Force on age grounds. To this figure must be added a further 235 which is the estimated figure of wastage from voluntary retirements before the age limit, resignations, deaths, etc., making a total estimated wastage of 450 for the year.  The Estimates provide for a recruitment of up to 450 recruits (including 30 Ban-Ghardai) during the year.  If there is any significant drop in wastage the number of recruits attested will be suitably reduced.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Division which stood at 1,719 on 31st March, 1960, was 1,769 on 31st March, 1961.  Over the past couple of years, it has been found necessary to increase the personnel in the Dublin Metropolitan Division with a view to coping with crime and other problems in the city.  The strength figure includes three Ban-shairsinti and 13 Ban-Ghardai.</P>
    <P>Deputies have probably learned already that police dogs are being used in Dublin for the past couple of months as a further aid in the prevention and detection of crime.  There has already been at least one instance in which these animals have proved their <Col N="1029" /> value in the apprehension of criminals, and I am confident that experience over the next few years will show that the acquisition of these dogs was a worth-while innovation.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for Prisons, No. 25, is for £242,930.  In this Estimate provision is made for the upkeep and staffing of Mountjoy, Portlaoise and Limerick Prisons and St. Patrick's Institution and for the maintenance of an estimated daily average of 480 prisoners and inmates.  Provision is also made for certain expenditure which under statute is a charge on the Prisons Vote, such as the cost of the escort and conveyance of prisoners and the cost of maintenance of prisoners confined in district mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Estimate shows an increase of £19,270 over the Original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate for 1960/ 61.  These increases are in the main borne on the subheads of Pay and Allowances, Victualling, Clothing, Bedding and Furniture, Maintenance of Buildings and Equipment and the Manufacturing Department and Farm. On the pay side, the additional cost is principally due to increases resulting from the settlement of staff claims under conciliation and arbitration machinery and the recruitment of additional staff for the supervision of political prisoners in Mountjoy.  An improved dietary for prisoners and inmates, which is being introduced very shortly, is responsible for the increased victualling costs.  While the present diet is of good standard from the point of view of nutrition, I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat monotonous and that some variation of the dietary is desirable.  The changes which I propose to make and which should help to relieve the monotony include the substitution of flake meal for pinhead oatmeal, provision of a milk pudding or other sweet with the dinner, an increase in the tea ration and the sugar content of tea, and an additional bread and marmalade ration instead of porridge on certain mornings.</P>
    <P>The increase on subhead C is due to the necessity to replace depleted stocks of bedding and furniture.  The <Col N="1030" /> main reason for the additional sum of £13,948 in subhead H is that new turf-fired steam boilers are required in Portlaoise Prison.  The existing boilers have been in use for nearly 60 years and are nearing the end of their useful life.  In addition to that requirement, provision is made in the sub-head for the normal maintenance work in the prisons and for the completion of reconstruction and adaptation works in St. Patrick's in connection with its use for the detention of youthful offenders committed to custody on remand or for trial.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that during the debates last year on the Criminal Justice Bill I referred to the undesirability of committing to prison, on remand or for trial, youths in the 17-21 age group, particularly youths who are first offenders, and said that I would consider the question of adapting portion of St. Patrick's for use as a remand home for these offenders. This was found to be feasible and the work of adaptation which has been in hands for some time, will when completed, provide distinct and separate premises for the youths on remand.  The work should be finished shortly and, when it is, I propose to make an Order, under Section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, approving of St. Patrick's for use as a remand institution.</P>
    <P>The purchase of materials for mailbag making, mat making and weaving is principally responsible for the increase in sub-head N but the anticipated increased output from the sales of the manufactured goods is reflected in the additional receipts provided in the Appropriations-in-Aid sub-head.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the passing into law of the Criminal Justice Bill and the House no doubt will be interested to know how the various provisions of the Act are working.  An innovation in our penal procedure introduced under the Act was the power to grant temporary release to persons in custody under sentence and to criminal lunatics. To date that power has been exercised in the case of 26 persons in custody. Temporary release was granted to seven persons on account of family <Col N="1031" /> bereavements and to five because of the serious illness of immediate relatives; ten were allowed to spend Christmas with their families; two were released to help in the harvesting of their crops, one to receive Confirmation and one to enable him to sit for an examination.  In all these cases, I should say that the persons concerned honoured the conditions of their release and returned to their places of custody prior to the expiry of the periods of release.</P>
    <P>With regard to persons transferred from prison custody to district mental hospitals and to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, consent to the grant of temporary release was given in eight cases, where, in the opinion of those in charge, temporary release would be an aid to treatment and would not be attended by risk either to the persons released or to others.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Act extended the powers of the Minister for Justice in relation to the places in which criminal lunatics may be confined, and this power has been exercised on several occasions for the purpose of transferring persons to the mental hospitals considered most suitable for their treatment or to places most convenient for visits by relatives.  Prior to the passing of the Act, St. Patrick's Institution was primarily a place for the detention of youthful offenders committed for corrective training but, under the provisions of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, most of the youths under 21 years of age who were committed to prison to serve sentences of imprisonment were transferred to the Institution.  Under the Act the courts are now empowered to commit such offenders direct to St. Patrick's instead of to prison, but I find that in a large number of cases the courts are still imposing short sentences of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>However, I expect that in time those who find it necessary to convict young offenders will appreciate the advantages, to the offender and to the State, of the imposition of a detention course in St. Patrick's.  Indeed, I have no doubt that visits to the Institution <Col N="1032" /> would hasten that appreciation and I heartily invite all concerned to make those visits.  Then they can see for themselves the educational and training facilities available and the efforts which are being made to promote and develop the qualities which go to make good citizens.  Some measure of the results of the efforts by the staff, the Visiting Committee, the clergy, the associations and institutions concerned with the welfare and after-care of offenders, by firms and private individuals, is reflected in the fact that out of 1,100 boys committed or transferred from prison to St. Patrick's during the last four years, only 45 found themselves back in custody in 1960.  I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere thanks to all those for what they have done and what they are continuing to do.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the provisions of the Act with regard to the establishment of remand institutions for young persons committed in custody on remand or for trial, and my intention to approve of the use of a separate portion of St. Patrick's for this purpose for youths.  The good work of the rehabilitation of the offender is not of course confined to St. Patrick's and I have ample proof of what is being done in this regard in the three prisons by the Visiting Committees, welfare societies and others.  To them also I wish to express my thanks and appreciation.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 26 is for the Courts of Justice and relates to the expenses of the courts and to the salaries of the staffs of court offices, but not to those of the Judiciary, which are borne on the Central Fund.  As I have said already, the former three separate Estimates for the District Court, the Circuit Court and the Supreme and High Courts, have now as a matter of convenience been amalgamated into one.  Information is, however, still given separately in the Estimate for the different Courts.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the reduction in the number of the districts of the district court to which I referred last year has now been effected and is in operation since the 1st April.  The total number of districts has been reduced <Col N="1033" /> by seven with a corresponding reduction in the number of Justices. I am hopeful that under the new arrangements the district court will function efficiently and smoothly.  However, only actual experience will prove whether or not the available number of &ldquo;movable&rdquo; or substitute Justices, of whom there are four, will be adequate at all times.  The operation of the new scheme will be kept under continuous review in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>Of the two remaining Estimates, No. 27 makes provision for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, and No. 28 caters for Charitable Donations and Bequests.  There is nothing which calls for any special comment regarding any of these offices.  The volume of business being handled by them is much the same as in recent years and, generally, their work is up to date and there are no complaints regarding them.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by referring to the very valuable unpaid services rendered by the members of the voluntary boards which function within my Department.  The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, the Censorship of Films Appeal Board, the Censorship of Publications Board and Appeal Board, Comhairle na Míre Gaile and An Bord Uchtála continue to deal effectively and regularly with their respective duties, in a manner which is deserving of the very best appreciation and gratitude of all. These public-spirited citizens are making a most valuable contribution to the conduct of public affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimates be referred back for reconsideration. When I came to this House many years ago, on the occasion of Estimates and on other occasions generally, Minister made speeches and the Chair allowed only a rather limited reference to notes.  Nowadays, Ministers read briefs prepared by the Civil Service, and while undoubtedly that makes for greater coherence in the Ministerial pronouncements, I sometimes feel that the brief that is read lacks reality.  This is an outstanding example.  In the sixteen pages which the Minister has just read, <Col N="1034" /> we find on page 2 the claim made that a review of activities since the Estimates last year indicates a period of solid achievement.  I should like to know what is being done about the prevention of crime and about the reform, or the attempted reform, of those who are convicted of crime.  The Minister picked these out for solid achievement.  A good deal was said about the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act in the latter part of the statement.  I would wager a certain amount of money that if you asked any six or twelve Deputies about the Criminal Justice Act of last year, you would find it difficult to get answers of an accurate type.  Mention was made of the Intoxicating Liquor Act. I did not think I would live to hear that being boasted of as any part of an achievement.  If any piece of legislation caused confusion, disappointment and agitation of a very aggressive type it is the legislation to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>These are two pieces of legislation. The Minister later refers, amongst the solid achievements, to substantial progress in the field of law reform&mdash; I shall deal with that later&mdash;and also to the special attention given to the traffic problem in Dublin.  I am keeping these two or three together for a particular purpose.</P>
      <P>In between the Minister's boasts is the solid achievement that we have had operated over a full year the Garda Síochána Conciliation and Arbitration scheme.  That comes well from a Government who for many years resisted arbitration of any form to State servants and who rather reluctantly agreed to give effect to recommendations that came from arbitration boards at a time when the Garda Síochána and the teachers were related to the Civil Service and had their particular emoluments moved or improved as the Civil Service conditions or emoluments also improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a certain amount of timidity in boasting that we have now had operating for a full year the Garda Síochána Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  That is reflected in the Estimates.  The increases in <Col N="1035" /> various Estimates are increases in pay or in the field of pensions, all of which were granted because of the increase in the cost of living figure and which must have caused a good deal of hostility amongst the members of the Gárda Síochána and the other services of which the Minister speaks because of the inadequacy of the increases given.  However, there it is.  There is one part of the solid achievement.</P>
    <P>The Government must have been able to stand for a full year the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the police.  The organisation of the district court was a point remarked upon towards the end of the brief.  The Minister had some doubt about that.  It was too early yet to say whether or not the districts having being reduced by seven, the provision of four movable justices would meet the situation.  Of the details of solid achievements, there are the two enactments, the Criminal Justice Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, the progress made in the field of law reform and the special attention given to the traffic problem in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I should have thought, in connection with those three things, that the Minister might say a word or two in praise of the Parliamentary Secretary of his Department who was appointed last year.  When that appointment was made, there was a suspicion among the public that it was in the nature of a job.  I use the word &ldquo;job&rdquo; in its worse sense, that is, the provision of work for a particular favourite.  What has happened during the year has deepened the public suspicion into certainty that it was a job.  This is a Department which was criticised by members of the Minister's Party as being a too-expensive Department. Deputy O'Malley is variously described in some of the newspapers that befriend the present Government Party as one of the best minds amongst the back benchers in the Party.  On 14th March 1956, his remarks were reported at Column 536 of Volume 155 of the Official Report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The local authorities&mdash;the people &mdash;cannot pay any more in rates.  The <Col N="1036" /> only solution of a constructive nature, as far as I can see, is that the Government should give the example.  How could the Government do that?  In my humble opinion, the Government should give the example at the top.  Take one example&mdash;the Department of Justice. Does everybody not know that the Department of Justice, instead of costing the taxpayers some £100,000, could be equally competently carried on by the Minister for Defence? Everyone knows the Minister for Defence could be Minister for Justice as well and carry on both Departments.</P>
    <P>Later, he said, as reported in the next column, column 157:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is all right to make speeches at Chamber of Commerce dinners in Dublin or Sligo or similar functions and to use the clichés about more productivity but we are all getting fed up with that.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy O'Malley in 1956.</P>
    <P>Later in that year, in October, 1956, when the Department of the Gaeltacht was being put under a Minister and a Ministerial appointment was being made, members of the present Government and their supporters took great exception to that proposal.  In justifying the appointment, the then Taoiseach reminded the House that, at an earlier stage, the Leader of the Opposition, then Deputy Éamon de Valera, when urging economy on the then Government reproached the Government for delay in setting up this Ministry for the Gaeltacht and for the fact that at its head was a Parliamentary Secretary and not a full-time Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello said Deputy de Valera pointed out the responsibility which would be given to the Minister for Education in having to hold two posts: he felt any one of them would be sufficient to occupy the full time of an individual.  He was making the point that it was wrong to have only a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Gaeltacht.  At that point he was interrupted by the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, who asked: &ldquo;What about Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1037" /> and Justice and Social Welfare?&rdquo; Later Deputy Costello referred to that and said the only basis he could find for these remarks was that we should double up some of these Ministries.  Deputy Smith, now Minister for Agriculture, retorted &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;.  So we had clearly from the people opposite, one of whom is now a Minister, that the Department of Justice did not require a Minister at all.  We now have a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to trace growth of this Parliamentary Secretary proposal. There came to this town on a visit some weeks ago a person who has made a name by the evolution of a certain theory which he has called a law.  He is a man called Professor Northcote Parkinson and the theory he evolved is known as Parkinson's Law. It is variously described.  At one time, he said one has to recognise that work is elastic in its demands on time&mdash;there is no relationship between work to be done and the size of the staff assigned to it.  He explained in a positive way at another time that work expands so as to fill the time of the personnel available for its completion.  He added on the other matter that expenditure always rises to meet income.</P>
    <P>If Professor Northcote Parkinson had only known a little about our governmental situation, he had a terrific example of what he was writing about on a theoretical basis.  He gave one example in a book he wrote on this matter.  He talked about a civil servant of senior rank who was well up in the ranks for promotion.  A vacancy was likely to occur through the retirement on age limit of a person senior to him.  In order to succeed to the post, the civil servant began to lay his plans.  It immediately occurred to him that he must increase the importance of the particular section of the Department he stood for.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to him that he could not appoint an extra member of the staff because that member might succeed him.  He was told that he would have to divide the work and he appointed two people.  Later on, each of these persons said that he had too much work to do and each of them <Col N="1038" /> got two assistants.  The end of it was that there were seven people doing the work of one.  We started off with a suggestion made by Deputy O'Malley and some others that the Department of Justice could easily be doubled up with some other Department.  Defence was mentioned but there was actually a choice of Departments, as Social Welfare and Posts and Telegraphs were also mentioned.  We were told that a considerable economy could be achieved by putting the Department of Justice into commission with some other Department.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, there was a certain amount of public astonishment when the Taoiseach announced that he was giving the present Minister for Justice a Parliamentary Secretary.  On 10th May, 1960, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Ordinarily I would agree that the Department of Justice would not require the services of a Parliamentary Secretary, but at the present time there is a considerable congestion of work including a great deal of legislation which it is desired to have enacted.</P>
    <P>So the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed.</P>
    <P>At that time the Taoiseach said that this was a temporary arrangement to facilitate Government work.  The date is remarkable&mdash;May, 1960.  Later on in that month Deputy Ryan, on these benches, asked the Taoiseach the present duties of the Parliamentary Secretary and whether he was engaged full-time or part-time on them.  The answer given in the Dáil Reports, Volume 182, column 2 of 24th May, 1960, is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice will assist the Minister in the discharge of his parliamentary duties, that is to say, in the preparation and handling of legislation, answering questions, receiving deputations, etc.  He will, also, undertake Departmental duties with respect to supply and establishment matters in relation to the Garda Síochána, the Court Offices, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public <Col N="1039" /> Record Office and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests and discharge such other duties as may be entrusted to him <i>ad hoc</i>...</P>
    <P>One might ask, what was there left for the Minister to do if the Parliamentary Secretary was going to do all this?  The Taoiseach said that the Parliamentary Secretary would attend to such other duties as might be entrusted to him <i>ad hoc</i> and he referred to itinerants.  It is a well-known thing that if an individual is brought into a post, he will look around for something to occupy his time and the Parliamentary Secretary proceeded to inquire into the circumstances of the itinerants of our country.</P>
    <P>The next thing was that he appointed a commission to inquire into this matter.  One wonders what the Parliamentary Secretary had to do with itinerants when he had off-loaded the whole question on to a commission. On 24th May, 1960, we were told by the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>He will discharge such other duties as may be entrusted to him <i>ad hoc,</i> such as the study of some particular problem as, for example, that of itinerants on which he is already engaged.  The office is a whole-time one.</P>
    <P>One of the <i>ad hoc</i> problems entrusted to the Parliamentary Secretary was that of traffic in Dublin.  I do not know whether he is the person responsible for the expenditure by Dublin Corporation of thousands of pounds to get information which will be handed over to some German expert who will report on it in a couple of years.</P>
    <P>There is another special <i>ad hoc</i> matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary attended.  He came to attend the opening of a branch in Ballsbridge of one of the banks where there was a drive-in counter, a special side entrance where a person can come in his car, where he can get an advance from the manager or increase his overdraft without getting out of his car.  The Parliamentary Secretary attended that occasion. He may have to go to chamber of commerce meetings and other places <Col N="1040" /> such as were referred to by Deputy O'Malley when he was on these benches but he came to Ballsbridge to open this drive-in counter and he said that he was specially interested in it because the drive-in system in the bank would ease the traffic problem in Dublin. Such fatuity has not been heard for many years&mdash;that the provision of a drive-in counter at one bank in a Dublin suburb would ease traffic congestion. Do not forget Parkinson's Law, that if a man gets a job, he has to get something to fill up his time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach described the post in that way on 24th May, 1960.  A month later, Deputy Ryan put down a question asking how long the post was likely to last and on 31st May, 1960, the Taoiseach said he was not in a position to express any opinion as to the probable termination of the appointment.  The matter remained so until March, 1961, when Deputy Ryan then asked the Taoiseach when it was proposed to terminate the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice which was declared by him on 10th May, 1960, to be a temporary appointment.  The Taoiseach replied that he had nothing to add to a reply to a similar question on 31st May, 1960.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan pursued the matter and said:</P>
    <P>If it be a fact that the Minister for Justice is either unable or unwilling to execute the functions of his Department, would not the proper course be for him to resign so that the cost of £5,000 a year of the dual appointments in the Department of Justice will not continue?</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle thought that was a separate question but the Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I am now quite satisfied that there is in the Department of Justice a great deal of work which has been neglected over many years by reason of the inability of successive Ministers for Justice to overtake it and that the work of that Department will require the assistance of a Parliamentary Secretary for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>It would seem from that reply that the <Col N="1041" /> Taoiseach was consenting to the remarks about the Minister for Justice and that he considered that the Parliamentary Secretary was now taking over the whole of the work of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The position remained that way until the Parliamentary Secretary himself went to a Fianna Fáil club meeting on 14th April last and made a speech there.  The headlines given to that speech struck my attention.  The headlines said: &ldquo;Ten Year Plan for Law Reform.&rdquo;  The temporary arrangement to facilitate the Minister for Justice as an emergency in March of 1960 has, by April, 1961, not merely swollen up to a full-time job but one that is going to occupy somebody for ten years.  Parkinson never had a better example of what he said with regard to his law.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary on 14th April spoke of a ten year plan for law reform to the Comhairle Ceantair Átha Cliath of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>He said he had been assigned the task of law reform by the Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>Here is some more Parkinson.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and a separate division in the Department had been established to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>That separate division is to last for ten years.  If that is not &ldquo;a job&rdquo; could I be told what is the correct expression for it?  A temporary emergency, a clutter-up of the business in the Department, business which had to be got rid of, certain legislation it was desired to put into the Statute Book, and we find that the &ldquo;job&rdquo; is becoming more and more for permanent occupation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan asked how long it would continue and the Taoiseach said he did not know how long but he thought it would be a considerable time.  The Parliamentary Secretary said ten years.  Whether he, or someone else, will occupy it for the ten years remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>... he had been assigned the task of law reform by the Government and a separate division in the <Col N="1042" /> Department had been established to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>He enlightens the public a bit further:</P>
    <P>The immediate task they had set themselves was the preparation of a Government White Paper so that the public would be made fully aware of the problem and how it was proposed to tackle it.</P>
    <P>More Parkinson.  We have now got a post of a more or less permanent character and a new section in the Department.  The only thing left now is to tell the public what it is all about and the first job of the new Parliamentary Secretary is to prepare a Government White Paper &ldquo;so that the public would be made fully aware of the problem and how it was proposed to tackle it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An ambitious programme was then sketched:</P>
    <P>At the same time they were getting ahead with a number of legislative proposals.  There was an accumulation of&mdash;</P>
    <P>This paper says &ldquo;errors&rdquo;; I take it they meant &ldquo;arrears&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;which must be dealt with first and they would be dealt with in a settled order of priority.  In the next couple of years they must advance the programme to the stage where they would be at least abreast of the work that had been done in other common law jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>First of all, we have a Government White Paper to tell everybody about the importance of the new section of the Department and the necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary.  And, after that two years getting abreast of the work that had been done in other common law jurisdictions, we have what Deputy O'Malley derided as the high-falutin talk that occurs at chamber of commerce dinners, and functions of that type.</P>
    <P>There was no reason why they should not develop their law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a way that would serve as an <Col N="1043" /> example to others, as their Constitution served as a model for India.</P>
    <P>He had a look at the world then:</P>
    <P>Continental countries had written codes of law such as the Code Napoleon and the advantages of these were obvious.  In this country common law had developed side by side with the common law of England ... but in some instances they had been in advance of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>After referring to some old statute of the reign of William III, relating to playing football in the streets on Sunday&mdash;I am sure the reference was introduced as a light note in this heavy discussion&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>In the sphere of private law there had, unfortunately, been no real legislative activity since the end of the 19th century.  Important statutes, such as the Property Acts, the Evidence Acts and the Sale of Goods Acts were all enacted in the last century and they were in large manner no longer suitable for or even relevant to modern conditions.</P>
    <P>There we are.  A White Paper about the great work ahead of the Department, two years to catch up and get abreast, and eight years to go ahead and be a model to every other country as our Constitution was, so he says, an example to India.</P>

      <P>The last paragraph is headed &ldquo;Important Bills&rdquo;.  This is a newspaper cutting of 14th April of this year.  The Parliamentary Secretary says:</P>
      <P>Four important measures at present before the Oireachtas&mdash;the Courts Bills, the Charities Bill, the Civil Liability Bill and the Defamation Bill&mdash;contained proposals for reforms which had been widely welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got the Charities Bill three days later.  It was not before the Dáil, but, <Col N="1044" /> of course, that is quite a usual thing to say before a Fianna Fáil gathering.</P>
    <P>These proposals, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, &ldquo;have been widely welcomed.&rdquo;  That smacks to me again of the civil servant preparing something, not knowing when the matter will be debated, and really not caring a hoot whether or not the proposals have been widely acclaimed or widely welcomed.  It was a proper thing to say.  The only unfortunate thing was that the Parliamentary Secretary said it three days before the legislation got round to Deputies and three days before any notice was taken of these proposals in any newspaper.</P>
    <P>Let me look at the four Bills now. We will probably be discussing the Courts Bills next week.  One of them was described by the Leader of the Government as a mere tidying-up piece of legislation.  A mere tidying-up; it is bringing up to date the courts which were established under the Constitution in 1922 and which have functioned as courts established under that Constitution without any difficulty, without any handicap in any matter and certainly no handicap in jurisdictional matters. When asked about this piece of legislation and why these Bills were being introduced the Taoiseach answered that the legislation was of no importance; it was a mere tidying-up.  Before the particular group that the Parliamentary Secretary was addressing it was, however, one of four important measures introduced.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second of the two Courts Bills we are told in the memorandum that came with the Bill&mdash;reference has been made to this already in this House&mdash;that, while it does incorporate a great many provisions, the most important of the provisions deal with the district court.  As far as the Second Reading debate went, proposals dealing with the district court were subjected to a tremendous barrage of criticism on the ground that these proposals put the district court under greater supervision than would seem to be required and certainly under greater supervision than this court has ever had before.  Those are two of the very &ldquo;Important Bills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The Charities Bill was in the Attorney General's office by at least the early part of 1954 and I know that it was a reprint of something that had been drafted almost <i>in toto</i> a year or two before.  It was held up for three years in a search for a suitable definition of &ldquo;charity.&rdquo;  What did the phrase &ldquo;charitable donation or bequest&rdquo; cover?  When the Parliamentary Secretary introduced this important piece of legislation, this was the old legislation prepared long ago, and without any definition of charity; the only point upon which the legislation was deferred was not met in the Bill that was brought in here.</P>
    <P>The Defamation Bill came after the speech to this group.  My observation of it since has been that it incorporates most of the old law, with an odd adaptation of the old law to modern circumstances. To regard it either as an important Bill or as a Bill making any important changes is to speak the language of exaggeration.</P>
    <P>The Civil Liability Bill is one that is regarded as of importance and the proposals have been widely welcomed, according to the Parliamentary Secretary. Proposals have been awaited with some anxiety for many years.  On 21st October, 1959, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, from this side of the House, moved the Civil Liability Bill of 1959.</P>
    <P>He moved:</P>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the amendment of the law relating to the defence of contributory negligence in civil actions and to amend the Tortfeasors Act, 1951.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice at Column 73 of Volume 177 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>We are opposing the introduction of this Bill not because we do not agree with its principles but simply because we have a Bill of our own in draft form.  I intend to bring this Bill before the Government as soon as I can and I hope that it may be possible to introduce it and to circulate the text to Deputies some time in the New Year.</P>
    <P>That would be early 1960.  Deputy <Col N="1046" /> O'Higgins asked that the First Reading be given and he added:</P>
    <P>I certainly feel rather strongly about this.  I introduced this Bill seven years ago.  A Second Reading debate took place in this House and when an undertaking was given to me by the then Minister, the debate was adjourned, pending the introduction forthwith by the Government of a similar Bill.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of back and forward discussion but, at Column 74, Deputy O'Higgins said:</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the Bill was in draft form for the last seven years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reply to that was&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have given a great deal of thought to this matter and there is a Bill now in draft form.  It is not in conformity with the Bill the Deputy has in mind but it will meet the point.  I think by far the better course would be to await the presentation of the Government's Bill and if the Deputy does not like it then he can say so.</P>
    <P>The matter was taken up again on the 28th October and Deputy O'Higgins moving that leave be granted to introduce the Civil Liability Bill, 1959, said:</P>
    <P>I think I should, as I am bound to do, explain to the House what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Then for a column and a half he spoke on the main point, which is the amending of the law with regard to contributory negligence, and half-way down Column 462, he sums up by saying:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the amendment of the common law of this country in this respect</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is in regard to contributory negligence&mdash;</P>
    <P>and to introduce into our common law what already applies elsewhere, namely, that this old defence of contributory negligence be modified in such a way that the court or jury trying the case shall be entitled to reduce the damages by the amount <Col N="1047" /> by which, or to the extent to which, the injured party contributed to the occurrence.  I think it will ensure in a great number of cases that the person who is badly injured through the fault of another shall not be disentitled to any damages merely because to some degree, be it greater or be it lesser, he had contributed to the occurrence.</P>
    <P>Then he continues, still at Column 462, on the 28th October, 1959:</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of this Bill and it is a view I have long held and expressed in this House.  I introduced a similar Bill seven years ago and it is pertinent to recall that, in 1952, following a similar statement, the then Minister agreed with and subscribed to the view I expressed and assured me across the House that he proposed to do something about it.  The discussion on the Bill was postponed in the sense in which this Minister spoke and it never arose for discussion again. The Government changed and a new Government came into office, of which I was a member.  Arrangements were made to introduce a legislative proposal to this House incorporating this proposal.  Unfortunately, before that could be introduced, the Government again changed and now seven years later, I am again proposing the same type of amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the other day that the Government had a Bill. The Government had a Bill seven years ago and I do not know why it has not been introduced.  Certainly, if the Minister says to me tonight, following what I have said here now, that a Government Bill will be introduced next week or in a month's time or in two months' time, I am perfectly content to withdraw this motion for the First Reading of this Bill, provided&mdash;and I know if the Minister says it, it will be done&mdash;that on the records of this House it will appear that this important measure of law reform is being approached in a realistic manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> The present Minister replied&mdash;</P>
    <P>I can give the Deputy not the complete assurance he is looking for, that is, an assurance that this Bill will be introduced in the course of the next two months, but I can give the assurance that it will be produced in the course of the coming year&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is October, 1959, and the coming year was 1960.  He went on&mdash;</P>
    <P>and, I hope, in the early part of the year.  The reason I have to say that is that, as the Deputy must be aware, at the present time I am inundated with Bills of one kind or another that must be produced in the near future, for the simple reason that they have priority over this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and the Minister avoided that.  He continued:</P>
    <P>But I am giving this assurance to the Deputy, that the Bill is on the stocks, being examined.</P>
    <P>That is in October 1959.  He went on:</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows much better than I do the complicated type of Bill this is.  He must know that even the learned judges differ as to the manner in which it should be approached, and so on.  We must be forgiven, therefore, if our advisers and our draftsmen take plenty of time to ensure that when they do produce a Bill, it will be a Bill that will meet the requirements.  It is a very complicated question, and, because of its complications, it has taken the length of time it has taken over the years.</P>
    <P>It has taken seven years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the reasons why the Deputy did not produce a Bill during his term of office, but I am giving him the assurance now that it will be produced in the course of the coming year.</P>
    <P>At Column 465, Deputy O'Higgins pursued the matter and said:</P>
    <P>I think it will be an agreed Bill but could we aim at dealing with it <Col N="1049" /> before the financial business gets too strenuous next year?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>I do not want to overload that Department.  They have a lot of legislation but I think there is a reasonable prospect the Bill will be ready for discussion before Easter.</P>
    <P>That was Easter, 1960.</P>
    <P>It is actually in draft but requires a great deal of re-examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked:</P>
    <P>Is it not true that it was a draft many years ago?</P>
    <P>And the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>This is a new one.</P>
    <P>Whether he meant the Bill or the comment I do not know.  Now the Civil Liability Bill comes around to us in 1961.</P>
    <P>I have referred several times in this House to the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, and I want once more to refer it, because of certain things that arise in the tidying-up Bill and the Bill that accompanies it in regard to the establishment of the courts.  The second Bill deals mainly with the district courts and gives the district justices much more supervision than before. We are told that it is only a question of getting the Bill through the House and that then it will be replaced by another piece of legislation which will incorporate very much the same matters.  We have not yet got an explanation why it is necessary to introduce two Bills in double harness, one of which is a tidying-up Bill and the other dealing with district courts, but which will be repealed by a different Bill altogether.  However, we have them.</P>
    <P>We are establishing supervision over the district courts.  There is to be a new President of the District Court, and he is to have certain functions with regard to the district justices.  In addition, the President of the High Court is getting further powers, additional to those which he already had, with regard to supervision of the district courts.  I wonder what is the good of giving duties to the members of the judiciary in face of what has been exposed here <Col N="1050" /> over a number of years when I asked questions about this particular matter?</P>
    <P>In the 1936 Courts of Justice Act there were laid down a very good procedure and a very good machinery for working out that procedure.  In Section 67 there was established a Superior Courts Rules Committee with a very distinguished personnel, The <i>ex-officio</i> members consisted of the Chief Justice, as chairman, the President of the High Court, as vice-chairman, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the Master of the High Court.  Then there were two nominated members, two ordinary judges of the Supreme Court, two ordinary members of the High Court, and, in addition, two practising barristers nominated by the Council of the Bar, one a member of the Senior Bar and the other a member of the Junior Bar.  That was the Superior Courts Rules Committee. There were also the Circuit Courts Rules Committee, a District Court Rules Committee and a Rules Committee for the Local Registration of Title, all with very distinguished personnel.</P>
    <P>In Section 75 it was imposed, and it was a statutory duty, that the secretary of each of the several committees was to summon a meeting of the committee at least once every year for the purpose of the general consideration by such committee of the practice, procedure and administration of the court in relation to which such committee is constituted and the law affecting or administered by such court.  As soon as conveniently might be after every meeting, the committee was to report to the Minister whether any and if so what amendments or alterations should, in their opinion, be made in the practice, procedure or administration of the court or in the law affecting or administered by such court.  As I say, that was a good procedure.  We are getting away from Civil Service drafting of Court rules or of law.  I am not complaining of what civil servants do in that matter, but I think for them to be attached to the practising members of the profession would be a good thing.  This is a good procedure.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Justice, in <Col N="1051" /> speaking on the debate on the Estimate three years ago, again two years ago and again last year, how many reports had he received from any of these distinguished committees and for the first two years the answer was that they never had reported since established; the last time I got a statement that the Local Registration of Title Committee had reported once or twice.  What is the good of putting new duties on people like this who will not attend to the statutory duties already imposed on them?</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the House on Thursday last, I had been developing a point in regard to the question of social benefits. I referred to the disparity between the 11/- granted to contributory pensioners and the 1/6d. granted to non-contributory pensioners.  In view of the fact that both classes of pensioners have the same expenses to meet, the 1/6d. in the case of non-contributory old age pensioners is a miserable pittance and does not cover one-half of the increases that have arisen during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now indicate some of those increases.  The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1052" /> to the Minister for Justice allowed all private landlords to increase rents by 12½ per cent.  In the case of a man living in one room, that would cost him an extra 1/- a week.  In the case of local authority tenants, the last increase of 11/- was taken into consideration and the tenants were charged one-sixth of that amount. While the local authority may not take into account the small pittance now being granted, nevertheless all private landlords have the legal right to do so and are doing it and at the very least it will increase the outlay of old age pensioners by 1/- a week.</P>
    <P>During the past year there were increases in the price of milk and butter and there was a shilling increase in meter fee.  This shilling is an important matter to an old age pensioner. I had a request last week from a woman in the Hardwicke Street flats to have the meter taken out because, although she was using a candle, she was being charged for the meter which she had not in use.  There was also an increase in bus fares.  It may be suggested that pensioners do not travel a great deal in buses.  They have to travel sometimes to visit their children or to attend a doctor.  An old age pensioner will travel by bus a few times in the week and each journey will cost him or her a penny more.</P>
    <P>During the past few months the price of newspapers went up by a penny.  One newspaper a day is a necessity for unemployed persons and old age pensioners.  If a person had not one paper per day, how would he know what was going on in the world or about the Budget, the census or anything else?  If one paper per day is regarded as a necessity, the cost of that necessity has increased by seven pence a week.  I am not talking about luxuries; I am talking about bare necessaries.</P>
    <P>The price of cigarettes has increased by a penny on the packet of 20.  Old age pensioners may not be able to afford to drink or to go to the pictures or to back horses but they do smoke, perhaps more than other people who have other ways of filling their time.  An old age pensioner will <Col N="1053" /> spend at least an extra twopence per week because of the increase in the price of cigarettes.  The price of a tin of boot polish was sixpence.  It is now sevenpence.</P>
    <P>I have worked it out that it costs an old age pensioner at least 3/6d. a week to meet the increases in the prices of these bare necessaries.  To meet these extra costs he is given 1/6d.  At the present time most employees have made demands for increased wages or reduced hours, Inevitably, there will be further increases.  The increase of 1/6d. in old age pensions does not cover the increase in bare necessaries, much less has regard to the increases which are to come.  I am not talking in terms of millions.  I am talking about the little things because I know the people concerned and their needs.</P>
    <P>Another important matter to which I referred on Thursday last is the practice of relieving officers taking into account any additional money that a person on assistance may receive. There are 1,500 persons in Dublin who are drawing assistance.  There are two classes of persons on assistance.  In one class is the person who resides with a member of his or her family, who is not obliged to pay rent but who probably gives a round sum to that member of the family to cover everything. In the second class is the person who has a room for which he must pay rent.  Such a person gets assistance from the relieving officer to help to pay the rent.  It is anything between 2/6d. and 12/6d.  On each occasion in the past when increases were granted to those people the relieving officer in numerous cases took into account the small increases they got in social benefits and deducted it from the assistance, which meant that very often those people who are supposed to have got an increase got nothing at all.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of the unemployed man with a wife and five children who was supposed to get an extra 9/6d.  He should get 1/6d. for himself, 1/6d. for his wife, an extra shilling each for the first two children and an extra 1/6d. each for the rest, making a total of 9/6d.  That is the type of man who is getting 10/- or <Col N="1054" /> 12/6d. from the relieving officer.  When he receives this 9/6d. all the evidence shows that whatever increase he gets from the Minister for Finance will be deducted from that 12/6d.  He will be told: &ldquo;Now that you have that you do not need this.&rdquo;  That has always been the practice and I want to know will the Minister give an assurance or get an assurance from the responsible Minister that these little increases which they are supposed to get will in fact be got?</P>
    <P>A woman who came to see me the other day about housing complained to me: &ldquo;I have 30/- national health and I was getting 5/- towards my rent but because I got 2/6d. extra, the assistance officer deducted the 2/6d.&rdquo; In other words her position is the same as it was.  It is to people who are in the very worst circumstances that this has happened, people who are not being supported by sons or daughters. On two previous occasions when these deductions were made I was told by the Board of Assistance that they intended to deduct the increases given. They did not in many cases because I got the Minister to make a public statement and I would ask him to do that again.</P>
    <P>On the question of emigration, I am prepared to concede that there has always been emigration.  I have been examining for the past two weeks the report of the Commission on Emigration set up by the last Government. According to this report, emigration was at the rate of about 22,000 a year between the years 1825 and 1830, and that was 25 years before the Famine. Therefore we can accept that there was always emigration.  The evidence shows that there has been emigration over the past 200 years because a large part of Washington's army was composed of Irishmen and they must have been emigrants.  We know most of them were Presbyterians but many of them were Catholics.</P>
    <P>From the data in this report it appears there are about 1,250,000 people of Irish birth in Britain and 1,300,000 in Northern Ireland.  From a comparison of the population of the Republic with the number of people <Col N="1055" /> of Irish birth in Northern Ireland and in Britain it would appear that in about 10 or 15 years time the majority of Irishmen will be subjects of her Majesty the Queen.  In those extraordinary circumstances, what history will have to say about the makers of independence I do not know.  I read quite a lot and I find it amusing to go back on the debates on the Treaty and consider them in the light of that prospect, that at the rate emigration is taking place the vast majority of Irish people will, of their own volition, be subjects of her Majesty the Queen. I say &ldquo;of their own volition&rdquo; because even the Nationalists of the North could not be said to be there against their will because they seem to be fairly satisfied, and I am not so certain that they would want to leave her Majesty and abandon the great benefits they receive.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Government for that situation.  However, this Government went before the people at the last election and they did not say whether the 100,000 jobs they promised would be provided in 50 years or in three years.  They should have said so because in spite of the evidence that so many thousands of jobs have been created, there is a corresponding amount of redundancy, so the position is no better.  It is an extraordinary fact that the population of Ireland today is the same as it was in 1803 although 20 million people were born here since then; therefore 20 million people born in this country since 1803 emigrated.  The population is the same as it was in 1921 except for the difference that we have 100,000 fewer and Northern Ireland has 130,000 more, so we have nothing to be proud of.</P>
    <P>What should be done?  That is a fair question.  The Taoiseach challenged the Opposition to say what they would do.  It is not easy in a democracy to be frank and say what you will do. I found that out.  Let us suppose that Fianna Fáil before the last election were challenged, say, by the Coalition as to what they would do and supposing they said: &ldquo;We will put <Col N="1056" /> 100,000 to work&rdquo;.  That is all right but they would not have said: &ldquo;We will save £8 million on food subsidies and use that for some other purpose.&rdquo; If they said that, they would never have got in.  It is not fair to challenge those not in power to say what they would do because if you tell people you are going to affect their interests they will gang up against you and you will never get into office.</P>
    <P>On the question of jobs, I believe that 10,000 more people would be working if some people had not two jobs.  There are married women employed and their husbands are also employed.  I can understand a married woman being employed where there is no one to substitute but where there is that should be discouraged.  I do not think that overtime should be encouraged either.  There is too much selfishness amongst many people.  If we adopted the principle of &ldquo;one man one job&rdquo; there would be another 10,000 people getting full-time, or at least part-time, work.  I am not an economist but it occurs to me that if all factories worked two shifts a day, unemployment would decline noticeably. I talked this over with a man recently and he agreed with me that if all factories worked 36 hours a week &mdash;after all, workers are looking for a 40-hour week&mdash;and did a shift up to 1 o'clock and another shift after that hour there would be more employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the attitude of the Minister for Finance some time before the Budget and from the speeches of the Deputies supporting the Government, the country was undoubtedly led to believe that we were facing a period of reduced cost of living and a considerable relief of taxation. In the other House of the Oireachtas, the Minister prophesied a very good Budget.  This chorus was taken up throughout the country in very loud tones and the newspapers favourable to the Government gave heavy black type to the prophecy that the taxpayers would get considerable relief in the forthcoming Budget.  All and sundry were under the impression that the Government would present a <Col N="1057" /> Budget which would give considerable benefits to every section of the community and provide a general lowering in the level of taxation.</P>
      <P>What happened?  The position is that keen disappointment with the Budget is felt in every quarter.  Not alone is disappointment felt by the taxpaying community but by every other section of the people as well, whether retired on pension, whether in work or unemployed. This Budget carries no reliefs whatsoever for the sections of our people already overburdened by taxation. It holds out no hope for those who had been led to expect great things in the form of concrete proposals for the stemming of the tide of emigration or providing work for the thousands who are unemployed.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that what the Government had in mind was Budget on the pattern of the previous four but that this year they thought they would produce a Budget with a little general election sauce in it as well by giving less than threepence per day to the old age pensioners.  If the Government thought that threepence a day for the old age pensioners was sauce enough to gull the electorate, they are making a very big mistake.  The Minister pointed out that this would be his last Budget before the election.  We are delighted to agree with the Minister in this and the people of the country are expressing grateful thanks to the Almighty that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have now reached the stage in the lifetime of this Dáil when they must give an account of their actions since they were put back into office.  This Budget is no better than the last, except that it contains this little election flavour of threepence a day for the old age pensioners. Otherwise, it is a complete admission of failure on the part of the Government and shows complete disregard for the pledges and the promises Fianna Fáil gave to the people just before the last general election.  Reading the speeches of the members of the Government, one is inclined to ask whether the Government are living in space or whether they are in even remote contact with the general public, because from all their speeches it would seem <Col N="1058" /> we are now at a stage of great and growing prosperity and that there is no evidence of anything but greater and greater prosperity, that there is no such thing as poverty, that the wheels of industry are humming, that the farming community are living in luxury, that no one has any difficulty in paying taxation.</P>
    <P>Recently a member of the Irish Hierarchy in the course of a sermon pointed out that the present position of our balance of payments and the increase in our exports have not in any way contributed to a relief of the serious plight of many small farmers and unemployed persons in rural Ireland.  While we hear speeches from Fianna Fáil Deputies about prosperity and the Government congratulating themselves on the increased exports and the better position of the balance of payments, we see at the same time in the west of Ireland many houses closed up and entire families leaving.  I sympathise greatly with the small farmers because they have experienced perhaps the greatest period of depression in the past few years since the Economic War.  Those speeches are designed to lead the country into believing that we are living in the lap of luxury.  Any Deputy who has close contact with rural Ireland knows that the speeches made by Government Ministers are far from reality and far from the facts.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to boast about increased exports, we may ask what great part did they play in bringing about that increase?  It cannot be denied that our exports have increased, due in part to the output of the St. Patrick's copper mines in Avoca which were established and developed by the inter-Party Government. Assisting in that increase also we have the oil refinery at Whitegate, negotiated and established by the inter-Party Government and, in addition, in my own constituency, the inter-Party Government were responsible for providing the money and completing the negotiations for the erection of two briquette factories which, I am glad to say, are providing a certain amount of employment in <Col N="1059" /> my constituency.  In addition to the market for briquettes available at home, a considerable amount of briquettes has been exported recently. Therefore, the briquette factories, the oil refinery and the copper mines at Avoca have contributed to a considerable extent to the improvements about which the Government seem to boast today.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance are very loud in their praise of the period of industrial expansion through which we are told this country is passing.  The facts are that the foundations for that expansion were laid by the Finance Act of 1956 during the period when the former Deputy Morrissey was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At that time, the Industrial Development Authority was set up, and from that Authority sprang many of the new industries about which the Government are loud in their boasts today.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority was designed to promote industrial expansion and to advise interested parties and promoters on the establishment and development of new industries.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;at that time Deputy Morrissey&mdash;was steering that Bill through the House, it met with the most fierce opposition possible from everyone connected with the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Taoiseach down.  They could see no use in the Industrial Development Authority. They said it would have authority in name only and that, in regard to benefits to the community, they could hold out no hope for its success.  The people who criticised the Industrial Development Authority and who were inclined to seek its execution before its birth are now loud in their praises of the benefits it has brought to the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the type of hypocrisy which says that the Industrial Development Authority was all wrong when the inter-Party Government were in office and all right when Fianna Fáil are in office.  Whether <Col N="1060" /> Fianna Fáil like it or not, the Authority was set up by the inter-Party Government and it has been responsible for any industrial achievements this country has attained in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is typical of Fianna Fáil to introduce a Budget on a particular day which they describe as Budget Day. The facts are that every day is Budget day, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned. Down through the years, they have been responsible for bringing in many supplementary Budgets.  If the taxpayer were satisfied that he knew the limit had been reached so far as his assesment for tax for a year was concerned, it would not be so bad, but a situation has presented itself in which every other month and every other week the Fianna Fáil Party are imposing, directly or indirectly, increased burdens and increased charges on an already overtaxed people.  Supplementary Budgets are bad and I feel that the advent of so many supplementary Budgets has not only aroused the anger of the taxpayer, but has reflected, certainly in no creditable way, on the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>If we look back over this great period of glowing prosperity which Fianna Fáil describe, we find that it has been a most expensive period for Irish taxpayers; we see that recently £2,000,000 per year extra was extracted from the pockets of the insured workers; and we see the huge additional contributions the workers and employers are asked to make to the State which has extracted millions from the pockets of the workers and the employers.</P>
    <P>Again we must consider the tragedy of the disastrous Budget which was responsible for the removal of the food subsidies.  Fianna Fáil may think it is a long time since the food subsidies were removed, but I venture to prophesy that, in the general election which will certainly take place before the end of this year, at every church gate throughout the length and breadth of the country they will have to answer for the removal of the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>The prices of bread, flour and butter have been substantially increased.  Let us take, for example, the price of flour.  Since the Government took office, the price of flour has been increased by 89 per cent.  Flour must be purchased in every home.  There is no small farmer's house, no house in rural Ireland, in which flour is not purchased.  The Government abolished the food subsidies and, without any cause whatever, and having pledged themselves not to do so, deliberately embarked upon a policy of increasing the price of flour by 89 per cent.  The price of biscuits and all flour products was increased in consequence.</P>
      <P>Bread is a very important part of the diet of the poor about whom Fianna Fáil spoke loudly at the last general election.  Having pledged themselves not to increase the price of bread, having stood before the electorate and said they would not stand for, subscribe or contribute in any way to an increase in the price of bread, they deliberately, without cause and with full knowledge of the serious hardships which would be inflicted upon the poor, increased the price of bread by 69 per cent.</P>
      <P>Let us take the price of butter.  Again, without any cause whatever, without any justification, without any reason and with a full knowledge of the serious consequences to the fathers of large families they increased the price of butter by 22 per cent.  I shall be interested to hear at the various church gates what excuses the Government will give to the working class people, to the small farmers and to the audience in general, for the increased prices of flour, bread and butter.  The increase in the prices of flour, bread and butter alone will be sufficient to put the Government out of office at the next general election.  They gave their word of honour at the last general election not to do these things if elected, but immediately they were elected, they set about extracting £9,000,000 out of the pockets of the taxpayers, and the greater part came from the poor who had to pay more for bread, butter and flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the increases on bread, butter and flour, we were faced with <Col N="1062" /> a substantial increase on tobacco.  In this Budget, there is a further extraction of a very great sum from the pockets of the smokers.  This increase on tobacco and cigarettes is unnecessary and unjust.  We have also had an increase in charges by the E.S.B., for which the Government are responsible. Consumers were asked to avail of the facilities offered by the E.S.B., and I repeat that guarantees were given that overhead charges would not be increased. But no sooner were the people gulled into connecting with the E.S.B. than the undertaking not to increase overhead charges was forgotten, just like the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>In Ireland to-day you have the dearest motoring in the world.  This has been caused by the Government increasing petrol charges.  In the past two months, we also had the insurance companies getting away with substantially increased motor insurance premiums. It was the duty of the Government to protect motorists from being fleeced by bringing in legislation to prevent another raid on the pockets of the people by the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Transport charges have been increased all round.  It is all very fine for C.I.E. to boast they are paying their way.  A man is always in funds the day he sells his own house, but the roof is gone from over his head.  Why would C.I.E. not be in funds when they are closing down branch lines and canals, selling railway stations and stretches of canal, depriving people of services and dispensing with the services of their workers?  I want to warn the Minister to convey to his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, the indignation of the general public if any attempt is made to bring about wholesale redundancy at Kingsbridge, as planned by C.I.E., where there is to be a big pay-off shortly as a result of economy measures.  We have also had increased postal charges and a further raid on the taxpayers' pockets.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputies what benefits this Budget has brought to the small farmer.  None whatever.  It is common knowledge, and it must be admitted here, that it is Fianna Fáil <Col N="1063" /> policy to get rid of the small farmer and drive him out of existence.  Nowhere in Ireland is that policy more in evidence to-day than in the West.  The small farmer is the enemy of Fianna Fáil, and Fianna Fáil is the enemy of the small farmer.  There is now a battle between Fianna Fáil and the small farmer. It is common knowledge that the Fianna Fáil aim is to rid Ireland of the small farmer and crush him completely out of existence.</P>
    <P>What ray of hope has this Budget for the small farmer?  To-day he is faced with ever-increasing rates.  Any Minister for Finance should give serious consideration to measures to curb this trend.  National taxation has reached its peak, and now we find local taxation is equally crushing.  Farmers, particularly small farmers, are unable to meet their liabilities to local authorities. This year every local authority was faced with the position of having estimates presented to them by county managers which called for the imposition of outrageous rates on the people.</P>
    <P>The increased rates were brought about as a result of Government policy.  We have a Health Act extracting millions from the taxpayers, directly and indirectly.  While local authorities were obliged to increase rates for this Act, fewer people are availing of the health services than ever before.  The Health Act is unworkable. Fine Gael maintained all along that it would be unworkable. The Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Health, prophesied here&mdash;as he prophesied about the Budget a few weeks ago&mdash;that the Health Act might impose a rate of 1/10d. or 2/- in the £.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>But he did not tell us about the additional 2/- or 4/-it would cost.  Everybody knows there is no county in Ireland in which the Health Act costs less than 2/-, while in some it costs 3/-, 4/-, 5/- or even 6/-.  Though fewer people are availing of the services, the poorer sections of <Col N="1064" /> the community are faced with greater difficulty and hardship.  The Government have made so many blunders that it would be difficult to say which will bring about their downfall at the next general election, but I believe the Health Act will play a major part in bringing about a speedy end to the Fianna Fáil Government.  That Act has proved too costly to the taxpayer. On the one hand, there is the cost to the taxpayer; and, on the other, the fact that the poor are getting no service.</P>
      <P>That is why I feel that the Health Act is unworkable and is a failure.  It even went beyond all expectations of the Government that brought it in so far as cost is concerned, but even though it has reached an outrageous cost to the local authorities not all the services are in operation under the Health Act.  If they were, what would it cost?  I feel that the time has come for a general overhaul and review of the rating system, because local authorities are now faced with the position that they are at the peak of their demands, and the ratepayers are finding it impossible to pay the rates for the maintenance and upkeep of local authorities.  Rates demands, health demands, water works schemes, sewerage schemes, housing, home assistance and the various other demands, are all reflecting back on the farmer and the small business man.  I venture to say that the time has now arrived at which the ratepayers cannot bear any further burdens.</P>
      <P>It is not the duty of the Opposition to tell the Government how it should or could be done, but it is the duty of the Government to devise ways and means to bring about the relief of local taxation which is urgently required and essential if the people are to remain on the land and to remain in the country at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the farmer, and particularly the small farmer, while we have increases in rates and in general taxation, it has been generally said in strong terms by the farmers' organisations that the farmers' income has decreased considerably.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in regard to the small farmers or the farmers of the midlands, because <Col N="1065" /> they are asking them in this Budget to pay more for everything, to pay more in rates and local taxation, and at the same time they are asking them to take less for what they produce from the land.  Fianna Fáil at the last general election solemnly promised that they would give the farmers 82/6d. a barrel for wheat&mdash;about which we will deal mainly on the Estimate for Agriculture&mdash;but the facts are revealed now that this year, in the case of wheat bushelling 54 lbs. or less, there is a reduction of 11/6d. per barrel.</P>
    <P>This has been the cause of an angry protest published on the 8th February, 1961 by the N.F.A. Grain Committee, who said that the members saw an unwarranted reduction in the price paid to Irish farmers for wheat when they were already faced with a decreasing income on all sides.  Where is the prosperity for the farming community there?  Does anyone say that the farmer gets better off when he is faced with a reduction, for example, in the price of wheat despite the fact that he was solemnly promised, for the purpose of getting his vote, 82/6d. per barrel, in the same way as he was promised 45/- per barrel for barley which he never got?</P>
    <P>The farmers' income has dropped considerably and has been decreasing month after month while this Government were in office, whether it was derived from the price of milk, the price of barley or the price of wheat. We find that the facts are there, and we have responsible people such as the N.F.A., the representatives of the farmers, making public statements registering their strongest possible protest and admitting that the farmers have faced a decrease in their income all around.</P>
    <P>How are the Government going to explain that at the church gates?  How do the present Government explain the position here and now?  I venture to say, without the slightest fear of contradiction, that the farmers are worse off to-day than they ever were before.  I cannot see how the farmer can be better off facing a reduction next harvest of 11/6d. a barrel in his wheat, and I cannot see how that <Col N="1066" /> should be the cause of laughter from Fianna Fáil or the cause of applause for a Government who are responsible for reducing the price of wheat by 11/6d. a barrel, having promised 82/6d. to the farmers, having failed to keep the promise, and having knowingly and deliberately dishonoured it and deceived the farmers.  While they took steps to reduce wheat by 11/6d. a barrel, at the same time the produce of wheat, namely flour, has been increased by 89 per cent. and bread by 69 per cent.  Here we say again, and it cannot be denied, that these steps have been taken to make substantial gifts to the millers at the expense of the consumer of bread and the grower of wheat.  Of course to Fianna Fáil the miller is more important, because they will probably be able to extract more in the form of a cheque from the millers than they ever can from the small grower's organisations or himself.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that the present Government have a knowledge of a considerable all round reduction in the farmers' income and yet, in the full knowledge of that, they will stand up and say that the farmers were never better off, never had more money to spend, although we see that the facts reveal the very opposite.  So much for the farmer.</P>
    <P>The last speaker admits that emigration always and will exist, but I have to subscribe to a different viewpoint on that.  I remember many of the Fianna Fáil speeches and even the posters and handbills that they invariably displayed at general elections which were never without a little flavour of a mild reference after an election and a very serious reference before the election to emigration. The only time we hear of emigration from Fianna Fáil is for a month or two before an election.  It is the duty of every Deputy on this side of the House, as it is the duty of every member of the general public, to query the Taoiseach and the Government on the promise that the Taoiseach made of the 100,000 new jobs.  No Fianna Fáil Deputy can dissociate himself from that promise.  We now find ourselves in the midst of the last Fianna Fáil <Col N="1067" /> Budget and we have to declare that there is no evidence of 100,000 new jobs, but there is clear evidence that there are 51,000 fewer persons in insurable employment to-day than there were when the inter-Party Government were in office.  There is the strength of that promise, and of the Fianna Fáil policy of providing work.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of a Minister for Finance and of a Government to give first thought to providing the citizens of their country with a way of living.  This Government have failed miserably to provide work, and tens of thousands have emigrated, particularly during the last four years.  Everybody knows that never before in the history of the country has there been such a flight from the land and such a continuous flow of people out of the country as during the past twelve months.  If emigration from the country generally has gone on to the same extent as it has from the small town from which I come, the position is not alone very serious but drastically critical.</P>
    <P>The older type of emigration was that the head of a family would go, but now the position is that the father of a family goes first, settles into his job, pays a deposit on a house, and afterwards brings over the remainder of the family.  There are tens of thousands of families in England to-day who could and should be here if the Government were doing their duty of providing work for the people.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act gave employment, but that Act was abolished by Fianna Fáil, not because they found any fault with the Act or because its phraseology was wrong but because of sheer spite, because it was a good Act, brought in by the inter-Party Government to provide work under the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It gave local authorities substantial funds to carry out important drainage schemes.  It enabled many fathers to keep the home fires burning because of continuous and guaranteed employment under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Because of sheer spite, because of envy of success, the Fianna Fáil Party took steps to <Col N="1068" /> abolish the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  With that went a substantial contribution to local authorities and, with that, went an order to councils to employ fewer men.  Fewer drainage schemes were to be carried out and fewer schemes of great importance to land-owners were to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The dismantling of the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been a great tragedy.  It was designed to give employment.  It was designed for the execution of proper and essential works.  We now find ourselves faced with that Act no longer in existence. Ratepayers have to meet additional costs to substitute for funds that were contributed by the State under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  As a result, fewer are employed in rural Ireland and it has added considerably to the many thousands who have had to emigrate.</P>
    <P>The same remarks refer to Section B of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme. That section was responsible for providing employment.  It was responsible for speeding-up land reclamation. It was responsible for adding to the national wealth by providing speedily additional arable land.  As a result of the Land Reclamation Scheme, over one million acres of land are producing food for man and beast that would not otherwise be arable.  Those of us associated with the inter-Party Government feel proud of all our achievements in this regard.  Our only regret is that the Fianna Fáil Party saw fit to dismantle the satisfactory working of that Act by abolishing Section B.  At the next general election we shall tell the people, as we have done and as we are doing, that the moment Fine Gael assume office as Government we shall restore Section B of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme and reinstitute the Local Authorities (Works) Act which will be of considerable benefit to local authorities and provide employment for those unemployed in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I made no reference whatever to the increase in the cost of living beyond referring to the food subsidies.  It must be borne in mind that the cost of living has increased 12 points since <Col N="1069" /> Fianna Fáil took office.  Yet we shall be told that Fianna Fáil have not increased the cost of living.  The statistics they published, and for which they are responsible, show that there is an ever-growing increase all round since they took office.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy may say that whilst I was speaking of the farmers and the advantages and disadvantages of this Budget, I made no reference to the fact that farmers are being helped in this Budget by the grant for lime. There is no help in this Budget in that regard.  The Government deserve no congratulations for assistance to farmers in regard to lime because they are only restoring what they took from them three years ago.</P>
    <P>Why should there be any appreciaton, on the eve of an election, of a pretence of helping farmers to lime their lands when the Government are only giving them what they took from them three years ago, what they should have had for the past three years and what they should have had this year. In recent years, farmers are keeping their eyes open.  They listen more attentively.  Farmers cannot now be gulled when they hear the Minister for Finance say he is providing money to help them to lime their land.  They know he is now giving them what he took from them three years ago.  That cock will now crow again.</P>
    <P>The farmers have already seen that. The farmers know that.  The farmers know that this is only restoring what was taken from them.  They were warned at the time by Fine Gael not to interfere with the lime subsidy.  We were told three years ago that the subsidy was not necessary, that it was of no benefit to the farmers, that the farmers did not require it.  Here they come, on the eve of an election, to restore what they took from them because they now realise that they took something from them that they had no right to take, an action that was resented by the farmer.  They are now giving back something for which our farmers do not thank Fianna Fáil. They are only giving back farmers what was unjustly and wrongly taken from them three years ago.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the facilities in this Budget to assist farmers in regard to cow byres and to help them in the drive to speed up the complete eradication of bovine tuberculosis. I do not see what is in this Budget to assist them in that regard. The memory of Fianna Fáil must be very short.  Fianna Fáil now ask farmers to speed up by every possible method the measures required to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>In the clearance areas and in the areas which have not as yet been declared clearance areas, Fianna Fáil now realise the damage they did three years ago by abolishing the double byre grants.  Was that a way to assist farmers to get rid of infected live stock? Was it a way to encourage farmers to give their full co-operation to the Government in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis?  It is common knowledge that the double byre grant was specifically designed to assist farmers in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall accept your ruling but other Deputies have dealt with it.  I just want to point out that the facilities in this Budget do not require an expression of thanks from the farmers to the Government.  Everybody knows quite well that one of the most difficult tasks facing the Irish farmer is the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  That scheme was commenced in 1950 by the inter-Party Government.  We went out of office in 1951 and Fianna Fáil took over.  Nothing was done from 1951 to 1954.  In 1954 the double byre grant was provided. Fianna Fáil took steps to deprive the farmer of that benefit.  It was wrong to do so.  The action of the Government in so doing has added to <Col N="1071" /> the difficulties of speeding up the successful eradication of bovine tuberculosis from this country.</P>
      <P>I want to make special reference to income tax reliefs.  My constituency is one in which quite a considerable amount of employment is given by Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and by mining interests in South Laois.  We have now reached the stage in which even ordinary road workers are obliged to pay a considerable amount of income tax.  I want to make a protest against that and to say that income tax is being extracted from people at the present time who cannot pay it. There are many road workers and others who find that they cannot fully meet their commitments and they are obliged to work, in some cases to work against their will, because of this imposition of income tax.</P>
      <P>So far as children's allowances are concerned, this Budget is very disappointing. Some provision should have been made to have children's allowances increased particularly where there are large families.  I had expected that some provision would have been made for additional benefits to be paid in the form of children's allowances to families where there are five or more children.  I think the Government would have been wise to give some additional benefits to the fathers of large families because with the cost of schooling and education, the increased cost of foodstuffs and clothing, such people are in a bad way and some provisions for additional benefits should have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House beyond saying that this Budget does not contain any provision whereby additional taxation will be paid by foreigners purchasing land in this country.  We know quite well that a good deal of land in this country is being bought up by Germans at the present time.  I feel that Government action in this regard is called for.  I was expecting that there would be some provision in the Budget which would have made it more difficult for those people to buy up land.  I do not propose to deal in detail with the land policy of the Government but I do <Col N="1072" /> say that it is no great credit to the Government.</P>
    <P>The lands being bought up by foreigners today should be leased or rented to the sons of hardworking farmers who have completed an apprenticeship course in agriculture. They are better entitled to the land of this country than any alien coming over here.  I believe that the Government are failing in their duty by not taking the necessary steps to stop the very serious invasion of this country by foreigners.  On the one hand, we have tens of thousands of our people going away and, on the other hand, we have foreigners coming in here to buy up the best land in the country.  Steps should have been taken to curtail such activities.</P>
    <P>The land policy of this Government is wrong and when a change of Government takes place our land policy will be changed to meet the changed conditions.  Those big tracts of land will be purchased by the Land Commission or some such body and made available on a lease or rent basis to young farmers to give them an opportunity of existing and making a proper livelihood in their own country.  That is something which calls for urgent action.  It is a problem that will be tackled most effectively after the next general election. I say with full knowledge that there is keen disgust amongst hardworking young farmers who have spent considerable time in agricultural colleges, who have a thorough knowledge of farming and who would be prepared to marry and settle down on a holding of 50 acres of land.  I say that they are better entitled to it than the foreigners who are coming here from many parts of the world and I trust that after the next general election the question will be tackled very effectively.</P>
    <P>The present Government have failed.  They are still hanging on to office merely as hangers-on, not because they are interested in the country or in the people of the country; they are interested only in themselves.  The quicker the general election comes the better.  We are ready for it and we are facing it with <Col N="1073" /> the full knowledge that, when it is over, there will be a Fine Gael Government. I want to say without the slightest fear of contradiction that only a Fine Gael Government can restore the confidence of the people in our industry and in our agriculture. When the election is declared, that declaration will meet with the entire approval of the vast majority of our people who have been disillusioned and deceived by the Government. After it we can settle down to hard work, to do our best for our people at home and to see that agriculture will be the backbone of this country.</P>

      <P>The significant thing about this debate has been how little has been said by the Opposition about the Budget itself.  The Opposition have been at pains to talk on every conceivable subject except the Budget. Of course that is only natural.  It is generally admitted that it is a good Budget and so the best thing the Opposition can do is to talk as little <Col N="1074" /> as possible about it.  In the fifth Budget which he has presented to this House, the Minister has given us his best yet.  Admittedly, all his Budgets were good but, as the years passed, they got better, and in this fifth Budget we have the crowning achievement of his period as Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Budget is an indication of the generally satisfactory state of our economy.  The Minister has been able to paint a picture of a progressive economy.  He has been able to point to a satisfactory balance of payments position, paralleled by an equally satisfactory internal financial situation.  He has been able to point to rising employment and increasing national production. This Budget gives concrete expression to that satisfactory position.</P>
      <P>The Opposition were caught on the wrong foot.  They hoped they might be able to attack this Budget because of the circumstances in which it is introduced, as a vote-catching or election Budget.  The Minister has disappointed them in that regard because of his good financial management. Because the sound economic policies of the Government are coming especially to fruition in this year, the Minister has been in a genuine position to give something away and to make concessions. That is a satisfactory position for a Minister for Finance to find himself in, but it is also a position which places heavy responsibilities on him.  Aware of the fact that he has a surplus to dispose of, he has to be equally aware of the responsibility he has to dispose of that surplus in a way that is both just and economically beneficial.  He has to balance carefully the needs of social justice against the requirements of economic stimulus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all agree that the Minister has done his task excellently.  He has in this Budget followed the pattern he set himself in his previous Budgets. He has taken care that the poorer sections will benefit in fair measure from the satisfactory state of the Exchequer and the economy.  With careful attention to their needs, he has given what assistance he can, while at the same time using the remainder of the resources at his disposal to procure the <Col N="1075" /> greatest economic advantage possible from the point of view of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The most significant thing in the Budget is the reduction of 8d. in the standard rate of income tax.  Listening to the Opposition, one would think that this kind of reduction is something that happens every day in the week.  This reduction is a very significant one and one of the utmost importance to our economy.  But Deputy Sweetman completely ignored it.  Since I have interested myself in economic matters, I have always been aware of the fact that the greatest single stimulus one can give to an economy is to reduce direct taxation. That is the ideal aimed at by all economists and all Ministers for finance.</P>
    <P>In this Budget, we have a concrete example of that principle being put into practice.  Remember that the reduction of 8d. in the rate of income tax this year has to be added to a reduction of 6d. given the year before last. From the point of view of national development and economic progress, the achievement of the Minister in effecting this reduction this year cannot be ignored as the Opposition have chosen to ignore it but must rather be regarded by all rational people as an important and entirely beneficial achievement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has continued his policy this year of helping economic expansion by means of fiscal reliefs. Since he took office, he has introduced a variety of measures to that end.  He has extended and improved tax reliefs on exports.  A number of concessions have been made to industry, not the least being the 25 per cent. increase in wear and tear allowances in last year's Budget.  Deputy Sweetman chose to ignore all that.  He said nothing was done to encourage the expansion of industry. The Minister has given the best possible incentives that can be given to industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about unemployment and emigration.  Again, any sensible person looking at our situation from the point of view of these twin problems will admit readily that the only effective solution to them <Col N="1076" /> is an increase in national production. In so far as this Budget is an incentive Budget, it contributed to that end.  We can achieve an increase in production only if we give incentives to get that increase.  This Budget gives the utmost concrete possible incentive it can, that is, the reduction in direct taxation. In that regard, it is making a very definite, very clear-cut and very real contribution to the solution of these problems about which everybody talks so much.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, one would think the Opposition would give due credit in that regard.  If they were as concerned as we all are about these two matters, they would welcome this Budget because by the incentives it gives, it contributes to an increase in national production and ultimately to the long term solution of these prob lems.  The position with regard to the Capital Budget cannot be regarded as anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>If you look at Table VI of the financial tables published with the Financial Statement, you will see that the capital expenditure proposed in the coming year is £55.3 millions.  That amount represents a significant increase on last year.  It represents an increase of 10 per cent., from £50.5 millions in 1960-61 to £55 millions in the coming year.  The 1960-61 figure represented an increase of £7 millions over 1959-60 and the 1959-60 figure represented an increase of £6 millions over 1958-59, so that in every year the amount of capital being invested in the development of the economy in one form or another has been steadily increasing.</P>
    <P>That increase has been achieved without any strain whatever on our balance of payments situation.  Our balance of payments situation is satisfactory at the moment and gives no cause for concern.  It is a very significant and real triumph to have been able to increase, year after year, in this fashion, the total national capital investment, without in any way upsetting the structure of our external asset position or of the balance of payment position.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if we look at Table VI we notice that not alone is the overall amount of capital investment increased, <Col N="1077" /> but, what is probably equally important, there is a directing of that capital investment into productive sources.  We can see that ports, harbours, airports, tourism, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, all productive sources, are sharing in the increased capital resources being made available.</P>
    <P>At the same time, social capital investment is not being neglected because it stands now at £4,000,000 higher than it did in 1958-59.  Generally speaking, the picture on the capital side of the Budget is as satisfactory as it is on the revenue side and available capital resources are being directed in an increased measure into productive national development.  Another satisfactory feature of the capital side of the Budget is the buoyancy of small savings.  You could not have a better indication of the basic soundness of the economy underlying the financial structure than the fact that these small savings are becoming increasingly available for national development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, outlined that the objective on the current side was to increase the momentum of economic progress while at the same time avoiding inflation.  If we look across the water, we see that that is a task very much in their minds and it is a task which in any community must call for financial skill and judgment of a very high order.  We can rest assured, from the various statistics and figures which have been supplied to us in connection with the Budget, that we are succeeding in achieving economic progress and at the same time avoiding any risk of inflation.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has achieved these two objectives side by side.  He was able to point out in his statement that of 20 countries reviewed recently in an article in an economic magazine of the highest standing, only five were lower than we are in the proportion of total national income that is taken in the form of taxation.  That is probably as sound a criterion as you could apply and it reinforces the general picture given by <Col N="1078" /> these figures of a current budgetary position that is quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan during his term in office as Minister has, apart from achieving very considerable fiscal success, done very good work in another way.  He has carried out very important and very useful reforms in the structure of our financial administration.  The most important and the most valuable was the introduction of P.A.Y.E.  That operation was carried through successfully and, I think, has given satisfaction all round.  He has given another indication in this Budget of his intention to keep up that good work.  He has merged a number of the surtax rates, with a view, as he said, to the eventual elimination of surtax by its combination with income tax.</P>
    <P>From time to time, we have heard the argument put forward that we should do away with death duties because we would thereby encourage wealthy people to come and live here and thus benefit the economy.  That has been talked about for a long time, but for the first time the Minister has decided to do something concrete about it.  In this Budget, he has said, in effect: &ldquo;Very well; I will put this matter to the test and I will introduce provisions in an experimental way which will enable us to decide whether the abolition of death duties would be as successful as people have been saying down through the years.&rdquo; That is not a very important fiscal provision in itself but it is evidence of the Minister's approach to this whole problem, a refreshing approach, a desire to introduce reforms in the structure in any way that seems beneficial. He has carried out a number of important reforms already and this clearly indicates that he proposes to continue the process.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have made reference to alleged burdens that the Government have put upon the people. They have referred to blisters and generally endeavoured to convey the impression that this Government have increased the burden of taxation unnecessarily to an unbearable point during their term of office.  Let me <Col N="1079" /> deal with that.  If we take the five financial years 1957-58 to 1961-62, the position is that Dr. Ryan as Minister for Finance has given a net relief in taxation of £4.2 million.  The Opposition outline the increases in taxation and ignore the reliefs given but the overall position in these five financial years is that net reliefs in direct taxation amounted to £5 million whereas net increases in indirect taxation amounted to only £8 million. So that, far from any excessive or unbearable burden of taxation being heaped upon the backs of the people, in fact, the Minister has been able in that period to give net relief to the extent of £4.2 million.</P>
    <P>That is a magnificent and significant achievement.  Do not forget that that has been achieved while at the same time the Minister has forgone completely a large amount of revenue that he would have got from industrial profits from exports over the last few years because of the export relief provisions. The figures, documents and publications which have been circulated to us at this Budget time represent, to me, a saga of success.  In every page there is evidence of some progress, some increase in national development.  The national income itself is probably the greatest single indicator we could get of that.</P>
    <P>At page 24 of the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> there is set out in Table 10 the national income for the years 1956 to 1960&mdash;an unbroken record of increases: 1956, £454,000,000; 1957, £467,000,000; 1958, £479,000,000; 1959, £502,000,000 and 1960, £528,000,000. It represents a story of successful achievement that none of us would have believed possible when this Government took over in 1957.  The same sort of picture is seen in the figures of industrial production and the employment statistics.</P>
    <P>The progress made over the last four years is reflected in a clear concise and concrete way in the figures in the Minister's Financial Statement.  To my mind, his Budget contributes to economic progress and national development in two entirely different ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> In the first case, there are the actual fiscal incentives to development and the fact that good financial management and sound economic planning are reflected in the ever-increasing volume of industrial and agricultural production.</P>
    <P>It is a very significant thing that, for the first time since 1954, the decline in agricultural employment last year was offset entirely by a corresponding increase in industrial employment.  That has been the ideal set by economists in this country for a long time.  It has been realised that with modern developments it is almost inevitable that employment in agriculture will tend to decrease and that the only way to offset that decline in agricultural employment was by a corresponding increase in industrial employment thereby enabling the population as a whole to rise and to bring us all the benefits that that would bring in its train.</P>
    <P>For many years it seemed to be a hopeless task to try to achieve that objective and the picture was one of increasing industrial employment but that increase not being able to make up for the decrease in agricultural employment.  In 1960&mdash; and this is probably the most hopeful thing that the statistics in connection with this Budget have shown&mdash;that position has been achieved.</P>
    <P>As I said, the actual fiscal provisions of the Budget will have a very beneficial expansionist effect on the economy but possibly even more important than that is the fact that the provisions of the Budget show more clearly than anything else that the programme of economic expansion is succeeding and that the country is in good hands and in good shape. This evidence will have a beneficial effect on the morale of our people and on their will and determination to achieve their economic salvation.  For that reason, I have no hesitation in saying that this Budget is the best I have seen introduced into this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the 21st year of Government of the Fianna Fáil Party and I suppose, like many ordinary people of 21 years of age, they are inclined to settle down and to forget <Col N="1081" /> the jousting and the give and take days of their teens or even of their early childhood.  From the speech the Taoiseach made here last Thursday, it seems that he wants us now to forget the rompings of his teens or the misdemeanours of his early childhood in politics.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach reprimands the Opposition about the type of speeches they have made on this Budget.  He seems to feel very sorry for himself and to resent any sort of criticism.  I do not take any exception to the type of speech made by Deputy Haughey, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.  He presented one side of the picture as it appeared to him.  It has often been said of politicians that they want to have things two ways.  The Taoiseach seems to want them only the one way.  He wants us as the Opposition to support what he believes are the good things done by the Government.  I do not think that is the role of an Opposition. I do not think it is the definition of &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo; that the Taoiseach gave himself when he was the Deputy Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party on this side of the House.  I remember that on one occasion&mdash;I mentioned this before&mdash;he said it was not the duty of the Opposition to provide solutions for the Government.  It was not the duty of an Opposition to tell the Government what policy they, if in Government, would implement.  It was the duty of the Opposition to be watch dogs and to criticise where they thought criticism was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also said he was surprised there was so little reference to the Budget itself.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Haughey was here last Thursday but I am sure he read the Taoiseach's speech.  Can Deputy Haughey tell me there was any substantial part of that speech devoted to the Budget proposals?  In one short column the Taoiseach talked about the main provisions of the Budget and then he went on to talk about things he said we should not talk about, the cost of living, advances in social welfare, emigration, employment and unemployment. Therefore, whilst also talking about the main provisions of <Col N="1082" /> the Budget, we are entitled to talk about these things which the Taoiseach said we should not mention. Of course, he describes it as misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asked for suggestions from the Opposition.  He deplored the fact that he as Leader of the Government, is not getting any assistance from the various Opposition Parties. We are not so childish as not to realise that, invariably, if any solution is suggested from this side of the House, we hear the cry from the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;Why did you not do it?&rdquo; However, that sort of interjection by backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party does not deter me and has not deterred me from saying what I believe should be done in certain branches of Government and in respect of some of the policies the Government are implementing.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are entitled to take the Taoiseach to task and remind him how he behaved in Opposition.  I remember occasions when, if not he, the members of his Party could be described as saboteurs when they cried very loudly that because foreign capital was being invited in here the then inter-Party Government were selling out the country.  That sort of propaganda, which I will not say was designed to, but which might have undermined the efforts of the Government at that time, was freely spread throughout the country and freely given in this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said when he was in Opposition&mdash;he subsequently denied it&mdash;that he had a plan to create 100,000 jobs, over what period I do not know; he was not very specific.  He talked about 100,000 jobs but he did not give us any details as to how he intended to implement that plan, behaving according to his own description of a good Opposition man, merely talking about and suggesting things but giving no details of policy in respect of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, the Parliamentary Secretary, spoke about the favourable position in regard to the balance of payments, the tremendous increase in national income, the increase in industrial <Col N="1083" /> output, the small but welcome improvement in agriculture in 1960 compared with 1959.  He became very enthusiastic about all these improvements and described them as the greatest improvements that have ever taken place in any single year under any Government.  It would be fair comment therefore to say, as I said last Thursday, that the Budget which was introduced does not reflect the enthusiasm of Deputy Haughey when he talks about the improvement in the balance of payments, national income, industrial earnings, industrial output and agricultural output.  The Budget is not that good.</P>
    <P>If all these things were as good as Deputy Haughey seems to believe they are, surely the Budget would have been more attractive to many more people than it has been?  It has not been a spectacular Budget.  There is nobody who does not welcome the increase, small though it was, that was given in social welfare.  Everybody welcomes the remissions that were made in income tax.  Apart from these items, however, what imagination was shown in the Budget?  Does it demonstrate that the five-year plan has been eminently successful?  I do not say it has been unsuccessful but has it been eminently successful?  This is the fifth Budget that has been introduced by this Government and apart from a few things here which are of no great consequence it is much the same Budget as has been introduced in this House for many years back.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that it is unfair for us to talk about emigration, as he suggests we have done, as if it only began in 1957 since the advent of the present Fianna Fáil Government.  We are all conscious of the emigration figures&mdash;at least I am and so is my Party&mdash;in the 'fifties and the big emigration figures after 1945 when the war ceased.  If they happened to be bigger in 1955, 1951 or 1946, surely that should not prevent the Opposition Parties here talking about the recent emigration figures, the figures for 1960, and comparing them with 1959 and even with 1957?</P>
    <P>It will be fair then for us when we <Col N="1084" /> go before the people to examine the record of the Fianna Fáil Government just as they were entitled to go before the people in February, and March, 1957, and tell them about our three years of office and about the two Budgets we introduced.  Surely the Taoiseach and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party have not become so thin-skinned that they cannot take criticism?  I know, especially on the hustings, they were well able to give back criticism and refute criticism. The Taoiseach adopts the role of a purist in politics.  He wants everybody to pull together, to stand solidly behind the Fianna Fáil Party and sympathise with them in any difficulties they have.  According to them, the Dáil was responsible for anything that was unsuccessful&mdash;not Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I remember in particular how the present Minister for External Affairs had so much to say from 1954 to 1957 about emigration.  I read Deputy Davern's speech on this year's Budget about the decline in emigration.  There is no decline unfortunately and surely this is the time to point these things out.  The 1959 figure, the most reliable we have, puts the rate of emigration in that year at 38,400.  In 1960 that had increased by something in the region of 2,000.  Surely, therefore, we cannot say that the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil in those two years has succeeded in diminishing emigration from this country?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not have to tell us that there are many nuns and missionaries who emigrate every year and who contribute to the figures available. These people have been emigraing every year so we can have a good comparison in one year with the other, disregarding the Taoiseach's suggestion about the nuns and missionaries.  This year we shall have the true emigration figures when the result of the census of population is made known.  We shall then not have to depend on figures for people leaving by boat and by air and coming in by the same means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey talked about the improvement in the balance of payments, <Col N="1085" /> national income, industrial output, but the funny thing about this country is that the smaller the population, the more prosperous we seem to get.  I do not know how the economists reconcile that sort of thing.  Deputy Haughey is, I suppose, an economist. At least he is an accountant and he seems to be fairly well satisfied that as far as the economists and all the fiscal measures are concerned, this country is on the right road.  How many of us in this House, particularly we in the Labour Party who do not pretend to be economists, can judge the country in any other way than by the outward signs?</P>
    <P>The outward signs to us are the numbers in employment, the numbers who leave the country, the amount of income that goes into the household each week, the number of people working on the land or in industry.  We can judge the economy only on figures like that and it is on figures like that that the Government will be judged.  I do not think the Government's record in respect of employment is good.  We heard the Minister for Transport and Power talking about the wind of change blowing through the country through the establishment of so many new industries but we must not lose sight of the fact that the Government's record in respect of employment in the last four years is not a good one.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that the Government's record for the three years before that was not a good one or that it was not good in the three years before that again or in 1935 or in 1932.  In the next election the Government will be judged on the figures for unemployment in the past few years.  As far as the people of the country are concerned, the figures for employment have declined by 20,000 since 1957 and that decline was particularly noticeable in rural areas. We get no comment from the Taoiseach when we suggest certain measures to try to ensure that more people would at least stay on the land. I know that the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been trotted out in this House time after time.  I agree it was valuable in that it kept Irishmen at home in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> The Local Authorities (Works) Act is not a fair comparison in this respect but it is no harm to mention it in this context.  This year we are to spend £5,000,000 for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Last year we spent another £5,000,000 to try to ensure that the cattle of this country would be rid of tuberculosis and thus qualify for the British market.  It is a pretty big figure for a worthwhile project, but surely if the Government and the economists think it desirable we should spend £5,000,000 to eradicate T.B. in our cattle they should consider that it would be worth while to spend a similar sum, if not double the amount, to keep Irishmen at home?</P>
    <P>We try to preserve our cattle trade with Britain but neglect to take the steps necessary to keep Irish flesh and blood at home and, no matter what has been said about the causes of emigration, the one big reason Irishmen emigrate is that they have not got employment.  Many of them do it because they have not got security or continuity of employment or decent wages.  Somebody has suggested in the past few days reasons Irishmen emigrate.  They gave examples of people who had up to £8 a week wages but who had the itch in their feet and went off anyway.  I can say that for every one of that type there are thousands who want to stay.</P>
    <P>Surely there is work to be done in rural Ireland&mdash;in drainage, in forestry, in fishery development?  Surely there is productive work of that kind that could be given in order to keep people at home?  When one talks as I am talking now, people are wont to say it is so much preaching, so much moralising.  Surely they must realise it is important to keep Irishmen at home in their own country, if not from the point of view that they are Irishmen, at least from the economic point of view?</P>
    <P>The Government say they are confident that there will be established in this country many more new industries. On the other hand they have said our unemployment figures are down to the lowest in many years.  We all know that in this figure of unemployed <Col N="1087" /> as registered there are many who are unemployable.  I could not put a figure on them.  They believe themselves able to work but, for various reasons, employers will not take them.  Therefore, we are left with a relatively small number of people available in this country to be put into the industries the Government say will be established in the next four years.  What happens then?  Will we have factories with no men, industries with no Irishmen to man them?  The flight from the land must come to an end.  If our dependence is to be on agriculture we must have a minimum army of men to produce the goods, the crops and the stock with which this country is so vitally concerned for home consumption and for export.</P>
    <P>When I suggested some time ago&mdash; or if I suggest now&mdash;that even £5 million or £10 million per year should be spent to keep men at home, it was said that I was advocating relief schemes.  As I said before, there is much work to be done in forestry, drainage and fisheries, and even if that £5 million or £10 million were spent on those schemes, or even on relief schemes, it would be worthwhile in order to conserve workmen for the boom in industry which Fianna Fáil say is coming.  No one will be more pleased than I and the members of the Labour Party, if that boom does come. As I say, we will find ourselves in a queer position if we are geared to and ready to deal with an increase in our industrial output, and have not enough men in the towns or the rural areas to man the factories.</P>
    <P>I saw an item in one of last Sunday's newspapers&mdash;whether or not any credence can be given to it I do not know, but it was not denied &mdash; stating that some employing agent from Britain attended at, I think, Castlebar and recruited 117 men to go to work in England. Perhaps 50 of them were family men who had to leave their wives and children at home in order to go to some place in Britain to work on an airport runway or on road construction.  Is there anything we can do to keep those 117 men at home?  Surely it would be <Col N="1088" /> worthwhile to engage in the type of work which I described a few moments ago, to keep those 117 men from Castlebar in that part of the country? I cannot check on whether it was a fact that they were recruited and did, in fact, go but if it is true, it is a deplorable state of affairs that we should allow such an important commodity&mdash; one should not describe them as a commodity&mdash;such an important source of our economic development to be taken out of the country and no return given.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said there were three main purposes in the Budget.  That was his only reference to the Budget.  He said there were three important features in the Budget and at column 833, volume 188 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>Against the four per cent. increase in national income which was achieved last year we are now providing an increase of over five per cent. in the old age pensions and the other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>They provided 1/6d. per week.  I remember that in previous Budgets presented by the Minister, when they had not the same boast to make about our economy, bigger increases than 1/6d. were given.  When there was not such a spectacular increase in the national income, as it has been described by the Parliamentary Secretary, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance gave more than 1/6d. per week.  That is why we are forced to say, from this side of the House, that the 1/6d. was meagre.</P>
    <P>Surely the Fianna Fáil spokesmen have their tongues in their cheeks when they talk about a spectacular increase in the national income, a favourable balance of payments, increased industrial output and increased agricultural output, when all that means for the old age pensioner is 1/6d. per week.  It has been so spectacular, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, that that sort of increase may not be achieved again.  If Fianna Fáil behave as they did this year, the increase next year will be only the same or even less and the old age pensioner will get only 1/6d. or even less.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not fair to take him to <Col N="1089" /> task here now, but the Minister for Health speaking on the radio in connection with the Budget on Saturday night had occasion to say&mdash;why, I do not know&mdash;that during the regime of the previous Government, even though the price of cigarettes was increased, no increases were given in social welfare benefits.  I think it was the Taoiseach who said across the House to Deputy Dillon last Thursday that they were the only Government who had done something for social welfare recipients in every Budget they introduced.</P>
    <P>The Government from 1954 to 1957 introduced two Budgets, but in those two Budgets, they included provisions for increases in social welfare benefits. I do not want to go back but, very briefly, an increase of 2/6d. per week was given to the old age pensioners, which amounted to £900,000 for a particular year, an increase of 25 per cent. was given to recipients of social insurance benefits, and there was a vast improvement in workmen's compensation. I mention those figures merely to refute the allegation made by the Minister for Health in his Budget broadcast last Saturday night.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that social welfare recipients would share in the increase in the national income.  I do not think that is good enough for the old age pensioners.  We should be prepared to do a little more for them.  The Taoiseach said that the national income in 1960 had increased by four per cent. and that he was giving the old age pensioners a five per cent. increase. As I say, I do not think that is good enough for the old age pensioners. At times when the increase in the national income was very much smaller, the Fianna Fáil Government and the last inter-Party Government gave increases that had no real relation to the increase in the national income.  We believe&mdash;and I am sure Fianna Fáil must at some time believe&mdash;that there is a lot due to the old age pensioners. There is a big backlog to be made up so far as they are concerned.  It is not good enough to have them trotting along with the increase in the national income.  We should get them up to some sort of a decent standard and then link them up either to the cost of living <Col N="1090" /> or a general increase in wages or, if you like, the increase in the national income.</P>
    <P>In 1954-55, the national income increased by £18 million and the Government at that time, because they believed it was his due, gave an increase of 2/6d. per week to the old age pensioner which more than compensated him for the increase in the cost of living and certainly was much more as a percentage increase than the percentage increase in the national income.  Even though in 1960, according to Government statistics, the national income increased by £26 million, the best the Government could do in the face of such an increase was to give the old age pensioner an increase of 1/6d. per week.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also talked about the numbers employed in manufacturing industry and said that, in 1960, the highest number ever had been attained. There is no point in having a row about this across the House or discussing it, but these statistics, prepared by the Taoiseach's Department, indicate that 1955 was the year in which the greatest number were employed in manufacturing industry.  I shall not read out the figures.  They are there for the Taoiseach or for any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to see for themselves.  On the one hand, we have the Taoiseach accusing us of misrepresenting the facts, and then he comes into the House and glibly describes 1960 as the best year for employment in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomes the concessions in regard to income tax, but they do not mean a lot for the working man. I reckon that of the amount given by the Minister for the relief of income tax more than 50 per cent. will go to companies.  There are many who will not benefit at all.  A married man with £11 a week, not a fantastic figure, will save 4½d. a week; but under the concessions in regard to sur-tax, a married man with £3,000 a year will save something like £120 a year, which is not too far off £2 10s. a week. Whether or not the Minister and the Government think it desirable that the concessions should be made in that direction, I do not know.  As far as I <Col N="1091" /> and the Labour Party are concerned, we would have much preferred to see the Minister give concessions in respect of the allowances&mdash;the earned income allowance, the personal allowance and the allowances in respect of wife and children.  That would have been much better for the ordinary family man.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister, in making these concessions, had regard to the British Budget in reverse.  They have taken the extraordinary step of imposing a tax on employment.  This is designed to correct an employment situation the British Government do not like, that of full employment.  A proposal was introduced in their Budget to try to ensure the most economical use of labour by industry.  I wonder did the Minister for Finance, in framing his proposals, consider giving concessions to employers here in respect of the number of people they employed?  The accent now seems to be on the establishment of industry and giving assistance for the building of factories and the provision of machinery.  There is no reference at all to the employment content.  The Minister should consider giving a tax concession to employers who take on as many men as they can, having regard, of course, to the economic working of their industry.</P>
    <P>There has not been any comment from the Government on a suggestion I put forward here previously.  As far as I know, if a foreigner decides to establish a factory here in the under-developed areas, he gets certain concessions, including the full cost of the factory and one-third the cost of machinery.  He may also get an allowance for training employees and concessions in respect of electricity and rates.  In many cases, the Government give what may be regarded as substantial amounts of money.  Having given this money, what control have the Government over these industries? If a Belgian, a German, a Britisher or an American decides to establish a factory west of the Shannon and builds that factory with the financial assistance of the Government, we do not know how permanent that industry will be.  We hope it will be permanent, <Col N="1092" /> but have we any assurance it will last any length of time?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the trading difficulties in Europe at present and discuss &ldquo;The Six&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Seven&rdquo;. We know, however, that the United States are prevailing on the British Government to join &ldquo;The Six&rdquo; and there is the possibility that they may do so in the near future.  The trading situation in Europe may change to such an extent that it might be more advantageous for someone establishing a factory here to go elsewhere. While we welcome the idea of these people coming here, many of us have wondered why they want to establish factories on our western seaboard.  Undoubtedly, the financial inducement is very good; but they must have some other reason, apart from the money.  I do not believe that it is solely the money they are after.  It was a factor in attracting them to Ireland, but we have no guarantee they will stay here.</P>
    <P>I cannot offer a perfect solution now.  However, in order to ensure that these industries will be firmly established, not alone should the Government give them financial assistance but there should be a Government representative in these factories to exercise some partial&mdash;not overall&mdash;control over them.  Let him be appointed as a director.  Let the Government themselves invest money in the industry so they will have some sort of administrative and financial control. Would it not be a tragic situation if in five or ten years' time, these industrialists should decide to pack their bags and establish themselves elsewhere? God forbid that day should ever come, but if it did happen, we would find ourselves with tens of thousands of Irish workers on the unemployment list again.  The Government have asked for comments and suggestions.  I do not want to be critical of their industrial encouragement policy.  However, I should like to hear a statement from them that, as far as they can guarantee it, these industries will be firmly established.  I know they cannot give an absolute guarantee, but some firm statement should be made on the points raised.</P>
    <P>It seems to be useless to try to induce <Col N="1093" /> the Government to engage in the establishment of industries themselves. We seem to have come to a sudden stop in the matter of State-sponsored companies.  We can quote the success of the Irish Sugar Company, the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, the Whitegate refinery and a few others.  These were directly sponsored by the various Governments. They have been eminently sucessful and have given a considerable amount of employment.  They have been responsible to a large extent for what is regarded as the favourable balance of payments position.  If these industries have been successful, surely the Government should investigate what further can be done in the matter of establishing State industries to afford further employment?</P>
    <P>Speaking about emigration I referred to agricultural workers and their wages.  It seems to me that the wages of agricultural workers have lagged very much behind in the last eight to ten years.  I have before me the book of <i>Economic Statistics</i> compiled by the Central Statistics Office and, on page 27 in Table 15, we are given index numbers of the weekly earnings of industrial workers in transportable goods industries and of minimum agricultural wage rates.  The table shows that while industrial workers' earnings stood at 100 in October, 1953, and agricultural wages stood at 100 in July, 1953, by October, 1955, industrial earnings had leaped to 108.4 but agricultural wages had only risen to 104.9 and in December, 1960, industrial earnings were 142.4 while agricultural wages were then only 134.7.  It thus appears to me that, as far as the agricultural worker is concerned, so long as he has to live with a situation like that where his income is not in line with other workers he will turn his eyes towards the towns or, if he cannot get employment there, he will turn them towards Britain.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the Minister in his speech spoke about the development of horticulture.  I think this was the first major pronouncement or reference by the Minister for Finance or any Minister of his Government to <Col N="1094" /> the possibility of this development.  I do not know whether the time is opportune for a further statement to be made about it, but we can recollect the complaint by the General Manager of the Irish Sugar Company to the effect that he was being restricted in his efforts to develop this industry. The small farmers would certainly welcome development in that respect, because there would be crops that they could manage easily from which there would be a very good return if the canning industry which has been mentioned is to be developed on any sort of scale at all.</P>
    <P>Whilst not posing as an agricultural expert I had occasion to say on some Vote on Account a few years ago that I believed the policy in respect of the small farmers should be reviewed. The Taoiseach complained that he does not get many suggestions from this side of the House.  I complained on that occasion that the bigger type of farmer could more readily avail of the generous assistance given by various Governments than could the smaller farmer who has not the capital or the initial moneys to put down to build his haybarn or his byres, or to engage in drainage in order to get the Government grant.</P>
    <P>The man with capital, with financial resources behind him, can get everything. He can avail of every single thing from a grant for an incubator up to a grant of maybe a few thousand pounds for land drainage.  The small farmer who needs it cannot get it.  I shall not attempt to define what a small farmer is, because the small farmer in County Wexford might not be the same as the small farmer in Tipperary or Mayo or any other county, but every Deputy has his own idea of the small farmer and the Government could certainly average what he is.  There should be much more assistance given to the smaller type of farmer than there is to the man with a large holding.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes means tests, but it has often occurred to me that it is the poorer sections of the community to whom the means tests are applied.  It is the widow with no means whose <Col N="1095" /> husband had no insurance stamps who is subjected to means tests.  The man who applies for the dole is subject to a means test.  The non-contributory old age pension is subject to it.  In all these cases the applicants have to prove that they have got nothing before they can be assisted by the State, but in respect of industry or agriculture we do not find any means tests at all.  In respect of children's allowances there are no means tests. The richest man in the country who has children qualifies for children's allowances.  The wealthiest group who decide to build a hotel are entitled to a grant within the rules of the administration of the law.  The farmer who has 2,000 acres or 1,000 acres can qualify to obtain a grant for an incubator or to build a cow house or a pigsty, but he does not really need it.  All he has to do is to apply for it and he gets it.</P>
    <P>I shall not say that that sort of money represents a substantial amount of the agricultural grant, but it should be devoted to the person who really needs it.  I know farmers in Wexford struggling with 30 acres who cannot get all the grants they need to do the drainage necessary on their land and who cannot build the various sheds and outhouses and pigsties that they need because they have not the initial moneys to engage in that work, or at least they have not the full amount. Therefore I believe that as far as the agricultural industry is concerned we should do much more to help the small and middle-sized farmer who provides the goods for us.  We say we depend on him and that he is the most important man, and if so we should help him more.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned as if it were a new thing that the Government were considering doing something to change and improve the educational system in this country.  I understand that he cannot be here for every debate, and I believe that his time is much more precious than the time of all of us here, he being the Taoiseach, but surely that sort of reform in our educational facilities has been advocated for the last four years, for ten <Col N="1096" /> years before that and for ten years before that again?  I have always felt, and have protested in this House, that not enough scholarships were being provided to allow children who would be regarded as very intelligent and clever to carry on their secondary education and if necessary to go into the university.  We are very mean and niggardly about the amount we provide for education.</P>

      <P>The question would be more relevant on the Estimate than in the general debate on the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making only a general remark on this question and will wind up with two or three sentences on it.  There are very few people in County Wexford who can afford to go to the university and, therefore, the county council in their generosity, whether they get any assistance from the Government or not I do not know, have provided scholarships for people of modest means. They provide three scholarships and there is another which is an agricultural scholarship.  This means that altogether four people in the county whose parents cannot afford to send them to the university are assisted, not very generously at that, to go to the university.</P>
      <P>It means, therefore, whether we like it or not, that the majority of those in the university are there merely because their parents can afford it.  Good luck to them.  Nobody begrudges them, but when we talk in the Constitution and in the Declaration of 1916 about equal opportunities for all in respect of education it is a joke when we remember the number of scholarships given in the entire country.  It was very welcome when the Minister for Education announced some time ago that he was contemplating providing many more scholarships.  I hope that he does.  He certainly will have the support of the Labour Party in that.  The only thing we would urge is that it be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach says he does not get <Col N="1097" /> many suggestions.  Sometimes it is risky in this House to make suggestions. The Irish language has been the subject of debate for a long time.</P>

      <P>I shall reserve my remarks.  I only wanted to say that I am, and always have been, in favour of the revival of the Irish language.  I did not and do not agree with the methods applied to revive it.  If I suggest as I have suggested, that we should remove the compulsion, I shall be told immediately by certain elements in Fianna Fáil that I am unpatriotic.

      <P>It is as much as I wanted to say.  I do not want to wind up this speech with a flourish and forecast of the election.  The Budget was a disappointment to the people.  Maybe Fianna Fáil themselves were responsible for that.  If so, they must face the public and take the consequences which I know they are prepared to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced some time ago in the Seanad that the Budget would be a good one.  He gave the people much more hope than the Budget justifies.  I do not know whether or not his remarks could be regarded as a breach of confidence.  I do not allege it is, but in my experience in this House and in my short memory of politics, I do not remember a Minister for Finance telling the public that the Budget would be a good, bad or indifferent one.  As a citizen, his remarks would have had no effect on me but I wonder what <Col N="1098" /> effect they had on what is called the financial world.  It was an intimation that there would be some concessions &mdash;I suppose the best bet would be income tax.  Whether or not that had any repercussion or effect on the financial world, I cannot say.  Nobody has said so far that the Minister was indiscreet or unwise to make that remark but it is the first time I have heard the Minister announce what sort of Budget he would introduce.  However, he disappointed the people.  It would be better if he had said nothing. Then maybe the people might have regarded this as a better Budget than it really is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMJohnston" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard from the public outside this House and read in the newspapers, some of which are not favourable to the Government, the Budget has been well received.  One of the best tributes came from an Opposition Deputy who said it was not by any means an election Budget, as it is not. It proves the honesty and integrity with which the Minister drew up his Budget.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Opposition reminds me of the statesman who remarked that when a country is doing badly, people blame the Government and when it is doing well, they thank God.  The Budget is an indication of the progress that has been made.  The Minister has been able to give some reliefs.  They are not spectacular and they were not meant to be so.  However, they were spread over the people as a whole.  Everybody has benefited to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear to everybody where the road to prosperity lies&mdash; increased production from our farms and from our factories and increased exports.  In that way we shall raise our standard of living.  That has been the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I was surprised to hear my colleague, Deputy Giles, say that in his twenty-five years of public life, he has not seen any progress.  In County Meath, there has been very considerable progress in housing, hospitalisation, land division, water supplies, and so on. That is real progress and it can be <Col N="1099" /> continued, provided we have the right driving force behind us.  Deputy Giles suggested we should send 40 or 50 members of the Fianna Fáil Party down to Guinness's to learn salesmanship. If the Taoiseach thinks well of the suggestion, he will not be short of volunteers but I do not think it will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Much mention has been made of the plight of the small farmer.  They are not doing well and they have not done well, as far as I can remember. This will give some indication of the value of land.  In my county, 11 statute acres were recently sold at a public auction for £1,700.  It was bought, not by a foreigner but by a local farmer who has a good deal of land.  He was buying something solid on which he was prepared to work.</P>
    <P>If our people are given the proper leadership, then, as will be seen from the Budget, they will go forward with the task in hand.  They have that leadership.  I do not think they will let it slip.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan said that after the next election, Fine Gael will be in office.  I think he is a bit over-optimistic, as we shall see from the result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take up on Deputy Corish's concluding remark, I would urge on the Minister that there is no more productive form of expenditure by the State than expenditure on education.  After introducing the Budget last week, the Minister circulated a White Paper <i>Direct Taxation</i> which I have studied very carefully over the weekend.  I suggest the Minister should immediately abolish the Income Tax Commission.  It is perfectly obvious that the Commission are getting nowhere.  The Government accepted their first report which recommended the introduction of P.A.Y.E. There have been three other reports. With the exception of one or two small points in the second report, the rest have been totally rejected by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a most hardworking Commission. Their reports are very thorough surveys of their subject.  The members <Col N="1100" /> of the Commission are all eminent and indeed distinguished persons.  It seems to me that they are wasting their time for what they have said on many important aspects of our tax system has been completely ignored.  Indeed, one of their reports has been treated almost with contempt by the Government, being dismissed in two or three paragraphs in this small White Paper.</P>
    <P>In particular, I want to refer to the second report, the main recommendation of which was that Schedule A. taxation on owner-occupied dwellings under £30 valuation should be abolished.</P>
    <P>The White Paper claims that that is an illogical recommendation.  That is a rather strong criticism, a most undeserved criticism.  The recommendation is not at all illogical; it is quite realistic.  Presumably, it is suggested that it is illogical because, if Schedule A is wrong in principle, one could argue that it should be abolished altogether. The Commission was enjoined to make practical recommendations and the Commission had regard to the effect on the revenue of any of its recommendations. The suggestion of this ceiling of £30 in the valuation for Schedule A tax purposes was made in order to lighten the impact of the concession on the revenue.</P>
    <P>Schedule A taxation is a penal tax on the thrifty citizen, on the householder. Receipts from it are said to be about £1½ million.  That figure is a most deceptive one, a most misleading one, and should be studied with great caution.  The fact of the matter is that the only persons who are effectively paying tax under Schedule A are, by and large, householders.  Admittedly, business property is subject to tax under Schedule A, but what is gained on the swings under that heading is lost on the roundabouts under Schedule D, which gives relief of the amount assessed under the previous tax.</P>
    <P>It is a most complicated tax which is inequitable in its incidence.  I greatly deplore and resent very much the view the Minister has taken of the Second Report of the Income Tax Commission. The only persons who benefit from Schedule A taxation are the landlords <Col N="1101" /> of residential property and certain other small properties.  If the recommendation of the Commission were accepted, the cost to the revenue would be approximately a quarter of a million pounds. I am not suggesting that it would be very easy for the Minister to give that concession this year, but he could have gone part of the way.  He could have admitted in principle that the Commission had made a good case for its remission.  An important point to have regard to in connection with Schedule A taxation is the very heavy cost of its collection.  Apart from that, I believe that the whole tax is wrong in principle, that it is based on crackpot, outworn, Victorian economic ideas.</P>
    <P>I think that only very few Deputies here, perhaps only a minority, are aware that our main tax statute is the British Income Tax Act of 1918.  This is the 109th year in which this tax code in its present form is being imposed on the Irish people.  The whole concept of income tax, as we know it, goes back to the time of William Pitt &mdash;it is over 150 years old.  I believe that we have been far too reactionary and far too conservative in our approach to income tax affairs.  I greatly regret and, indeed, resent the manner in which virtually all the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission have been rejected by the Government.  In particular, I feel it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the wage earner and the salary earner contribute far more than is equitable to our direct tax revenue. The receipts from the wage and salary earners, particularly after the onset of P.A.Y.E., have been such that the Minister has done very handsomely from them during the past year.</P>
    <P>The approach is that the wage earner and the salary earner are fair game for the Revenue Commissioners. They are an easy mark.  Their income is easily ascertainable.  They are taxed in full on every 20/- in the £.  They are the only section of taxpayers who receive no allowances in respect of expenditure when their tax assessments are raised.  I believe the time has come when future Ministers for Finance must have regard to the inequitable impact of our present form <Col N="1102" /> of income tax on wage earners and salary earners and must introduce differential rates of allowances.  A very strong case can be made for a higher rate of personal allowance for wage and salary earners or for a higher rate of earned income relief.  The amount of the salary earner's expenses is something that should be looked into and at the earliest possible opportunity. The rule with regard to those expenses is one which has been condemned by very many important authorities, including a British Royal Commission and many courts of law.</P>
    <P>In respect of the taxation of wage earners and salary earners, I should like to say a word about the P.A.Y.E. scheme which has worked very successfully from the Minister's point of view.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting all concerned with the mechanics of P.A.Y.E. and to say what a very good job the Revenue Commissioners have made of adapting to our purposes the British system.  In the mechanical sense, the job has been done with great efficiency. When P.A.Y.E. was introduced, Senator O'Brien gave a very apt description of it in the Seanad.  He likened it to a person who has an old wornout coat and who put a patch on it.  That is P.A.Y.E. he said.</P>
    <P>What is really needed is a new code.  Because P.A.Y.E. seems to be working well and because the Minister has not, perhaps, received very many complaints about it, we should not be too smug with regard to it.  It is only a patch on an old outworn tax code, a tax code which should be discarded.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my agreement with a point made by Deputy Corish.  He said he would prefer to have the income tax concession given in the form of increased allowances for the individual rather than by way of reduction in the standard rate.  I suspect one of the reasons the Minister did not increase the personal allowances was that that would have involved the scrapping of the certificates for the current year issued under P.A.Y.E. during the past two or three months.  This is one of the criticisms one can make of the system; in a <Col N="1103" /> mechanical sense, it seems to impose a certain degree of rigidity on the tax structure.</P>
    <P>In relation to this question of the inequitable impact of direct taxation on wage and salary earners, it is true to say that the proportion of the national income accruing to wage and salary earners has not increased significantly in the past two or three years. Over the same period, the amount of taxation paid by wage and salary earners has increased very considerably. As far back as 1956, the present Tánaiste as a Deputy in Opposition, referred to the principle of social justice.  At volume 158, column 226 of the Official Report, Deputy MacEntee said:</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, there is an obvious element of social injustice because, after all, while the percentage received from Schedule E tax has gone up by 50 per cent. &mdash;there is a 50 per cent. greater proportion of the total yield from the tax than in 1938-39&mdash;the earnings upon which this tax is assessed have declined very substantially in real value per unit of currency.</P>
    <P>Further on, he says:</P>
    <P>The main plea I am going to make to the Minister is this.  I think we should have this examination of income-tax as it affects all classes of taxpayers, but we should particularly have it in relation to its incidence upon those who are employed and whose income is mainly derived from the carrying on of a business or profession, whether that income accrues to them as the owner or as the employee of it ... we should consider whether we have not reached the stage at which income-tax has become positively detrimental to our continued economic development.  It is, at its present rate, highly inflationary. It leads to all sorts of abuse.</P>
    <P>At that time, of course, Deputy MacEntee was in Opposition.  He is now a member of a Government who <Col N="1104" /> have produced this extremely reactionary White Paper and who have rejected so many of the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued as to what was behind the concessions given to surtax payers in this Budget, concessions costing no less than £100,000.  This £100,000 represents the third concession given by the Minister for Finance in the present Government to surtax payers.  Some years ago, he raised the surtax exemption limit from £1,500 to £2,000.  In 1959, he made the personal allowance chargeable for surtax purposes.  Prior to that, it had not been.  That was quite a considerable concession.  Now he is raising the limit to £2,500.  I wonder does the Minister feel the Fianna Fáil Party have an obligation to discharge to the wealthy classes in the country?  Can we from now on regard Fianna Fáil as the rich man's Party?</P>
    <P>It is extremely important from the point of view of inspiring confidence and preserving public morale that the income tax code should be both impartial and equitable in its impact upon taxpayers.  Our present code is neither impartial nor equitable.  The fourth report of the Income Tax Commission expresses that opinion in paragraph 143:</P>
    <P>If a tax is to command public support it must fall impartially on all members of the community.  In practice there will inevitably be some modifications of this idea, but the whole foundation of our system of income taxation is damaged so long as the basis of assessing income is out of conformity with the realities of the situation.  Our recommendations are intended to remedy this serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>Their recommendations have, of course, been completely rejected, along with the recommendations in most of the other reports of the Commission. There is a very strong moral obligation to instil a measure of equity into our tax code.  An unfairly loaded tax code is bound to be demoralising in its effect on those who are called upon to pay on their full income.</P>
    <P>If I may revert to this question of <Col N="1105" /> Schedule A&mdash;the householder's tax, as I term it&mdash;I would suggest to the Minister, and it is a constructive suggestion, that he should consider the reintroduction of the repairs allowance for Schedule A purposes.  At one time, there was a repairs allowance.  It was abolished in the 'thirties by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly.  He was probably hard pressed for money.  In the absence of the complete abolition of this Schedule A tax on owner-occupiers, the introduction of a repairs allowance would go part of the way towards making this tax somewhat fairer in its impact.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the community sadly disappointed by the Minister's latest Budget, and for a very particular reason.  In the autumn of this year, Irish television will become a reality.  Already cinema owners are suffering adversely because of the popularity of British television. A year ago the Minister made quite a generous concession in relation to entertainments duty where cinemas are concerned.  He gave a flat rebate of 20 per cent. on the duty payable per week, plus a round allowance to each cinema of £10.  I think that perhaps the Minister in one respect was over-generous last year.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the desirability of taxing cinemas on a differential scale should be seriously considered. The big cinemas, the O'Connell Street houses in Dublin, the first-run houses, will always draw big crowds and will always pay their way very handsomely.  The second-run houses, usually the smaller cinemas, are the ones which are now feeling the draught in a very big way.  Several of them in the Dublin area have closed recently and I am afraid that it is probable more will have to close unless the entertainment duty on them is abated considerably.</P>
    <P>Two scales of relief are called for, one scale for the first-run houses and another for the second-run houses.  It should not be administratively impossible to devise such a scale.  The relief that was given a year ago is really most significant for the big men.  It does not mean nearly as <Col N="1106" /> much to the smaller ones, those which really need the relief, those whose prices are in the lower bracket.  There are 3,000 people employed in the cinema industry, 1,500 of them in the Dublin area alone, and the reality of the position is that their jobs are in jeopardy by reason of the falling off in attendances due to television. A scale of duty related to the attendances or to the revenue earned per seat in those houses, is one which should commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I said at the commencement of my remarks, we should face up to the fact that in this country William Pitt's code of income tax was never designed for Irish needs and that it is quite unsuited to our economy.  I would urge the Minister to take another look at all the reports of the Income Tax Commission and adopt a less reactionary approach.  I have a Parliamentary Question down for tomorrow asking the Minister how many recommendations the Commission have made to-date and how many of those have been accepted by the Government. I think I can anticipate the Minister's reply.  The vast majority of them have been rejected in this reactionary, over-conservative White Paper which the Minister circulated a week ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish admonished the Minister this evening because in the Seanad a couple of weeks ago he said that he was going to introduce a good Budget.  The extraordinary thing is that Deputy Corish himself, four or five months ago, prophesied that not only was the Minister going to introduce a good Budget but that we were going to have a general election in May, because of the Budget.  He made that statement in Clonmel and repeated it in some other place.  He did not allow to the Minister anything like what he allowed himself.  It is because it is a good Budget that there is all this fuss. What I often wonder is what the Opposition would call a good Budget. I have come to the conclusion that a good Budget from the Opposition's point of view would be one that would blister the people, impose heaxy taxation <Col N="1107" /> and impose crushing burdens on industry, and so on.  That would give them an opportunity at the church gates and here in this House of shouting about the disastrous effects of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Of course we did have it from Deputy Dillon and needless to say when Deputy Flanagan spoke, we had it even better.  Of course everything Deputy Flanagan says is exaggerated, as, for instance, his statement that Fianna Fáil at the last election gave pledges, promises and undertakings in order to induce the people to change the Government.  &ldquo;Pledges, promises and undertakings&rdquo;&mdash;he must repeat himself two or three times for emphasis sake.  It so happens that I was present at the last speech, I suppose, delivered by a Minister at the general election.  The meeting started at 10 p.m. and the Minister spoke at 10.30.  The Minister was the present Minister for Finance and the most important statement he made at the meeting was that because he did not have details of the financial position, he was unable to make any promises whatever to the people except that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would devote all their energies to clearing up the mess which they felt the country was in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no doubt about it that a mess did exist. I want to deal with the question of election Budgets and appealing to the people and all that type of thing.  There was an excuse for the election that followed the first Coalition because there was internal dissension.  We all know about that; it was published in the newspapers; and they spoke of sinister influences and so on.  The second Coalition had an excellent majority and Fianna Fáil were not able to beat them in any way at all.  The only reason I can see for their dissolving Parliament was simply that they were not able to carry on.  If the Government were able to carry on, <Col N="1108" /> why should they dissolve before three years had expired?</P>
      <P>We all know the position of the country at the time.  Unemployment was at the highest level in my memory and it was increasing.  We all know there was no money for any purpose and that grants had been suspended.  In fact, in the first two or three months after the election, I was getting nothing but appeals from people to help them to get grants which they should have got a year before.  Factories were in a very precarious position.  I know that to be perfectly true.  Factory workers were working on short time and many were being dismissed.</P>
      <P>The real reason the last Coalition Government dissolved was simply that they were unable to carry on.  That being the position, what were the people to do when a Party like Fianna Fáil appealed to them?  They knew the Coalition Government had failed.  They knew that they had thrown up the sponge, that they had actually admitted that they were unable to carry on the government of this country.  What option had the people but to elect the one Party who could give them a Government?</P>
      <P>It cannot be denied that for the past four years there has been a period of stability and peace in this country, a period of certainty.  Everybody knows that the country is in a sound financial position, a situation completely different from that which obtained during the three years previous to Fianna Fáil taking office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan told us that there was keen disappointment in the country because of the Budget.  I do not know what kind of people Deputy Flanagan meets but I meet a fair cross-section of the people every day and the general comment on the Budget that I have heard is exactly what the Minister has said, that it is a good Budget.  I believe that to be perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan consoles himself with the thought that this is the last Fianna Fáil Budget.  He prophesied that the election would take place before the end of this year.  The last Fine Gael Budget was introduced <Col N="1109" /> about a year before Parliament dissolved. I suppose they were afraid to introduce a Budget in the year 1957. They were afraid of the taxes they would have had to impose.</P>
    <P>We have heard a tremendous amount of talk about the food subsidies.  So far as the people are concerned, the food subsidies are as dead as mutton. Nobody in rural Ireland bothers his heard about food subsidies.  The price of bread, tea and butter is a subject for wonderful election slogans but the people generally are not concerned with the food subsidies at the moment. They are able to buy food at the prices obtaining and they are quite happy to have the money to buy these commodities. I am quite happy to envisage Deputy Flanagan's threat being put into effect, that at every church gate in the country, we will be hearing about the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also told us that if we believe that the threepence per day granted to old age pensioners will mean that we will sweep the country, we are living in space.  It is the Deputy who is living in space.  The old age pensioners are very happy about any increase they get and Fianna Fáil have always given such increases to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the attitude of the Labour Party towards the increase in old age pensions.  About 18 months ago, Deputy Kyne, from the Labour benches, advocated the imposition of an extra tax on tobacco, cigarettes, beer, spirits, cinemas and other luxuries, the proceeds to be used to improve old age pensions and other social services.  Last year, the Minister imposed an extra penny tax on cigarettes and tobacco and announced that it was hoped thereby to raise £900,000, £450,000 of which would be allocated to old age pensions and the balance to other social services.  To my surprise, last year, Deputy Kyne, who had advocated exactly what the Minister had done, walked into the division lobby to vote against that tax.  He did precisely the same thing last week when the Budget was introduced.  I had complimented him when he spoke on that motion on taking a realistic view of taxation, of government and <Col N="1110" /> of everything else.  I said he had come to realise, and was the first person on the other side of the House I had heard stating, that in order to give anything, the Government had first to collect it. The Deputy advocated the imposition of a tax and then suggested a method of spending it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish always amazes me when he talks about the old age pensioners. The Deputy was Minister for Social Welfare for about three years. He believes that the old age pension is a means of livelihood.  I remember challenging him on that question.  I have always regarded the old age pension as something which a Government give to old people to help them. I believe, and I do not make any secret of my belief, that old people are the responsibility of their children, just as children are the responsibility of their parents.  I hope the idea will never be accepted in this country that old age pensioners are wards of State. I am always happy when a Government are able to improve the position of the aged by giving them something extra and the more they get the better I will be pleased, but Deputy Corish, who believes that the old age pension is a means of livelihood, should have seen to it when he was a member of the Coalition Government that that belief was put into operation and that, instead of the 25/- or whatever it was at that time, they would get £3 or £4 or whatever sum he thought would be a means of livelihood for old people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred at great length to the small farmers.  I asked him several times what exactly he meant by a small farmer but I did not get an answer from him.  Towards the end of his speech, he gave a solemn pledge that when Fine Gael took office again, they would, through the Land Commission or by some other method, purchase the thousands of acres that were being purchased by foreigners and would give 50-acre farms to the sons of farmers.  I wonder is the owner of a 50-acre farm the small farmer about whom Deputy Flanagan was talking?  Apart from that, what amuses me about <Col N="1111" /> Deputy Flanagan is that he of all people should talk about farmers. When we increased the price of milk by twopence, he protested that he would not agree in any circumstances to increasing the price of milk to benefit the rich farmers of Limerick and Tipperary.  Every penny on the price of milk, he said, meant twopence a lb. on the price of butter to his constituents and he certainly would not stand for that.  This is the man who comes here today and every day and lectures the Fianna Fáil benches about the farming community.</P>
    <P>I noticed when Deputy Dillon was talking about farmers that there were only two farmers in the 13 men who sat behind him.  I have no objection to the number of farmers there may be in any Party but it is extraordinary that the number of farmers in the Fine Gael Party is as small as it is.  I do not think there is one Fine Gael farmer living in the <Col N="1112" /> province of Munster.  There are quite a number of them on the Fianna Fáil benches.  It is the people who elect their representatives but it is laughable that the suggestion should come from the opposite benches that we should not open our mouths about the farmers.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat was referred to. We were told that we had promised 84/- a barrel for wheat.  Certainly no such promise was made in Tipperary at the last election.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;Annual Road Grants for County Road Improvement were introduced in 1949-50 and were based on the mileage of county roads in each area.  The total amount of any grant has since been varied upwards and downwards on a number of occasions and in general these variations were extended to the counties on a proportionate basis.  A number of them have added to their mileage of county roads under the Local Government Act, 1953 and this explains why the grant per mile in some cases is now lower than in others.</P>
