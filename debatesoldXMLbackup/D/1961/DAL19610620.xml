    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that <Col N="454" /> carters who were employed by some local authorities have been refused contributory old age pensions on the grounds that they have failed to satisfy statutory contribution conditions for the pension because the local authority by whom they were employed failed to stamp their cards until the passing of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, although they were employed on contract with service basis; and if he will consider crediting such persons with that service in order to qualify them for the contributory old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>A person cannot be granted old age (contributory) pension unless he satisfies the statutory contribution conditions on his insurance under the Social Welfare Acts or the former National Health Insurance Acts.  Accordingly, pensions have been refused, or awarded at reduced rates where appropriate, to a considerable number of claimants, including persons who had been employed as carters by local authorities, because their insurance did not satisfy the conditions.</P>
      <P>The position of carters in relation to social insurance was affected by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Prior to the 5th January, 1953, when that Act came into operation, carters who were employed under contracts of service requiring personal service on the part of the carter were insurable under the National Health Acts but carters who worked in the execution of contracts not requiring personal service on the part of the employed person were not insurable.  As from the 5th January, 1953, the carters previously insurable continued to be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  In addition, carters employed on the basis of contracts for services where the employment is of one person and is by way of manual labour and personal service is given by the employed person, became insurable for the first time.  Carters who do not come within the foregoing categories are, <i>prima facie</i>, not insurable but I should stress that the question of the insurability of any employment is, in accordance with Section 42 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, a matter for decision by a Deciding Officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> I do not accept the implication in the question that local authorities failed to meet their statutory obligations as employers in the matter of stamping insurance cards for carters who were insurable.  However, any person who considers that his employment was insurable under the Acts in force at the time, may apply to have the question of insurability statutorily determined.  If it is decided that the employment was insurable, a claim to pension already dealt with can be reviewed in the light of any further contributions paid following the insurability decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any doubt or any question of the insurance of carters prior to 5th January, 1953?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what precisely the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Pay As You Earn, tax is deductible from all emoluments <i>paid</i> subsequent to the 5th October, 1960, irrespective of the period in which the emoluments were earned.  So far as the year 1960-61 is concerned, the exact liability is calculated by reference to the amount of the emoluments <i>earned</i> in that year, and an abatement amounting to one-half of that liability is then granted.  All of the tax deducted between the 6th October, 1960, and the 5th April, <Col N="456" /> 1961, is credited against the net liability for 1960-61.  If there has been an overdeduction, the excess is refunded; and if the tax deducted was insufficient the amount of the underdeduction is subsequently recovered.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any specific case where difficulty has arisen, I shall have inquiries made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the poll for the Referendum in relation to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, and that for the Presidential Election were held on the same day in 1959, it is not possible to give a separate figure of cost for the Referendum. The combined cost was £83,888.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that under a recent decision of the High Court area exemption orders granted prior to the operation of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, have been held to be valid for the periods for which they were granted; and, if in view of his statement to the effect that all such orders would be invalid after the implementation of the 1960 Act, he will cause to be refunded to all holders of area exemption orders the stamp duty paid on them.</P>

      <P>There is no connection whatsoever between the High Court decision in question and a claim for a refund of fees.  The fee prescribed for area exemption orders was the same whether the order related to one Sunday or to several, and those orders that were regarded as inoperative as from 4th July had, in general, been in operation for several Sundays before that date.</P>
      <P>I may add that an appeal against the decision in question is being taken in the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Gráin hold approximately 110,000 tons of 1960 crop wheat which is unsuitable for milling into flour.  Of this quantity 68,000 tons have been sold for export before mid-August next.</P>
      <P>Approximately 130,000 tons have already been exported or sold on the home market for feeding since August, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister justify the importation of pollard and bran, when he has on hands such large quantities of unmillable wheat which could substantially be converted into white pollard and bran?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised this question with me on a previous occasion.  I dealt with it at that time. Apparently the Deputy has in mind an occasion when the flour millers' profits were guaranteed and when the subsidy arrangement permitted the solution he suggests to be adopted as one more acceptable than the system in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am trying to find out is this.  If we have on hands thousands of tons of wheat which is not fit for conversion into flour but which could be converted into pollard and bran, why do we keep that wheat in store and at the same time import pollard and bran?  I can quite see we must use the pollard and bran derived from our current manufacture of flour.  Why do we import pollard and bran when we have wheat which can be converted into pollard and bran?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The disposal of any surplus wheat that arises as a result of a bad harvest has to be dealt with having regard to our grain policy and having regard to the guarantee we give to the barley grower.  Regard must also be had to the compounders' anxiety to produce a compound which is uniform and acceptable.  Bearing in mind all <Col N="458" /> these delicate and intricate questions we believe the course which has been taken, after very careful consideration of this problem, is the proper one.</P>

I am not yet in a position to say when it will be possible for the Board to announce the terms of the scheme.

      <P>At the time of the passing of the Insurance Act, 1936 an arrangement was made under which the British tariff offices undertook to pass a considerable volume of re-insurance business to the Irish insurance companies. The advantages which would thus accrue to the Irish companies <Col N="459" /> were superior to those which would have resulted from the establishment of a State re-insurance company.  In the circumstances, the Part of the Insurance Act, 1936 relating to the establishment of such a company has not been brought into operation.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say whose responsibility the bridge is.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has not received, nor is it aware of, any complaints that the Intermediate Certificate Geography paper was either difficult or erratic. Accordingly the remaining part of the Question does not arise.</P>
      <P>The reference in the second Question would appear to be to the Leaving Certificate Honours Geography paper. The paper concerned is fully within the programme in Geography for Leaving Honours outlined in the Rules and Regulations for Secondary Schools.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Leaving Certificate, as stated in those Rules and Regulations, is &ldquo;to testify to the completion of a good secondary education and to the fitness of a pupil to enter on a course of study at a university or an educational institution of similar standing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Leaving Certificate, either in itself or by comparison with equivalent examinations, is in any way inadequate for its purposes.</P>
      <P>In so far as pertains to industrial and commercial requirements, I have expert advice that not only is a knowledge of the map projection concerned of educational value, but that it is of basic importance in the matter of air transport in all fields, including industrial and commercial.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are similar. They cover a point raised in the <Col N="472" /> Seanad.  It was suggested there might be some confusion arising out of the use of the words &ldquo;appearing to the Board to have&rdquo; and &ldquo;appearing to the High Court to have&rdquo;.  I thought the section as it stood was all right but, once the point was raised, to clear up any confusion, we decided to delete &ldquo;appearing to the Board to have&rdquo; and &ldquo;appearing to the High Court to have&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;having&rdquo; in both cases.  That is in line with Section 36 of the Trustee Act, 1893.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment.  I think the original drafting was correct and the present drafting is not correct.  The situation could very well be that, until the High Court has determined the trustees of the charity, nobody knows who has or who has not an interest.  It is perfectly proper, therefore, that until such time as it is determined by the High Court who has an interest, &ldquo;appearing to the Board to have&rdquo; would be quite correct because the Board thinks that such and such a body will have an interest. Until the actual decision of the court is obtained, it will not be clear who has an interest and the court will want, appearing before it, the people who are completely found to have an interest and, in addition, the people who are on the other side to argue the other point of view.  It does not seem to me that the other House, in their wisdom, have been as clear in this matter as we were in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (1) (b), the Board can be moved by any person appearing to the Board to have an interest. Under that subsection, as it stands, if it subsequently transpires that the person in fact has not an interest, <Col N="474" /> his status is still preserved if, as a preliminary to any proceedings that have taken place or any costs he may have been involved in, it was agreed by the Board&mdash;or, in respect of the second amendment, by the court&mdash;that, when he moved the Board in the first case, or the court in the second case, he had a status inasmuch as they said that at that stage he appeared to have an interest.</P>
    <P>If it subsequently transpires he has not, I take it he may be indemnified for his costs.  If we stipulate in the Bill that the only person who may move the Board or the court in a matter of this kind is a person who has an interest, a person perfectly genuinely believing in the ambiguous circumstances envisaged by Deputy Sweetman that he has an interest, but it subsequently transpires when the trusts are settled that, in fact, he has not, and never had, will he then be in the position that any indemnification in regard to costs of any proceedings he may have inaugurated will not be available, whereas they would have been available if the original wording of the section had been left and the court was satisfied that the applicant acted <i>bona fide</i> in the belief that he had an interest which, as a preliminary, the court could have said they accepted as quite legitimate?</P>

      <P>To appoint trustees. We are laying down the qualification which such a person must have. Whether or not we insert the words &ldquo;appearing to have&rdquo; could not possibly affect the position with regard to costs.  Adhering to the phraseology of the section at the moment would undoubtedly create difficulty.  At least, the argument can be sustained that it would create this difficulty: an application could be made by a person who appears to the Board to have an interest. Before he goes near the Board at all, he must appear to the Board to have an interest.  It was suggested, <Col N="475" /> reasonably I thought, in the Seanad that that was nonsensical.</P>

      <P>The section stipulates who may make an application.  No application has been made and we have to decide who can make an application.  The section says that the only person who may make an application is a person who appears to the Board to have an interest.  If he has not made an application, he has not come before the Board and he cannot, therefore, appear to the Board to have an interest.  It has been suggested that that is what is wrong with the wording as the Bill stands.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that would help us.  It would certainly help me. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how the words &ldquo;appearing to have an interest&rdquo; came to be introduced into the Bill?  My experience is that words are very carefully chosen and not just casually inserted.  There must have been some reason for adopting this form &ldquo;appearing to the High Court to have an interest.&rdquo;  I assume that they were probably taken from some previous statutory instrument with equal authority with the Trustee Act that the Parliamentary Secretary now quotes as the suitable precedent for the proposed amendment from the Seanad.

      <P>Section 45 dealt with gifts for Foundation Masses.  I have explained the position with regard to these gifts in the House.  Difficulties arose in connection with gifts for Foundation Masses and, indeed, in connection with gifts for Masses generally.  We set out in the former Section 45 to deal with that situation. On reflection, we decided that we could deal with it better by making a general provision with regard to all gifts for religious purposes, which provision would apply not only to gifts for Masses but to other valid gifts for religious purposes or for any religion.  We decided, therefore, to delete Section 45 and introduce this amendment to Section 46.  We achieve all that we had formerly achieved in Section 45 and a great deal more.  It is a general provision covering all religions and covering all valid charitable gifts for religious purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a very valuable reform and I am quite certain that it will be welcomed by all the different religious denominations.  The amendment of <Col N="480" /> Section 46 in this way involves the deletion of Section 45 and also involves the consequential provision which is made by amendment No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain important matters that arise in this amendment of which the House should be made aware.  This Charities Bill was, in fact, drafted&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary will agree&mdash;some four or five or six years ago.  It is not unnatural for people to ask, if it was drafted by the previous Government, why was it not introduced.  The answer is it was not introduced because the previous Government proceeded to consider this extremely difficult problem of an appropriate description for religious charities and, very often, when Governments come to consider specific questions of this kind that seem to the uninitiated to be relatively simple, the more one considers them the greater the difficulty of providing appropriate statutory definitions to meet every possibility becomes.</P>
      <P>The plain truth is that the Charities Bill we are now considering remained on the files of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice because, after giving days of careful consideration to it, we had not yet arrived at a satisfactory drafting for the subject matter of Section 45. Section 45 is new to the Charities Bill.  That section was not in our Charities Bill.  It was not in our Charities Bill because, having given it the most careful consideration, we had not yet found a form which seemed to us adequately to deal with this tangled problem.  The view was pressed, though not finally accepted, that possibly there was a good deal to be said for allowing this problem of charities to remain temporarily at any rate, a specific problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is an amendment that goes to the heart of the matter and changes the whole basis of this section from being a section designed to make a specific bequest for Masses valid as a charity and extends that to any bequest for a religious purpose, so any bequest &ldquo;for the purpose of the advancement of religion shall have effect and, as respects its having effect, shall be construed in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned&rdquo;.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that greatly widens the ambit of the original intention of the section.  I am certain that when considering that matter we ought to have very careful regard to the history of this whole story and recall the O'Hagan clause and all the devices developed down through the years to avoid the consequences of the obscurantist decisions of British Chancery Courts in this country during the 18th and 19th centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying now to do by statute what Judge Gavan Duffy's judgment, I think, did in respect of a judicial decision and which had, up to the date of that judgment, been provided for by the O'Hagan clause.  We are now taking a further step and saying that any bequest &ldquo;for the advancement of religion shall have effect and, as respects its having effect, shall be construed in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned&rdquo;.  Whether that is a wise provision or not is another matter. In this country we are fortunate in that we have a number of Christian <Col N="482" /> churches all of whose theology and structure are well-known to us and deservedly respected by all other communities. We have the Jewish community with their religious institutes; we have the Unitarian Church which I think does not desire to be known as a Christian community but as Unitarian and we have other recognised religious institutions, access to whose laws, canons, ordinances and tenets is readily available from sources on which our society can confidently depend.  But we are very fortunate in finding ourselves in that position and we are quite unlike many other countries.</P>
    <P>One of the problems here involved is that, to take a country like the United States, you can have all sorts of strange sects arising and many of them describing themselves as being religions with laws, canons, ordinances and tenets which are ascertainable. Now, you can see this subject is a matter of some little embarrassment to me to discuss here and yet we have a duty to face embarrassing problems.  I know a sect in the State of New York whose laws, canons, ordinances and tenets require every female who becomes associated with it to be at the disposal of the head cook and bottle washer of that particular sect.  That may sound very amusing to Deputies but it is not a bit amusing to me.</P>
    <P>I could multiply cases of that kind.  I remember a sect manifesting itself on one occasion on the Californian coast, the high priestess of which sect was alleged to be kidnapped and turned up as a Spanish bullfighter emerging out of the sea and the sect were required to believe that she rose from the sea mysteriously.  But she had a sect and she had laws, canons, ordinances and tenets, and I have not the slightest doubt that, in the period of her ascendancy, there might have been very substantial sums of money provided for the promotion of this now long-dead activity.</P>

      <P>I do not think these things can be spoken of thus trivially because Deputy O'Malley, who has a <Col N="483" /> plain and simple mind, I think rightly illumines this matter.  Are we to identify the Mass with activities which Deputy O'Malley considers to be appropriate to the Gaming Act?  We did not think so.  I am now going out to the extreme fringe of extravagance.  But one of the things we were slow to deal with by Statute was to tamper with a delicate situation of this kind lest we give an opportunity to Deputy O'Malley to say that everything from the celebration of the Mass to what might be more appropriately controlled by the Gaming Acts is to be gathered into one omnibus section covering charitable bequests.</P>
      <P>We pride ourselves in this country on the respect that all sections of the community have for the religious beliefs of our neighbours but we forget sometimes how fortunate we are to be in the position of giving that respect.  Am I not right in saying that this new omnibus definition which the Parliamentary Secretary asks us to accept&mdash;</P>

It deals purely with the situation, when you have a valid gift, as to how that valid gift shall be administered.  We are not making any decision as to whether any particular sect or religion would be regarded as a religion or whether a gift to such a body would be regarded as a valid charitable gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion. We are dealing only with the administration of a valid charitable gift for the advancement of religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you have such a sect as I describe, which establishes beyond all doubt that this bequest has been made to it and that it is for the advancement of religion as defined by the secretary concerned, and that secretary goes on to say: &ldquo;and I am the sole repository of the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets, of which I am the head, and accordingly I direct the Court that I am the only evidence to the court.  There is no other evidence that these are the terms in any appropriate scheme that can be formulated, because your obligation is to formulate in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets.&rdquo;  I think there is an obligation on the court to prepare schemes which in my respectful submission to this House, would constitute an outrage to our legislative intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we mean to do is to say here that if money is left to the Presbyterians, to the Methodists, or to the Jewish community, or the Unitarians, or some money is left to the Roman Catholic Church, the court would hear from the responsible authorities of such communions what are the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion in question and that the prepared scheme would conform with those.  All sides of the House would readily agree to that approach.  But it is because this goes far beyond that that it has created such difficulties in the minds of previous Governments. It is because this section of the Bill now to be amended goes miles beyond what all of us could agree upon, that this Bill was held up.  We could not <Col N="485" /> find the section which would go far enough, or as far as we thought it should go, without in fact taking us far beyond the distance we think Oireachtas Eireann ought to go.</P>

What I am trying to avoid is putting an obligation on the courts to form a scheme under charitable bequests which will conform to the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets for any sect which may have been decided by our courts to be a religious sect.  That goes far beyond what we want to do. I am not at all sure that, when this section with this amendment in it appears in the Bill, our position in relation to this delicate matter will be any better than in fact it has been with the Gavan Duffy judgment and the O'Hagan clause to provide for any contingencies that could arise in the future, or did arise in the past, in regard to charitable donations and bequests for the advancement of religion.</P>
      <P>I thought Section 45 in the original Bill did not present much improvement on the actual situation in which we were.  As I understood it, it sought to follow substantially Gavan Duffy's judgment.  This goes much beyond it and I do not know where the Minister got this addendum to his original section.  I do not like it and a realistic examination of this problem should make manifest to any reasonable Deputy the new elements that are being introduced in this legislation which I think we are, rightly, profoundly reluctant to contemplate.</P>

      <P>That problem has been before the courts, a problem which they decided from time to time and one which they will have to continue to decide.  This section does not alter the situation in that regard in any way; it merely stipulates that where a gift is a valid charitable gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion it should have effect and be construed in a certain way.  If the appalling problems which Deputy Dillon has outlined in the matter of deciding whether or not certain sects are valid religions or not, if they are as appalling as he suggests, well, they have long been so and will continue to be so.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that subsection (1) does affect in a very definite and concrete way whether or not a gift is a valid charitable gift for the purposes of the advancement of religion. I have no doubt that Deputy Sweetman realises exactly the sort of case towards which it is directed.  The type of case towards which subsection (1) is directed is the case where a gift is left to an enclosed Order of nuns.  Up to now, there seemed to be some doubt as to whether or not such a gift was a valid charitable gift because it did not include any element of public benefit. Subsection (1) is designed to remedy that situation but I was not talking about subsection (1).  I was referring exclusively to the proposed subsection (2).</P>
      <P>I was arguing how right or wrong Deputy Dillon may be in his statement about this problem, and whether or not it is ever likely to arise with us. My simple answer is that subsection (2) does not affect it in any way.  I have considered this matter very carefully indeed.  I have been in consultation with a number of interested parties and people who are vitally affected by the provisions of the new subsection, and I am quite satisfied that it is a very valuable piece of reform. I have no fears whatever in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I disagree entirely with the Parliamentary Secretary.  Under subsection (1) of Section 46, the courts would make certain declaratory pronouncements in relation to what was a gift for the advancement of religion, including a public benefit.  The court cannot construe subsection (1) entirely in a vacuum.  In considering what the word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; means in subsection (1), it must consider its meaning in the new subsection also.  It cannot consider it in a vacuum but will look to the nearest place where it has some cognate statutory notice of what &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is.  It then goes on to the <Col N="489" /> new subsection where it is &ldquo;construed in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me ask the Parliamentary Secretary one simple, straight question. No; perhaps I will not.  One does not like to refer to matters that have actually taken place here.  We know there is one small body of people who operate in this country who would certainly come within those terms.</P>

I do not think that under this subsection bequests for the purpose of enabling them to carry out their somewhat unpleasant methods of proselytising would be valid because the court would have to go back again to subsection (2) in making a construction under subsection (1).  No one would want it to do that.  It seems to me that you cannot construe subsection (1) in a vacuum.  If you cannot construe subsection (1) in a vacuum, then inevitably you are thrown on to the matters raised in the new subsection which says: &ldquo;... and, as respects its having effect, shall be construed in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If it is construed &ldquo;as respects its having effect&rdquo; when you have nothing to define what &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is in subsection (1), you must consider the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned to decide, if it has all these things, whether it is a religion to which subsection (1) refers. If it has those things, then it gets thrown back on to subsection (1) and the court has no option.  I think this is a very wide amendment, the implications of which the Parliamentary Secretary does not at all understand.</P>

      <P>I am not in the least influenced by the interpolations of the Minister for Health or the arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am dealing with this section on the basis <Col N="490" /> of a situation which happily does not exist here at present but may at any time.  It does exist elsewhere and we should have regard to it.  When the Parliamentary Secretary says an English court decided this or that activity was not a religion, I am not interested.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not look on this as a light matter but as a very grave matter.  I am not in the least encouraged by the predictions of the Parliamentary Secretary that the court will hold one thing to be a religious activity, and will hold some other thing not to be a religious activity.  If there is a body of persons who honestly believe themselves to be a valid group with religious convictions, my whole instinct is to lean towards them and to hope that this Legislature and our courts would be as jealous of their rights in our society as they would be of the rights of the most powerful and highly organised church in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You should be extremely chary about doing violence to a religious group simply because it appears to you that their religious conviction is at variance with what you yourself believe to be true.  The very quintessence of a Christian society, and particularly a society where the population is more than 97 per cent.  Roman Catholic, is that everyone's religious convictions will be most scrupulously respected.  It is with that situation in mind that you have got to face this whole problem and while your inclination <Col N="491" /> is to see that everyone will be perfectly free to hold such religious convictions as may appear appropriate to them, do you want to go the step further of saying that, however incongruous, incomprehensible and inexplicable these religious convictions may appear to be in the eyes of reasonable men, the courts, once they determine it is a religious issue and that a bequest to it is technically for the advancement of religion, will then have put upon them an obligation by this Legislature to ask that group: &ldquo;What are your laws, canons, ordinances and tenets?&rdquo; and, if there is no other source of evidence available to the court, that the court is bound to approve a scheme in accordance with those laws, canons, ordinances and tenets as reported to them by that group, whatever these laws, canons, ordinances and tenets may be?</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that we were very much better off before Section 45 and Section 46 were presented to us.  I am of opinion that Section 46, as here amended, may give rise in the future to most undesirable difficulties which we have successfully avoided to date and may give rise to conflicts which none of us would wish to see develop in our society.  I am not one bit ashamed in declaring that, in regard to delicate matters of this kind, it is very often wiser for the Legislature to stand aside and let the Court of Chancery in our own country deal with the problems that arise in connection with matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Court of Chancery is there with its own code to mitigate the rigours of the statute and common law.  It has done so with remarkable success.  It has shown that flexibility and wisdom which has enabled it to adapt the common law and the statute law itself to the requirements of our society, since our independence was established here.  We are going in now with the crude machinery of the statute law to try to improve upon what the Court of Chancery has already done.</P>
    <P>I think the decision of the previous Government to leave this matter with <Col N="492" /> the Court of Chancery was probably the wisest and I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary has found himself already slipping down the slippery slope and devised Section 45 and Section 46 as an innovation which he thought would tidy up this difficulty because he was persuaded in the Seanad to offer amendment No. 5 as a further elaboration of what he first recommended to this House as a solution to this proposal.  I think he has allowed himself to be pushed too far.</P>
    <P>He has not given us the history of the amendment, where it came from or who urged it upon him.  If it were desirable, why did he not include it in his original draft to this House?  He has fallen into the exact pit which we sought to avoid and that is to try to improve on what the Court of Chancery has done.  He is now doing by statute far more than the Court of Chancery would have done and very much more than this Legislature would have approved of, if they could foresee its potentialities and we were confronted with such developments as have taken place both in the United States and elsewhere throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are free from such aberrations gives us no guarantee that we will do better.  We are cutting a very awkward stick which may be used upon our own backs in the years to come if and when the contingencies which I regard as quite possible arise to plague us here as they have done elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me deal with the point made by Deputy Sweetman.  Subsection (1) of Section 46 does not have, I think, the effect that he thinks it has.  Merely excluding the necessity for an element of public benefit will not let in as a religion something which is not there at the moment.  If I read the subsection for the House, I think the House will agree with me.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>In determining whether or not a gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion is a valid charitable gift ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The determination there is directed to the charitable nature of the gift and not as to whether or not the religion is a recognised religion or one that would be recognised by our Courts as a religion.  Exactly the same point arises&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary continue reading the subsection.  It is precisely because you are excluding the provision about the public benefit that you are widening what a religion means.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The element of public benefit is concerned with the purposes of the gift and not the religion. The religion will either stand or fall as a religion by existing tests.  It is only the purposes of the gift that are in issue.  Let me give an example. Our Courts would regard the Catholic Faith as a valid religion: It is a religion which they would recognise as such.  Nevertheless, it is conceivable, although unlikely, that under existing law, even though the Catholic Faith is recognised as a religion, a gift to a particular Order of Catholic nuns would not be a valid charitable gift because of the lack of the so-called &ldquo;public benefit&rdquo; element.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that <Col N="494" /> the argument of Deputy Dillon and particularly of Deputy Sweetman is that by taking away this element of public benefit, we were letting into the category of recognised religions some which we should not.  I think that is just not so.  The subsection does not say that.  I do not think it can be read as saying so.  May I go on to put a couple of points in reply to what Deputy Dillon has stated?  I think anybody would agree that the proposed new subsection (2) very clearly envisages that the religion concerned must have laws, canons, ordinances and tenets.  Therefore, Deputy Dillon's suggestion that some of these sects would not have laws, canons, ordinances and tenets and that we would have to take the word of the secretary of the organisation just does not stand up.</P>
      <P>I have said before that law reform must be a continuing process.  All we can hope to do in this Bill is to give ourselves a piece of legislation which will be adequate and suitable to our times and circumstances.  Deputy Dillon admits that the problems he envisages are not with us today.  His concern is that they may arise in the future.  I suggest we cannot legislate on that basis.  We must try to give ourselves a charity code to suit the times and circumstances of today.  If those circumstances change, if developments make this legislation out of date or unsuitable, then it will have to be amended. That is the essential process of law reform.  Because that process is going on all the time we have this Bill before us.</P>
      <P>The statute of 1634 was possibly appropriate to its time.  The whole social set-up and fabric of society was different then from what it is today. That statute may have been suitable and adequate in 1634.  Because of changing circumstances, we must have law reform and amending legislation from time to time.  It is not a valid argument on the part of the Opposition to say, in effect: &ldquo;We admit everything is all right now and that the Bill deals with the situation as it is today but such and such a situation may arise.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday evening, my predecessor in office, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, reasonably and courteously told the Dáil how deplorable it was that the relations between the Irish Medical Association and the Minister for Health were so unsatisfactory. With similar courtesy Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde endorsed what Deputy O'Higgins said; and finally the Leader of the Fine Gael Opposition expressed the same views, though not so happily or so succinctly.  I hope Providence will forgive me that understatement.</P>
      <P>I agree with all these Deputies.  The existing situation is truly deplorable, deplorable, that is, from the point of view of the Irish medical profession&mdash; insofar as the Irish Medical Association, having regard to the course of action upon which it has embarked, has any true claim to represent the profession as a whole; or any power in present circumstances to further its interests or protect them, if protection should be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deplorable situation on the other hand, as everyone knows who is familiar with the facts, has in no way reacted adversely upon the efficiency or effectiveness of the health services, or to the detriment of the patients who avail of them.  All local authority hospitals are functioning with staffs as skilled and as complete as ever they had; and hundreds of dispensary doctors are devotedly doing their duty, secure now in the knowledge gained <Col N="499" /> by experience that when their interests were discussed with the proper authorities, they received fair and sympathetic treatment from me.</P>
    <P>That position will, of course, obtain also in the case of the district nursing service and nursing staffs generally.  No person has suffered because of the break with the I.M.A., except those few practitioners who, obeying the ban, forewent their right to apply for appointments for which they were qualified and which, if they had been the best qualified candidates, they would have obtained, if it had not been for the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>It is not enough, however, to say that a position is deplorable and to leave it at that.  If a deplorable situation is to be remedied, it is sometimes necessary to consider how, when, by whom, and for what purpose it was brought about.  I propose to do that in winding up this debate, quoting chapter and verse for what I say, stating my case as briefly and simply as possible, so that the people may appreciate how this situation was brought about and recognise that it was not of my seeking.</P>
    <P>I hope to convince the people also that no Minister for Health, who was truly concerned for their welfare, could surrender to the arrogant, unscrupulous and unjustifiable actions by which the present situation has been brought about.  I shall begin by referring to the speech of my predecessor, as Minister for Health, Deputy Tom O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins in opening this question referred to the fact that during his period of office he had been able to establish friendly relations with those who controlled the Irish Medical Association.  He took some modest credit for that fact.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detract in any way from what may be due to him on that score; or to belittle the pride which he may feel in this achievement.  Undoubtedly the attitude of the I.M.A. towards him was different, very different, from what it has been towards me.  Just as it differed, in the same way, towards my colleague, the first Minister for Health, Dr. Ryan, not only in connection with the Health Act of 1953 but earlier in 1947; and to myself <Col N="500" /> when, as Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1941 to 1947, I had occasion to deal with that body.</P>
    <P>But is there not something peculiar, something that calls for an explanation, in the very fact that relations between the Executive of the Irish Medical Association and a Fine Gael Minister for Health whoever he may happen to be have been invariably close and cordial; while with equal uniformity the relations between that body and a Fianna Fáil Minister have been invariably strained to breaking point, and, in the present instance, beyond it?</P>
    <P>Why should this most peculiar position have obtained over all those years and indeed practically since 1932? Does it not suggest that there has been some malign and esoteric influence, some hidden hand, operating to shape and colour the relations between the Irish Medical Association and successive Ministers for Health?  I think it does.</P>
    <P>To my mind it suggests that for many years the Association has been controlled by an inner caucus and this caucus has been exploiting, for its own hidden purposes, whatever grievances members of the medical profession may feel they have in relation to the Health Services, the Health Acts and the Minister who is called upon to administer those Acts.</P>
    <P>I submit indeed that the recorded facts do support the view that this dominating influence, whatever it may be, whoever may exercise it, has been a powerful factor in bringing the present deplorable situation about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom O'Higgins recalled how pleasant his relations with the officers of the Association had been. I am glad that they were pleasant, very pleasant, I believe.  The officers of the I.M.A. did not seek out an issue on which to quarrel with him. During the time he was Minister for Health the Association acquiesced in certain duties which he had prescribed for all consultant posts, medical, surgical and obstetrical, in the health service, and did not try to ban the posts to which these duties were attached.  The duties to which I refer were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" />&ldquo;(xii)  To give any person (being a registered medical practitioner) authorised by the health authority or the Minister, when requested, the clinical details respecting any person who is or has been under his care in the hospital.</P>
    <P>(xiii)  To give to the appropriate local authority all reasonable information respecting any person who is referred to him for examination and report by the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These duties have since been made by the I.M.A. the &ldquo;casus belli&rdquo; against me.  In view of this is it not surprising that while Deputy O'Higgins held office from June, 1954, to 20th March, 1957, no more than the lightest and most fugitive objection was raised at any time by the Executive of the Irish Medical Association to the fact that he had prescribed these duties for posts of the status I have mentioned. On the 20th March the Dáil approved of my nomination to be a member of the Government and on the 21st March, 1957, I formally took office as Deputy Tom O'Higgins's successor in the office of Minister for Health.  The House should note that date.  It should note another date also, a date some four days later, the 25th March, 1957; for on that day the Irish Medical Association addressed this letter to my Department:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>My Council has had under consideration the duties specified for the recently advertised post of Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Galway County Council, and other Local Authority appointments.  We refer in particular to duties stated as:</P>
    <P>(xii)  To give to any person (being a registered medical practitioner) authorised by the health authority or the Minister, when requested, the clinical details respecting any person who is or has been under his care in the hospital.</P>
    <P>(xiii)  To give to the appropriate local authority all reasonable information respecting any person who is referred to him for examination and report by the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> I must break the quotation to point out again that these duties are expressed in the terms in which my predecessor formulated them.  Despite them, however, and despite the fact that he insisted, rightly insisted, on their acceptance, his relations with the authors of this letter had been of the pleasantest.  Is it not exceedingly strange, therefore, that under me they were seized upon by the Executive of the I.M.A. as an excuse for the rancorous campaign on which they subsequently embarked?  To resume the quotation, the letter went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By long tradition, medical practitioners have been taught to consider themselves under both moral and legal obligation not to divulge, without the permission of the patient, any information which has been given to them by a patient under the seal of `professional confidence'. Strict application of the paragraphs cited above would, we are convinced, be in direct conflict with the accepted teaching of our Medical Schools.</P>
    <P>A reply at your early convenience will be appreciated.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Noel O'Reilly,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Medical Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now let me again recall that Deputy Tom O'Higgins was Minister for Health for almost three years. During the whole of that period the conditions set out in the Association's letter which I have just quoted&mdash;or the equivalent of them in the case of D.M.O. appointments formed part of every appointment made under him. These included&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A large number of posts as District Medical Officer&mdash;I may say that there are almost 1,000 D.M.O.s in the health service; and</P>
    <P>(2)  The following specialist posts:</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Tipperary (N.R.) Co. Council.</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Louth County Council.</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>E.N.T. Specialist, Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> Opthalmic Surgeon, Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>Paediatrician, Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>E.N.T. Specialist, Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>Paediatrician, Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>Obstetrician-Gynaecologist, Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Kerry County Council.</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Tipperary (S.R.) County Council.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the post of obsterician-gynaecologist to Galway County Council had been advertised early in 1956, at which time Deputy O'Higgins was still Minister for Health, and the two duties, referred to in the I.M.A. letter that I have just read, were included amongst those to be discharged by the holder of the post.  Yet no objection whatsoever was made to him in regard to them; which I think the Dáil must agree was more than passing strange, having regard to what followed later.</P>
    <P>So much for the attitude of the Irish Medical Association to this question when my predecessor was Minister for Health.  I think everyone will agree that it was one of the highest complaisance. The attitude of the Council of the Irish Medical Association changed, however, with all the slickness of a bedroom scene in a French farce, when Deputy O'Higgins went out and I came in.  Within four days after I succeeded as Minister for Health, the duties which for years had been accepted under Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, became intolerable under Deputy MacEntee.  The moribund conscience of the Council of the I.M.A.&mdash; or more properly a faction in the Council&mdash;was miraculously revived, and certain of its members suddenly discerned that the performance of the O'Higgins duties, as they may be conveniently referred to, violated certain moral and legal canons of great consequence. They must have been of great consequence, since to protect, as it has told us, the inexperienced and <Col N="504" /> innocent consultants among its members, the Irish Medical Association has done its utmost to deter them from even applying for posts to which the duties attached, conditions which, it is necessary to repeat again, were found to be quite acceptable under my predecessor.</P>
    <P>The Association indeed has gone even further than this.  It has attempted to bring the whole machinery of the Local Appointments Commission to a standstill, by forbidding its members to act on selection boards established by that body.  Now it cannot be pleaded that persons invited to act on such boards are inexperienced and innocent in the ways of the world.  To safeguard them from its dangers they at least do not require the archangels of the I.M.A. to guide them.  They are quite competent to look after themselves. The ban which the Council of the I.M.A. sought to impose on them had one object only, to procure a breakdown of the health services.</P>
    <P>With these facts before it, must not the Dáil and the country wonder what brought about this radical change of attitude on the part of the I.M.A.?  It cannot be denied that it was a radical change.  Surely the members of the Executive responsible for it might reasonably be expected to give the reasons for it, might be expected to justify it.  They have never deigned to do so.  On the contrary, they have shown unmistakably that they have no regard whatsoever for public opinion. They have clearly demonstrated, in fact, that they have one attitude towards the Minister for Health and his Department, if he happens to be of a certain political Party, but quite a different one towards him and his Department if he should be a member of another Party.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts, can there be any doubt in the minds of reasonable people that the present dispute was deliberately engineered and developed for their own ends by a clique in the Council of the Irish Medical Association?  Moreover, in view of the position in which the Association finds itself, can there be any doubt that when they did this, those responsible <Col N="505" /> acted in complete disregard of the true interests of the medical profession?  It cannot be denied that these interests demand that those who profess to act on behalf of the profession should work in cordial co-operation with the existing Minister for Health, whatsoever the Party he may happen to belong to, and that, like him, they must work within the law, whatever it may be.  I shall show that at no time, so far as I was concerned, has the Council of the I.M.A. been prepared to do either.</P>
    <P>But first it is necessary for me to point out that the duties which I have detailed, and to which the Association objected in March, 1957, were based on revised provisions regarding the keeping of medical records in relation to services provided under the Health Act, 1953.  These revised provisions were introduced in Regulations made by Deputy Tom O'Higgins, then Minister for Health, in March, 1955, following consideration of objections by both the Association and the National Health Council to the provisions contained in regulations made in May of the previous year.  Although the revised provisions did not meet with the formal approval of the Association, the National Health Council agreed to them; and the membership of the Council at that time was predominantly representative of the medical and ancillary professions and included nominees of the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, had I been the quarrelsome fellow that Deputy Dillon has alleged, or the vain one that Deputy Dr. Browne suggested, I should have sent a brusque reply to the I.M.A. Instead, after full consideration of every aspect of the problem, having satisfied myself that the duties prescribed represented the minimum which would enable the Minister for Health, whoever he might be, to ensure that, if a patient under the Health Acts suffered through neglect or in consequence of a culpable act on the part of his medical attendant, the responsibility for this could be properly established and brought home to the culprit by investigation. This was the purpose which all my <Col N="506" /> predecessors wanted to serve when they insisted on the duties, now objected to, being prescribed for all appointments.  Being convinced that nothing less than the conditions which Deputy O'Higgins and his predecessors had insisted on would suffice, I directed that a reply should be sent in the following terms to the I.M.A. It issued on 18th April, 1957.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...The Minister has asked me to say that he shares the anxiety of your Council to preserve medical secrecy.  It is clear to him, however, from the voluminous correspondence with your Association and from the various discussions which have taken place, that the matter is one of considerable difficulty, to which successive Ministers for Health have given considerable thought, and it appears to him that the duty numbered (xii) of the duties of the post in question is the minimum necessary to enable him, and health authorities, to discharge effectively their obligations to the public.  He is, however, prepared to examine the matter afresh in the light of any further considerations which your Association may wish to bring forward.  He regrets that, because of his many commitments over the next few months, he will not find it possible to receive the proposed deputation in the immediately foreseeable future, but he would suggest that the question might profitably be explored further at an informal meeting between a small deputation from your Association and officers of his Department. If the Association agrees with that suggestion, a meeting can be arranged at any time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the duty numbered (xiii), the Minister has asked me to point out that this applies only to a person sent by the local authority &ldquo;for examination and report&rdquo;.  The attendance of the person for this purpose must, in the Minister's view, clearly imply that person's consent to the furnishing of the report.  Consequently, he cannot accept that, in reporting, the officer is being obliged to do anything contrary to the wishes of the patient or involving breach of medical secrecy.  The principle <Col N="507" /> of requiring medical examination and report is well established in everyday practice, e.g. in relation to applications for employment or for life insurance purposes, and the Minister is unable to appreciate that there is any difference in principle in the discharge of this duty by the officer concerned and the furnishing of a report by any other examining doctor in the circumstances mentioned. If, however, there are other considerations which the Minister may have overlooked, this matter also might be considered at the suggested meeting.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise, le meas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the senseless suggestions which were made by Deputy Dillon in his speech last Wednesday, I should like to call particular attention again to the following passages from that letter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; that is to say the Minister, &ldquo;is, however, prepared to examine the matter afresh in the light of any further considerations which your Association may wish to bring forward. He regrets that, because of his many commitments over the next few months, he will not find it possible to receive the proposed deputation in the immediately foreseeable future, but he would suggest that the question might profitably be explored further at an informal meeting between a small deputation from your Association and officers of his Department.  If the Association agrees with that suggestion, a meeting can be arranged at any time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>and</i>
    </P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, however, there are other considerations which the Minister may have overlooked, this matter also might be considered at the suggested meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been charged against me that I have treated the Executive of the I.M.A. with discourtesy, that I have been cavalier in dealing with their representations.  Quite the contrary has been, in fact, the case as these passages prove.  Until the I.M.A. deliberately and without any justification whatsoever, broke off all relations, <Col N="508" /> every communication from that body received my personal attention and was courteously replied to.</P>
    <P>Moreover, at all times, as the letter shows, my most experienced officers, from the Secretary of the Department downwards, were at the disposal of the representatives of the Irish Medical Association for the discussion of any matter of sufficient moment as in my opinion as Minister would justify a demand on the limited time of these exceedingly busy men.</P>
    <P>In this particular case not only was a reasoned reply sent to the I.M.A.'s letter, but the Association was invited to send representatives to discuss what modifications, if any, could be made in the duties in order to reconcile the views of the Association with the minimum requirements of the Minister. The suggested meeting took place on 31st May, 1957.  At it the representatives of the I.M.A. admitted that the problem was a difficult one.  Certain possibilities of amending the duties to make them more acceptable were examined and discussed; and, as a result, a revised statement of the duty to which the major objection had been expressed was drafted and put in a letter to the Association on the 9th August, 1957.  The Association replied, under date 8th November, 1957, some three months later, to the effect that the duty even in its amended form was unacceptable.  The reply, moreover, went on to say that if the duty were not cancelled, publication of the correspondence in the Irish Medical Journal would be a regretted necessity.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this first flourish of the Association's cudgel, I had the temerity to address myself again to the question, and, in the hope that I might persuade its objectors to revert to the attitude of reason and goodwill which they had adopted towards my predecessor, I sent a further letter on 9th December, 1957.  In it were set out in detail the reasons why as Minister for Health I must prescribe the duty, or something very close to it for all medical, surgical and similar appointments of consultant status in the health service.  In an endeavour to meet the views of the Association, however, I proposed to amend the already amended version of the duty, as it had <Col N="509" /> been prescribed by my predecessor, by whittling it down still further to the irreducible minimum that would serve the public requirements.</P>
    <P>That letter was virtually the last of the correspondence which I had with the Association on this matter.  It set out fully the reasons which make the duty, as I have said, an indispensable condition and is an essential portion of the record.  I must ask the indulgence of the House while I quote it in full.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Health to refer to previous correspondence and discussions regarding No. 12 of the Duties prescribed for the office of Obstetrician/Gynaecologist at the Galway Regional Hospital.  The duty as drafted was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To give to any person (being a registered medical practitioner) authorised by the health authority or the Minister, when requested, the clinical details respecting any person who is or has been under his care in the hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to assure your Association that he agrees with the view that, normally, the relations between a doctor and his patient should remain confidential and that there should be no breach of this confidential relationship, without the consent of the patient, save for the most compelling reasons related to the public good. This, of course, is already accepted in the case of infectious diseases where failure on the part of the patient's doctor to notify the disease might have far-reaching consequences from the public health point of view.</P>
    <P>When a deputation from the Association discussed the duty in question with officers of this Department on 31st May last, it was explained that the circumstances in which compliance with the terms of the duty might normally be invoked were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in the investigation of a complaint by a patient, made <Col N="510" /> either to the health authority or to the Minister;</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the investigation of a complaint made by a seemingly responsible person in relation to the treatment of a particular patient or patients; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  in a general investigation of the work of the officer where, from observation in the course of an inspection, the Medical Inspector had reason to believe that the officer was neglecting or otherwise failing in his obligations to his patients generally.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances at (i) above it seemed to be accepted that there could be no objection to the duty as drafted, since in complaining, the patient, <i>prima facie,</i> gave his consent to full investigation and disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances at (ii) or (iii) above, the patient or patients might be unaware that the doctor was regarded by anybody as being remiss in his treatment.  If, in the course of the necessary investigation, it was necessary to approach one or more patients for their consent to the disclosure of information, a presumption would immediately be created in their minds, however carefully the approach was made, that there was some neglect or dereliction on the part of the doctor and, even if they could be assured later, following investigation, that there was no such neglect or dereliction, a suspicion would remain in many cases, with consequent injury to the reputation of the doctor and of the hospital.  The deputation appeared to appreciate that point.</P>
    <P>It was conceded by the official side in the course of the discussion that local circumstances might make it undesirable that a medical officer of the health authority should pursue an investigation in the absence of the consent of the patient to the disclosure of information and that the duty should be amended appropriately.  The amended draft of the duty already forwarded to the Association made such amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The net point at issue, therefore, appears to be the right of the Minister's Medical Inspector to pursue his investigation in relation to particular patients in the absence of the consent of the patients to the disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given the most careful and sympathetic consideration to this point.  As the Association appreciates, the Minister's responsibility to the Oireachtas requires him to ensure the highest level of service is given by all officers of health authorities, including medical officers, in respect of whom he is the appropriate Minister and his concern is to ensure that he will be in a position to discharge that responsibility in a manner which is fair to the officer concerned, to the service to which the officer belongs, to the patients concerned and to the public generally.</P>
    <P>In a further effort to meet the genuine difficulty which the deputation agreed exists, the Minister suggests that, in the case of an investigation by one of his Medical Inspectors, the hospital doctor concerned will be entitled to refuse to supply clinical details of any patient in the absence of the consent of the patient unless there is produced to him a certificate from the Minister that the public interest requires the supply of the information without the consent of the patient.  The duty as revised would read as follows:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;To furnish the clinical details regarding any person who is or has been under his care in the hospital, to a registered medical practitioner authorised by the health authority or the Minister on request, on production of the written consent of the person (or the written consent of the person's representative or next-of-kin) or, in the case of a registered medical practitioner authorised by the Minister, the Minister's certificate that it would not be in the public interest to seek such consent.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister trusts that your Association will find it possible to <Col N="512" /> accept the foregoing revision, which is the outcome of the most anxious consideration by him of the problem in an effort to meet the point of view of the Association.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise, le meas,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Dáil will note and appreciate how clearly this letter established that, in order to avoid doing unjustifiable harm to the reputation of the medical, surgical or other specialist concerned and the hospital to which he happened to be attached, it might be essential, in certain special circumstances, for the clinical details of a patient's case to be furnished to a duly authorised medical practitioner, without such patient's consent.  It will be noted too that this was an aspect of the matter which the representatives of the I.M.A. with whom it had been discussed, before the letter issued, also appeared to appreciate.  It remained, therefore, to define what these special circumstances might be.  The letter set out how I proposed to define them. Clearly I was restricting them to the narrowest possible field, to wit, the service of the public interest as certified by the Minister for Health; but strictly within the limitation that the information was necessary to enable him to discharge his responsibility to the Oireachtas and to the people for the care and treatment of all those who avail themselves of the health services.</P>
    <P>There was nothing new in imposing a duty to furnish clinical details when the public interest required it.  My immediate predecessor and all those before him had prescribed this duty for certain posts.  Apart from this, however, there is not an inquest held at which clinical details are not given in open court, often by the medical attendant of the deceased, whether the next-of-kin agrees or not.  Nor was there anything new in requiring doctors in the health service to recognise that the service of the public interest must be an over-riding consideration in this matter.  Dispensary doctors have been required for very many years to keep a register in which are entered not only the names of their individual dispensary patients, but clinical details relating to them, and they are bound <Col N="513" /> to make this register available to the authorised Medical Inspector when called upon to do so.  Furthermore, as the letter pointed out in relation to infectious diseases, the over-riding weight of the public interest is accepted by all medical practitioners, whether in the public service or in private practice, as justifying the notification of the clinical details of all cases of such diseases to the appropriate authority.  And if this disclosure can be made in the case of an infectious disease, or in the case of dispensary patients, why may it not be done in the case of a hospital patient, if it is necessary to do so, in order that the Minister for Health may be able to satisfy himself in the first instance, and the Oireachtas, if called upon, as to whether there was wilful or culpable negligence in the treatment of such a patient.</P>
    <P>But whatever view we may take of this argument, surely the fact remains that if the argument were not accepted, if it could be refuted, the letter in which it was stated with such care and clarity required an answer.  Beyond a formal acknowledgment that the communication had been duly received no answer to it has been forthcoming, even to this day.  The letter has remained unanswered, because it is unanswerable.  It had clearly established the necessity for the duty to which exception had been taken. But the fact that the need for the duty had been established did not suit the book of the dominant element within the I.M.A.</P>
    <P>Their plans demanded that a local dispute with the Minister for Health should be fomented, forced and kept alive until the moment set by them for a complete rupture arrived.  It was necessary, therefore, to render my letter of the 9th December, 1957, ineffective in so far as it might affect the views of members of the Association, to kill it in short.  This was done with exquisite craftiness and most resourceful chicanery which did not baulk even at a stupendous lie to accomplish its purpose.  Having made that charge against the Chairman, the holder of the combined offices of Honorary Treasurer and Honorary Secretary and certain members of the Council of the <Col N="514" /> Association for the year 1957/58, I shall now set out to prove it.</P>
    <P>I shall begin by detailing how, as recorded in the official Journal of the Association, my letter was dealt with, and I would ask the Dáil to follow the record carefully.</P>
    <P>According to the I.M.A. Journal for February, 1958, the letter of 9th December, 1957, was considered at a meeting of the Central Council of the I.M.A. held on 9th January, 1958, at which, in the words of the official report &ldquo;divided opinions were expressed&rdquo; and consideration of it was postponed to the next Council meeting and in the meantime it was decided to obtain the views of branches.</P>
    <P>In its April issue the Journal recorded that the letter, dated 9th December, 1957, was again considered &ldquo;with&rdquo;&mdash;I quote&mdash;&ldquo;the replies of those Branches who had responded to a request that they should give their views on the letter.  After a long discussion, in which divided opinions were expressed, it was decided that the Executive Committee should arrange to set up a Committee consisting of trained experts in theology and members of the I.M.A. to investigate the ethical questions involved.&rdquo;  Perhaps such a Committee as is here referred to was set up.  I do not know.  I have been unable to trace any subsequent reference to it.  But the mention of it at least gave the impression that the Minister's letter was receiving the serious consideration, I quote, &ldquo;of trained experts in theology&rdquo;, who without doubt it was hoped would be able to demolish his arguments in due course.  Doubtless the members, the majority of whom, the Secretary of the I.M.A. has told us so frequently, are simple and guileless, were content with this; and so the plotters were able to keep the pot simmering, without boiling over until the chosen moment arrived.</P>
    <P>We then move on to the month of June, when the Annual Report of the Council of the I.M.A. for 1957/8 was published in the Journal.  Under the heading &ldquo;Professional Secrecy&rdquo;, this Report stated that &ldquo;negotiations are still proceeding with the Department of Health on the question of professional <Col N="515" /> secrecy&rdquo;.  Will Deputies please note that statement?  It is the lie to which I have referred, an utter and shameful and cynical falsehood.  No negotiations were then in progress; nor had any negotiations taken place subsequent to my letter of 9th December, 1957.  In fact, as the House now knows, beyond a formal acknowledgment of its receipt, at that date no reply whatever had been received to the letter of the 9th December, 1957.  And no reply has been received since except what I shall now detail.</P>
    <P>On the 22nd November, 1958, that is almost a full year after I had sent to the Irish Medical Association a reasoned and courteous statement of my case, the following notice&mdash;the &ldquo;Important Notice&rdquo;, as the Association has designated it&mdash;appeared in all the daily papers:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;IRISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Medical Practitioners are requested not to apply for, or accept, the following positions:</P>
    <P>Surgeon, County Hospital, Bantry;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Laois County Council;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Monaghan County Council;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Sligo County Council;</P>
    <P>without first communicating with the above Association at 10, Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the same day the following letter, dated 21st November, 1958, was received in the Department of Health from the Irish Medical Association:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>My Association have studied the conditions, terms of appointment and salary for the positions of&mdash;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, County Hospital, Bantry;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Laois County Council;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Monaghan County Council;</P>
    <P>Surgeon, Sligo County Council;</P>
    <P>and have decided that they cannot recommend these appointments to their members.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Sgd.) Noel O'Reilly,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Medical Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it will be observed that the authors of this letter did not deign to <Col N="516" /> indicate the conditions and terms of appointment to which objection was taken.  Even to this day I have not been informed officially of them, though I have ascertained them through another channel.  I am sure that the House will note that the persons responsible for this gross discourtesy are those who squeal and complain because in my capacity as Minister I will not suffer such an affront.  I was left to learn the grounds on which the I.M.A. sought to justify its arbitrary, unjustified and unjustifiable action from a letter kindly sent to me by a correspondent who had communicated with the Association as requested.  In view of the repeated assertions by the Association that this notice to communicate with it, is not the equivalent of a ban, the opening paragraph of that letter is revealing.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>In answer to your enquiry concerning the recent County Surgeon posts for Bantry, Laois, Monaghan and Sligo, the Executive Council of the I.M.A. at the request of the County Surgeons' Group, examined the conditions of employment and salary scales offered.  As a result of this examination the Executive Committee decided that the conditions and salary scales were unacceptable to the Association and, accordingly, advised members not to apply or if they had applied to withdraw.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is only an advice and not a direction.  But those who recall the treatment which was meted out by certain members of the I.M.A. at the instance of their Council, to the distinguished surgeon who filled the breach in Mallow after the removal of the County Surgeon there, will know that when that letter was written in December, 1958, the advice could only be ignored at one's peril. That, of course, is no longer the case. Public opinion, outraged by the attitude of the Council in the Mallow case, has seen to that.</P>
    <P>The grounds for objection by the Association to the posts in question, <Col N="517" /> as stated in that letter, may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Two of the duties, alleged to infringe &ldquo;medical secrecy&rdquo; were unacceptable on ethical grounds; and</P>
    <P>(b)  The salary was inadequate because the middle income group had become entitled to hospital and specialist services (that group was being extended to include persons with incomes up to £800) and the limitations on private practice and fees were contrary to Section 25 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>The House, when it recalls the reports which I have cited as appearing in the issues of the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> for February, April and June of 1958, of the discussions on this matter of &ldquo;professional secrecy&rdquo; will be surprised that the I.M.A. executive had the hardihood to provoke a quarrel with the Minister for Health on such an issue.  Thus when the Central Council discussed the matter in January, 1958, we know from the I.M.A. journal &ldquo;divided opinions were expressed&rdquo; and consideration of it was postponed to the next Council meeting.  In March, 1958, when the views of the branches were discussed at length, it was again reported that &ldquo;divided opinions were expressed and it was decided to set up a Committee of trained experts in theology and members of the I.M.A. to investigate the ethical questions involved&rdquo;.  That has been a lengthy investigation.  It would appear, indeed, not to have reached finality, for so far no results of the investigation have been published. It must be that once again &ldquo;divided opinions&rdquo; have been expressed; or it even may be that the duties as framed by my predecessor and as revised by myself were held not to be objectionable on ethical grounds.</P>
    <P>Good grounds for this surmise are afforded in the notice which the I.M.A. sent to me on the 21st November, 1958, and which I have already read to the Dáil.  In that letter for the first time the question of salary attaching to the banned posts was raised.  I suggest that the reason for raising it then was that it was found <Col N="518" /> that after my letter of a year earlier, &ldquo;professional secrecy&rdquo; was a cock that would not fight.  So the break with the Fianna Fáil Minister for Health, which was now due and timely, had to be forced on another issue, that of salary.</P>
    <P>But whether it be on the issue of &ldquo;professional secrecy&rdquo; or on the issue of salary what does a faction within the Irish Medical Association, a faction within this &ldquo;house divided&rdquo;, as I may properly describe the I.M.A. to have been, take upon itself to procure in November, 1958, and what has it been endeavouring to procure ever since, even in this month of June, 1961?  Nothing less than a complete breakdown in the health services of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has tried to persuade the House that the poor and the sick are suffering because of disorganisation of the health services.  There is no foundation whatever for that suggestion. The plan of this clique within the Association to bring about such disorganisation has failed.  The services have not broken down, nor have they been disorganised except for one very brief period following the removal of the County Surgeon in Mallow. Except for that short time and in relation to that hospital, not one patient can be said to have suffered because of the action of the I.M.A.  Every skill that was available at any time for the treatment of the sick in our local authority hospitals and our dispensaries is there in undiminished measure to-day and just as devotedly at the service of the patients.</P>
    <P>But if those responsible for this &ldquo;Important Notice&rdquo;, those responsible for this ban, had their way, were able to enforce their boycott, that would not be the case.  Patients might die, people might perish, but the men who have chosen to embark the Association on this wrong-headed course might be as perverse as ever.</P>
    <P>I have already told the Dáil that the first of the posts in the local health services which the I.M.A. endeavoured to proscribe were those of County Surgeon.  The ban on these posts was imposed on 22nd November, 1958.  It was followed by other bans in rapid <Col N="519" /> succession.  The post of County Physician was banned on 6th December, 1958, and that of Obstetrician-Gynaecologist in Waterford Regional Hospital on 22nd January, 1959. Previously on 8th January, 1959, the Central Council of the Association had passed a resolution refusing to cooperate in giving effect to the Health and Mental Treatment Act, 1958, but this resolution was subsequently rescinded.  The &ldquo;march of the bans&rdquo; reached its climax when, on 23rd May, 1959, all resident and non-resident medical posts in local authority hospitals were banned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Dáil to note the dates on which the several bans were imposed.  They bear a remarkable relation&mdash;too remarkable to be merely coincidental&mdash;to the development of certain political events.  The first ban, that on county surgeon posts, was imposed on 22nd November, 1958, and came very closely after 12th of that month, when the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was introduced in Dáil Éireann.  The Second Stage of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill was taken over the period from 25th November to 16th December, 1958.  The second I.M.A. ban, that on county physician posts, was announced on the 6th December and fitted in very nicely with these Dáil proceedings. The Committee Stage of the Constitution Bill opened in Dáil Éireann on the 8th January and ended on the 21st January, 1959, and on the 22nd January, 1959, the third ban fell on the post of obstetrician-gynaecologist.</P>
    <P>On 19th May, 1959, nominations for the office of President closed; and on 17th June the polls in the Presidential Election and on the Referendum to amend the Constitution were taken. The esoteric circle which, I think, runs the I.M.A. apparently thought it expedient to intervene again and so, using the removal of the Mallow county surgeon as an excuse, they imposed, as I have mentioned, a comprehensive ban on all resident and non-resident medical posts in local authority hospitals. In doing that, however, they went too far.  They outraged an overwhelming majority of the profession, <Col N="520" /> and as a result of the widespread indignation expressed this ban was quietly abandoned once the Referendum had been taken and the Presidential Election was over.</P>
    <P>Looking back over these events, as I have faithfully and accurately detailed them, who can doubt that from the very day on which a member of the Fianna Fáil Party took office as Minister for Health on March 20th, 1957, a group within the I.M.A. were determined to provoke a dispute between him and the Association.  They laid their plans carefully and astutely. First, they opened this issue of &ldquo;medical secrecy&rdquo;, an issue on which they found no ground for quarrel with my predecessor.  Then they carried on negotiations with me, through my officers, ostensibly in an endeavour to reach agreement on the matter.  When I had gone as far as I could to meet them, by amending the duty in the way set out in my official letter of the 9th December, 1957, they pretended to give serious consideration to the acceptance of the duty in its new form.</P>
    <P>The letter in which the amended duty was set out was discussed at the meeting of the Council on 9th January, 1958.  It was then circulated to the branches and discussed again by the Council on 13th March, when it was decided to set up a committee with the help of theological experts to consider it.  It was a wonder they did not refer it to the Holy See.  It was again referred to in the annual report of the Council for 1957/58, when the members of the Association were informed falsely that negotiations were proceeding.</P>
    <P>It was then put into cold storage.  I heard nothing more about the matter. No one else heard anything more about it, until the opening of the debate on the most critical and important political issue to be put before the people since the Constitution of 1937. The issue was then taken out of cold storage, warmed up, and used as an excuse to ban one important medical post after another.  The purpose for which these bans were imposed in this dispute was quite clear.  They were imposed in order that the doctors of Ireland might be led to believe that <Col N="521" /> their profession would not get justice from a Fianna Fáil Minister.  The end in view, of course, was that in their resentment doctors would use their votes and influence against the Fianna Fáil Party.  No doubt many of them were influenced by the political chicanery of their leaders to do this.</P>
    <P>On the other issue, that which was raised at the eleventh hour, and without any prior notice whatever, that of salary, events as they transpired manifested clearly that this was being used merely as further excuse for the row which certain persons in the Association wished to provoke.  In the Dáil, in reply to Questions and in statements in the course of debates, in the Press and elsewhere, I pointed out, time and time again, that I had no authority of any kind to negotiate with the officers of local authority health services behind the backs of their employers. I stressed that under the County Management Act, 1955, it was essential that all such negotiations must be with the representatives of the appropriate health authorities, in the first instance. It could not, in fact, be otherwise, since every officer of a health authority who is aggrieved by the action of his authority in relation to his salary and conditions of employment has the right to appeal to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was otherwise in my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That right would be an illusory one, if the appeal to the Minister were nothing more than an appeal against a settlement which the Minister himself had previously made. But with an obduracy which would be incredible, if it had not actually shown itself, the stiff-necked members of the Council refused to accept the legal position, as I put it clearly before them.  Law or no law, County Management Act and Trade Union Act, notwithstanding, they would negotiate with the Minister and with no one else.  These nabobs of the Council were too high and mighty to discuss the claims of their members in the local authority service with the county managers who by law represent and are entitled to act for the individual health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> This attitude was maintained by the Irish Medical Association for almost two years.  Then rank and file members of the Association took matters into their own hands.  Dispensary doctors, county surgeons, county physicians, and county medical officers of health met the county managers and discussed their problems with them.  As a result, proposals for increases in the salaries of all these groups were submitted to the local authorities concerned, and I am glad to say were accepted in most cases by the representatives of the ratepayers without too much demur.</P>
    <P>Where a local authority decided not to concede the full terms which had been generally accepted elsewhere, the officers aggrieved by that decision appealed to me, with, I think, satisfactory results.  Where, as in the case of the post of assistant county medical officer of health, the holder of a post appealed to me on the grounds that the new scales proposed for that class were inadequate, having considered the matter very carefully, I came to the conclusion in the case of assistant county medical officers that the appeal was well-founded, and decided accordingly.  Need I emphasise that I should not have been in a position to exercise these appellate functions, if I had negotiated on these questions with any organisation, I.M.A., or otherwise, beforehand?</P>
    <P>The position now is that by their competing for the posts which the I.M.A. endeavoured to proscribe, by accepting such posts when selected for them, progressive, highly qualified and greatly skilled physicians, surgeons and obstetricians have demonstrated that the Council of the I.M.A. is not the keeper of their conscience.  I am certain that these upright, conscientious Irishmen in no way violated their conscience or eschewed any moral obligation when they agreed to accept the duty which my predecessors and I attached to the posts which they hold, the duty which was made an excuse for the deliberately engineered estrangement between the I.M.A. and myself.  The ban has been shown to be ineffective.  It should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The salary issues have been negotiated <Col N="523" /> with those who have the statutory authority to negotiate them, new scales have been drawn up and are now in force.  I do not claim that they go the whole way to meet the claims of the profession&mdash;that is an ideal which is not likely to be attained in this country or anywhere else&mdash;but they are a considerable improvement on the old scales.  From the point of view of those immediately affected, the pity is that they were not in force earlier.  But I am not responsible for that.  Many times, during the course of this miserable controversy, I indicated my sympathy with the claims of the profession.  But so long as those who claimed to speak for the profession would not go the right way to secure redress, so long indeed as they were able to dissuade their members from going about it in this way, I could do nothing.  Once the rank and file saw the common-sense of it and took matters into their own hands, the rest, so far as I was concerned, was easy.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is now clear that the issue on which this dispute was opened, has been decided.  The obligation to furnish clinical information relating to a patient when the public interest so demands remains as an integral part of the duty of holders of certain posts in the health service and, so far as I can foresee, will so remain.  It is for those who purported to want it otherwise, to face this fact and in the light of it to determine what their attitude towards the Minister for Health and their relations with him are going to be.  I have nothing more to say on the matter.  I am not going to flog the dead horse of this controversy further.</P>

The reason I mention this matter in relation to an obligation to divulge information with regard to patients is that it was, for as long as I was Minister for Health, a matter of grave objection raised to me <Col N="529" /> by the Irish Medical Association.

      <P>I am discussing the terms, conditions and duties of the resident physician and governor. Provision is made in the Vote for the payment of salary to the resident physician and governor.  I take it I am entitled to discuss the duties of his office, the conditions applying to that office and matters of that kind.  I was referring to whether or not he is under an obligation to provide to the Minister or to anyone else clinical information which he has obtained as a doctor in relation to patients within that hospital.  The reason I want to refer to that matter and want that matter dealt with by the Minister in concluding this debate is that it was a matter raised with me on many occasions by the Irish Medical Association. I had to consider it very carefully. I considered it in relation to the different posts for which I was, as the present Minister is, responsible.  I was unable to find a formula which would completely reconcile the interest of the employer of a medical officer and his obligation in relation to secrecy, so far as his patient was concerned. I was compelled to specify in relation to all these posts the obligation to provide reasonable information.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Would the Minister subside then and let me proceed? It does appear that the objection was renewed to the Minister and apparently no solution was found.  The Minister has been pleased to suggest that the renewal of this objection by the Irish Medical Association was because he was a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party and that it was not put forward because I, when I was Minister, was a Fine Gael Minister. That suggestion is absurd.  In any dealings I had with regard to this matter, I met, as the Minister knows well, prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were amongst the leaders of the Irish Medical Association.  I found them reasonable men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with this Bill will have given Deputies a comprehensive outline of the proposals in it.  As explained in the memorandum, the main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the decision of the Government, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 19th April last, to grant&mdash;as from 1st August next&mdash;increases in the rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions, of unemployment assistance, and of the <Col N="532" /> married person's allowance in the scheme of old age (contributory) pensions.  The second important object of the Bill, also adverted to by the Minister for Finance, is the introduction of substantial concessions in regard to the means conditions for the receipt of Unemployment Assistance.</P>
      <P>Apart from these matters arising from the Budget Statement, the opportunity offered by the Bill is being taken to bring in a number of other amendments of the law which experience has shown to be either desirable or necessary.  Two of those amendments relate to the non-contributory scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions and provide respectively for a relaxation in relation to the assessment of means in certain cases and for an easement in the residence condition for the receipt of widow's pension. Other amendments proposed are designed to clarify the law in relation to the powers of deciding officers under the Social Welfare Acts, and to repeal an inoperative provision in the Old Age Pensions Acts.  The remaining provisions of the Bill are concerned with strengthening the law in relation to abuses and to the recovery of overpayments of pension, assistance and benefits.  I shall explain these various provisions in greater detail later.</P>
      <P>In the first place, then, the Bill, giving effect to the increase announced in the Budget, provides for an increase of one shilling and sixpence per week in all non-contributory old age and blind pensions; the new rates of these pensions will thus be 30/-, 25/-, 20/- and 15/- a week, according to the means category of the pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the increases in rates of unemployment assistance, recipients themselves will get an increase of 1/6d. a week also, and they will in addition get the same extra amount for an adult dependant.  Furthermore, if the recipient has dependent children, the Bill provides for an increase of 1/- each for the first and second child and for an increase of 1/6d. a week for the third and each subsequent child.  Accordingly, a man who is on unemployment assistance and who has a wife and four dependent children <Col N="533" /> will get an extra 8/- a week as from the 1st August next, while a man with a wife and six children will receive a total increase of 11/- a week as from that date.  As I shall explain in due course, these increases in unemployment assistance rates will be augmented somewhat in certain cases as a result of the proposed easing of the means conditions for that scheme.</P>
    <P>Widows' non-contributory pensions will also be increased by 1/6d. on the personal rate, by 1/- for each of the first two qualified children, and by 1/6d. for each subsequent qualified child.  A non-contributory widow pensioner with four qualified children, therefore, will receive a weekly increase of 6/6d. in her pension.</P>
    <P>A contributory old age pensioner who receives an allowance in respect of a spouse will also benefit.  At present, the allowance for a wife or dependent husband which is contained in the old age contributory pension equals the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension, and this allowance normally continues to be payable as a benefit to the surviving spouse of a deceased pensioner. Payment of the allowance, or of the survivor's benefit, disqualifies the spouse for receiving a non-contributory old age pension.  As the maximum non-contributory old age pension is being increased from 28/6d. to 30/- it is necessary to increase the dependant's allowance and survivor's benefit correspondingly, in order to preserve the existing parity and to prevent anomaly.  This charge will bring the contributory old age pension and allowance, for a married couple entitled to the maximum rate, up to £3. 10.0. a week.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increases in pensions and in assistance payments which I have outlined, the Bill proposes to make other substantial concessions on the unemployment assistance side, and to make some desirable relaxations in relation to certain aspects of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  With regard to unemployment assistance, there are, as things stand, two yearly means limits for participation in the scheme&mdash;a limit of <Col N="534" /> £72. 16.0. which applies in rural areas and a limit of £98. 16.0. which applies in urban areas.  Under Section 8 of the Bill a single yearly means limit of £100 will, from the 1st August next, apply throughout the State.</P>
    <P>I might say here that the means test for unemployment assistance is essentially a rural problem, affecting, in the main, smallholders and their families.  The vast majority of applicants for unemployment assistance in urban areas possess little or no means and the means limit is of no practical significance, nor does it constitute any problem, so far as those people are concerned.  This is because the income of urban applicants is usually confined to their earnings from employment and such earnings do not, of course, count as means for unemployment assistance purposes.  On the other hands, rural applicants frequently have means derived from the occupation of land. Therefore, as I have said, the problem is essentially rural.</P>
    <P>The effect of the introduction of the new means limit will be to bring within the scope of the scheme additional numbers of persons in rural areas, mainly smallholders, with means ranging from £72 16s. 0. to £100 a year, who by reason of their means, are not at present eligible for any unemployment assistance.  It is estimated that the number of persons who will thus be brought into the scheme will be up to 1,200,apart from their dependants. These additional beneficiaries&mdash;when regard is had to their means, to the new maximum rates of unemployment assistance and to the further concession I am just about to refer to&mdash;will qualify for payment of assistance at rates ranging from 18/6d. a week downwards, plus 2/6d. a week for each dependent child after the second such child.</P>
    <P>The other concessionary provision affecting unemployment assistance is in Section 9 and proposes to increase the amount of assessed weekly means which is disregarded in determining the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable in any particular case. At present, only the first 1/- of means is so disregarded.  In future, the disregarded amount of assessed weekly <Col N="535" /> means will be 2/- in the case of a person without a dependant and will be 5/- where the person has a dependant. Deputies will have noticed that in easing this condition of the scheme I have made a distinction between persons without dependants and persons with dependants.  The House, I am sure, will welcome this innovation in favour of the person with family commitments. The concession will be of value to applicants with means and it will enable many recipients&mdash;approximately 16,000 at peak periods&mdash;to qualify for higher rates of unemployment assistance than heretofore, and, as I have said it will be especially beneficial to those who have large families.</P>
    <P>The increase in the amount of weekly means disregarded will, of course, operate in addition to the increases in the rates of unemployment assistance provided for in Section 3 of the Bill. The effect of the improvement in the disregard will be to increase still further, by a 1/- a week for a person without a dependant, and by 4/- for a person who has a dependant, the rates of unemployment assistance payable where the assessed weekly means exceed 1/- and 4/- respectively.  Taking this in conjunction with the increase in the rates, the combined result, in the case of a man with a wife and four children, with means in excess of 4/- a week, will be that he will receive a total increase of 12/- a week in his unemployment assistance as from 1st August next, while a man with a wife and six children, with more than 4/- a week means, will get a total increase of 15/- a week as from the same date.</P>
    <P>I made passing reference earlier to concessions provided for in the Bill in relation to widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions.  One of these is similar to that introduced last year by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, in relation to non-contributory old age pensions, and concerns widows or orphans who may be in receipt of small statutory pensions from some other source, for example, from another Government.  It sometimes happens under existing legislation that a small increase <Col N="536" /> granted in the pension from the other source can cause a greater decrease in the widow's or orphan's pension payable by my Department, the net result being that the pensioner's total income is reduced.  Section 15 of the Bill will ensure that such net losses of income do not occur in future.</P>
    <P>In Section 11, an alteration is made, in favour of claimants, in the residence condition for widow's pension. As the law stands, a widow is disqualified for receipt of non-contributory widow's pension unless she has been resident in the State during the period of two years immediately preceding the date of her claim.  A widow who has been absent from the country cannot, therefore, qualify for a pension until two years after her return unless, of course, she was in receipt of the pension at the time of her departure. I think this condition is unduly strict and a cause of hardship in some cases. Under the altered condition proposed in the Bill, two years' residence here, at any time, will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the group of amendments framed to improve and strengthen social welfare legislation generally. Some doubts have arisen as to the correct interpretation of Section 42 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, in regard to the power of deciding officers appointed under that Act to decide whether a person is or was in insurable employment, and to give decisions in respect of past events in relation to other matters arising under that section. An amendment of the section, designed to put these matters beyond doubt, is therefore included in the Bill. There is a provision in the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908 for the making of regulations providing for notice to be given by registrars of births and deaths to pension officers or local pension committees, of the deaths of persons over seventy years of age.  The provision has never operated in this country, and is now being repealed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the remaining provisions is to remove obstacles and to strengthen and improve the law in relation to abuses and to the recovery of overpayments of pension, assistance or benefit.  When the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, <Col N="537" /> was before the House last year, I referred to the fact that the State is at the loss of considerable sums of money every year as a result of fraudulent claims to non-contributory old age pensions and false statements as to means.  That Act went some way towards strengthening the law in this respect.  The present Bill similarly contains a number of provisions which will, it is hoped, help in the first place to discourage people from making fraudulent claims and giving false information in relation to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims.</P>
    <P>Of all the social insurance and assistance services administered by my Department fraud is most commonly experienced in relation to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. Special provisions to reinforce administrative measures against fraud and so help in reducing it to the minimum are being introduced.  Anyone who is convicted in court of fraud in relation to an unemployment benefit claim will, apart from any penalty the court may impose, be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit for six months from the date of the conviction. Similarly, anyone who is convicted of fraud in relation to an unemployment assistance claim will lose his right to unemployment assistance for six months, in addition to any penalty the court may impose.  If the offence relates to a qualification certificate, the offender, on conviction, will be debarred from obtaining or holding such a certificate for a similar period.</P>
    <P>The maximum fine which can be imposed by the court for offences in relation to unemployment assistance is being increased from £25 to £50, thereby bringing it into line with the limit already in operation in relation to other social welfare services.  Section 58 of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, which deals with offences for which legal proceedings may be instituted, is being strengthened. In future, the concealment of any material fact for the purpose of obtaining or continuing a pension will also be an offence under that section. The House will notice that these provisions, which are contained in Sections 10, 13, 14 and 18, apply only to <Col N="538" /> offences committed on or after the 1st August next.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 12, 17 and 19 of the Bill will facilitate the recovery of money obtained as a result of fraudulent claims to pensions, benefit or assistance. Provision is being made, for example, which will enable current payments of pension to be withheld in recovery of overpayments of old age pension and widows' pension fraudulently received and in respect of which a decree is being sought or has been obtained in court.  Power is also being taken in the Bill to permit an over-payment of benefit, pension or assistance fraudulently received to be recovered by withholding all or part of any benefit, pension or assistance which may subsequently become payable to the claimant.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-contributory old age pension, the right of recovery will extend to payments to which the spouse, widow or widower, as the case may be, of the claimant becomes entitled by way of pension, benefit or assistance.  The Bill will also make it possible for the pension, or benefit or assistance of a third party to be offset, with his consent, against a debt due by someone else on foot of an overpayment of a non-contributory old age pension.  In connection with these various proposals concerning fraud and the recovery of consequential overpayments, I should like to emphasise that the tightening up of the law in this way is aimed only at those claimants who dishonestly get, or attempt to get, public money to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of cost. On the basis of present numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries, the increases in pensions and assistance rates proposed in Sections 2 to 4 of the Bill will cost £768,000 in a full year.  Of this sum £486,000 is in respect of non-contributory old age pensions, £170,000 is in respect of unemployment assistance and £112,000 is in respect of widows' pensions.  In addition, the relaxations in the unemployment assistance means conditions will cost an extra £80,000 a year and the concessions in relation to widows' pensions an extra £1,500.  The total yearly cost of the proposed increases <Col N="539" /> and concessions in social assistance comes therefore to the very substantial sum of £849,500.  The cost in the current financial year, as from the 1st August next, will be £567,000 and this amount will, of course, be additional to the £19 million already provided for in the Book of Estimates for social assistance requirements in the current year.  The increase of 1/6d. in the old age (contributory) pension married person's allowance, which is provided for in Section 5 of the Bill, will be met out of the Social Insurance Fund and will cost in the region of £49,000 in a full year, or £33,000 in the current financial year.  The total cost in the present year is therefore £600,000 as provided for by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on the 19th April last.</P>
    <P>The number of people who will benefit under this Bill is of the order of 220,000&mdash;old people and persons who are blind, widows and their children, and the unemployed and their wives and children.  This is apart altogether from the 200,000 or so men, women and children who received new or extended benefits as from 6th January last under the various contributory schemes administered by my Department.  Most of the beneficiaries will be the same people who had already received an increase as recently as August last year.  In fact, this is the third successive year in which the non-contributory old age and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance rates have been increased.  It constitutes the fourth general increase in the non-contributory assistance schemes since the present Government assumed office in 1957.  Since then, the rate of non-contributory old age pension will, when this Bill takes effect, have been increased by a total of 6/- a week from 24/- to 30/- ; the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to a man with a wife and four children, who resides in an urban area, will have been increased by a total of 19/6d. from 38/- to 57/6d; and the weekly rate of a widow's non-contributory pension payable to a widow with four children will have been increased by a total of 21/- from 36/6d. to 57/6d.</P>

      <Col N="540" /> It may be instructive to look at the figures which I have just quoted in the light of the movement of the consumer price index during the same period, since the case is not infrequently made that social assistance and benefit rates tend to lag behind increases in the cost of living.  What are the facts?  In mid-February, 1957, the consumer price index stood at 135.  The figure at mid-May, 1961, was 150, an increase of slightly over 11 per cent.  The maximum rate of old age pension provided for in this Bill, however, represents an increase of 25 per cent. since 1957. The improvement is even more striking in the case of the other services covered by the Bill, owing partly to the more liberal approach which has been adopted in relation to child dependants in social welfare schemes generally, by the extension of payments to cover all qualified children and not merely the first two.  The increases as at 1st August next, since 1957, of 19/6d. a week in the unemployment assistance payable to a man with a wife and four children, and of 21/- a week in the rate of non-contributory pension payable to a widow with four children, represent increases of 51 per cent. and almost 60 per cent. respectively, in that period of four years.</P>
    <P>It is with much pleasure that I recommend this measure to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, agree with the provisions in this Bill.  The first criticism I should like to offer is that it has been so long delayed and has taken the Minister so long to introduce it.  On earlier occasions, when indications had been given that it was the intention of the inter-Party Government to assist these classes for whom we cater under the social welfare code, it was made possible, by the introduction of speedy legislation, to implement the provisions governing increases almost immediately. I should like to know, when the Minister comes to reply, why it took this Government so long to introduce this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the closing paragraphs of the Minister's speech there are references which are intended to convey that the people whom it is intended to assist under this measure are so much better <Col N="541" /> off today than they were some years ago.  I said that we agree with the provisions in this Bill.  We agree with them because we think the classes for which it caters are necessitous classes and anything the State can do to come to their assistance to the fullest extent possible within our means is welcome. I am not in harmony with the note struck by the Minister in his closing paragraphs in which he compares the advances made in social welfare benefits&mdash;obviously, he regards these advances as very advantageous to the recipients&mdash;with the increase in the cost of living.  There is no doubt that it is much easier for the State to provide greater benefits for fewer people.</P>
    <P>We have it on record that in the past four years, the period the Minister saw fit to review, there has been unprecedented emigration.  It is, of course, easier to look after the residual unemployed, those who did not leave the country.  We know that many heads of families have emigrated, as have so many others, who could see no future in remaining in the country, and that has relieved the Department of Social Welfare of the obligation of providing unemployment benefits for so many more people.  The escape valve was emigration.  So many availed of that escape that it is much easier for the Department now to give increased benefits to those who come within the ambit of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has seen fit on this occasion to close a loophole. He is taking steps to ensure in this measure that net losses in income will not occur in future when certain increases are given.  We know the glaring injustice that occurred when the cost-of-living increases were given, particularly in the cases of wives of blind persons.  A trifling cost-of-living increase put the recipient outside the category for qualification and the blind pension was withdrawn completely. The net loss in income was, of course, quite substantial, though it was the clear intention of the Government at the time to compensate for the cost-of-living increase.  I am glad there is provision in this measure to meet such a situation in the future. It is regrettable that those who were <Col N="542" /> affected in the past will not be able to seek redress under this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that this increase constitutes the fourth general increase in non-contributory assistance since the Government assumed office in 1957 and the rate of non-contributory old age pension will, when this Bill comes into operation, have been increased by a total of 6/- per week.  That may be regarded in some circumstances as a reasonable increase.  However, it is at the general situation we must look.  We have the gratification of knowing that, in consequence of our accession to Government in 1948 and having discovered &mdash;we had, of course, been aware of the position&mdash;that the rate of old age pension then was 12/6d. a week, by the time we left office, it had increased to 24/- per week.</P>
    <P>The House will recall a private motion, which was defeated by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947, seeking a much smaller increase.  We were informed at the time that the country could not afford that increase.  Within a matter of months, and having removed certain penal taxation which had been imposed, the inter-Party Government found the first charge upon them was looking after the weakest sections of the community.  In consequence of their action then, there was a steady improvement in the lot of the old age pensioners.  They were removed from the necessity of appearing before the relieving officer and declaring themselves as paupers in order to secure 2/6d. in the old age pension. When we left office, the old age pension had increased from 12/6d. to 24/- per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared to take solace from the fact that the average increase in the cost-of-living figure, which he asserts is in the region of slightly over 11 per cent., can be compared with an increase of 25 per cent. in benefits.  I can recall when the Minister sat on these benches.  I can remember his being very critical of the method of compilation of the cost-of-living index figure and of the fact that, included in its compilation, were many items very far from being associated with the way of living of those who are <Col N="543" /> charge on the State through the dium of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that far from its being the fact that there was merely an increase of 11 per cent. in the cost of living index figure, in the period to which the Minister referred, the cost of the basic diet of these people, bread and butter, has increased, bread by 40 per cent. and butter by 30 per cent.? There has been this formidable increase in the cost of the basic diet of the people whom the Minister represents as having been so well looked after.  It was the Minister who introduced the cost of living index figure into this debate.  Deputies on all sides of the House know that bread and butter represent the normal staple diet of these classes and the fact is that the price of a loaf of bread today is 61/2d. more than it was before this golden era, according to the Minister, opened up and the lb. of butter is 10d. dearer. I am adverting to the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister when referring to the assistance given to the old age pensioner, did not mention that in the Budget under which that assistance was to be afforded, he imposed a tax on the old age pensioner's plug of tobacco, which did not await this late day of implementation.  Old age pensioners have been paying the increased tax on their tobacco since the Budget but they had to wait until now for the benefits it is now proposed to give them.</P>
    <P>It is with these criticisms that we welcome this Bill as we would welcome any Bill designed to ease the lot of these sections of our community who are dependent upon us for assistance. We consider that the evil was done when the food subsidies were withdrawn and the cost of living deliberately raised by Government action. This is merely a further chapter in the unfortunate tragedy consequent on the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  The State has had to come repeatedly to the assistance of those people who were hit so hard when, in complete contradiction of election assurances that food subsidies would be maintained, the Government removed them in one fell below.</P>

      <P>The small increases contained in the Bill and the improvements in social welfare legislation suggested by the Minister are certainly acceptable to the Labour Party.  Without wrapping it up in fancy words, I want to say that as far as the proposed increases are concerned, they are not enough.  The Minister and the members of the Government should recognise that they are not enough and that they could have given more, that the country could afford more.  In the past couple of years, we have had statements from various Government Ministers as to how effective and successful the Five Year Plan has been, that we have ridden into an era of prosperity.  The prosperity is translated into action as far as the old age pensioner is concerned by an increase of 1/6d. per week.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare when asked in recent years why there was not a bigger increase in old age pensions said &mdash;and I think he believed it&mdash;that the country must produce more wealth before we can afford more in respect of either social welfare or social assistance. He very rightly told us that an extra 2/6d. to old age pensioners would mean that the people would have to contribute over £1 million more in taxation.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should remember that due to the fact that many old age pensioners have been transferred to the contributory class, the 2/6d. now would cost only about £800,000.  Therefore, when we think about an increase of 2/6d. to old age pensioners we should think in terms, not of over £1 million, but of £800,000 or £810,000.  Many people inside and outside this House will say that the country cannot afford to give more.  I think we can give more, not merely because the members of the Government, in an election year, are telling us we never had it so good but because, as I have said, the country can afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that in this Bill we are giving concessions to something like 220,000 persons to the extent of £600,000.  To each of those 220,000 it will mean an increase of 1/4d. per week.  Let us consider what the Government do in respect of other <Col N="545" /> people.  It reminds one of what some personality in the country said recently &mdash;the rich seem to be getting richer and the poor seem to be getting poorer.  We are making concessions amounting to £1,200,000 in respect of persons in the upper income bracket in relation to income tax.  The Budget gave them a present of £1,200,000 but to 220,000 persons who are dependent on old age pensions and various forms of assistance we give £600,000.</P>
    <P>Let me return to what the Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister have been saying in recent years, namely, that they will get more when the country can afford it.  The evidence is that rather than more being spent on social welfare and social assistance the amount is decreasing every year, despite statements to the effect that the country is becoming more prosperous. It may be in certain respects but let me give these interesting figures to show what the Minister for Social Welfare has done in respect of people who are dependent on the State and on social insurance funds for their weekly income.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue has increased, since this Government came into power, over each of the years since 1957.  In 1957-58, the Government found it possible to extract from the people £102.7 million.  In 1958, tax revenue rose to £104.1 million; in 1959, it rose to £107.3 million; in 1960-61, it amounted to £114.9 million; and in 1961-62, it is estimated at £118.3 million. People would be entitled to argue that if tax revenue goes up, we should come to the assistance of people who cannot sometimes, as the Act says, provide for themselves, but, in 1957-58, when tax revenue stood at £102.7 million, we spent, 24.8 per cent. of that revenue on social welfare and social assistance.  In 1958-59, when tax revenue was £104.1 million, the percentage spent on social welfare and social assistance fell to 24.4 per cent.; in 1959-60, when the Government succeed in extracting about £3.2 millions more from the people, the amount spent on social welfare and social assistance further decreased to 23.8 per cent.  In 1960, when tax revenue showed an increase of £7.6 million <Col N="546" /> over 1959 even less a percentage of the whole was spent on social welfare and social assistance&mdash;22.8 per cent.  In the present year, according to the estimates of the Minister for Finance, tax revenue will amount to £118.3 million and again we see a decrease in the amount spent on social welfare and social assistance, which now stands at 22.3 per cent. as against 24.8 per cent. in the year 1957-58.</P>
    <P>That is a very good reason why the Government should have given a little more than 1/6d. to old age pensioners and other categories described in the Bill.  The State is evading its responsibility towards those people.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary, when concluding the debate, will probably argue that expenditure is declining because less has to be provided for unemployment assistance by reason of the fact that the numbers of registered unemployed have decreased over these years.</P>
    <P>There is another fact which must be taken into consideration when one thinks of social welfare and social assistance and that is the extra amount that is being demanded and taken in contributions from workers and employers. For that reason I say the State is evading responsibility that it formerly accepted.  In 1960-61 the workers contributed £3.3 millions in social insurance; this year they are required to contribute £4.9 millions, an increase of 50 per cent. in one year. The Government are therefore placing an added burden in respect of social welfare directly on employees and employers while cutting down substantially themselves.  Indeed, the Minister for Health who is also Minister for Social Welfare said last week, I think, that we could not afford to pay nurses any more.  At least he seems to be consistent because it seems that he is also determined not to give the increases that I believe are rightly due to those who come under this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the cost of living index figure.  We should get away from the idea that in present circumstances old age pensioners <Col N="547" /> should be harnessed to the cost of living figures.  If we are to tie them to the cost of living figures, the old age pensioners, the sick, the unemployed and the widows will never have what all of us say they should have.  If we are to give increases merely in accordance with the cost of living figure, they will still be in receipt of weekly allowances which everybody agrees are inadequate.  The Minister may talk about the cost of living figure but I wonder is he being serious when he applies it to the old age pensioners? The cost of living figure includes the price of practically every single commodity but we must remember that the main thing that the old age pensioner, the unemployed person, the sick person and the widower are concerned with is food.</P>
      <P>The record of Fianna Fáil in respect of the price of food is not good.  The Minister says the cost of living index figure, since the present Government assumed office, has increased by 11 points.  That is correct but food items increased by 17 points.  That gives an entirely different picture.  Deputy O'Sullivan has described these increases in pence and shillings and there is no necessity for me to repeat them.  The biggest item affecting the expenditure from the purse of any of the people catered for in this Bill is in respect of food and, to talk about the cost of living index figure which includes things with which they are not concerned and never will be concerned, is purely madness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Government could have afforded more.  I am content to sit here and listen to the taunts of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary telling me how I did when I was Minister for Social Welfare or what some other Minister did, when reductions were made or about the meagre increases which were given. What I am concerned about is the position at present and, when one has regard to the increase in the cost of food over the last four years and to the increase in tax revenue collected by the Government, I think the argument can be sustained that 1/6d. <Col N="548" /> is too little to offer to the old age pensioners at a time when the Government are boasting about the wind of change and about the new era of prosperity which we are entering.</P>
    <P>It did not seem to me to be realistic that we should give a concession of £1,200,000 to income tax payers and to expect 220,000 people to be satisfied with the meagre £600,000.  It seems to me to be the policy of the Government to endeavour to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  As another income tax concession we have the married man with £3,000 a year getting a present of over 2/- while the married man with £11 a week benefited under the income tax concessions by only 4½d. That seems to to be in keeping with the policy of the Minister for Health when he was Minister for Finance on one occasion.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to two or three of the other provisions in the Bill.  The Minister spoke of substantial concessions in the means test for recipients of unemployment assistance.  I do not know what he considers to be &ldquo;substantial concessions&rdquo; but the maximum that a single man may have if he is to receive unemployment assistance at present is £98 16s. and the benevolent Minister for Social Welfare now says: &ldquo;We are now going to raise that to £100.&rdquo;  Is he serious when he describes that as a &ldquo;substantial concession?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the rural man the increase is from £72 6s. to £100.  That is not going to mean a lot for any substantial number of people and I do not think it can be described as a &ldquo;substantial concession.&rdquo;  The Minister might well consider the type of people who are at present so badly hit and who have been so badly hit down through the years by this means test that they must undergo to qualify for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can consider the fishermen, for example, and the person that I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the task worker, the worker the farmers of this country are seeking, the worker for whom they will not have to pay insurance, the man they will get to put a price on a field where turnips have to <Col N="549" /> be weeded, the fellow who takes the job for a price on, as it is described in the country, &ldquo;taskwork.&rdquo;  The taskworker works for a number of weeks and under social welfare legislation&mdash;not under this particular piece of legislation&mdash;he will not qualify for unemployment assistance&mdash;at least a single man will not.  If he works for six months for some miserable farmer, he will not qualify for unemployment assistance. The man who operates for five or six months as a fisherman and who, of course is not insured, if he earns&mdash;as he may well do in the salmon season which lasts roughly from April to September, six months &mdash; about £7 per week, will not be entitled to home assistance during the winter months. That is not a very good income but if he earns that amount on an average over six months, as far as I can gather, he will not get home assistance.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister might well consider an easement of the unemployment assistance means test with a view to rectifying these matters which I have described.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can take this as a backhanded compliment. The Minister says there are not so many now in the country on unemployment assistance, not so many registered as unemployed, so that it would not constitute the same problem as when there was a greater number registered as unemployed, who were entitled to and had applied for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say about one proposal in the Bill, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary can find some amusement in it as well. If one commits an offence in respect of the means one discloses to obtain a qualification certificate, one is not to be fined £25; one is to be fined £50.  I do not know whether that is a joke or not. The man who looks for unemployment assistance or the man who gives wrong information is surely not going to be able to pay a fine of £50.  I do not know who brought this idea into the Department of Social Welfare but in recent years the accent seems to be on fraud in respect of social welfare <Col N="550" /> and social welfare assistance.  There is no necessity to terrorise people and they have been terrorised.  I have met them and the Minister's officers know of such cases.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency the officers carrying out their instructions&mdash;and I repeat carrying out their instructions&mdash; subjected people to searching inquiries as to where they worked, who employed them, how long they worked, could they be sacked, and so forth. To such an extent did this happen that some of them decided to withdraw their applications altogether because they got the idea into their heads&mdash;who put it there I will not say&mdash;that they were to be prosecuted and would end up in the district court.  I do not think the people of this country should be terrified in this way.  They were badgered and terrified.  I have no particular officers in mind but these men were acting in accordance with the regulations and they were required to do it within the strict letter of the law.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister appreciate the suffering that they can impose on people with these investigations?  Applications for unemployment benefit are investigated over a period of months. I do not think the Act provides for such long delay.  The case of the man who applies in November is being investigated in January, February and March, and it may be decided five or six months afterwards.  What is he supposed to live on?  The local authorities are not very generous in dispensing home assistance, or any of the other moneys they have at their disposal. Therefore the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should get it out of their heads that there is this colossal fraud going on, because to be fair to the Minister's officials, and especially to those concerned, in the vast majority of the cases it is found that there is not fraud, but in the suspicion of fraud there is an awful lot of suffering imposed on these people for three, four or five months.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for the recovery of over-payment by deductions from the social welfare allowances, that is when a court order has been <Col N="551" /> sought.  I should like to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that in some cases there are errors of payment, justifiable errors, or excusable errors, where recipients get more than they should. If I am overpaid to the tune of £10 and I am told about it, but honestly believe that £10 was due to me, it is very difficult for me to pay it back.  The Minister and his officials should show and I am sure they do, a great deal of tolerance where overpayment has not been due to any fraudulent act of the recipient.  I would also urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that, in regard to the recovery of these overpayments, there should be a little more generosity in fixing the amount of the instalments. Recently I came across a case of a widow who had an allowance of 30/- a week.  She was overpaid in respect of sickness benefit for her late husband. Some official from the Department went to her and suggested she might pay back 10/- or 15/- a week.  The widow was afraid of her life that she might end up in court&mdash;she was not threatened&mdash; and agreed immediately to the payment of 10/- a week out of her meagre 30/- She should have been advised by the Department, by the Minister, or by the official who interviewed her.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on Section 15.  It is a section which might have been introduced many years ago.  It is the section which prevents a reduction in a pension by reason of income from another source which would be assessed as additional means.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are to be congratulated on making that change, among others, in this Bill.  As I say, naturally we do not oppose it.  We welcome it for what it is but we believe, in view of the increase in tax revenue, that there should also have been a consequential increase for the old age pensioners, widows and those who are unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points on which I should like some elucidation when the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister is replying.  The Minister refers, on Page 6 of his speech, to the powers of deciding officers to determine <Col N="552" /> whether a person is or is not in insurable employment.  I have in mind a case in which it was decided that the person involved was not in insurable employment.  When he inquired about it, an officer went to investigate the complaint.  It was again decided that the person was not in insurable employment. As a matter of fact, people are really not aware of what their rights are at these inquiries and whether they can be represented or not.</P>
      <P>This was a case where a man was employed for one day of the week and only for a time.  Rightly or wrongly he felt at the time that he was not insurable and consequently no stamp was applied for a time.  When it was brought to his notice his employer was prepared to stamp the card, if that would be accepted.  It was decided that this man was not insurable.  Unfortunately, not being insurable and not being able to obtain employment where he resided, the man had to leave the country.  The only indication he had that he was not in insurable employment, was that he was employed with a farmer for the purpose of doing odd work such as hay making and so on for one or two days a week.  When people have cause for complaint, they should be notified well ahead as to when the appeal will be held.  Notice should be given to them beforehand.  In some cases, they are told to turn up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon at one of the offices and that does not give them very much time.</P>
      <P>The second point to which I want to refer is related to paragraph 10 of the Minister's speech :</P>
      <P>The purpose of the remaining provisions is to remove obstacles and to strengthen and improve the law in relation to abuses and to the recovery of overpayments of pensions, assistance or benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would greatly assist everyone, the officials of the Department and the people concerned, if the limits within which people must keep to qualify for assistance or the payment of a non-contributory pension, were made perfectly clear.  Very often, when people <Col N="553" /> apply for such pensions, they are unaware of the way in which the Department operates the means test. Some people have money in the Post Office or in a bank, against a rainy day, and in the Post Office the rate of interest they can obtain is 2-?ths.  A sum of £300 at the rate of 2-?ths. interest would give an income of something like £9 per year.  But as I understand it, a sum of £300 is counted by the Department as bringing in much more than £9 per year.</P>
    <P>If the maximum amount of money which the person may have to qualify for benefit were made clear, it would help the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials in regard to this matter which has been referred to as fraud. If people understood that they could not benefit under the social welfare code if they have a certain income, then knowing the position they would not so readily make these claims, and they would not seek benefits to which they knew they were not entitled. Generally, when people reach the age of 70 years, they think they are entitled to a non-contributory old age pension.  They consider they have worked for it the same as everyone else.  They certainly do not think that, because they have a few hundred pounds laid aside to meet their expenses at the end, they are debarred from receiving these benefits.  Surely a notice setting out the limits could be displayed in post offices and elsewhere, as other notices are displayed, notifying people that these are the limits and that these are the amounts above which they cannot qualify.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the recovery provision is applicable to all sections of the Bill now.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me if it will apply to pensions paid on or after 1st August.  I have a case in mind of a worker, an old man, who got a notification, when he had become entitled to a contributory pension, that a debt existed in regard to his wife who had pre-deceased him.  When this woman sought her pension, it was found that she was entitled to it.  Her husband was working in agricultural employment and the officer investigating the case found she <Col N="554" /> was entitled to a pension and she was awarded a pension.  Eight years afterwards, the man changed his employment and went to work in a quarry for the local authority.  The lady's pension then ceased.  That was a year before she died.  After her death, the State claimed that a debt was due.  The man had no assets and no means whatsoever. He is not in good health&mdash;as a matter of fact, he is seriously afflicted &mdash;and in any case he has no means.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, will this section be used for the recovery of such payments, because I think it would be an undue and a very harsh decision if such power were to be taken at this stage.  I would not condone in any way any such thing as getting money from the State, if a person is not entitled to it.  These tests are carried out locally.  I may say they are very efficient and, indeed, some people would say they are very ruthless. To grant a pension and then at a later stage to say that a person was not entitled to it puts those who are left when the recipient has died in the position of finding themselves faced with a bill with which they never thought they would be faced.  It is very easy to spend 8/-, 9/- or 10/- a week, or whatever it may be, but it is very difficult to find that amount if a person is faced with a demand for the recovery of a large sum of money.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether this section in regard to recovery covers all the sections and all the pensions which the Department administers.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give me some information on that.</P>

      <P>I have not had time to prepare what I want to say.  Things are happening quickly here.  I want to discuss the alleged increase which persons in receipt of social benefit will receive.  In the Budget statement, we were told that adults will receive an extra ?d. and that after the second child, the allowance will be increased by 1/-.  The average family on assistance at present receives as much as 10/- or 15/- a week from home assistance.  Families of a husband, wife and five children, we are told, will gain <Col N="555" /> as much as 11/- as a result of the Budget.  The fact remains that those people receive anything from 10/- or 15/- a week in home assistance, and always have.</P>
      <P>The people who will be in receipt of those additions on 1st August will have the amount which they receive under the Budget deducted from the home assistance payment, which means in the case of most of them that they will receive no benefit at all.  Any person who receives an increase under the contributory scheme and who was in receipt of home assistance from the home assistance officers had, in fact, the increase deducted from his home assistance, even if he only benefited by 2/6d.  Where a person was in receipt of 5/- home assistance, that 2/6d. was deducted.  All these unfortunate people were to be well off as a result of the Budget but the fact remains that the various home assistance officers throughout the country will deduct in most cases the amount these people will receive on 1st August.  That means they will be no better off.</P>
      <P>The Minister can give an assurance that that will not be the case and that he will use his good offices, as he did before, and ask that that should not be done.  Will he ask the home assistance authorities not to take this increase from these people's home assistance?  If he does not give that assurance, let me tell the Parliamentary Secretary that the vast majority of these people will gain nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the various increases in the cost of living, rents, bus fares and electricity, the argument has been used that the employee was entitled to an increase in wages.  With the present demands for increased wages, we are going to have a further increase in all those commodities because the Parliamentary Secretary must admit that where there are increases in wages, those increases can be met only by increased costs.  Therefore, those unfortunate people whom it is alleged will receive an increase on 1st August and who may have the increase deducted from their home assistance will, in fact, be no better off but will have to face up to the increases which are certain <Col N="556" /> to come about as a result of the demand for higher wages.</P>
    <P>Not only will many of those people not be any better off but in many cases as a result of increases to come in the cost of living, they will be worse off. Whether the Minister likes it or not, that is exactly the position.  That will be the position after 1st August.</P>
    <P>Once again I am protesting against the Minister's policy of cutting people off assistance on the ground that they are not genuinely seeking work when, in fact, work, in the case of males anyway, is unobtainable in Dublin.  I hold that it is part and parcel of Government policy to press these people so that they will find it more convenient to take the boat.  It seems to me that the great economic successes and the buoyancy of the revenue about which the Government talk arise largely from the fact that very large numbers leave the country annually and so the State is saved the job of having to pay them home assistance, whilst at the same time it gets back money in the form of emigrants' remittances.  It seems the policy to force people out of the country.  I do not see why people should be denied assistance on the ground that they are not genuinely seeking work when, in fact, they regularly apply to the labour exchange which is the proper place where they ought to be offered employment.  If they are not offered employment at the labour exchange, there are no grounds upon which they should be cut off.</P>
    <P>Much of the Government's claim is an artificial claim because by forcing people out of the country, they have saved money in relation to the payment of social benefits.  It is claimed that those people will benefit from the Budget.  In fact, when the moneys they receive from social benefits are deducted, they will not have benefited at all.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one matter.  It is relative to a point I raised here on 8th March, 1960.  It is what appears to be an injustice existing in the transfer of a farm to a son or daughter.  In that case, the farmer may get the pension but where the transfer is to a niece or nephew who lives and works on the farm, the transfer is not acceptable for assessment under the pensions code.  The Parliamentary Secretary at the time promised he would look into that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend upon the date upon which the transfer was made.  If it is done sufficiently long before the claimant attains the age of 70 years, the transfer may be accepted; if it is done in the way in which it might be done in respect of a son or daughter, it is not.  After all, the niece or nephew might quite readily buy the farm.  There is not any filial obligation on the part of a person to give his property to a niece or nephew.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position which has been established for a long time.  Having regard to the liberal manner in which the concessions have been extended, I think it would not be fair to the ordinary taxpayer to concede the same right in respect of a niece or nephew.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;I am sorry I had to leave the House; I was not able to remain while he was speaking&mdash; enquired how it was that the proposals which had been announced in the Budget were not coming into operation until 1st August.  The explanation is simple.  First of all, the Budget appears in April or sometimes in May.  Then there are certain administrative arrangements which have to be made in order to bring these proposals into operation.  The earliest possible date on which they can be brought into operation is three or four months after the date upon which they are announced.  It has been the custom always, when increases in benefits are announced in the Budget, to bring them in on 1st August because experience has shown that that is the earliest possible practical date.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy Jones complained that people do not know how the means test is operated or what is the limit of the means they must have to qualify.  Let me say this: I did not hear Deputy Jones and I am reading a note as it was recorded for me. People are not expected to keep within the limit of the means that would entitle them to qualify for unemployment assistance.  On the contrary, they are expected to exceed those means by as much as lies within their power to do so.  They are expected to work as hard as they can and to improve their position as much as they can.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the situation, I am afraid, has developed in some parts of the country that people refuse to better themselves, refuse even to avail of the opportunities offered to them to better themselves lest they might lose unemployment assistance, the free-and-easy money which they have been getting for years.  I think all that is a regrettable development.  I would hope that all sides of the House would discourage it to the utmost extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tax people who have to work hard in order to provide these moneys. We tax them on the assumption that <Col N="559" /> the people who receive them have done their utmost to maintain themselves and improve their position.  It would be grossly unfair to the community as a whole if we were to allow the idea to develop that people receive these moneys as of right&mdash;they receive them as a grace&mdash;and that, for that reason, they are entitled to refuse to pull their weight within the community and, where possible, to better their position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the complaint that persons do not know how the means test is operated, the position is that all officers of the Department have adequate supplies of explanatory leaflets, which may be had for the asking. These give full information as to the scope, means limit, rates of benefit, qualifying conditions, and so on, of each scheme.  Therefore, anybody can get the information which Deputy Jones spoke about, on request.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to hear from Deputy Sherwin that any man who really wants a job in the City of Dublin at this moment need be without one.</P>

      <P>He may not get the sort of job he might like&mdash;the nice, soft cushy job.  However, I know a great many people who have been complaining, particularly in the building industry, of shortage of labour.  I know that Deputy Sherwin is a very soft-hearted man but he is not as simple, surely, as to wish us to believe that there are able-bodied men anxious to work walking the streets of Dublin today, with a good character&mdash;that is one essential&mdash;who cannot get a job.  Another thing is that it is not up to the Labour Exchange to provide a man with a job.  The purpose of the Labour Exchange is primarily to put people who are looking for employment in touch with likely employers.</P>

      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the home assistance authority is only entitled to take into consideration such other sources of income under the social assistance code as may be an excess of 10/-.  Outside that, of course, we have no control. There is that statutory bar so far as home assistance authorities are concerned. I will say this, and it is as far as I should go, that I am sure that the Oireachtas does not intend, when it asks the taxpayers to provide increased benefits for social welfare beneficiaries, that all that benefit will be utilised to relieve the ratepayers within any home assistance authority district of their proper responsibilities for the care of those in need.  I am sure Deputy Sherwin will now be able to do his duty to these people inside the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>Under this Section the Minister takes power to appoint the president of the Nurses' Board.  We indicated on the Second Reading that this section appeared to be highly undemocratic.  We are opposed to it for the reasons which we stated on the Second Reading.  It is an unusual section to incorporate in a Bill of this kind and, so far as I can follow the reasons given by the Minister on the Second Stage, there does not appear to be any substantial reason why this change should be imposed.</P>
      <P>The Minister says it is necessary that there should be an understanding between the Chairman of the Board and the Minister.  That, to my mind, does not make sense.  The Minister is entitled to representation on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> He is entitled to have a point of view expressed on the Board and it is surely reasonable that the Nurses Board itself should be entitled to elect its own chairman as it has always done.  I could understand if in relation to a board of this kind the experience had been that there was a sort of tug-of-war between the policy of the Minister and the policy of the board itself and if the result was that necessary progress had not been made.  We know that the contrary is true.  Since the establishment of the Nurses Board quite a dramatic measure of progress has been achieved and that, in my view, has been largely due to the fact that the Board had as its Chairman for many years a person who was dedicated to the advancement of the nursing profession in this country, providing them with a status they did not previously enjoy and with facilities for better training and better education. In those circumstances, where the story up to this has been a success story, it is difficult to understand why this unusual procedure is now being suggested.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes power, as he does under this section, to appoint the Chairman, he might as well abolish the Board entirely and provide that the interests of nurses and all that follows from that should be controlled and managed by the Department of Health.  I found in my limited experience that it was a good thing in relation to boards of this kind concerned with interests outside the Department to have from time to time a fractious point of view put forward so that from a clash of opinion a good policy might result.  Under the suggestion contained in this section there will be no possibility of any disagreement between the Department of Health and the Nurses Board. Everything will conform.  The policy the Minister decides upon will be automatically carried out.  There will be no possibility of disagreement. Everything in the garden will be lovely but, in the result, I doubt very much whether the interests of the nurses will be served as a priority. The priority will be the interests of the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>It was stated here on <Col N="566" /> the Second Stage that doctors objected to nurses being chairmen.  That is one of the reasons I thought this proposal of the Minister was best.  I have received a letter from a doctor who was a member of the Board.  He denies there was any truth in that statement.  He states that at no time did the doctors feel there would be any loss of prestige if a nurse was made chairman.  There was no objection to a nurse being made chairman of the Board.  It is wrong in a democracy that any chairman should be appointed.  Replying to the arguments used against this proposal, the Minister said there was no money involved in it, it was merely honorary.</P>

      <P>There could be patronage because many people attach importance to position.  People with money are always after position.  Look at the people with money who would give a fortune for a title.  Look at the people who spend money to become councillors, and there is no money in being a councillor.  The Minister for the time being will be lobbied.  In all walks of political life, there is patronage, and there always will be.  I think it is wrong in principle that any person should be appointed to any board; the person should be elected.  The Minister is not lacking in knowledge.  He knows that when it comes to position, it would be contrary to human nature if there were no patronage.  The Minister has left the position open to patronage by taking on himself to appoint a chairman. I am most emphatically against the Minister's proposal to appoint the chairman.  The chairman should be elected by the Committee.</P>

      <P>Wait now.  That is where the Deputy is wrong.  If an election is held inside a little body like this, where backs can be scratched to use that homely phrase, it cannot be challenged.  If the Minister makes a wrong appointment and appoints a person unworthy of the position, it can be challenged, and I am perfectly certain it would be challenged here in Dáil Eireann.  The fact that an appointment which did not commend itself to the judgment of the people had been made by the Minister would get the utmost publicity.  It is not possible to do that in relation to these appointments to minor bodies.  I am just suggesting that the position in which a responsible public man can be called to account for the appointment he makes is a very much better one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Are we not elected by the people to do the people's work? What is the relationship between An Bord Altranais and the Minister for Health?  The Board is in fact the agent of the Minister for Health.  It has no existence outside him.  If he wants to find some other agent to perform all the functions of the Minister for Health, he can do so under the Act of 1950, under which the Board was brought into existence.  It is only the agent of the Minister, established for the purpose of training and qualifying nurses to meet the public demand for members of that profession.</P>
      <P>I cannot see what is wrong in giving to the Minister who has set up this Board under an Act of the Oireachtas the right to appoint a chairman, whose purpose will be to ensure that the Board works smoothly and in co-operation with the Minister for Health.  I have no apology for taking up the attitude that it is of first importance for the public good that this and all other boards are to work in cordial co-operation with the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>One of the best ways of securing that is that there should be this liaison which I am proposing here in Section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has said that this is unprecedented.  I am surprised to hear him making that statement because, after all, I am following excellent precedents.  I am sure if Deputy O'Higgins and I agree about the wisdom of doing a thing in a particular way, it is likely to be the best way of doing it.  Deputy O'Higgins established Bord na Radhairc-mhaisteoirí and he appointed the chairman of that Board.  It was a good choice.  If he had not made that provision in the Act and had left the chairman to be elected by the members of the Board, perhaps the Board would not function at all, would not be functioning even yet.  There would not be a neutral chairman to guide the Board in the performance of their <Col N="569" /> functions and particularly in the formative stages of their development.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy established the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, he not only appointed the chairman of the Board but he appointed all the directors.  I am not making any point about that, but I do say he was wise to appoint the chairman of the Board. In the same way, there are a number of other associations which bear a similar relationship, as does An Bord Altranais, to the Minister for Health. There is the Cancer Association.  It was not established by an Act of the Oireachtas.  It was established under the Companies Acts.  One might say, therefore, in that case that, since it is not formally a statutory body, the members of this company, limited as it is by guarantee, might be given the prerogative of electing their own chairman.  But that was not the action taken by one of my predecessors.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Cancer Association is appointed by the Minister. The Chairman of the Mass Radiography Association&mdash;again an association doing the work of the Minister, as agent for the Minister, as Bord Altranais is doing&mdash;is appointed by the Minister.  I shall appoint in due course the Chairman of Comhairle Nimheanna.  Again, the Medical Research Council is a body which has a similar relationship to the Minister as has Bord Altranais, though it is again a company limited by guarantee. It receives, as Bord Altranais does, a subvention from the Government out of the Exchequer.  In that case also the Chairman is appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unprecedented in what I am now proposing.  My experience is that matters tend to go better and work tends to make better progress if there is that association through the Chairman between the Minister and these subsidiary agents of his.  There is no question about democracy in this.  This Board could not exist for a minute if the Oireachtas decided not to supply it with funds.  It could not operate unless it was prepared to charge very heavy fees to <Col N="570" /> those who qualify under it or those who sit for its examinations.  In those circumstances it does not seem to me that there is any question of the infringement of any right.  It is merely the fact that the Minister is entitled to have in this matter a choice, and the choice in this particular case will not be exercised, I think, by me because the existing Chairman is to continue in office for the remainder of the period in which the present Board will exist. After that, the choice of President of the Board will probably be made by another person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise.  It was Deputy Briscoe. The Minister says this is not unprecedented.  I should like to assert again that it is unprecedented. I know of no Board&mdash;the Minister can check this&mdash;where the constitution and the manner in which the chairman is appointed has been changed as this is being changed by legislation.  This Board has been in existence ever since the Principal Act of 1950.  That is over eleven years. It has been functioning, operating, carrying out its statutory duties and providing for the training of nurses and the supply of nurses in this country. The Board is there.  It is an unprecedented action on the part of any Minister to come in here to change the manner in which that particular Board &mdash;it is not a new Board, not appointed <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash;will elect its President or Chairman.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true that the Chairman of Bord Radhaircmhaisteoirí, which was appointed under legislation for which I was responsible, is appointed by the Minister.  That is an <i>ad hoc</i> Board appointed to deal with a new problem, a new situation.  The Minister is aware that, at that particular time, the tide and tug of a variety of interests made it impossible for any Minister to take any other course except to appoint a Chairman.  That is why the Chairman of that Board is nominated by the Minister.  But that was as I say <i>ad hoc,</i> a particular situation.  There is no question of election in relation to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. That Board was set up to deal with a particular public and social duty.  Not only the Chairman, but the entire Board, is appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In argument it is always possible to get an example to suit the particular point one is making, but here is the Minister asking this House to change the constitution of an existing and successful Board.  It is a Board, taking what the Minister said on Second Reading and the experience we have had of it, that has been extraordinarily successful. <Col N="572" /> Since it was established it has helped the nurses of this country up from the ground.  Through its activities it has provided a new vision and given a new breath of life where nurses are concerned.  They have to-day better training facilities.  They have opportunities in the universities for better education.  It is on the way to solving the perennial problem of premises and methods of training for young nurses. It has been a successful Board.  Why should this change be proposed now? It is part of the kind of complex the Minister has had over the past four and a half years.  This method&mdash;I cannot say &ldquo;of electing&rdquo; any more&mdash;by which a member of the Nurses Council becomes president has got to be changed because the Minister did not like the person who was president for a number of years.  That is why this change is proposed.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Briscoe is not here now because Deputy Briscoe attended his first meeting of the Nurses Board some two years ago for the purpose of voting out the person who for many years was the architect of the success of An Bord Altranais.  It is because that attempt failed that now the power of election is being taken by this section from the Nurses Board.  It is because they did not perform in accordance with the Ministerial wishes two years ago and because they exercised their right to re-elect as president a person in whom they had complete confidence that this section is now brought in to take that right from them.  I have no doubt whatever that is the motive behind this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister says his experience in matters of this kind is to the effect that matters go better if there is, as he said, &ldquo;that association between the Minister and these subsidiary agencies of his&rdquo; and he interpreted &ldquo;that association&rdquo; as meaning agreement between the Minister and the subsidiary agency. The subsidiary agent in this respect is An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be a democracy. That is how we regard ourselves in our Constitution.  A democracy surely means that from the free play of independent opinion and vigorously held thought, reason, often a compromise, may result but what the Minister <Col N="573" /> wants, and it is in accordance with the Minister's point of view, is his opinion translated automatically, not only in the Department but in relation to every subsidiary agency outside.  That all adds up to the definition of dictatorship and this section is clearly undemocratic. It is to make An Bord Altranais, what it never has been, some kind of doll that will perform according as the Minister for Health pulls the strings.  I think it is wrong. I think it is unprecedented.  As I have indicated already, I do not know of any legislation in which the constitution of an existing board has been assailed and changed in this remarkable manner.  In my view, this change is motivated by the Minister's displeasure with the person who for many years was a most successful and most respected president of the Nurses Board.</P>

      <P>I just wish to say that I am more than surprised that Deputy O'Higgins's memory tends to mislead him.  He has painted a picture to the House of a long-term servant of the public being deprived of an office because a Minister does not like him.  I shall not enter into the merits or demerits of the ex-president of this board.  I had not anything to do with the &ldquo;ex-ing&rdquo; of him. Apparently, some people had persuaded him that it was better for him to retire and he did retire in 1960, having served from 1956 to 1960&mdash; four years.  His predecessor, I think, was given a fair hint by certain interested parties that he might not be elected and the person about whom Deputy O'Higgins is so much concerned had not the slightest hesitation in displacing him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been since 1951 four presidents of that body, the late Dr. P. McCarville, then his successor who held office for, apparently, only one year, and then the gentleman about whom Deputy O'Higgins is so much concerned.  Since that person was not elected president of the Board in 1961, I do not think he has any reason to complain or that Deputy O'Higgins had any reason for the indignation he has expressed in the House.  He will <Col N="574" /> not be affected by this, nor will his successor.  His successor remains under this Bill as president of the Board.  I cannot see what all the fuss is about.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has been throwing bouquets at An Bord Altranais and, particularly at the person with whom he is so much concerned.  He has told us that they have solved the very difficult problem of premises.  Of course, they have solved it&mdash;with moneys provided by whom?  By the Minister for Health who allocated to them £5,500 for the purchase of their premises and it is to the Minister for Health that in that respect the credit is due.  It is not that I am concerned about it but since we have had this picture painted, this glowing picture of the services which a certain person has rendered to the nursing profession, may I say that he had predecessors and he has a successor, all of whom have done their job, I am sure, just as well as he?  And in so far as they are going to have premises, they are going to have premises because the Minister for Health let them have the money for them. That is all there is to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 on behalf of Deputy McGilligan:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, line 23, to delete &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; and the brackets enclosing the next three words.</P>
      <P>If the House is agreeable there are a number of following amendments which might be considered at the same time.  The purpose of this is to delete the words &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; in the section so that the section, if the House agreed, would read: &ldquo;...the Court of Final Appeal, which in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution is to be called the Supreme Court, shall stand established.&rdquo; I hope it will be understood that this amendment is not put down with a desire in any way to belittle the Irish language or the language revival movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to provide some reason and sense in our legislation.  We have come into this House under a Constitution which provides that we are entitled to speak either Irish or English and the Constitution provides the right to speak both languages but I do not know that the Constitution provides that we can speak either pidgin English or pidgin Irish.  Pidgin English connotes the type of person in some of England's former colonies who knew a bit of English and a bit of the native language and proceeded to <Col N="576" /> converse in a kind of hybrid language, using part of his native tongue and part of some other tongue.</P>
    <P>We frequently find legislation being proposed in this House in English, having every important section and point in English and then a genuflection is paid to the Irish language by calling the particular board to be established by some Irish title.  That kind of approach to the language has led to absurdity and to jokes which one hears on the stage and elsewhere belittling the language.  Here we find, under the proposal in the Bill brought in by the present Minister for Justice, and discussed by his Parliamentary Secretary, that this disease is beginning to spread to the courts.  I noticed the other day when the President of Ireland decided to refer legislation from this House, he referred it to the Supreme Court of the country.  The announcement was in English and very properly the President referred to the court in accordance with the title by which it is known and respected, the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Deputy McGilligan's amendment is to prevent that court being described as something which it is not.  Under this section&mdash;if it were passed&mdash;it is to be described as &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach (The Supreme Court)&rdquo;.  I do not know by what authority it can be so described.  Our Constitution provides that it shall be called in the Irish language, An Chúirt Uachtarach, and in the English language that it shall be called the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to learn that we arrogate to ourselves in this House the right to change the Constitution.  I should have thought that since 1937 we should, at least have learned the lesson that we have no right in the Dáil or in the Oireachtas itself to alter by even a comma what the Constitution provides.  I suggest that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary might consider this amendment as being helpful and withdraw the different references to our courts in the Bill except where we are referring to them in the Irish language and then, very <Col N="577" /> properly and appropriately, they should be called by the Irish equivalents. Where we are referring to them, as we are in this Bill, which is being discussed in English, we should call them by the English names.  The English name in this context is the Supreme Court and, in relation to the other sections, we should refer to them by the appropriate titles by which they are known.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment. The decision to include the Irish forms in the Bill was made by the Government after careful consideration. They felt it desirable to emphasise the importance which they attached to the Irish styling in the establishment of courts, pursuant to the Constitution.  The House will be aware of the fact that &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; is the description used in the Constitution itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is using both languages.  We regard the Supreme Court as being one of the most fundamental institutions of the State. It is on a par with Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and the Ceann Comhairle. I think that as we are now establishing <Col N="578" /> the Irish courts under the Constitution it is right, appropriate and correct to give them the nomenclature that we are using in the Bill, the Irish form together with the English form in brackets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a reference made to &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  Dáil Éireann is described in Article 16 of the Constitution and there is no phrase other than &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  There is no phrase like &ldquo;the Irish Parliament&rdquo;. It is &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in English and in Irish.  The whole of Article 16 relates to that.  Then we turn to Article 34 which deals with the courts.  Clause 2 says that &ldquo;The Courts shall comprise Courts of First Instance and a Court of Final Appeal&rdquo;.  The Irish for the phrase is &ldquo;Cúirt Athchomhairc Dheiridh&rdquo;. Then one comes to Clause 4 which says in English that &ldquo;The Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court&rdquo;.  The Irish version is &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach is teideal don Chúirt Athchomhairc Dheiridh&rdquo;. and if I found in this Bill instead of &ldquo;the Court of Final Appeal&rdquo;&ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution...&rdquo; I would agree. But that is not what is said in the section.</P>
      <P>The section says that the Court of Final Appeal in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution is to be called &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;.  But Article 34, clause (4) says that the Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court.  Why get into this bastardization of two languages and mix up a statement of a court with the English version and give it an Irish title?  Let us have both Irish and English. To say that the Court of Final Appeal in accordance with the Constitution is being called this Irish title is not correct.  The Article says that the Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Mind you, the words in the Constitution are there.  Do not let us forget that this Government on three separate occasions <Col N="583" /> found themselves in a dilemma in their efforts to drive a coach and four through the Constitution which ended up in grave public inconvenience and, on occasion, in substantial financial loss.  One of the advantages of having a Constitution is that it is a rigid instrument.  That also involves disadvantages and we can all see that.</P>
      <P>Recently, I had occasion to hear this matter discussed in exalted places and I heard the view expressed that there must be the presumption that Deputies in Dáil Éireann in enacting laws had the letter and the spirit of the Constitution present to their minds. I availed of that exalted company to say that that was a very considerable presumption.  That was the view expressed, that there must be the presumption that there was present to our minds when enacting laws not only the letter but the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Parliamentary Secretary to turn hopefully to Deputy P. J. Burke and call him to witness the argumentation on the meaning of the Constitution and the legalistic word-spinning.  I am sure Deputy Burke was straining in his waistcoat to say &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; but the Supreme Court will not take much stock of the Parliamentary Secretary's appeal to Deputy P. J. Burke.</P>
      <P>Our job in these Opposition Benches is to bring to the consideration of legislation of this kind the best and most informed criticism we can provide. I dare to say that the contribution we are in a position to make from these benches on this topic is unique, and should not be lightly disregarded even by the Parliamentary Secretary, whose Minister commends him as a man of legal training and the obvious choice of a future Taoiseach for Ministerial office.</P>

      <P>Giving lectures is one thing and absorbing them is quite another.  I do not want to swap discourtesies with the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has his job to do but he should be careful before he describes informed criticism on legislation of this kind as legal word-spinning. That kind of thing provokes rejoinder and makes his position difficult. We all accept that he comes in here well briefed and perfectly advised and we do not expect him to make obeisance to every representation made.  It is perfectly natural that he should defend the advice he has been given.  He has to make his case which I personally think has no constitutional authority.</P>
      <P>There is force in the whole case which falls to be made on the general tenor of this Bill.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is misdirecting himself in thinking it expedient or desirable that we should by implication in this Bill reverse the accepted practice in this State which is to accord to both languages a strict equality.  There is no obligation on anyone who speaks in this House in Irish to provide an English translation of what he says, and there is no obligation on anyone who speaks in English to provide an Irish translation.  Either may be freely used. I think the Ceann Comhairle would flinch in spirit if we stood forward and uttered a sentence in Irish, translated it into English, uttered another sentence in Irish and translated it into English, and proceeded on those lines. I think he would charge us with repetition if we advanced that idea.  We have just passed an Act of Parliament where every word in substance is written in one language and translated into another. I presume it is the Parliamentary Secretary's intention that this legislation will be translated into Irish.  Will the Irish version read &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;, or whatever it is called, with &ldquo;The Supreme Court&rdquo; in brackets?  Is that the intention?</P>

      <P>He speaks schoolbook Irish, the same as we all speak and he is fluent.  I think he must see himself that if there were a genuine desire to give emphasis to the Irish character of the legislation implementing the establishment of the courts, he could make a case for bringing in the originating instrument in Irish and enacting it in Irish.  He did not do that. I could understand his doing that and then saying in the English version that the name of the Supreme Court will be reproduced in the terms employed in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>But the procedure here is wrong, according to the Constitution which, after all, is important, but it is also wrong, in my respectful submission, from the point of view of our whole approach to the language.  I think the whole procedure is misconceived.  I think there is inherent in it the nature that if you depart in a matter of this kind from the letter of the Constitution, it opens a crack.</P>
      <P>Some people may say that I am getting very anxious about the sanctity of the Constitution.  I am a pragmatist. I do not believe in chewing over old battles as to whether this is a good Constitution or a bad Constitution. There I leave it.  It is now the fundamental law.  We have a procedure for amending it, if we want to.  Such as it is, there it is.  We ought so to conduct ourselves, and I quote the highest authority and if the Parliamentary Secretary wants further verification, let me refer him to the Leader of his own Party, the Taoiseach, as to legislate in this House with due regard to the letter and spirit of that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary cannot challenge the proposition that the section here does not correspond to the letter of the Constitution.  Quite apart from the very form on matters <Col N="587" /> relating to constitutional law in this country, there is the very highest judicial opinion to support my view.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to yield to Deputy McGilligan, in the knowledge that he is far from being alone in warning the Parliamentary Secretary that the letter of the Constitution is something to which this Legislature must have regard and that there are means available to evoke the courts.</P>

      <P>I know nothing whatever about the law or the courts.  I am interested in this matter just for the sake of accuracy.  The literal meaning of the word &ldquo;uachtarach&rdquo; is &ldquo;upper&rdquo;. Can one reconcile the words &ldquo;uachtarach&rdquo; and &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; as meaning one and the same thing?  I doubt it.  I think what Deputy McGilligan says, an Chúirt Athchomhairc Dheiridh, would be the proper title because the other could be misleading except when taken in conjunction with the High Court.  If you are going to take it in conjunction with the three others, I think it should be an Chúirt is Uachtaraí.  That is the only point I wish to make.  &ldquo;Uachtarach&rdquo; does not express the meaning intended.</P>

      <P>The air of sweet reasonableness adopted by the Leader of the Opposition captivates me and makes me very amenable to what he has to say.  I think, however, that he might be disposed to agree that Deputy McGilligan in supporting his amendment was not beyond trying to force me, as it were, into a corner of argument and did not hesitate to use any trick of debate to get his point of view over, so that if I were to tend to reply somewhat in kind, I do not think he need take it too badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are not attempting to abandon the letter and spirit of the Constitution.  Indeed, the case is exactly the opposite.  They are fully conscious of the fact that the Constitution <Col N="588" /> envisages Irish titles and English titles for the courts.  It is clearly stipulated in the Constitution that the Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court, on the one hand, and An Chúirt Uachtarach, on the other.  It is because the Constitution in the letter and in the spirit envisages dual nomenclature that we have this form in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>We feel we are perfectly in accord with both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution in what we are doing. If we can accept that, then the only other thing that follows is to ask whether it is desirable to do it?  The Government in this have been influenced by the fact that they want to put an emphasis on the Irish titles of our Irish courts.  We are acting in accordance with the provisions of our own Constitution enacted by the Irish people.  The Constitution envisaged Irish courts and in setting up and establishing those courts for the first time, we want to put an emphasis on the Irish aspect of our titles.  The Constitution gives any one of the courts two names&mdash;an English name and an Irish name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is walking into a trap he need not fall into. There is an instance in the Constitution where the very thing the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="589" /> denies is possible is adopted.  If he will look at Article 28 (5) (i), the Constitution says:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It does not say:</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, is the head of the Government.</P>
      <P>It says:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point.  We are not legislating in pursuance of that Article but of Article 34.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It says:</P>
      <P>The Courts shall comprise Courts of First Instance and a Court of Final Appeal.</P>
      <P>It also says:</P>
      <P>The Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the corresponding Article, it does not say &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo;.  The Article I am referring to says:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The parallel piece of legislation would be to say &ldquo;The Supreme Court, or the Court of Final Appeal, shall be called An Chúirt Uachtarach.&rdquo;  Then I would understand the Parliamentary Secretary's introducing legislation referring, in the English text, to &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; just as, when speaking in this House or outside it, we do not refer to the Taoiseach as &ldquo;the Prime Minister.&rdquo;  We call him &ldquo;the Taoiseach,&rdquo; because it is laid down in the Constitution that the Prime Minister shall be called the Taoiseach.  That is quite all right, if that is constitutional practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exactly the opposite practice is <Col N="590" /> chosen in the other article&mdash;34 (4).  I cannot see how the Parliamentary Secretary can escape from that parallel. We are charged as legislators to correspond to the letter and spirit of the Constitution.  We have an example of a circumstance in which the Constitution directs us to call the Prime Minister &ldquo;the Taoiseach&rdquo; and to state categorically throughout the Constitution that the Prime Minister shall be described as &ldquo;the Taoiseach,&rdquo; and is thereafter referred to as the Taoiseach. However, Article 34 (4) goes out of its way to speak of &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo; but, on the opposite page, you find:</P>
    <P>An Chúirt Uachtarach is teideal don Chúirt Athchomhairc Dheiridh.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary is trying, despite the Constitution, to adopt a course for which there is no constitutional basis and is doing it in the light of the clear inference that when the Constitution was drafted and enacted, it was present to the minds of those who drafted and enacted it that in certain circumstances they would direct that an Irish word would be used even in an English context to describe an officer or institution of the State.  I think that is an inescapable situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison between Article 28 and Article 34 in this regard.  If we were legislating here in pursuance of Article 28 (4), we would simply have to provide for the person under Article 38 (5) to be called the Taoiseach because Article 28 (5) clearly lays down, and the Irish version confirms it, that he is not to have an English title.  He is just to be &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; in English and Irish. There is no translation.</P>
      <P>That is a completely different situation from Article 34 which clearly lays down that this Court of Final Appeal will have two names, an English name and an Irish name.  That is what we have written in subsection (1).  We say it is to be called &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach (the Supreme Court)&rdquo;&mdash; the English title and the Irish title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put these in contrast.  Article 28 (5) says:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach&rdquo;&mdash;and that is the title he has in the English version. When it comes to Article 34, the English version is &ldquo;The Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court&rdquo; and the Irish for that is &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach is teideal don Chúirt Athchomhairc Dheiridh.&rdquo; But we are not speaking of &ldquo;An Chúirt Athchomhairc Dheiridh.&rdquo;  We are speaking of &ldquo;the Court of Final Appeal&rdquo; and the Constitution says in English that that shall be called &ldquo;the Supreme Court.&rdquo;  Article 28 says&mdash;I am speaking of the English version:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, The Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>That is entirely different.  In order to put the two in equality, one would have to have here &ldquo;The Court of Final Appeal shall be called An Chúirt Uachtarach.&rdquo;  That is not in the Constitution.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been referred to as a legal expert in his own right.</P>

Not one of them has failed to pass the Legal Practitioners Act with qualifications.  The Parliamentary Secretary has them.

      <P>I think I will do better.  I will use Deputy McGilligan's own petard on which to hoist him. If I am falling into error here, I think there is an excuse for me.  I have in my hand the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act, 1922 &mdash;the original 1922 Constitution. Article 64 of that Constitution reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The judicial power of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) shall be exercised and justice administered in the public Courts established by the Oireachtas by judges appointed in manner hereinafter provided.  These Courts shall comprise Courts of First Instance and a Court of Final Appeal to be called the Supreme Court...</P>

One idea is to inject into the statutory instrument a title which does not exist in the corresponding paragraph of the Constitution. The other is to put in what is in the Constitution and then to make the gesture of translating it thereafter.  It does not matter what you put in by way of translation so long as the language of the Constitution is being reproduced.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary see no difference between elaborating the language of the Constitution and substituting for the language of the Constitution?</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan's only complaint which is crystallised in his amendment is that he wants to take out the words &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach.&rdquo; That is his only ground for complaint. These Irish words are in the 1924 Courts of Justice Act.  Why did he not take them out of that?</P>

      <P>I will keep my patience, though it tax my soul.  It is fascinating the way Fianna Fáil&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary acquired this habit pretty late in his life; he has wonderful powers of absorption&mdash;can dance from one leg to the other when under pressure.  Anything that is done under the original Constitution and the legislation dependent therefrom is sacrosanct in the eyes of the Parliamentary Secretary.  If it was done then it must be right now.  That is one line of argument.  The next line of argument is: &ldquo;Ah! everything began with the 1937 Constitution.&rdquo;  When the Constitution was being discussed,  I said it was cod very largely.  Most of it was derived from the old Constitution; then all the trimmings and furbelows were put on to make it sound pious because, as we remember, Machiavelli enjoined that the politician should always appear pious and good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> By whatever fraud that pious and good instrument was sold to the people, there it is now and in our judgement, when you have to have a Constitution, you ought to abide by it and if you ask us why, our answer is because too-frequent invocation of the powers of the Supreme Court to negative legislation of this House is undesirable.  The Government are gravely answerable if they push themselves into a position of having legislation sponsored in this Parliament overturned in the Supreme Court too frequently.  Therefore, for that reason, if you have a Constitution, acknowledge the inconvenience or the restrictions it puts upon you, acknowledge that sometimes legislation which you would like to have you cannot have because of the Constitution.  That is one of its inconveniences.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, its very inflexibility has its blessings as we saw in the Sinn Féin funds case.  There the Government rolled legislation through this House over violent and indignant protests.  They then came up against the High Court and the Supreme Court and were obliged to come back and reverse engines.  Therefore, when you meet inconvenience it is well to recall the blessing of a rigid Constitution.</P>
    <P>These departures from the letter of the Constitution are departures of no fundamental importance.  This is the last intervention I shall make.  They are open to these two objections.  First they are an infringement of the Constitution, which is important and, second, for quite another reason, they are an effort to cash-in by a political Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, on the Irish language and to pretend they are so solicitous for its welfare that they never miss a chance of plastering it up somewhere.</P>
    <P>I want to say that this whole attitude is grossly offensive.  The Irish language does not require wooden legs of that kind.  The Irish language is not a two-legged stool; it can stand on its own bottom without being dragged like a tin can at the tail of every piece of legislation brought into this House. There is neither dignity nor prudence to be associated with this legislative <Col N="597" /> warning that you must begin every letter with &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo; and end it with &ldquo;Mise le meas mór&rdquo;; that the less Irish you know, the more important it is to begin every public speech with &ldquo;A Chairde Gael&rdquo; and that, whenever you get a chance of translating a phrase in an Act of Parliament just before a general election, you must wrap the Craobh na gCúig gCuigí around it and say: &ldquo;Now, hit me with the baby in my arms.&rdquo;  There is neither decency nor dignity in the figure of the Parliamentary Secretary treating the Irish language as the baby in his arms as he squares off to the constituents of North-East Dublin.  He ought to be able to get a quota there without any baby in his arms, but, if he requires a baby behind which to shelter, in ainm Dé, let it not be ár dteanga féin.</P>

He is trying to tell us that An Chúirt Athchomhaire Dheiridh is a different thing from the Court of Final Appeal. It is not; it is the same.  The Constitution, taken in its entirety with the English and Irish versions, finishes up with the end product of one court with two different names or a name and a translation: the Supreme Court and An Chúirt Uachtarach.  That is exactly what we have put into our Bill&mdash;one Court of Final Appeal as envisaged by the Constitution, and further, as envisaged by the Constitution, an Irish and English name.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Parliamentary Secretary does not see the distinction.  There is a precedent for the matter with which we are now dealing.  There are various officers of State to whom the Constitution refers. One is the head of the Judiciary. Another is the head of the Government. In Article 28.5.1. the Constitution says:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Whether you agree with that or whether you disagree with it, these are the terms of the Constitution and it would be perfectly proper in any legislation tendered by the Government, this Government or any other Government, that they would abide by that injunction of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Article 34. 4, subparagraph 2, says:</P>
      <P>The president of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice.</P>
      <P>Surely if we are to have any respect for this document we must read it in its own context.</P>
      <P>We know that the drafters of the Constitution when submitting it to the people for its approval consciously said that in respect of the head of the Government, commonly known as the Prime Minister, he shall be called the Taoiseach and, signs on it, when we address the Taoiseach in this House, when we meet him socially, when we refer to him in the ordinary course of conversation in this country we always say, &ldquo;This is the Taoiseach,&rdquo; always speak to him as &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; when we address him.  Frequently we are asked, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has been asked, &ldquo;What is that word you have used addressing the Prime Minister&rdquo; and we explain that in Ireland we call the Prime Minister the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anybody in this House when <Col N="603" /> he addresses the Chief Justice in English or when he meets him socially and speaks to him in English or when he introduces him or presents somebody to him say, &ldquo;This is the Priomh-Bhreitheamh?&rdquo; We do not, because the Constitution has laid down that the President of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice.  He is addressed in court by the customary title&mdash;I emphasise the word customary title&mdash;laid down by the custom of the courts but he is addressed on all other occasions as &ldquo;Chief Justice,&rdquo; he is spoken of as &ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo; and familiarity may carry one to &ldquo;C. J.&rdquo; but no one is going to say: &ldquo;Good morning P.B.&rdquo;</P>

Are we not all agreed that no degree of familiarity would suggest to any sane person in this country to meet the Chief Justice and say &ldquo;Good morning P.B.?&rdquo;  But, remember, if this piece of legislation is to stand, that is the appropriate address.  Can nobody see, quite apart from the argument based upon the sacrosanct character of the text of the Constitution, the fatuity and the humiliation that any rational and reputable person must feel at this prostitution of the Irish language?

Leaving all that aside, is not there something disreputable in this whole thing, which is so unnecessary and which is so degrading, not only to the language, but to ourselves?  It is this kind of thing that is making the language hated by so many of our people&mdash;the effort to force it down our throats.  It is that kind of thing which takes all joy and self-satisfaction from a person who uses the language and who would, speaking in Irish, triumphantly address the Chief Justice as &ldquo;a Phriomh Bhreitheamh,&rdquo; feeling it was a dignified, appropriate and proper thing to do.</P>
      <P>Is there anyone who doubts that hereafter these words will become associated in our minds with a sort of racket, a desire to make capital? That is the part of this proposal that revolts me but, strictly as a legislator, how does the Parliamentary Secretary claim to reconcile this legislation with the Constitution?  Article 28, subsection (5), paragraph (i) says:</P>
      <P>The head of the Government, or Prime Minister, shall be called, and is in this Constitution referred to as, the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>And Article 34, subsection 4, paragraph 2 says:</P>
      <P>The president of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that, certainly in <Col N="605" /> respect of this matter, there is a departure from the context of the Constitution itself?  If he does, will he not agree with me that is a procedure that should not be lightly undertaken? Surely this procedure is lightly undertaken for a wholly unworthy reason, a material departure from the context of the Constitution.  That being so, will he not even now realise that by every argument based upon Constitutional observance and decency in the matter, we should respect the accepted doctrine that has now been in universal practice, that the two languages should be treated on the basis of strict equality and proclaim by our legislation that the Irish language requires no fatuous and fortuitous assistance of the kind which it is attempted ineptly to give it by this proposed section of this Bill?</P>

      <P>If any test were to be made to decide whether there was any merit in this, it would be found in an examination of the consequences of making it compulsory in 1929 for all law students to pass a test in Irish before practising in the Courts. The effect of that has been to ridicule the Irish language among the legal profession because while there is nobody since then who has qualified, either at the Bar or in the solicitors profession, who does not hold a certificate of competency to carry out the duties of his profession through the medium of Irish&mdash;members of the solicitors profession must attain 75 per cent. in the examination before they can hold a certificate that they are competent to practise in Irish&mdash;not .005 of the profession would be able to do it.</P>
      <P>The reason is that something that should be cherished and respected in the legal profession is regarded as a joke.  In fact, if a student gets 30 per cent., or 25 per cent. on a second or third attempt or even, in one branch of the profession, if he sits or if he attends a grind given by the examiners, he will pass if all he can do is write his name in Irish.  Now we have an extension of this utter and complete farce, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows it to be, to the courts.</P>

    <P>I have discussed this matter with many members of the profession, many <Col N="606" /> of whom are proficient in Irish and use it outside the courts, and I have not been able to find one person who has found there is any merit whatever in the provision that is being enshrined in this Bill.  If we admit this, I believe we may yet find ourselves refusing medical assistance to persons who do not address a doctor as &ldquo;a dhoctúir&rdquo;. Or we will have some Minister like the Minister for Health refusing to reply to correspondence unless it begins with &ldquo;A Aire&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am talking on the right section.  This is merely an extension of the farce, fraud and make-believe of this disgusting attitude which is only building up disrespect for something for which we should have respect.</P>
      <P>We are being asked to put a section in the Bill making it mandatory to address certain judges of the court in a particular manner.  There is no point in doing this, it occurs to me, unless there is a sanction involved.  I wonder where the sanction is involved? The purpose of the amendment is to leave things as they are.  It is quite open to any person at the moment to address the court in Irish or to be heard in Irish and if the Irish movement had not been debased, demoralised and dragged into the gutter by a Party that endeavours to wrap the green flag around it for the good it imagines it can get as a consequence, then we would have people using Irish freely.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, seeing that he has so little else to do, might be well occupied in going to the courts to ascertain the number of summonses, civil bills or civil processes issued through the medium of Irish.  I think he would be a very dusty man before he comes across one of them except, perhaps, in the Gaeltacht areas.  Knowing all that, we are now going to make it mandatory for people to address the court in a particular manner.  It occurs to me that it is all so much hot air because practitioners in the court can choose to ignore it.</P>

      <P>It is very useful for us all that Deputy Ryan should have come in at this late stage to give us the benefit of his views.  It would have been well if, before he began to talk, he had read the section.  Subsection (2) (a) clearly gives both the Irish and English versions of the title of the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal if I may with the more responsible argument put up from the Opposition Benches.  It seems to me that the attack made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan can be divided into two parts.  In the first case, they were criticising the measure and the Government for introducing it, because of its implications on the revival of the language and, secondly, it is criticised because it is alleged that it is not in accordance with the Constitution. As regards the first case, I can only protest the sincerity of the Government in this matter.  Deputy Dillon himself said to us that we should have regard to the spirit of the Constitution.  The Constitution clearly envisages that our institutions of State should preferably be known by their Irish titles.  That is not an unfair inference to draw from the <Col N="608" /> various provisions of the Constitution, that in preference we should use the Irish forms for our national institutions. It is in pursuance of that spirit that the Government are doing this.</P>
    <P>By using this form of words, we are endeavouring to place the emphasis on the Irish title of the Chief Justice.  We make it absolutely clear in the section that the Chief Justice has two official titles, as it were.  He is the Chief Justice and he is An Príomh-Bhreitheamh.  That is enshrined in the section.  By the manner in which we do it, we make it clear that we want the emphasis placed on the Irish form of the Chief Justice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to deal with the Taoiseach or, as it says, An Príomh-Aire, the Constitution makes it clear that there is only one form of address, one title, the Irish form and no other. Therefore, if we were providing in an Act of the Oireachtas for anything to do with the Taoiseach, we would use <Col N="609" /> only the one form, &ldquo;Taoiseach,&rdquo; and we would refer to him throughout the Bill in the English and Irish version as &ldquo;Taoiseach.&rdquo;  When we come to Article 34 of the Constitution it clearly stipulates that the person who is president of the Court of Final Appeal or the Supreme Court, is to have a bilingual title.</P>

I want to drag him from the pit that looms before him. The Parliamentary Secretary has got <Col N="611" /> himself into a mess by the extraordinary procedure he has laid down in the Bill.  We are going to fall into this ludicrous situation repeatedly as a result of this effort to drag the language through the gutter of political expediency.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) reads: &ldquo;On the commencement of this Act, the Court of Final Appeal, which in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution, is to be called An Chúirt Uachtarach...&rdquo; We have adopted that.  We divided the House on it.</P>

Subsection (2) of the same section reads: &ldquo;The Supreme Court shall be constituted of the following judges ...&rdquo;.  Now may I say to the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;You cannot have it both ways.&rdquo;  The <i>hoi polloi</i> shall call the Supreme Court An Chúirt Uachtarach; in Ireland we all belong to the <i>hoi polloi</i> and therefore their ruling must be deemed to be universal. If it is, what shall we say if the first person to make a breach in it is the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the Bill; if we are all to call the Supreme Court An Chúirt Uachtarach and the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that is the spirit, not to speak of the heart, of the Constitution?  How come, if on the first occasion after that principle has been enunciated and defended in the Division Lobby by the Parliamentary Secretary, that he himself calls on Oireachtas Éireann individually and corporately to refer to this institution as the Supreme Court?

Our argument has been that if the English text of this Bill is to follow the Constitution, the subsection should read: &ldquo;On the commencement of this Act, the Court of Final Appeal, which in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution is to be called the Supreme Court, shall stand established&rdquo;, and that in the translation of the Bill the words &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; should be used.  We have been over-ruled on that and we are now directed by the majority decision of the House that we are to refer hereafter to the Supreme Court as An Chúirt Uachtarach.  I cannot imagine that for evermore the Parliamentary Secretary expects us to refer to the Supreme Court as &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach, the Supreme Court in brackets&rdquo;.  That cannot be his intention so, on his own subsection, we are to refer to it hereafter as An Chúirt Uachtarach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the fantastic situation that in the next subsection which he asks us to consider in Dáil Éireann, he requires us to describe what is now to be known as An Chúirt Uachtarach as the Supreme Court.  Can fantasy be carried further?  Can absurdity be carried further?  This is gross prostitution of the language to degrade the language and to degrade us until we are made to talk nonsense in our own legislation.  Has there ever been tendered to this House before, a Bill which in subsection (2) of Section 1 contradicts subsection (1)?  Has there ever been put before us a Bill which lays down a positive law in subsection (1) and violates it in subsection (2)?  Not in my memory.  That <Col N="613" /> absurdity has been thrust upon us in the name of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary feel no embarrassment?  If he does not, I should be glad if he would explain to me how he asks Oireachtas Éireann within one half-hour to be the first person in the State to ignore the provisions of its own legislation: In subsection (1) the Court of Final Appeal is to be known as &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach, the Supreme Court&rdquo;, in brackets, and in subsection (2) we read: &ldquo;the Supreme Court shall be constituted of the following judges&rdquo;.</P>

He attributes to me an argument which I did not make and very skilfully proceeds to tear the argument to shreds, knock it down and generally kick it around the floor of the House.  I do not think anyone can say that at any stage in this debate I maintained that An Chúirt Uachtarach alone was to be the title of the Court of Final Appeal.

The idea and the principle under the Constitution in any Act of Parliament of giving it a name and indicating that it has an alternative form to that name by putting the alternative form in brackets is not new.  It occurs in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  In one section we see: &ldquo;A Supreme Court of Justice <Col N="614" /> (Cúirt Bhreithiúnais Uachtarach)&rdquo; which clearly indicates that it has two names.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly when I find myself&mdash;and I did not know this until this debate started&mdash;reinforced by the precedent of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 which follows exactly the same line?  Section 5 of that Act gives us an English title, an Irish translation in brackets and from then on proceeds to drop the translation and refer exclusively to the English version.  There is no inconsistency and nothing to worry about.  The provisions are perfectly simple, logical and straightforward, absolutely in accord with the letter and spirit of the Constitution and to me completely satisfying in every way.</P>

      <P>It has to be kept in the framework in which it is put. We are so fond of the Irish language and we must show such a predilection for it that we establish a Supreme Court and a Cúirt Uachtarach.  We remember it has an English title and we put it in brackets.  In fact, we forget the Irish business.  Deputy Dillon referred to subsection (2) which deals with how the Supreme Court shall be constituted.  May I just anticipate what <Col N="616" /> will be said to-morrow ?  Would the House have a look at subsection (3) which says:</P>
      <P>The President of the High Court shall be <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) refers to it as the Suppreme Court.  The court is referred to always as the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>We forget all about the brackets and An Chúirt Uachtarach. &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; is mentioned once in subsection (3) and four times in subsection (4).  We have established a court and we have called it &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach (Supreme Court)&rdquo;. We move on and forget all about the Cúirt Uachtarach; we forget about the brackets.  It is just &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo;.  My amendment is addressed to the Chief Justice and the President. This piece of legislation says &ldquo;An Príomh-Bhreitheamh (The Chief Justice)&rdquo;. I want to take out the phrase &ldquo;An Príomh-Bhreitheamh&rdquo; and the brackets so that it will read: &ldquo;the president thereof, namely, the Chief Justice&rdquo; and why?  Because Article 34, Section 4, subsection 2 of the Constitution says that &ldquo;The President of the Supreme Court shall be called the Chief Justice&rdquo;.  There are no brackets and there is no &ldquo;Príomh-Bhreitheamh&rdquo;. I want it to be in accordance with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Does that argument not make the Parliamentary Secretary realise the absurdity of the situation into which we are working ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I not explained the reason?  The explanation I gave was perfectly valid and simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seeks to draw a comparison with the Act of 1924.  I would not regard that as final.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary need hasten back to every piece of legislation passed 40 years ago and say they did it then and <Col N="617" /> that it is right to do it now.  Even if they did and if the Parliamentary Secretary says he prefers to shelter under these precedents, he must search the Act of 1924 for any precedents that will justify what he now seeks to do.  In the Act of 1924, they speak of a High Court of Justice (An Ard-Chúirt Bhreithiúnais) and a Supreme Court of Justice (Cúirt Bhreithiúnais Uachtarach) and thereafter they speak of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary seeks to do in this Bill is the exact opposite of that.  Instead of taking the words which are the dominant words and repeating them throughout his whole Bill, he takes the words out of the brackets and drops the dominant word which he says the whole purpose of the Bill is to make sacrosanct and of universal usage.  Is it not fantastic to work himself into a passion to justify subsection (1) of this Bill if he himself is to be the first person to set it at nought and not only the first person to set it at nought but to require the whole of the Oireachtas to disregard it?  Surely that breathes of the stink of fraud?</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary it is almost certain that the original draft of this Bill was the commencement of this Act and then somebody had a brainwave.  The Minister for Defence says: &ldquo;I will allow no promotions in the Army unless the man says: `Cé chaoi bhfuil tú ar maidin, a Aire.' &rdquo; If he replies: `Tá mé go maith&rdquo; and he is expected to say: &ldquo;Buíochas le Dia&rdquo; and does not say it, he is a second lieutenant for the rest of his life.  In pursuance of that, they said: &ldquo;Let us put in an amendment.  It is to be called An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;&mdash;Supreme Court in brackets.</P>
      <P>Everybody said it was not a bad tag at all.  The Deputy from Meath will campaign up and down county Meath like a madman as the Gael of Gaels on this grand new piece of legislation.</P>
