      <P>In relation to the first part of the Question what I said was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No sane person could think that such murderous activities serve any national purpose.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Indeed, it is becoming increasingly impossible to believe that there is not some sinister influence which directs these outbreaks of violence, in their manner and in their timing, so as to do maximum damage to the nation's interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not wish to add to, or subtract from, this.</P>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the Question, the Gardaí do not have information as to the extent that these activities are being helped by foreign nationals.</P>

      <P>The only available estimates of new jobs created date from 1st January, 1957.  These relate to new industrial undertakings and extensions of existing undertakings, involving a capital investment of not less than £10,000, which came to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as having commenced production since that date.  Up to 30th September, 1961, the estimated initial employment involved in these projects was 10,800 and estimated potential employment 18,400.</P>

      <P>National expenditure on health forms part of the total expenditure on the gross national product.  On account of the difficulty of estimating private expenditure on health it is not possible to make reliable estimates of total health expenditure.  Figures are available, however, of the net health expenditure by health authorities (including transfer payments to the personal sector but excluding capital expenditure). <Col N="1216" /> The net health expenditure expressed as a percentage of total expenditure on the gross national product at current market prices in each of the years 1957-58 to 1960-61 was:</P>

      <P>The Consumer Price Index is at present weighted according to the pattern of expenditure of households in towns and villages throughout the country on the basis of the Household Budget Inquiry 1951-52 adjusted to the August 1953 price level. No similar information is available in relation to households in rural areas to establish a system of index number weights related to their consumption. Periodic returns of prices can be obtained only in centres with an adequate range of shops to provide suitable data.  In addition the preparation of a variety of index numbers of consumers' prices is not considered desirable, particularly since investigations have shown that the differences in the trends of prices for different classes of the community do not differ markedly.</P>

      <P>The rates of allowances specified in the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations are maximum rates and the amount payable in any particular instance is at the discretion of the health authority, within the specified maximum applicable to the case.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of the allowances is to encourage persons suffering from the specified infectious diseases to undergo treatment by guaranteeing a measure of financial assistance while they are under treatment.  In determining the amount of allowance payable in any particular case, income from other sources, including social welfare benefits, is ordinarily taken into account. A health authority has discretion, in cases in which undue hardship would be caused, if income from other sources, including social welfare allowances, were taken into account, to disregard such income in whole or in part.  I cannot accept that there is a case for singling out, for exceptional treatment, payments under the social welfare code.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statements referred to.  They were contained in an unsigned article, under the heading &ldquo;A Rumble from the Periphery,&rdquo; and were subsequently reprinted in a Dublin evening newspaper. They impute that I and members of my staff have been corrupt by showing favour in the making of a public appointment.  This imputation is related to an alteration made in June last in the qualifications declared for posts of district medical officer.  In view of its serious nature, I feel that it is necessary for me to deal with the matter at some length, and I would ask the indulgence of the Dáil accordingly.</P>
      <P>The first of these referred to an alteration made in June last in the qualifications declared for posts of district medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30th September, 1960, I had introduced, for the first time, an upper age limit of 50 into the qualifications for such posts.  This followed a decision, taken as a matter of general policy, shortly before that date, to introduce upper age limits for a variety of medical posts in the local authority service. As is customary in such cases, the declared qualifications provided that the age limit would not apply to persons who were already pensionable officers of a local authority in the <Col N="1222" /> State.  That exception has not been impugned by the Association.</P>
    <P>Subsequently it was brought to my notice that, while the position of persons already in the permanent service of a local authority had been equitably dealt with, no account had been taken of the position of doctors who, over long periods, had given satisfactory service to local authorities in a temporary capacity.  It will be within the recollection of many members of the House that in the Dublin area there were doctors who throughout periods of 18, 14, 6½, 5, 4 years and for shorter periods had served in a temporary capacity as district medical officers because, for a variety of reasons into which it is not necessary to enter now, recruitment to permanent dispensary posts in the area was suspended. I felt that it would be unreasonable in these special circumstances to debar such persons from the opportunity, now that recruitment to permanent posts in Dublin had been resumed, of competing for such posts because of the new upper age limit introduced, such a short time previously. Accordingly, on 30th June last, I amended the age qualification so as to provide that in reckoning age a prospective candidate who had been an officer of a local authority for a minimum period of six months might deduct from his age half the aggregate of all periods of temporary service in excess of six months, subject to a maximum deduction of five years.  The amended qualification was not related specifically to the competition then in question but has application to all competitions for posts as district medical officer.</P>
    <P>This action is now stated in the official organ of the Irish Medical Association to have been taken &ldquo;to enable someone to compete who was over age and had not got a permanent post before he was fifty years of age.&rdquo; Later there is a reference to &ldquo;the person he went to so much trouble for&rdquo;.  Clearly, therefore, the accusation is that the action was taken in the interests of a particular individual.  In fact, as I have shown, it was taken in favour, not of an individual, but of a class.</P>
    <P>The statement goes on as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" />&ldquo;If influence like this could be brought to bear on the Minister, could it not also persuade him to pack the Selection Board, with his Medical Inspectors (who may have got their posts, because better qualified candidates would not apply, when the Association did not consider the terms satisfactory and listed them under the &ldquo;Important Notice&rdquo;) to select the person he went to so much trouble for?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to the quotation I would point out, first of all, that the competition was conducted by the Local Appointments Commissioners and consequently the composition of the selection board was determined by those Commissioners and not by me.  The Commissioners have complete autonomy in such matters and consequently, even if I were so minded, which I was not, there could be no question of my &ldquo;packing&rdquo; the selection board, with Medical Inspectors or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the second place, as is by now within the knowledge of the many persons who appeared before the selection board, of the four members of the board only one was a medical inspector.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a medical inspector or other officer of my Department serving on a selection board is a free agent and is morally bound to exercise his judgment in complete accord with the dictates of his conscience.  I am satisfied that the medical inspector who served on the board now in question acted accordingly.  No suggestion was made to him by me or by any person on my behalf that he should show favour to any candidate.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the implication that medical inspectors are inferior in qualification or in character to other members of their profession because they competed for their posts in face of an &ldquo;Important Notice&rdquo; issued by the Irish Medical Association is devoid of any foundation.  Apart from the fact that experience has shown that doctors of the highest character and professional skill have refused to be influenced by the manoeuvring of the Association in regard to appointments in the public <Col N="1224" /> service, so far as I have been able to trace, none of the permanent medical inspectors was recruited while an &ldquo;Important Notice&rdquo; operated in relation to the grade.</P>
    <P>The persons responsible for this gross libel on me and on their professional colleagues serving as medical inspectors in my Department are well aware of the procedure for the filling of permanent posts in the public service.  This is apparent from the fact that in their &ldquo;Important Notices&rdquo; by which they seek to boycott certain competitions (posts as district medical officer have so far escaped the boycott) they counsel their members not to sit on interview boards for such competitions without first communicating with the Medical Secretary of the Association.</P>
    <P>In this House on 15th ultimo, I stated, in relation to the phraseology of the duty requiring certain medical staffs in the local authority service to furnish information, if required, to medical practitioners nominated by me, that &ldquo;if the Irish Medical Association wishes to discuss it and puts me in a position to receive a deputation for that purpose, I shall be glad to do so&rdquo;.  Following publication of that statement I received a letter from the Medical Secretary stating that &ldquo;my Association is prepared to meet you to discuss the redrafting of the regulations&rdquo;.</P>

Included in that material was <Col N="1226" /> this grossly offensive and libellous article, suggesting by innuendo that I and a medical member of my Department had conspired to make an improper appointment.  I now propose to reply to the Association to the effect that I am not prepared to meet its representatives until: (i) the Association ceases its attempt to interfere with the proper working of, and in particular recruitment to the Health Service, and (ii)  it causes to be published in its Journal an absolute retraction of the innuendoes contained in the article and a satisfactory apology for having made them; this, of course, would be without prejudice to any other procedure which may be available to my officers to vindicate their honour and reputation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Revenue Commissioners have reason to believe that there have been grave evasions of customs duty in the case of textile imports, and, if so, what was the extent of the evasions; what methods were adopted to evade the appropriate duties; whether such acts constitute fraud and are criminal acts punishable by the law; how many firms were involved; what was the approximate loss sustained by the revenue; what action he proposes to take in the matter; and <Col N="1229" /> if he will make a statement as to the serious damage done to Irish textile manufacturers as a result of those frauds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ascertained from the Revenue Commissioners that they have under investigation a number of instances in which they are satisfied there has been evasion of customs duty on imported textile goods in circumstances rendering the importers liable to the penal provisions of the Customs laws.  As the enforcement of these provisions is vested in the Revenue Commissioners, it would be improper for me to intervene.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that it would not be in the public interest to require the Commissioners to disclose the details of the matters involved.  They have, however, informed me that it cannot be assumed that the interests of Irish textile manufacturers have been adversely affected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in view of the severe financial losses suffered by importers of goods subject to special levies in respect of goods imported within a few days of the abolition of such levies on which such levies were paid he will sympathetically consider making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to such importers by way of relief of their losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a customs duty is abolished there is no provision in law for refunding the duty paid on goods which have been cleared through the Customs prior to the date on which the duty was abolished.  In such cases it frequently happens that duty is paid on goods which are cleared shortly before the duty is abolished.  Whilst I understand the difficulties involved for the importers of such goods I could not contemplate making <i>ex gratia</i> payments of the type envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3rd August, 1961, I announced that, having considered the report of an Inter-Departmental Committee set up to examine general conditions prevailing on inhabited islands off the coast, the Government had decided to set up a permanent Inter-Departmental Committee to co-ordinate the activities of Government Departments in relation to the islands and, in particular, to examine and to act as a clearing medium for projects relating to the islands involving action by more than one Department.</P>
      <P>I further announced that the Government had, at the same time, approved of the following measures:</P>
      <P> (1) A scheme similar to the Gaeltacht islands bottled gas scheme would be extended to non-Gaeltacht islands which have no electricity or little prospect of obtaining it.</P>
      <P>(2) Telephone services would be provided for four additional islands, namely, Inishmeane, Co. Donegal; Achillbeg, Co. Mayo, Inishturk, Co. Galway, and Long Island, Co. Cork.</P>
      <P>(3) The question of improving island landing facilities would be sympathetically considered and, in particular, an Exchequer grant would be made available to meet the cost of extending the pier at Kilronan on Inishmore in the Aran Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Additional Exchequer grants up <Col N="1234" /> to £5,000 a year would be provided for the improvement of county and accommodation roads on the islands.</P>
    <P>(5) A scheme would be prepared for the award of a limited number of State scholarships for island children; and</P>
    <P>(6) Local authorities would be asked to pay particular attention to housing conditions on the islands in the survey of housing conditions in their areas which they were recently asked to carry out.  </P>
    <P>Action on these measures has been, or is being, taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Owing to the exceptional pressure of work on law reform and other matters, it has proved impossible to complete the index within the time indicated in my reply.  The material for the period 1948/1958 is now virtually ready for printing but it has been decided, in view of the unavoidable delay, that it would be preferable to bring the index down to the end of 1960.  This revision is now in progress and the work is expected to be ready for the printer in the near future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for External Affairs made a statement on 1st December about the return of Dr. Cruise O'Brien to the service of the Department of External Affairs.  This statement was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. O'Brien wrote me about a week ago asking that I approach the Acting Secretary-General to seek his return to the Department of External Affairs of Ireland.  I then wrote to the Acting Secretary-General expressing this request a couple of days after that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dr. Connor Cruise O'Brien, in a letter addressed this evening to the Minister for External Affairs in New York, informed him of his decision to resign from the public service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Monday, 4th instant, the Minister made a further statement on the subject, arising out of the statement issued by Dr. O'Brien after he had resigned from the public service.  This further statement included the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In regard to Dr. O'Brien's resignation from the Irish service I may say that he resigned entirely on his own initiative.&rdquo;</P>

Does he consider it fair on the part of an industry established by Government initiative to adopt such measures against a certain section of the community?</P>

      <P>I do not know the day-to-day business of the Sugar Company but I should imagine they would be glad to afford an opportunity to every farmer, not only in West Cork but everywhere else, to grow beet for their concern, if they could handle it and market it.  The fact they have confined themselves to those who have been supplying beet for a number of years is a proof that they cannot do better than they are doing.  I understand that three or four years ago it was possible for farmers in south-west Cork to contract <Col N="1260" /> with the Sugar Company, if they so desired, and they did not do so.  Even though I have no responsibility for the decisions of the Sugar Company, I do not think it unreasonable that in these circumstances the company should decide to continue to give the contracts to those who have been, as it were, their constant customers.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the main reason the company do not give the contracts is to save subsidising transport?  In other words, the Company are anxious to get the beet grown as near as possible to the factories, thereby saving themselves transport costs or the subsidisation of transport.  That is not fair in the case of a nationalised industry and it is the Minister's duty to see that those responsible carry out the service they are supposed to give on a national basis.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will introduce legislation to re-enact the repealed provisions of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, so as to enable the Labour Court to investigate disputes regarding the wages and conditions of employment of agricultural workers employed by the State and drainage workers employed by the Office of Public Works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it necessary to introduce some other type of legislation to enable these people to have their just wage claims considered, in view of the fact that some of them have now reached the bottom of the wage scale because the right of appeal to the Labour Court has been taken from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally desirable that the State should not lead in the matter of wages, that wage rates should be fixed by agreement between employers in the private sector and employees, and that the remuneration of State workers should follow the rates voluntarily fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Board of Works rural labourers <Col N="1282" /> in particular follow the lowest rate in the area rather than the highest?  Does he not consider that in their case, particularly, something should be done to get back to the situation that operated nine or ten years ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The position appears to have deteriorated further in so far as there is considerable hardship being imposed on the workers themselves and on the travelling public. Various prominent persons in Cork, including trade union leaders, have tried to solve this matter and it appears that the Minister is about the only person left who could intervene or whose intervention would be acceptable.  Therefore, I would ask him to try to bring about an amicable settlement before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy the difficulties confronting me in taking any action by way of intervention but I would urge very seriously on the workers in question, in the interests of themselves, of trade unionism and of the country, that they should accept the advice already offered to them by their own trade unions.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure the Minister must be aware of the genuine conviction on matters of principle which appears to obtain on both sides of this dispute and, indeed, on the trade union side as well.  Is he not aware that it requires somebody of his status as an individual, outside his status as Minister, to get over this unhappy state of affairs in his own constituency?</P>

      <P>Kerry County Council have already been allocated a 100% <Col N="1285" /> grant for a specific road under the scheme of special grants for roads affected by recent railway closings. Having regard to the limited funds available for such grants and the several demands on these funds, a second allocation to the county out of these funds is not possible.  This year the council have a special grant of £55,000 for the improvement of tourist roads as well as a Main Road Improvement Grant of £58,000, and it is open to them to consider the claims of the road in question for improvement out of those resources.  I have replied on these lines to the resolution from the Council referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistical information requested is in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Road Fund grants are not based on the number of motor vehicles registered in each area, but on the mileage and condition of roads in each case, subject to the overall limit on the amount available for distribution. Both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have received a substantial increase in their Road Fund allocations in recent years.  The total amount of these allocations for 1961/ 62 will be about £376,000 more than in 1959/60.  Furthermore, the major part of a special provision of £500,000 for the arterial roads leading out of Dublin has not yet been taken up.  I cannot agree in the circumstances with the suggestion that the areas in question are inequitably treated as regards Road Fund grant.</P>

It is not open to the interpretation suggested by the Deputy.  Under the law, the sums referred to must be regarded as forming part of the figure of £165 of yearly cash income which may be disregarded, in accordance with the concession introduced as from 1st August last, when assessing the means of the elder member of a married couple who fulfil the necessary conditions.</P>

      <P>The financial arrangements under which salaries are paid to clerks of old age pension committees and sub-committees are in force since 1935 at which time they were presented to the Oireachtas.  These arrangements have not, hitherto, been the subject of complaints, but I am aware that in a few instances recently there were delays in the making of the quarterly payments due to delay in the return to the Department of forms issued to clerks for certification.  It may be that it is to these delays that the Deputy is referring.  As to the question of paying the salaries of clerks on a monthly basis I should explain that clerks are appointed on a part-time basis only: their duties, generally speaking, occupy very little time and the salaries paid to the great majority of them are very small.  Because of this, it may be that the payment of salaries to them on a quarterly basis rather than on a monthly basis is a better arrangement.  In view of the Deputy's request, however, I am having the question examined in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, Sir, that what is involved here is the prestige of the National Parliament.  That is being brought into disrepute by all these proceedings.  If we cannot get respect for the rulings of the Chair the House will be turned into a bear garden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question is whether the rulings of the Chair will be obeyed.  If we cannot get respect for the rulings of the Chair, all our proceedings will end in confusion and disorder.  I would urge upon everybody who has respect for the National Parliament to accept the rulings of the Chair, whether he agrees with them or not.  If we do not work in this way, we just cannot work at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, without departing from the merits of the issues involved, to endorse most emphatically what the Taoiseach has just said.  I take the gravest possible view of the proceedings at present in progress in this House.  There is a simple issue involved here.  It is a simple, net issue and nothing need be added to it.  Are we in this Parliament prepared to support the authority of the Chair?  The day we cease to do that, Parliament ceases to function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned for no other matter than to ensure that democratic Parliamentary institutions will survive <Col N="1335" /> and will in our society prove themselves equal to any emergency or any problem with which our people happen at any time to be confronted.  The indispensable <i>sine qua non</i> of that is, whether any one of us or any group of us agree or disagree with the ruling of the Chair, we should accept it.  We have the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House to turn to if we wish to have those rulings reviewed or we can put down a motion and have any ruling of the Ceann Comhairle reviewed in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>I endorse emphatically what the Taoiseach has said.  I appeal to all Deputies on whatever side to accept the view which he has expressed, and which I now support, and preserve Parliament and keep freely within our hands the right to administer the affairs of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We tried on our side to make an effective protest against what we considered to be an unfair attitude of the Chair when permission was sought from the Chair to discuss what we regarded as a matter of grave public importance.  When that motion was submitted to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was not allowed to support the proposal that the House do adjourn to consider what we in turn considered to be a matter of grave national importance. There will be no real opportunity to discuss this matter up to, I suppose, 14th February.  Any action which the Labour Party has taken is not so much a gesture against the ruling of the Chair as against what seemed to be the decision of the Government not to allow time to discuss this matter.  We have as much respect for the Chair, whether the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as any other Party in this House.</P>

      <P>The Chair exercises only delegated authority, that is, the delegated authority of the House.  If any Deputy flouts the authority of the Chair, he is flouting the authority of the House.  The Chair exercised that authority this afternoon in saying that a certain matter was not permissible for discussion.  That authority was exercised after very careful and long consideration.  It had no prejudice in any way.  It endeavoured to consider the merits and demerits of the matter. It had very little notice that the matter was to be raised.  The matter was discussed in a rather protracted way previously and the ruling was based upon those considerations.  If Deputies think it would help matters, I suggest that we adjourn for 15 minutes, I must ask Deputy McAuliffe, who is still here, to leave the Chamber.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure how we stand in that regard at the moment, seeing that the two Deputies whose names are appended to the motion have been suspended from the service of the Dáil and I understand that Deputy Dunne is not ready to go on with his Bill.  So that, if the Local Authorities (Works) Act motion falls for any reason arising out of the situation that has arisen, I gather it is the Labour Party's Housing Bill which <Col N="1339" /> will be next and which we are ready to take at 9 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some comment on some of the items which appear in this Supplementary Estimate.  First of all, I welcome the contribution of £4,000 to Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  I feel it is only right and just that voluntary effort and self-help should be assisted where possible by Government agencies working in the same field.  Macra na Feirme, in particular, has made a notable contribution to the promotion of agricultural education during the 15 years since its foundation.  I believe that in the future Macra will play a still more vital role and for that reason I welcome the contribution.  While welcoming the contribution from the Government to this voluntary organisation, I sincerely hope that the organisation will be allowed to control its own affairs and that there will be no strings attached to this grant.</P>
      <P>The marketing of dairy produce is a matter which vitally affects the constituency I have the honour to represent. The recent action of the British Government, while it has come as a surprise to many people, was not, however, entirely unexpected by those who are closely associated with the dairying industry.  One thing the butter crisis has done is to force us into a realisation that we must take immediate action to find manufacturing outlets for our milk other than butter manufacture.  In this impasse, there seem to be a number of alternative lines of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we might endeavour to increase the home consumption of milk and milk products.  Secondly, we could try to find an alternative market for our butter.  Thirdly, we could divert our surplus milk into alternative markets such as powdered milk and so on.  Fourthly, there is the proposal which was put forward yesterday by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association and I compliment that organisation on putting forward one practical solution to this problem.  We have very little scope for increasing the home consumption of milk and milk products.  Our per capita consumption <Col N="1341" /> of butter is pretty high by European standards but there is however, scope for increasing the consumption on the home market of milk and cheese.  I believe that a well directed sales promotion campaign through the medium of the Press, the radio and television, when we have it, could go a long way towards increasing the consumption of milk and cheese by the Irish people.  Our consumption of cheese is pretty low by European or international standards and there is considerable scope for increasing it.  In regard to looking for alternative markets for our butter I believe there might be slight hope there, but not very much.</P>
    <P>If Bord Bainne tackled this business in a determined fashion it might be possible to find another market for our butter outside of Britain.  It might be worth while exploring the American market in view of the large number of Irish people, or people of Irish extraction, living in the United States.  With regard to improving outlets for supplies of milk, cheese offers quite a good alternative.  An argument has been put forward that the production of better quality cheese has been held up by reason of the fact that our farmers are not producing the high quality milk required to manufacture the more specialised or luxury type of cheese.  If the dairy farmers are given an incentive to produce that better quality milk needed for high class cheese production sufficient milk to meet the demand will be produced.</P>
    <P>What has happened up to now is that the farmers have been told that a special high quality milk is needed for powdered milk and for cheese and have been told to get their byres into the hygienic condition that is necessary and have still received only the same prices for their milk.  If we give them an incentive we shall get the results.</P>
    <P>There is chaos in regard to what I would call the manufacturing organisation in relation to milk.  The whole situation is disorganised.  In County Limerick, which produces roughly 43,000,000 gallons of milk per annum, much of the milk requires a considerable amount of transport each day to <Col N="1342" /> Dungarvan, Rathmore and Mallow. If we want to go into international markets with milk production we must localise our manufacturing end in the dairying and milk producing areas.  It was a ridiculous thing to erect a cheese factory in County Wexford and I do not know the reason for doing so.  There is room for centralising the manufacture of milk products and these industries should be on a large scale.  The city of Limerick, being in the centre of the dairying industry, would be an ideal place for such an industry.</P>
    <P>Another item dealt with in the Supplementary Estimate, the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, is also a matter which vitally affects the constituency I represent.  I am sorry to say that the progress of this scheme has not been at all satisfactory in County Limerick and I would go so far as to say that it has been a colossal failure there.  If there is an annual report at the end of the year dealing with the progress of the scheme, it will show that it has been a failure in County Limerick.  I suggest the Minister might review this scheme, taking into account the peculiar circumstances relating to County Limerick, where there is a very high number of dairy cows and where the incidence of bovine tuberculosis is 49.2 per cent. Practically half the dairy cows have gone down in the test.  A new approach must be adopted and I would suggest an incentive, by way of extra bonus on the gallon of milk, to be given to farmers in the creamery areas.  I wish to compliment the Agricultural Institute on the excellent work it has been doing.  Agricultural research is vitally important, especially in the highly competitive era we are about to enter; but I believe agricultural research is going only half way, unless the fruits of it can be brought to the farmer's doorstep.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Faculty of Agriculture at U.C.D., again it is necessary that the results of research be brought to the farmer.  We need an agricultural advisory service to do that.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that we are now exporting agricultural graduates.  Last week, I saw off a <Col N="1343" /> friend of mine, an agricultural graduate, who was going to Nigeria, along with four of his friends to take up work there.  In the previous week, five others had left.  Over the past couple of years, graduates are working in occupations for which they have not been trained, in vocational schools and so on, while the agricultural advisory service is starved for lack of graduates. We are producing an adequate number but we are not absorbing them into employment.  I cannot see how we can survive in the Common Market without an agricultural advisory service comparable with the advisory services in other progressive agricultural countries.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if in fact that £50,000 has not already been completely spent by An Foras Talúntais and if the original Estimate, given here as £450,000, is correct.  Is it not a fact that An Foras Talúntais asked for almost £200,000 more?  When An Foras Talúntais, or the Agricultural Institute, if you prefer to call it that, was originally set up, it was financed from American funds.  A solemn guarantee was given by the Government that any money necessary for running the Agricultural Institute would be provided.  My information is that that guarantee has not been honoured.  As a matter of fact, not alone have the Institute been unable to carry out necessary schemes which it felt should be carried out, but it has now reached the stage where it is finding it very difficult to pay the extremely low wages paid to the people who work on its farms throughout the country.</P>
      <P>On one farm, Johnstown Castle, Wexford, arrangements have been made for the determination of the employment of approximately 15 working men.  One of the main reasons given for this is that the Institute has not got the money to continue them in employment.  The case has been made publicly by the representatives of the Institute that that is so.  The trade union I have the honour to represent had a Labour Court case against the Institute some time ago.  During the hearing of that case the officials representing the Institute said the main reason they were unable to pay the higher wages our members were asking was that they had not got the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Agricultural Institute is to carry out the task for which it was set up and if it is to prepare our farmers for entry into the fierce competition of the Common Market, if we get in, then it is a scandal that the Government are not providing it with the necessary funds.  It is true that, from the money <Col N="1345" /> provided from an American source, funds were made available by the Institute for the purchase of farms throughout the country.  It is still working on that.  Originally it had a certain amount of income from invested capital, but it is eating into that because of the fact that it has been getting less than its running costs from the Government for some time past.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to treat this matter very seriously.  The Institute is being used as an umbrella by the Government in order to meet criticism that they are not preparing the farmers for entry into the Common Market.  There is no use in doing that when the umbrella is full of holes, as I believe it is, and cannot be repaired because the money is not available. When we are dealing with sums like the £10,300,000 in this Estimate, £50,000 is a very small sum and £450,000, the sum it has got already, is a relatively small sum, if the Institute is to be expected to do a good job.  The previous speaker referred to the training and employment of our future instructors.  If any progress is to be made, the necessary moneys must be made available.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to let the House know if it is a fact that the Institute is not getting the money it requires to carry on its ordinary day-to-day business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening the debate for this side of the House, Deputy Dillon described the Minister's statement as a dismal fiasco.  Bearing in mind the circumstances of the farming community throughout the country at present, I would accept that description as a fair one.  I think there is one bright spot, and it is only right and proper that we should acknowledge it.  Unlike my friend, Deputy T. O'Donnell, I think that bright spot is the present satisfactory rate of progress being made in the eradication of boving tuberculosis.  I think that fact should be acknowledged and it is only right that a tribute should be paid to the Minister and the officials of his Department who are responsible for this progress which is, in part, due to the help and co-operation which the county committees of agriculture have <Col N="1346" /> given in an effort to further this very important work.</P>
      <P>Speaking recently, the Minister generalised in criticising the lack of interest displayed by county committees of agriculture.  That criticism was very much resented by committees who had worked very hard to bring about the desirable position in which we now find ourselves.  We are making very rapid progress at the present time.  The Minister should accordingly endeavour to seek co-operation in counties where committees of agriculture are not doing their bit because this is one of the most urgent and important jobs that remains to be done in agriculture in this country.</P>
      <P>When we turn to the sub-head dealing with the Pigs and Bacon Commission, I am sorry I do not find the picture quite so bright.  I feel there is widespread dissatisfaction with the Pigs and Bacon Commission and I think the Minister for Agriculture should tell us what, in fact, the Commission have been doing over the years in which they have been in existence.  The present position on the British market is that the Danes are getting 260/- per cwt. for their pigs, the British are getting 245/-, the Dutch 236/-, the Poles 236/-, the Hungarians 231/-, Northern Ireland 230/-, the Swedes 221/- and the Irish 215/-. That does not indicate much progress on the part of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
      <P>The Danes, for Grade B bacon, get 235/-, the Dutch get 217/- and the English Grade B bacon is paid for at the rate of 220/- a cwt.  That gives us a fairly vivid picture of our position in relation to other countries supplying the British market.  It means we are getting 45/- less per pig than the Danes and 21/- per pig less than the Dutch. Furthermore, it indicates the position in which we will find ourselves when we enter the Common Market.  My feeling is that, as a result of progeny testing in this country, we have not got the raw material and that we will have to go outside, probably to Sweden, if we are to get the type of pig which will produce bacon comparable to that produced by the Danes and the Dutch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> I shall now pass to the losses on the disposal of wheat.  We are asked here for £900,000 to meet losses on the disposal of wheat.  It is fair to say that, if the Minister were to gather the results of tests carried out on samples of wheat taken in America, in Sweden, and in England and by the Institute here, he will find that these losses could be reduced by something in the region of £600,000, if he accepts that a much higher percentage of Irish wheat could be included in the grist.  There is nothing we can do about this loss at the present time; we must accept it and pay for it, but I think that when the Minister comes in here for this extra money he should be able to tell us he will institute effective measures to ensure in future that this sort of situation will not arise and that the position will not be allowed to continue in which the millers are both judge and jury in their own cause and in the definition of millability.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to refer to the Farm Building Scheme.  That scheme is making very good progress at the moment but there is one matter I should like to mention in respect to it. The people who are carrying out this scheme, the farm building inspectors, have been very unfairly discriminated against in the matter of salary.  If we are to get the progress we hope for, the Minister should have their position reviewed. They have been unfairly treated and we are unlikely to get the co-operation we should, unless we remedy their position.  In this respect, excellent work is being done where there is co-operation between the present construction instructors employed by the county vocational education committees and this scheme but I think there is room for the employment by the vocational committees of more of these instructors.  There is room also for more co-operation between the vocational committees and the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Supplementary Estimate there are several items which we need to discuss.  The most important, to my mind, is that referring to losses in the disposal of wheat.  Are those losses to continue? <Col N="1348" /> Will the Department of Agriculture bring forward any scheme by which the growing of wheat by conacre and by foreign ranchers will be ended in this country?  The man growing 600 or 700 acres of wheat can afford to sell each barrel at a low profit.  That is no use to the ordinary tillage farmer, but that is the condition to which wheat growing has been reduced here. Ordinary tillage farmers have been driven away from wheat growing, a business which has now become a competition between the ranchers.  It is high time the Department of Agriculture got down to preparing some feasible scheme under which wheat growing can be set out in contract to the ordinary small tillage farmer so that this ranching system will be ended.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately most of the items in this Supplementary Estimate have been overshadowed by our position in the British market in relation to our butter export.  In this matter we are dealing with an unscrupulous enemy and I make no bones about stating that.  On any occasion that they find softness anywhere they are very apt to drive their wedge in and, unfortunately, in 1956 they found that softness here.  Without any word of protest, we had on exports of sugar and sugar products from this country, an imposition amounting to £16 a ton.  I endeavoured to find the figures paid in that respect last year.  I could not find them but I am sure close to £1,000,000 was paid to Britain, between levy and duties on sugar alone.  That was done through downright neglect on the part of the Government responsible at that time.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition said at Column 1411, Volume 183 of the Dáil Debates of 12th July, 1960:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>. . . I understand that goods containing Irish sugar are being subjected to a very formidable levy, the proceeds of which are devoted to the subsidisation of goods of similar quality containing sugar derived from Crown Colonies of the British Crown.  I am told, I think, by some of the Minister's colleagues, that when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry <Col N="1349" /> and Commerce, this matter arose and that he did not consider it desirable to press the interpretation of Article V which would give us the right to claim exemption from that levy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to that.  I have no recollection of hearing the matter discussed when I was a member of the inter-Party Government, although it could have happened and passed out of my memory but I do not remember it and I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Norton.  Whatever attitude was taken up, I should like to be told now because frankly I confess that as I see it now, it appears that that Article is wide enough and comprehensive enough to cover the present procedure under which I believe that goods which are the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland are being put at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks are related to the further step taken by Britain in regard to our butter and I am saying that five years ago Britain made the first move and, through the incompetence of the Government of the day and their technical advisers, was allowed happily to continue to collect each year to the detriment of our farmers.  We had an example here today from both Deputy Murphy and Deputy S. Collins of what has happened&mdash;protests because the extra acreage of beet could not be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason the extra acerage of beet could not be given was that there is a levy against <Col N="1350" /> us in the export market of £16 a ton on all sugar exported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact and I am suggesting to this Government that it is time they got a move on to remedy that.  I have here the trade statistics from January to August, 1961.  They show that while we exported to Britain from January to August of this year £70,451,000 worth of produce, we imported from them £78,914,000.  That means we bought from Britain £9,000,000 more than she took from us. That is the position from which we should operate.  If Britain can put a tariff or a duty on the produce of our farmers, I do not see why we cannot collect that money for the farmers by a tariff on the £79,000,000 worth of goods Britain is importing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You would be hurting all your friends then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only way to deal with the situation.  According to this amazing table of imports, we imported agricultural tractors from Britain to the extent of £1,421,000 and £6,407,000 worth of motor cars.  I am sure Continental countries would be only too glad, in bringing into this country agricultural machinery and other items, to get the same terms as Britain enjoys.  I see no reason why Britain should be allowed to get away with that.  While Britain is imposing penal duties and penal tariffs on the produce of our farmers who have to use tractors, these tractors and British machinery generally are coming in here with practically no duty on them. I found the extraordinary position that certain sugar products were being imported from Britain free of duty, while, at the same time, she was putting a levy on our sugar going out.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that this whole matter must be reviewed.  The time has gone for turning the other cheek as far as John Bull is concerned, who never understood anything but force.  Now that we are preparing for entry into the Common Market, it is about time these matters were straightened out definitely, once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Either we have an agreement or we have not.  There are two sides to every agreement.  If Britain breaks one end of it, we are entitled to break the other.  Soft methods never got anywhere as far as those people are concerned. One would think she would hesitate to adopt the attitude she has adopted in this connection.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Donnell's remarks about agricultural instructors leaving the country I would point out that, particularly in the South, we have a very grave scarcity of horticultural instructors to-day.  As a matter of fact, they cannot be had.  One would think that, with the opening here for them now in regard to the production of vegetables and soft foods, some attempt would be made to get people trained in that particular line.</P>
    <P>We have the unfortunate position that a very considerable number of temporary instructors are employed in Cork.  As Chairman of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, I feel very hesitant about appointing 22 permanent instructors in a county while I know that side by side with that we shall have to appoint at least ten to fifteen more horticultural instructors. I am of the opinion that we could let some of the ordinary agricultural instructors go and replace them by horticultural instructors.  That is our reason for complaining in that connection.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a statement by Deputy McQuillan about the attitude adopted towards the Irish Sugar Company's new venture in regard to vegetables and so on.  We in the South are very hopeful as far as that is concerned. We see in this step something that will not alone give employment to our small farmers but be a means of keeping infinitely more people on our land.  The work is going ahead very happily up to the moment.  We hope, by judicious investment, to take that matter out of the realm wherein there will be any curtailment of the sale of produce in this country.  I think we shall be in a position to deal with the British-based teams that are endeavouring to curtail our movements in that connection.  I trust we shall be able to deal effectively with them very quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> As far as the Estimate generally is concerned, I am glad to see that more money is required for farm buildings and for lime.  It shows that our farmers are going ahead.  The more money I see for grants in that direction the more I believe that our agricultural community are going ahead and making satisfactory progress.  I should like also to congratulate the Minister on being prepared to find the cash for these grants.  This matter is now brought to a head.  I regret sincerely that my suggestions here some months ago, in dealing with the sugar question, were rejected.  Now, we have had a second wallop which concerns butter.  We have proof, in this second wallop, that there is very little use in talking softly to those people.  There is only one way to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had a very deep-rooted objection to a series of large Supplementary Estimates during the course of the year.  It seems extraordinary that estimation in the Department to cover the subsequent period of this year could be so much out.  It does, however, give a very welcome opportunity of analysing some of the very serious ills in our agricultural economy.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Clinton, dealt with a problem the Minister will have to face as quickly as possible.  There was a deep-seated responsibility on his Department to give us the result of the pig progeny testing and to give the Irish farmer direction as to the line of production in which he should engage to ensure a reasonable grading of his pigs.  I shall not say much about the Pigs and Bacon Commission because the less said about them the better. Their sorry history is consolidated by more inefficiency.  It is time the Minister realised the position, particularly when he is dealing with the pig producer in the area I have the honour to represent, the very large pig producer in Ballyvourney back into the Berehaven peninsula area.  It is of vital importance to that producer to know the particular type of pig that is best suited to his production and that will give him the best return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should make known to farmers the effective result of the <Col N="1353" /> pig progeny testing scheme.  He should let them know whether the time has come for us to get out of the production of the pork pig and to get into the production of a different type of pig.  I can assure him that, with rising costs of ration and delivery, it has become a vital economic factor for any pig producer in my area to have his pigs properly graded. Whatever bit of potential profit is in them is wiped out if the grading goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I have heard it suggested that we should not quibble about paying a vast sum of money for the loss on wheat.  It is time this country knew the appalling mess that was made of the disposal of that wheat.  It is time we got an explanation as to why non-millable wheat was offered, in job lots of six tons, to the Irish farmer at £22 or £23 a ton, and afterwards the ports were opened and it was disposed of at £16 10s. a ton to our competitors. There is no doubt in my mind that the loss suffered thereon was grossly aggravated by that fact.  The convenience of the miller was suited and he was allowed to export it in bulk.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to ask the Irish farmer, particularly the small, hardworking, industrious mixed farmer in an area like West Cork, to have patience with the Department of Agriculture when it is responsible for such extraordinary stupidity.  We, in West Cork, know that the millers are a <i>cartel</i> the Government do not like to interfere with, and all their squeals and aches are met by the money gift, by way of subsidy or appropriation-in-aid to cover loss, but there is damned little sympathy in the Government for the unfortunate pig producers in the fastnesses of Ballyvourney, Rathnaree or back in the Beara peninsula, who are not only carrying the Rolls Royces of the millers on their backs but also the profits of the distributors, and if anything goes wrong with the profits on their pigs or should any unfortunate mishap occur in their economy, they must take the brunt of it without sympathy or grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was quite right when he said there has been gross mishandling <Col N="1354" /> of the butter situation.  I was interested at Question Time when the Minister was pressed by the Leader of Fine Gael as to whether or not he had made representations about the fact that there was a formal breach of the Trade Agreement as well as a breach of the spirit, because it is time the Irish people realised what is involved in this action of the British Government whereby they give to our competitors quotas commensurate with their import quantities into England and ask the Irish people to accept grossly deflated quotas and, as a consequence of the Department not accepting that, have brought down this bludgeon blow on Irish butter.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the officials and the Minister have been blind to the fact that this problem has been building up over a number of years in a most serious way.  I was appalled recently to find that the Minister who had a very large appropriation for the purpose of market exploration had used practically none of it and that we have no practically-conceived policy yet as to how we can readily profitably and properly dispose of our milk surplus in some fashion other than as butter.  It has become apparent over the years that we are over-producing butter, as such.  What will the Minister do to face the problem that will inevitably arise unless something is done about increasing the cold storage for what has to be held in stock?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the time has come when the Minister and his Department must get down to rational planning of our agricultural economy; no doubt that it needs very careful consideration to get that flexibility of policy that will enable Irish farmers to gear themselves to the type of production for which they are best suited. Instead of having to give large sums of money to make up for the loss sustained by the poor, starving millers, it is time we faced the real problem besetting the whole foundation of our stock production, the problem of getting down the prices of all the offals that go to make the various rations essential to primary producers here.  It is time that the Minister's power was directed towards making available in <Col N="1355" /> a proper manner, at far more reasonable prices, basic rations to the primary producers instead of allowing the millers to get away with murder.  I have no doubt that, as long as they remain the arbiter of the standard of acceptability of grain, we are completely in their hands.  If the Minister brought the leaders of that industry into his office and said to them: &ldquo;There is the wheat that you tell me is unmillable; I am telling you to mill it,&rdquo; I am satisfied he would have got the same reaction as Deputy Dillon got when he was Minister and we would not have any artificial diseases arising in our wheat to give them another lever to reject wheat on the basis of its not being suitable to mill for flour.</P>
    <P>There is a great amount of ineptitude in the whole approach of the Department to the present inherent difficulty in our economy.  While Deputy Corry may try to bring in a sidelight on sugar, I know that the present problem arises because we have allowed our agricultural economy to drift in a direction that should have been altered years ago so that we would not be now facing the task of having to bargain or barter or make some kind of compromise with the British on the problem of our butter exports.  We have been told here for years that we have to subsidise our butter to feed the British people, while we make our own people pay what has been fixed as the economic price. To me, that was always a cockeyed scheme.  It seems far more rational to me that if any profit or subsidy is to accumulate from butter production for the benefit of the consumers, it would be better that Irish consumers should reap the benefit and enjoy the nutritious quality of our own butter rather than pay somebody else to eat it for us.  It is a problem that is perenially with us and yet the Department has done nothing about it but allowed it to grow in its complexities and difficulties over the years.</P>
    <P>There are many facets of this Estimate where there is a welcome improvement.  I want to see the use of lime and fertilisers on our land <Col N="1356" /> expanded; I want to see the farming community with better housing for stock and storage for grain, and it is good to see that money is to be spent on a more lavish scale in that way, but but one must come back to the fundamental principle, that if our economy is to depend on animal husbandry and if it is to be mainly an economy of pigs, cattle and poultry, we must face the problem of finding not only stable but profitable markets for it.  The Minister knows that difficulties have arisen in every section of our economy, to my mind, because of lack of proper market research facilities and lack of efforts by the Department to guide and direct it in the likely way of progress and profit.  If there had been any rational approach to the problem, we would not have the mounting difficulty of turkey prices, the falling off in fowl, the immense difficulty in pig production and the continuing difficulties that exist in the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes in to seek £10 million odd for his Department. Agriculture is the most important facet of our economy.  It is intrinsically and basically the real foundation of our economy.  Yet, the Minister cannot give us any reasoned approach as to what the alternative will be to over-production in milk, what the nature and type of our improved bacon trade will be, what type of pig will be best suited for that trade.  He does not give us any explanation as to how he can sit quietly and allow our competitors to benefit to the extent of 30/-, 35/- or 40/- per cwt. in the differential price for bacon.  He cannot give us any reasonable prognosis of what the future will be in any branch of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is talk as to what may happen when we enter the Common Market.  Perhaps I strike a realistic note when I say now is the time to gear our economy if we have to face that competition.  Now is the time for the Department of Agriculture to advise the primary producer what are the lines upon which his economy should be geared to make the best use of the Common Market, either as full or associate members.  Now is the time <Col N="1357" /> to evaluate the competition that will have to be met.  Now is the time to plan and direct the primary producer along the paths which hold out the best hope of ultimate success.  Now is the time for the Minister, instead of coming in here talking about wheat losses, to face up to the fact that we cannot afford to over-produce wheat. The land of this country is more suited to the coarser types of grain which can be walked off the land in the bellies of our stock.  Now is the time to get the Irish farmer to realise the integral facets of his economy that must be put right before he can become a competitor in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House by traversing the entire field of our agricultural economy.  I merely want to direct the Minister's attention to matters of urgent importance where the pig producer in my area is concerned. The time has come, if the research and effective investigation of his Department is a reality, to let us know the type of pig to which we should switch, the type of pig likely to grade best and give the best profit to the producer.  Instead of panic export of unmillable wheat, the Minister should insist that the millers give him some return by way of production of offal or quality feed which will inure to the benefit of our animal husbandry rather than cast it to the winds at completely uneconomic prices for the benefit of our competitors.</P>
    <P>If I got warmed up on the subject of the ineptitude of the Department of Agriculture, I could keep the House here all night and all tomorrow.  The Minister is charged with the biggest task and the most difficult task any Minister could have.  He is dealing with that particular facet of our economy which will be the real life-line of the country in a Common Market situation. It is a task to which all his energies and efforts will have to be applied if he intends to get Irish agriculture geared in the right direction to reap the best possible harvest.  No matter what industrial-minded people may think, many of our tariff-protected industries will collapse when we enter the Common Market.  It will be up to <Col N="1358" /> the Minister to continue to keep this country afloat and ultimately put it into a state of economic soundness.</P>

      <P>I shall raise the matter on another occasion.  If the Minister could give cheaper manures to the small farmers in Leitrim and Sligo, many of them would make greater progress in farming.  They cannot pay the present high price of fertilisers.  If they had cheaper manures, they could make the land more productive.  They would get a bigger cheque from the creameries and their economy generally would be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last evening I was here, I heard a Deputy say that money given under <Col N="1359" /> any scheme except the L.A.W.  Act was criticised by us.  I can assure the House no money under any scheme is being spent in my constituency.  No matter what representations are made, we can get no drainage work done.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite the inspection of schemes for which application has been made so that drainage work will be done.</P>

      <P>With regard to production, when we have a good year, there should be a guaranteed price for farmers who have a surplus. What really influenced farmers not to go into production in a big way was the fact that, when they did so, got a good year and had a surplus of produce on their hands, it was left in the haggard and was not worth bringing to town.  If the farmers of Sligo-Leitrim were sure of a price for whatever produce they had after feeding their stock, they would be glad to co-operate with the Minister and the community.  The cost of living would not be running so high.  It is costly to produce a crop on these small holdings. The net result is that if there is a surplus, it has to go to loss.  That is particularly the case in respect of the potato crop as we have known on a few occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much money has been spent on the Land Project.  I have seen huge projects carried out under the scheme. I always thought that if the same amount of money were spent on land starved for manure, it would be far more in the interest of the country in general.  Bringing heavy machinery into a mountainous part of the country, reclaiming that mountain and <Col N="1360" /> letting labour see what can be done and forgetting about the land which is in bad shape for manure is not profitable work.  The bit of land reclaimed under the scheme will, in a few years, revert to its original condition.  I have seen that happen myself and I have no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to give the greatest possible help he can to the farmers of Sligo-Leitrim.  If he does not, Sligo-Leitrim in a few years' time will find itself with nothing except forestry and four, five or, perhaps, six holdings merged together. The result will be that the population will dwindle and nothing can ever compensate for the loss of population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>From every side of the House it has been freely admitted that agriculture is our premier industry. That being so, I think I could not stress too strongly the need for expenditure <i>ad lib</i> on this scheme.  Local bodies such as county committees of agriculture and others should sometimes examine their consciences when they see what is being spent on roads, health and various other schemes as compared with the small amount of money going into agriculture.  I have said before&mdash;and let me repeat it&mdash; that the Minister should advise the Department to set up the most virile marketing scheme it is possible to find.</P>
      <P>The sad thing about agriculture is that farmers are advised to increase production.  They set about doing so, and the next thing they find is that supply exceeds demand.  We certainly have evidence of that this year.  Wheat has been a very vexed question in this House recently.  I will not go into that matter because I do not think there is any need to do so but, having mentioned that item, something should be done whereby the farmers will be advised in time as to the amount of wheat to grow and produce in order to keep themselves and everybody else &mdash;including the national Exchequer&mdash; out of trouble the following harvest. By doing that, everybody's face would be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got into a panic lately&mdash; I am sure the Minister is more concerned than anybody else&mdash;with <Col N="1361" /> regard to our milk products and our butter.  Everyone who has any interest at all in agriculture knows that milk and milk products, pigs and bacon products are what we call the farmer's friend and surely the friend of the small farmer, to say the least of it.  Enough cannot be done in that direction to find alternative markets if Britain is to close the door on us and to push us out of the market to which we are most entitled.  It is a shame really.  It shows some ineptitude on our own part if we are unable to compete with other countries who have to bear costs which are by no means as light as ours to put their goods on the British market.</P>
    <P>Everybody will admit that our cattle trade is the biggest factor in our economy and something which really should be nurtured.  I would ask the Minister to put the Department to work as hard as possible to find alternative markets for our cattle, whether live or as dead meat. At the moment every farmer admits that the cattle trade is in a fairly sound position, whether beef or stores.</P>
    <P>We find that the market has improved and is very good.  At the same time, however, farmers fear&mdash; and it is not really any wonder&mdash; that at any time there may be a collapse such as we had a few years ago.  Stores born in March were sold as beef in August.  The margin left to the farmers was, very small indeed. I do not blame the Department for that; I do not blame the Minister for that.  Again, it is a question of supply and demand and it demonstrates the need for a proper market research system.</P>
    <P>One fear which I have about the cattle trade&mdash;I say it here without fear of contradiction by anybody&mdash; is that at the moment too many people, unfortunately, have become interested in the trade&mdash;people who have no knowledge of this trade, people who are racketeers and financiers. I do not know if the Minister has any say in this but I know that professionals and others are coming <Col N="1362" /> into the cattle trade who have no idea at all of what they are doing. A sadder aspect of the matter is that they have no interest in what they are doing.  It is just an instance of the operating of a racket on the producers under the cloak of a pretence of being their greatest friends.  I would advise the Minister in such circumstances, where it is necessary, to withhold licences from those people who enter the cattle trade under false pretences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of agriculture, whether it be on the principal Estimate or on a rather formidable Supplementary Estimate, always provokes a fairly general sort of discussion.  Not only are the Department, and the activities of the Department, very widespread, but, in fact, if the Chair were not active, some Deputies would make those activities still wider.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes interesting to sit here and listen to all the suggestions made by Deputies with regard to the problems of agriculture and how some of those problems might be approached. For example, this evening I heard some criticism of the activities of one board which was very recently established, and the Pigs and Bacon Commission which has recently been reconstituted. I think it is a mistake on our part&mdash; and when I say &ldquo;a mistake on our part,&rdquo; I mean it is a mistake on the part of Deputies on all sides of the House&mdash;to engage in that sort of criticism, because the problems they were set up to deal with are problems which have been with us for a long time and they are problems to which Ministers, Departments and Governments have given their attention down the years with a view to finding suitable solutions for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussions which took place here on the establishment of An Bord Bainne and the reconstitution of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I think I made it very clear that I appreciated fully what those problems were.  I did not want to mislead either the House or the country as to the difficulties those organisations would be up against, and the disappointments that might result because of the delays which they would <Col N="1363" /> experience in approaching even something in the nature of a better solution than has yet been found to these important problems.</P>
    <P>As I say, I suppose it is natural in dealing with a Supplementary Estimate for a Department with such a wide field of activities that there should be all sorts of suggestions.  I do not think I should make any attempt to follow the different lines of thought to which expression was given so freely, and glibly in some cases&mdash;for example, the request that feeding stuffs should be made available at a cheap or a low rate.  Every one of us would be glad if that could be accomplished, but, on the other hand, we have a policy, and have had it for some years, of trying to induce our farmers and landowners to grow some of those feeding stuffs. We have approved of that policy.  We have given them a minimum price for what they grow and having done that, we have, of course, taken a step which will influence the price at which the grain they grow will be made available to those who purchase it for the purpose of converting it into livestock feeding and other produce.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion this evening&mdash;and not only this evening but on the previous occasion&mdash;some few questions were addressed to me which I feel I should answer.  Deputy Tully raised the matter of the provision in the Supplementary Estimate for the Agricultural Institute, and he seemed to make the complaint that the Agricultural Institute was not provided with all the funds it requested. I asked for figures showing the increasing amounts that have been provided for agricultural reseach of all kinds inside the past three years.  I find that in 1959-60, the total amount was £145,655; in 1960-61, it was £400,000; and in 1961-62, it is £½ million.  A grant of £½ million to the Agricultural Institute, so recently established, in any one year, is not an ungenerous gesture.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to think that the Institute itself is dependent upon that sum.  The Institute has an independent income of £80,000, or so, and a fixed capital sum for capital purposes.  It <Col N="1364" /> also has a tidy income from sales of produce, livestock, etc.  In fact, the total income available to it would be in the neighbourhood of £700,000 per year.  It is not reasonable for Deputies to think that, however generously the Institute should be treated and is being treated, because it prepares an estimate as to what it would like its expenditure to be, the Government must agree to such sum.  As I say, the evidence is there that it has been treated generously, I would say, and that is as it should be.  There is certainly no ground for complaint on that head, according to my reasoning.</P>
    <P>I was asked how much of this Supplementary Estimate is being charged to capital.  The guarantee payments under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, subhead K.K.11, and the grants under the farm buildings scheme, Subhead K.6, are chargeable to capital. There have been some savings on other subheads which are charged to capital and the net amount chargeable to capital is £4,450,000, the balance of £5,850,000 being chargeable to revenue.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy asked me whether the provision for the 1960 wheat crop in the Supplementary Estimate represents the total cost of Exchequer assistance for that crop.  It does not represent the total cost, because there was also a payment in the financial year 1960-61.  Exchequer payments on the 1960 wheat crop, spread over the financial years 1960-61 and 1961-62, are £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Some complaint was made here as to the way in which the unmillable wheat was disposed of.  That was the responsibility of the Grain Bord.  The Board handled the 1960 wheat crop and, of course, in handling it and making recommendations as to how it should be handled, they had to have regard to the fact that we have a guaranteed minimum price for barley, to the capacity of our farmers to use not only the barley crop but the amount of wheat that was regarded as unmillable, plus the need to have certain imports that would enable us to have a balanced ration.  They had to have regard to all these things in any recommendation they made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they not forbidden <Col N="1365" /> to sell that wheat until 9th January of this year?  Is it not a fact that the Grain Board were not allowed to market wheat from the previous harvest until 9th January of this year?  That is my information.</P>

      <P>A further question was raised here by Deputy Lynch, not for the first time, about the £250,000 allocated for marketing purposes a few years ago.  The Deputy complained that the expenditure from this allocation has so far been comparatively small.  One of the reasons for that is that the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Marketing suggested that the new marketing boards they proposed should have the use of part of these funds.  These new boards, that is, An Bord Bainne and the reorganised Pigs and Bacon Commission, have been set up only quite recently and discussions are to take place with them about the use of part of the funds to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  I do not think that simply because the Minister for Finance makes a sum of money available for a particular purpose, somebody should lash it around irrespective of whether there were likely to be beneficial results from the expenditure or not.  This sum of money was provided quite genuinely and the Agricultural Marketing Advisory Committee in their recommendation, which can be read by any Deputy, suggested as I have indicated.  Now that the boards and the reorganised Commission are functioning, building up an organisation and trying to understand the problem with which they have to grapple, discussions as to when, where and how this sum can be expended to the benefit of the agricultural industry are all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of butter, I do not think I could go as far as Deputy <Col N="1366" /> Dillon in saying that the imposition of the anti-dumping duty was a formal breach of the 1948 Trade Agreement. The Commodity Annex to that Agreement related to bulk purchase by the British Government in the four years 1948 to 1952, and that Annex has lapsed.  At the same time, I would agree that Article I of this Agreement, and the general provisions of the 1938 and 1960 Agreements, run counter in spirit to the use of anti-dumping duties to stop trade in one of our major agricultural exports.  In view of the mass of information on the butter question which is given in the Government's White Paper, I do not wish to say very much more on the subject, and it would also be my wish not to say or do anything which might in any way exacerbate the situation.  I can only say that there has been no question of our adopting an intransigent or unbending attitude and, indeed, I think we did everything possible to avert the present situation, short of conceding the whole principle that is involved.  We, for our part, are quite ready at any time to resume discussions on this matter on a reasonable and constructive basis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talked here about the condition of agriculture and the depressed state of the industry.  I do not think there is any justification at all for using a discussion on the subject of agriculture for such a purpose.  For a number of years now the Deputy in question has always referred to 1957 as the year in which agriculture was tremendously prosperous but the Deputy does not refer to a number of other years when he was in the Department of Agriculture. I am admitting, and I always did admit&mdash;as I said in this House on previous occasions, it is a mistake to pretend that something is a fact that is not a fact&mdash;that 1957 was a good year. It was a good season; there were good <Col N="1367" /> crops; there were good prices; and the condition of the market to which we were exporting most of that produce was very favourable.  The present year is described by the same Deputy as one in which agriculture is on its last legs.  That description is inaccurate as these facts will show: it is estimated that the income of farmers and members of their families, after deducting expenses of production, including rates, wages, etc., will be £7 million to £8 million greater in 1961 than in 1957.  Deputy Dillon, of course, expressed reservations about 1961 as to the advisability of relying upon official figures.  The way in which the figures for 1961 were arrived at and the people who arrived at them are the same as in 1957.  If the manner in which the figures we have been hearing about every other day, that is, the figures for 1957, were compiled, was good, the same can be said about the figures produced in 1961.</P>
      <P>There is no purpose to be served by these antics, especially if we are sincerely interested in agriculture and in helping agriculture.  As I have often contended in this House, the fact that that sort of argument is advanced makes no impact at all upon the minds of farmers, except to whatever extent it may depress some of them.</P>
      <P>No one will contend that everything is just as we would wish it to be; no one, and certainly not the Minister for Agriculture, will contend that there is not much to be done, much to be desired, but we are hardly likely to achieve our objectives and bring about the further improvements we would like to see just by using figures for a year that suits the political book and turning then to a year which will not suit the political book and pretending there is something mysterious about the way these figures have been arrived at.</P>

      <P>Not only is that the story on the fact of the results of 1961, but at no time was the direct assistance to agriculture in every shape and form as high as it is this year.  That surely is no evidence and no indication of a lack of confidence.  I should like to say to those who are concerned, as we all are, about the position regarding our butter and other agricultural produce, that it is the duty of the Government and the Department of Agriculture, and the responsibility of the Minister, to do their utmost in regard to these matters, because milk, milk products, the cattle trade, the pig industry and the bacon industry, are all fundamental questions as far as our economy is concerned.  It is the duty of the Government to stand by these, to protect and shelter them to the best of their ability, having regard to the resources that from time to time are available to a country in which agriculture and agricultural exports play such a predominant part. The producers, I have often admitted in this House, of these very important products are not by any means being compensated lavishly for engaging in their production but they can at least have this assurance, that as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government are concerned, we shall stand by them to the utmost in protecting and shielding them and shielding the prices they obtain for these products, against any action which might affect prices in the future.  They can have every confidence in that respect.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that existing health services have been proved to be inadequate, and that in their place there should be provided a comprehensive health service based on the principles of insurance which will extend to 85 per cent. of the population, and which will provide without charge an adequate medical service with free choice of doctor, free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services and which will remove the necessity for medical cards for all those within the scheme. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendments:</P>
    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;a select Committee of Dáil Éireann, consisting of nineteen members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom seven shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to examine to what extent, if any, experience has shown that, having regard to the general structure of our society, the existing system of health services does not meet in a reasonable way and at reasonable cost the essential needs of the various sections of the population for medical care and attention and, if the examination should disclose any significant defects in the system, to what these are due;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is the direct result of Fine Gael stated policy during the last election when Fine Gael produced a policy for health radically changing all the existing health provisions in this country. Having arrived here not in Government but in Opposition, they very properly put down a motion embodying the policy which they had expounded to the people.  Certainly they made some impact because while in the ordinary way of politics, the Government would not wish to give the Opposition something they had put before the people&mdash;and apparently convinced a great number of the people&mdash;they decided to put down an amendment which I suppose is a direct negative but which at the same time does refer the matter to a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I believe if a referendum were conducted on the two policies for health, there is not the slightest doubt that the majority of the people would vote for the Fine Gael policy because it is true that it is really impossible for the ordinary citizen today to bear the cost that may accrue to him in respect of the ill health of himself or a member of his family.  The new wonder drugs have meant that illness can often be shortened and that the effects of illness or accident can be lessened or even obviated, but they are very expensive drugs and treatments are expensive. One has only to look at the cost of beds in hospitals which the State builds and maintains, to see that the whole thing has built itself up into very high expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1372" /> As I understand it, the present system is that 50 per cent. of the cost of the health services is provided by the ratepayers and 50 per cent. by the Government and the question of whether a person is eligible or ineligible for a health service is decided by the county or city manager in whatever health authority area the person resides.  The impossibility of equity in such a system can be very easily explained when one realises that in Louth, to take my own county, there are 69,000 people, a large proportion of whom would fall to be looked after under the health services and that a penny in the £ produces roughly £1,000.  In our neighbouring county, Meath, however, there are 67,000 people and a penny in the £ produces £3,000.</P>

      <P>No; I must correct the Deputy.  He is about two years behind the time.  The figure is £3,000. Perhaps it is a county-at-large charge as against another charge, but even if Deputy Tully were right, which I contend he is not, the comparison is quite obvious.  When a manager comes to decide whether or not a person is in the lower income group, in which he is entitled to get the service free, he must always have in the back of his mind the fact that one penny in the £ will yield either £2,000 or £3,000; but the county manager in Louth with 2,000 more people than in Meath to look after is in the position that he is going to get £1,000.  Take only one subsection of the Health Act, 1953, subsection (2) (d) of Section 15, where the county manager rules on hardship cases.  Always at the back of his mind must be that if he allows a person enjoy £500 worth of health, and he is going to pay 50 per cent. of it, in one county that figure may be four times what it is in another county.  The fact that the present system does not spread the cost is a bad and distressing thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has explained our approach to this problem.  It is that ?d. should be charged on the employee and ?d. on the employer, that there should be a cessation of the <Col N="1373" /> present dispensary doctor system, that there should be a choice of doctor, whereby a person in possession of a card&mdash;not a green card decided on by his county manager because he is in a certain income category, but a card given to him because he is in a certain capacity, because he is an insured worker, because he is a person earning less than £1,100 a year in some circumstances and £800 a year in other circumstances, because he is a farmer with less than £50 valuation&mdash;could enjoy certain facilities.  It was the intention that if he had five in family, and his card said he had that number, and he brought it to the doctor of his choice, that doctor would, as in Britain, get a payment per member of the family.  At the end of the year, if the subscriber was dissatisfied with the service he had received from that doctor, he could take that card, go to another doctor of his choice and the card would be accepted.  Then he could stay with that doctor for a year. That would put the ordinary citizen in the position of being the customer. There is an old adage that the customer is always right.  As far as health is concerned, we should try to create the situation whereby the person getting the service would be the customer and could, if he wished, remove his custom.</P>
    <P>I mean no criticism of doctors in general or particular.  I think the dispensary doctors have been particularly good in their approach to this problem, but I feel their situation in relation to it is untenable.  As housing areas are built up in the various towns and cities, the position has been that one dispensary doctor may be looking after three times as many patients as another dispensary doctor.  Nothing seems to have been done about that. It is obvious, be that doctor as willing and as excellent a doctor as ever there was, that he cannot give the same service to his patients as the man with the lesser number can give, no matter how anxious he may be to give it. The choice of doctor system would mean that you could limit the number of patients a doctor could have the same as in Britain and that, if he had a certain number of patients, he would have to employ an assistant.  As well <Col N="1374" /> as putting the ordinary citizen into the position of being the customer, that would also see to it that each person would have an equal chance of enjoying the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Our view was that there should be no such thing as a means test, but that the matter should be decided by the category of person, not defined by anybody outside but defined by the person's own position; in other words, that the person who would get the service free would be the old age pensioner, the person on home assistance, the person with a valuation of less than £15, if a farmer, and all people easily defined by reference to their position and not related to a means test, whether they had the pig out in the back or 25 chickens in the shed.  That would be a great help.  It would get rid of the green card.  I cannot say how much I would like to get rid of that, because there is a suggestion of pauperism and the old poorhouse system about it&mdash;getting something for nothing as a charity.  There is an old saying down the country: may you or yours never know the coldness of charity.  I would prefer to see these people in the position of getting something as their right rather than that they should have their means investigated&mdash;and their means are usually very small&mdash;by the local relieving officer, that they should be questioned by the home assistance officer and eventually have their application for a green card refused when a file is produced before the county manager or someone appointed by him.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked what would this new system give to the people that they had not got before.  They would have a choice of doctor.  The people who had not a green card would get medicines at 50 per cent. of their cost outside hospital.  The middle income group people have got absolutely nothing outside hospital.  Hospitalisation would be free to these people as long as they were subscribers to the scheme and were making the statutory contributions.  Those are great steps forward and the scheme is not, as was represented by the Minister for Health. simply a change in name.</P>
    <P>There is also a great anomaly in the green card system inasmuch as when <Col N="1375" /> the county manager or his officer comes to decide who will get a green card and decides on the father or mother of a family, he must have regard to the incomes of sons and daughters residing with that father or mother, but if any one of those sons or daughters applies for a green card, they can get it without any regard being had for the incomes of their brothers and sisters or of their mother and father.  That brings about a shocking situation.  You can have a father and mother who have worked all their lives and are now at home drawing the old age pension, but because they have sons and daughters living at home with them and drawing good wages, they cannot get a green card.  Even though some of these sons may be drinking their heads off, they can get a green card and the only income taken into account is their own.</P>
    <P>That situation just will not be tolerated and I would emphasise that, irrespective of what happens in respect of this motion, in ten years' time, you will have a system of health services which will not include this pauper provision.  You will not have a position where one family living side by side with another in the same street, in receipt of the same income and having the same outgoings, will have a green card while the other will not.</P>
    <P>There is also the strain on the time and effort of the relieving officers and the home assistance officers in trying to make up these green cards.  It is impossible for them to do it efficiently and I can assure the House that it is not being done efficiently.  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the green card system must go in the next ten years.  As I have said, politics is the science of what you can get out of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of drugs.  We must face up to the fact that when the health services began in Britain, drugs were given entirely free and they were being used. People went to their doctors and said they wanted certain drugs and the doctors, knowing that they might lose patients at the end of the period if they refused, issued the drugs.  Because of that, the British authorities were <Col N="1376" /> forced to put a small charge on drugs. The system we suggest whereby certain persons, such as old age pensioners, farmers with valuations of under £15 and unemployed men or men in receipt of health benefits should pay 50 per cent. of the cost, would mean there would be no abuse of the provision and that quite a considerable contribution would be made towards the cost of the drugs.  On the other hand, considerable help would be given to poor people, particularly in the case of such drugs as those of the sulpha group which may cost anything up to £3 for a short course.  The 50 per cent.  we suggest would be of great assistance to such people.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the rates.  Implementation of the motion would mean that a great portion of the health charge would be taken from the rates.  This would result in a considerable reduction in local charges. How could we have a good health service when 50 per cent. of it is being paid by the ratepayers?  The 10 per cent. reduction in the rates which we estimate will come from the removal of the 50 per cent. health charge from the rates is something that can be looked forward to eagerly by the ratepayers. Of course it does not mean that the entire health charge would be removed from the rates because ratepayers will still be faced with the task of maintaining county hospitals and similar institutions.  It will, however, mean a 10 per cent. reduction in the rates, at a time when they are so high that the ratepayers cannot bear very much more, particularly nowadays when the health services are increasing continuously.</P>
    <P>I feel that the insurance contribution system is the only one whereby you will create the situation in which the subscriber is the customer.  Such a system could not fail to produce a decent result.  A fact which I think is quite extraordinary is that at the moment we are spending only £200,000 on dental care of people unable to pay. From the figures produced, and over which great trouble was taken, it is obvious that we are not prepared to spend anything like £1 million a year on this very necessary service, despite <Col N="1377" /> the fact that the 1953 Health Act places a responsibility on the local authorities in this respect.</P>
    <P>Many counties provide no such service because they have not been in a position to face up to the cost of it. Consequently, a position has been reached where all that is needed is for somebody to sue a local authority and bring the entire matter through the High Court, and the Supreme Court, if necessary.  Of course that would not happen because the type of person affected could not afford to face up to the local authorities who would employ the best legal brains in the country. In my county, we have been unable to provide any dental service whatsoever. However, doctors and even officials of the county council have sent patients into hospital so that when they became patients, they could have a dentist called in and service provided free in a county in which otherwise there is no free dental service.  The section of the 1933 Act making provision for such free dental services by local authorities is Section 14 (1).</P>
    <P>On these grounds I appeal to the Dáil to accept this motion.  Its implementation would remedy obvious defects in our health services.  I know the Government have been placed in an invidious position because this work was done by the Opposition and was produced at the time of the election. That was one of the things that increased our representation so considerably.</P>

We got the Government to put down an amendment.  If they had not thought the people throughout the country were behind this motion, they would not have bothered with the amendment. It shows at least that this is a matter of great moment and that the implementation of our proposal would <Col N="1378" /> provide a decent health service so lacking in the past under the old pauper system.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to what the previous speaker has said and I wonder what would happen in the case of patients who, he says, would have a choice of doctor, if the doctor refused to take on such patients.  Where would they turn then?  As regards the charge of 1/6d. for the employer and 1/6d. for the employee, who will collect that?  Will there be a staff of people going around to squeeze this 3/- from these people to finance these services?  There is another very important question.  How will these services cater for those unfortunate people in our community who will be unable to pay this charge? Will they be left to die in the corridors?</P>

      <P>I would like very much to be convinced of that but the previous speaker has not convinced me that this is a scheme which could replace the health scheme already in existence.  He mentioned a reduction of 10 per cent. in the rates.  Anyone representing a local body and who knows anything about rates will know that if each member of a family has to pay 3/- per week extra perhaps in the long run they might be much better off paying rates rather than carrying this weekly insurance contribution envisaged in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the speeches made on the motion and particularly to Deputy Donegan.  He poses the question: if the choice were between the present system and the Fine Gael proposal, which would the people choose?  Of course they would be mad if they did not choose the Fine Gael proposal, if it would operate.  I cannot agree at all that the Fine Gael proposal could possibly operate.  They have enumerated very many things which I agree need to be changed in the existing health services.  They have pinpointed very many things which we all know should be done, if we are to have a fairly <Col N="1379" /> decent health service.  However, the suggestion made by the mover of the motion&mdash;he can correct me when he is eplying if I am wrong&mdash;that this service can be provided under the scheme which they propose for approximately £8,500,000 and that they would be able to do much more than the Government are doing for £18,500,000 is something which I do not just believe.</P>
      <P>We have been working on this question of health services for a number of years and our Party gave their support to the introduction of the Health Act because they believed it could improve the red ticket system which operated up to then.  It would be most unfair to say there has not been an improvement, but the red ticket system has been replaced with a blue card or a green card, depending on the county you are in.  In one county, they were operating a blue card and when the T.B. scheme for cattle came in, they had to change it because they were also being issued with a blue card.  Someone was unkind enough to say the cattle were getting better service than the human beings.  I do not know how true that might be but I do know that the present system at dispensary level is not satisfactory and Fine Gael are quite correct to point that out and to ask to have it changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of dispensary doctors throughout the country and they supply a domiciliary service to the ordinary people.  Most of them are very decent and devoted to their job but some of them unfortunately seem to forget that if there were not poor people needing free medical assistance, there would be no necessity for dispensaries or dispensary doctors.  Every effort should be made to wipe out the system whereby those who have money to pay get precedence over those who have not, even though those who have not got the money are often very much more sick than those who have the money.  Any effort in that direction must be welcome.  I agree Fine Gael have that idea in the motion but even if we can agree that they are genuine about it, I do not think it can be done <Col N="1380" /> as easily as they seem to suggest it can.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs for the sick poor is one which from time to time has engaged the attention of anybody who is interested in social services and medical services.  Recently, I was intrigued to find the Department of Health had issued to local authorities some statement to the effect that they did not need to make everybody who had not got a medical card pay for their drugs, particularly if they were expensive drugs, and in fact they were entitled to take the normal circumstances into consideration at the time of the illness and to see to it that the drugs were supplied free.  The unfortunate thing about it is that it does not seem to have gone any further than the files of the local authorities because the local authority members have not had it brought to their notice. It is likely that unless the Minister makes a statement about it which will be taken up by the national Press, this concession&mdash;it is a very big concession&mdash;will not be known to the people who will be affected.</P>
    <P>One of the shocking things about this system is that some people who have been working all their lives may find that because they have a reasonable income&mdash;and in country districts, that may be as low as £6 per week&mdash; when they fall ill, the doctor who attends them may say that as they have not got a medical card, they must pay him before he attends them and they must pay for any drugs they may need. There is a flaw in the existing Act that the insured person who has not got a medical card, even though he goes from full wages down to social welfare benefits, is still considered ineligible for the treatment to which he would be entitled if he were in possession of a medical card.</P>
    <P>We think, as we have suggested in our amendment, that the Committee which the Minister for Health proposes to set up should report back not later than 30th June next, which is over six months' away and that the county managers and county health authorities should liberalise the administration of the Health Act in the interim period. <Col N="1381" /> Another unfortunate feature about the whole matter is that somebody in the local authority is officially responsible for deciding that a person is or is not entitled to a medical card. Deputy Donegan was quite correct when he said that you will find instances of two families living side by side, next door neighbours, one of whom may have a fairly hefty income and be in possession of a medical card while the next door neighbour with a very moderate income is without a medical card.  It has been suggested that there are various causes for this. One of the most common suggestions is that there has been a certain amount of political pull.  I hate to think that that should be so.  It occasionally appears as if it is so.  But, no matter what the reason, it does seem to be the case that people who public representatives know are not very well off, and who are entitled to free health treatment at local level, are refused it while those who might possibly be able to pay, and in some cases are definitely able to pay, can get free treatment.  The answer may be that the doctor has the right to report such cases to the county manager and to ask that the medical cards in such cases be withdrawn but doctors are human beings and many of them do not want to report those cases.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there are doctors who would have no hesitation in telling people that they must pay for these services.  A few days ago, I heard of a man who was earning almost £10 a week with a considerable amount of overtime.  In order to go to his job, he was paying for a car which cost him £2 10s. per week.  He had a wife and four children and the wife's mother, an old age pensioner, was living with them.  The local authority decided that none of those people, including the old lady, was entitled to free medical treatment. That is what can happen and what is happening under the scheme as it is at present.  It is quite right to ask that a change should be made in that system.</P>
    <P>As far as dental treatment is concerned, the biggest trouble seems to be that in any county where a dental service is in operation there is a waiting <Col N="1382" /> list in many cases of a year, a year and a half or two years.  It is just too bad for some people who, on a doctor's recommendation, had their teeth extracted by the local authority representatives or local authority dentists and who have then to wait that period for dentures.  As a matter of fact, in some cases they have to wait that period before they get their teeth extracted at all.  The same thing happens with people awaiting spectacles.  Many of them have to wait that very long period before they are supplied. Naturally, the eyes must suffer over the period they are carrying on without the spectacles.</P>
    <P>A third matter which I think is far more serious is that I understand the Department of Health have recommended to local authorities that the accent should be on the children, particularly where dental extractions are concerned, rather than on older people.  We find that the local authority are prepared to look after the teeth of youngsters while the older people are running into bad health because the Department of Health says the accent should not be on them but on their children.  That is something which must be taken into consideration by the Department if any effort is being made to improve the present health services.</P>
    <P>As far as the hospital service is concerned, one matter causes a considerable amount of uneasiness.  In some areas, people are required to attend at the hospital daily or twice weekly or weekly for treatment.  If they are really poor people the only way they can attend the hospital is for the local authority to supply transport.  This may mean that the local authority will send either the ambulance or a car to take them to the hospital or clinic for the treatment and home again, at considerable expense.  In many cases, a hospital beside their place of residence, three, four or five miles away, cannot be used because of nothing other than red tape, or, should I say, green tape. A particular instance of that is both sides of the town of Drogheda.  On the Meath side, people have to travel to Navan for treatment although they could receive it in either of the two <Col N="1383" /> Drogheda hospitals at very much less cost to the local authorities.  In fact, they would probably be able to cycle or take the bus or train to Drogheda and get the treatment there without having to go to Navan by car or ambulance.</P>
    <P>In Louth, in Deputy Donegan's constituency, people have to go to Dundalk in many cases when in fact they could receive treatment in Drogheda.  As far as those entitled to free treatment inside the hospital are concerned, the position is something better.  However, one extraordinary feature came to light recently during an inspection of the accounts of one of the local authorities.  It was discovered that the amount of money recovered from people who had received treatment in local authority hospitals amounted to between ½d. and 1d. in the rates.  In other words, if everybody who went to that local authority's hospitals had received free treatment it would have made the difference between a halfpenny and a penny in that local authority's rates. When we talk about how difficult it is to give free treatment to everybody who needs it in hospital, those facts seem to show that it is not so difficult at all if we had the will to do so.</P>
    <P>Specialist services also are sometimes easily obtainable.  Most local authorities co-operate very fully in seeing that the patients get treatment quickly and, as far as possible, cheaply.  But again the question of green tape arises.  If the proper form is not filled up, if the local authority have not been notified in time, a patient may receive a bill after leaving the specialist which, if the patient had not heart trouble before he went to see him, he would be inclined to have after reading it.  Again, this is something which should very easily be looked after if the various local authorities went to the trouble of trying to arrange to have specialist services made available at the nearest possible place.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, after a person has received treatment, to have the necessary forms filled up because, if somebody very ill is going away for consultation or for treatment, the question <Col N="1384" /> of who is to pay the bill afterwards does not seem to worry him, and I am not surprised.  But it is a bit of a shock to find that the bill is sent along and in many cases is ultimately paid by the local authority after confusion and annoyance have been caused to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities are very co-operative about the question of where a patient may go for general hospital treatment.  We know some local authority areas where patients find that the full quota of beds is taken up with the result that they have to be sent to a hospital further away. Again, we find some local authorities insisting that the patient, who is going to get what is called free treatment, must go to the local authority hospital no matter where it is situated rather than to the nearest available hospital. That is something that must be taken care of as quickly as possible.  It is rather unfortunate that if somebody is ill he or she should be asked to go to a hospital in a town where very often there is neither a bus nor a train service, a town perhaps 30 or 40 miles away from the patient's home while suitable hospitals are within easy reach, or at least situated where there is a decent bus or train service.  This causes a lot of annoyance particularly to older patients who, when they go to those hospitals, find they cannot have visitors because their friends are too poor to hire a car and have no other way of coming to visit them.</P>
    <P>Another thing that causes considerable trouble is the tendency in some local authority hospitals to send older patients who do not seem to be making a rapid recovery to what were known until very recently as county homes.  These have now got more respectable names, such as the name of some saint.  Perhaps that is all to the good, but I do not think it right that decent people, who go for treatment to a local authority hospital, should be sent to the county home without their consent if they are not recovering as quickly perhaps as those who are looking after them would like, or else sent to their own homes where they get no treatment.  I often wonder if those people had sufficient money to pay for themselves in hospitals, <Col N="1385" /> would they be sent away.  We know what the answer is.</P>
    <P>Another aspect, on which I should like to touch lightly, and which I think the Department should note, is the system whereby people, old age pensioners for instance, who go into a county home, not for shelter but for treatment for illness, have deductions made from the old age pension and in some cases have the entire pension stopped, although there is no authority whatever for such procedure.  The Department should notify local authorities that it is unfair and unchristian to deprive those old people of their pensions or whatever small incomes they have when they go for treatment rather than for shelter.  If they go for shelter, it is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of cost. It has been the practice over years&mdash; goodness knows why; I do not&mdash;that people who go into hospital and are willing to pay for treatment find, when they get their bill, that it runs to something like £10 7s. 11d. or £9 18s. 9d. whereas if they went to a private hospital the bill would probably be about five or six guineas.  The reason given by the local authorities for the difference in cost and for the pennies in the account is that repairs are being carried out to the hospital and that the cost is being added over a period of years to the <i>per capita</i> charge so that there will be no loss either to the Department or the local authority.  I think that system is entirely incorrect. A charge should be laid down for the local authorities and the extra charge imposed because of repairs should not be put on.</P>
    <P>As far as the health service generally is concerned we believe it must be changed.  We believe, following the discussions that will take place as a result of the Committee being set up here, that the change will be made and we feel the Government will be big enough to admit that the present system is wrong.  We should love to see a system introduced that would save £10,000,000 with improved health services.  We do not think it possible, but we think it can be done if the <Col N="1386" /> health services which we have at present can be brought up to the required level if we continue the existing system of collecting from the local authorities and the Government and, in addition, make a charge on an insurance basis.  A very small charge will pay what is required and farmers and other self-employed persons can get the same service by paying a small charge.</P>
    <P>We also believe, as do Fine Gael, that those who are unable to pay should not be debarred from the treatment they need but we would like to point out that people who are unemployed or ill&mdash;insured persons&mdash;should be entitled to benefit because of their insurance.  In conclusion, I should like to reiterate what Deputy Donegan said, that the really important thing when improving the health service is to provide a service which the insured worker and the insured person generally can demand by right and not seek because it is a charity to which somebody thinks he is entitled.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The present health system is financed on a fifty-fifty basis between the central and local authorities and when the Minister for Health intervened the other day he seemed to think that system of financing was quite satisfactory.  He mentioned that he was quite satisfied with the Revenue Commissioners and the rate collectors.  The system suggested by Fine Gael is intended to replace that by insurance stamps. Deputy Tully, I think, wants a mixture of both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present health system gives a varying degree of coverage to about 85 per cent. of the population on a completely free or partly-free basis.  In other words, 15 per cent. are outside the scheme and are expected to look after themselves although they appear to be individually, in the majority of cases, the larger contributors.  I am endeavouring to portray an aspect of it for the House which has not been already adverted to.  If we go back far enough, at one time in this country probably 85 per cent. of the people were providing free or partly free service for about 15 per cent. of the <Col N="1387" /> population.  There was no outcry.  It was no burden.  But, as the years passed, an increasing number of people came under public services.  We have now the position I mentioned earlier in which about 15 per cent. are left to contribute to a great extent to 85 per cent.  In other words, fewer and fewer are paying for more and more. All these costs have gone up considerably, due largely to the increased cost of living but particularly to the increased cost of modern drugs.</P>
    <P>An expenditure of £30,000,000 is in contemplation on rural water supplies.  Again, to give approximate comparative figures, a few years ago, 85 per cent. of the people were supplying free piped water to 15 per cent., namely to non-urban towns and villages.  With the progress of a rural water supply scheme, with our ratepayers paying a 25 per cent. contribution, ultimately the position will arise that 85 per cent. of the rural community may have a piped water supply and 15 per cent. will be permanently excluded.  Consider the position of a man who happens to be geographically so situated that he can never get a piped water supply, and also so situated by virtue of his valuation which may happen to be £50, or by virtue of his income, which, because of his efforts, may be over £800.  Will he be expected to pay 10/- for water he cannot get or 12/- or 15/- for a health service in which he cannot participate? Clearly there is a social injustice here. I believe the financing of our health services, when we take into consideration further imposts like water supplies upon our county councils, is clearly becoming unjust.  In fact, I think the Government recognised that before the election, unless it was for propaganda purposes they established a commission to inquire into the distribution of local rates.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say &ldquo;To each according to his needs and from each according to his means&rdquo;.  These are relative terms.  That could easily become: &ldquo;To each beyond his needs and from each beyond his means&rdquo;. Many of us on this side of the House <Col N="1388" /> think&mdash;others may think with us&mdash; that it is the function of the State to supplement rather than supplant. As a result of our Hospitals Sweepstakes money and the prodigal extension in the number of hospital beds under State auspices, we have now more beds per thousand of our population than any other country in the world.Is this &ldquo;To each according to his needs?&rdquo;Is this &ldquo;From each according to his means?&rdquo;I know I will be told we have a shortage of beds and that there is a long waiting list in every institution.  One could build a hospital extending from here to Finglas and fill it with patients so long as it was comfortably centrally heated, the patients were well fed, and charged very little.  I have never seen a hospital yet that could not be kept filled.  The criterion of a hospital well run is a waiting list and a demand for beds.  Our mounting rates are largely due to the increased number of hospital beds and increased hospital expenses rather than any rise on the domiciliary side of the service.  Our complaint in the Fine Gael Party is that there has been an over-emphasis on hospital treatment and not sufficient emphasis on domiciliary treatment.  Deputy O'Higgins has given the facts and figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You had him thrown out.  Now, I have not read <i>Das Kapital</i> but I have read the <i>Life of Washington.</i>He once said that a Government should not do for people those things which they are well able to do by their own efforts.

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Nobody will deny, I think, that it is not unreasonable to expect, unless we are all paupers, that 15 per cent. of the better off people should be able, in ordinary circumstances, to provide for themselves.  To a great extent, they are doing so at the moment.  That will be the position under the scheme as we envisage it.  I think it cannot be denied that a scheme embracing 85 per cent. of the population should be largely self&mdash;financed.  It is not suggested in our proposition that it is completely self-financed&mdash;I said &ldquo;largely&rdquo;&mdash;because 15 per cent. will as employers and as ordinary revenue payers be making their contribution either into revenue or in paying for the stamps of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health card system and the means test have been mentioned.  It does not need emphasising that much of the difficulty and a good deal of the outcry against the Health Act at the moment is in relation to the means test. I think that people are particularly <Col N="1390" /> worried by the fact that, if they have not got a health card, they will have to pay something when they go into hospital. The Minister said they should not be charged this 10/- per day.  At the same time, a little brochure was issued to every county councillor and to members of the public who applied showing this charge.  By our proposition, we are, in fact, abolishing the means test.  We are abolishing a means test which applies at the moment to the base of the social pyramid, if you like, to the people at subsistence level, and raising it to a higher level, a subapical level, to embrace a few pople.</P>
    <P>It is not exactly a means test.  It is merely a test to find out whether they should come in under the compulsory insurance scheme or whether they should be free to opt out of it.  This test, carried out on a small number of people of £50 valuation or people with £800 a year income, will not and could not cause the same distress, the same hardship or the same objections as a test applied to a large number of people in very poor circumstances&mdash;a test, which has, I believe, under the regulations, to be applied annually.  We know that it is not being applied annually.  It is impracticable to do so but where it is being applied it is causing considerable distress.  It would be simpler to abolish it completely and merely have to deal with people of £50 valuation and people with £800 a year income and tell them they must come into the scheme or stay outside.  To these people it would not make very much difference whether they join the voluntary health insurance or the compulsory insurance scheme.  I am sure they would not bother very much either way.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which has been mentioned already&mdash;the question of the free choice of doctor.  The Minister for Health made great play on that phrase calling it restricted choice and so many other things that he had me all tied up.  Free choice of doctor is a recognised term all over the world. The Irish Medical Association, the British Medical Association, and the World Health Organisation have <Col N="1391" /> always advocated what they term free choice of doctor.  It is a relative term. What one means by the term &ldquo;free choice of doctor&rdquo; is that a man in the town of Clonmel may, irrespective of his income, pick any doctor in Clonmel and if he wants to go three miles outside Clonmel he is free to do so but he is not going to travel to Dublin. We must be rational about these things.  There is no point then in raising a hare about restricted choice or using any other verbiage of that kind.  Free choice of doctor is accepted all over the world.  It is accepted practice and has been in operation in England for the past 30 or 40 years. We believe that the free choice is good for the doctor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what the Deputy believes all right but what about the patient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> We also believe it is good for the patient because we believe that the doctor should not own the patient nor should the patient own the doctor.  We believe it would be good for the patient because it would introduce an element of competition.  We believe it would be good for the doctor because it would keep him up to scratch.  I think that the best type of payment is the insurance contributory scheme which is based on a contractual basis by which the patient may take his card from one doctor to another.  I think it would remove much of the element of difficulty which arises at the moment where we have in some cases large dispensaries with doctors overworked trying to deal with thousands of patients while doctors in rural areas attend to a small number of patients only.  Free choice of doctor is the system adopted in most civilised countries at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free choice of hospital and specialists constitutes a more difficult proposition.  Before national health was introduced in England the specialist was largely obtainable even by the poor patients.  In the rural areas of this country there is very little choice left as regards hospital or <Col N="1392" /> specialist treatment.  Even where that is possible the regulations do not permit it.  In my own practice, a purely private practice, I could make my living on 15 per cent. of what somebody might call top-drawer people but it is largely on 85 per cent. of the people who are already provided for through Government services. They prefer to elect to come to me.  That shows that at least people are prepared to pay for this free choice and that is a thing very much desired by the people of this country.  We should endeavour to give our people free choice.</P>
    <P>There is a final aspect of this matter which has not been mentioned here before.  I think it is important for the success of any health scheme.  We hear a lot nowadays about staff-management relationship in regard to the industrial worker but we hear very little about Minister-doctor relationship. One would have thought that the more liberal lines of thought permeating the industrial world would have now permeated through the hidebound atmosphere of the Custom House.  I need hardly stress that good relationships between the Minister and the Medical Association are a necessary prerequisite, a <i>sine qua non,</i> of any satisfactory health service.</P>
    <P>Our Minister's estrangement appears to derive from the medical practice of inserting certain State appointments in an advertisement column of its journal under the title of important notice.  He has variously described this important notice as a ban, a boycott and a proscription.  As a consequence, he has refused to meet the Irish Medical Association.  He gave us a dissertation on these important notices here to-day.</P>
    <P>What are these important notices to which the Minister has been objecting for so many years and which caused this estrangement?  The important notice is merely a request attached to certain advertised posts advising potential candidates to communicate with the Medical Association if they are applying for such posts.  The medical man may or not seek this advisory service and, having sought it, may ignore it and is not in any manner <Col N="1393" /> precluded from accepting such positions. It is purely an advisory service which the Medical Association is constitutionally entitled to offer to its members.  As the Irish Medical Association is not a trade union, it may not, therefore, impose formal restraint on any member.  This type of notice was first inserted, I think, in the year 1904 in the British Medical Journal.</P>
    <P>It has been found to be a very useful and essential weapon down through the years in the interests of medical care.  It is particularly used in the British Medical Journal to protect doctors travelling to overseas appointments, badly equipped posts like rubber plantations or to colonial services. No British Minister has ever objected to these important notices.  I do not know whether any Irish Minister has objected to them except the Minister for Health.  I may be wrong there but in over 35 years of often embittered controversy, no British Minister has ever refused to meet a representative of the British Medical Association.  The Minister for Health has consistently refused to meet them.  The Road Traffic Bill, 1960, the Poisons Bill, 1960, the Mental Treatment Bill, 1960, and the Nurses Bill, 1960, were all introduced without consultation with the I.M.A. who might have had important contributions to make.  The National Health Council and the Opticians' Board are statutory bodies on which the Medical Association have a legal right to representation but the Minister has withdrawn the Association's right to nominate its own representatives.  He has further reduced the number of medical members of various boards.  He elects the members of such bodies and their removal is now the sole prerogative of the Minister for Health.  Terms of office of members, the procedure governing the calling of meetings, the numbers requisite for a quorum are all determined by the Minister and so in fact these bodies cannot reasonably be expected to offer to the Minister objective guidance or critical observations.</P>
    <P>We must all daily compromise to live.  Even heads of State, much less Ministers, find it expedient to do so. The Minister for Justice found himself in an uncomfortable position last <Col N="1394" /> week and he compromised, and, in my opinion, gained in stature by doing so. May I express the hope that even at this eleventh hour, the Minister for Health may in some fashion rearrange his mind, set aside his silly obsessions, and take a headline from his junior colleague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with regard to the Health Act is that Fine Gael are the doctors' Party and Fianna Fáil the patients' Party.  I am on the side of the patients' Party.  I should like to point out to the geniuses who have thought up this scheme that they were six years in office during the past 13 years and they had none of these brainwaves.  When the election came, they were fired out of office, as fired out they should be.  It is rather strange that they did not have any of these brainwaves during their six years in office.  The Deputy who has just concluded his statement is leaving the House now because he knows he has met his match.</P>
      <P>Why did they not put this famous scheme which they now put forward into operation during the periods they were in office?  The number of people insured in this country is relatively small and, in my opinion, if we had a health scheme based on insurance, it would mean that most of the people would have no health service at all.  I see nothing wrong with the present health services so far as my county is concerned except for a few trivialities which could be easily remedied if we had discussions with the Minister.</P>
      <P>These geniuses have come here tonight as they came a few nights ago with this famous scheme.  What would be its outcome?  It would mean that no one where I live could get free treatment for anything.  I am sure that no one in this House would seriously suggest that I for one should stand idly by and allow such a position to be reached.  I will not.  I have no trust in anyone over there.</P>

When the Minister has discussed some of the outstanding flaws with Deputies, and with anyone else with whom he may wish to consult, I believe he will correct them.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in sympathy with many of the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker.  I also think the approach of the Labour Party has been a practical one, and one which has been of value in the debate generally. The main Labour Party criticism has been directed at the administration of the health services under the Health Act rather than an attack on the principles of the Health Act itself. That form of criticism is at least valid and should certainly merit attention at the meetings of the Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are undoubtedly some anomalies in the administration of the Health Act in the various local <Col N="1396" /> authority areas and certainly the Select Committee should seek ways and means of finding some more uniform standard in regard to the administration of the services and a more equitable system of administration.  Anomalies exist particularly in regard to the different standards adopted by the various local authorities and these anomalies are very clearly defined in border areas, in towns such as those mentioned by Deputy Tully, like Drogheda, between Louth and Meath, where people in one county area may have medical cards and people on the same income but in a neighbouring local authority area may not.</P>
    <P>That line of criticism is, I think, valid enough.  It is certainly a line of criticism that should be followed up at the meetings of the Select Committee. In principle, I think the Health Act, 1953&mdash;and I agree with Deputy Corish in this&mdash;is quite adequate.  That Act, following on the Act of 1947, sought to introduce here the most comprehensive scheme of health services for our people yet devised. I believe the principle of that Act is largely adequate and that if any improvement is to be effected, it is an improvement of the administration under that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A fraudulent one.  I regard the Fine Gael motion we are discussing here as a fraudulent motion which was born as an election stunt. Obviously, there was not much thought given to it at that stage.  A certain amount of hurried thought has been given to it since the election and we now have it produced here as a comprehensive scheme for medicine in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it is designed to cover 85 per cent. of the population.  That <Col N="1397" /> is exactly the percentage covered by the existing Health Act.  The existing Health Act, taking medical card holders and members of the middle income group, covers approximately 85 per cent. of the population.  Therefore, in essence, the motion does not seek to cover any wider percentage of the population than is covered by the existing Health Act.</P>
    <P>The claim has been made by Fine Gael speakers that their scheme abolishes the means test.  There is not a scintilla of basis for that.  There is a means test.  There is implicit in the motion a means test, several means tests, but particularly a means test when 15 per cent. of the people are excluded from it.  In essence, how do you segregate 15 per cent. of the people from the operation of the Health Act, unless you apply a means test to them? There are a number of other means tests throughout the scheme proposed in the Fine Gael motion.  There is a means test involved in deciding what people should pay a contribution and what people should not pay a contribution. That, in essence, is again a means test decision.  One must take a means test between the contributors and the non-contributors under the Fine Gael scheme.</P>

However, under the guise of being an advance in health provisions in this country, the scheme proposed by the Fine Gael Party is an obscurantist retrograde scheme, a scheme which is seeking to take from people who are entitled to free services under the 1953 Health Act and to add to their cost in meeting health expenses.

      <P>Certainly, the total figures in the country refute the allegation of Deputy O'Higgins that the present medical card system is merely a pauper system.  Thirty per cent. of our people, in some cases up to 40 per cent. in certain local authority areas, but 30 per cent. on a national average of our people, have medical cards at the moment.  However, how do we find the proposed Fine Gael scheme in regard to people who at the moment have medical cards and are entitled to free medical services? According to Deputy O'Higgins' motion and his remarks, he seeks to impose a levy, a penal levy, on every farmer over £15 valuation.  Every farmer over £15 valuation would pay what Deputy O'Higgins seeks to call an insurance charge but which, in fact, is disguised penal taxation.  In fact, he goes so far as to suggest that this insurance charge should be collected every six months along with the rate demand.  Will the farmer whose valuation is in excess of £15 and up to £20, who at the moment has his medical card entitling him to free hospital and medical expenses, regard the £1 6s. he will have to pay every six months along with his rates as an insurance charge or as additional taxation?  We are only dealing in double talk here in seeking to call it an insurance charge when, in fact, as Deputy O'Higgins suggests, it should be collected every six months from the farmer.</P>

So much for them.  On top of that, it is proposed that the farmers between £20 and £50 valuation, who at the moment are entitled to all the benefits under the middle income group provisions of the Health Act, 1953, should pay a penal tax along with their rate demand every six months, representing 2/- every week.</P>

      <P>A fraudulent claim has been made, and I think it was Deputy Tully who referred to it, that by some wave of a miraculous wand everything is going to be provided for £8½ millions which at present is costing £18½ millions.  The most glaring omission in the scheme is that it practically ignores the cost of hospital and specialist services.  Institutional services administered through the local authorities would cost, under this scheme, about £583,000.  There is no indication how the balance of administering institutional services is to be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to point out that £12½ millions at the moment is expended on institutional services.  Deputy O'Higgins makes no mention that the balance will have to be met as at present, under taxation and under the rates.  Twelve and a half million pounds must still be met out of general taxation and the rates. That very definitely highlights the fact that under his scheme, ill-thought out as it is, there is no prospect whatever of any substantial rate reduction.  In fact this scheme is merely providing, or seeking to provide, what is in fact provided under the existing scheme. Under the existing Act, 85 per cent. of our people are covered.  He seeks to indicate that a more comprehensive scheme without a means test, providing for an insurance charge, will be provided, when in fact the same number of people are going to be covered &mdash;that is 85 per cent.  He seeks to introduce this insurance charge which is in fact a thinly-disguised method of taxation or rate exaction, as far as the farmer is concerned.</P>
      <P>Apart from the farming community between £15 and £50 valuation, and they comprise about 103,000 whom Deputy O'Higgins seeks to burden with this penal levy disguised as an insurance charge, there is the question of insured workers, all of whom are going to be obliged to pay ?d. a week contribution towards this scheme. At the moment a large proportion of insured workers have medical cards. In fact, depending on the numbers in the family, men with from £6 to £9 a week in most local authority areas have medical cards.  In most local authority areas, a man with £6 a week automatically gets a medical card and as his family increases he can get a medical card with an income of £9 per week.  These people, already in insurable employment, paying contributions to social welfare, are now going to be given a further burden of ?d. a week, as a further penal levy in respect of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That again is sufficient indication that this proposed measure is a step <Col N="1404" /> backwards and not a step forward as it is claimed to be.  Indeed, it certainly is not surprising that it should be a step backwards because it was only by the combined efforts of the Fianna Fail Party and the Labour Party that, despite the reactionary opposition of Fine Gael, the present progressive Health Act was passed in Dáil Éireann.  The attitude incorporated in this measure is again a reactionary attitude, seeking to impose additional levies disguised as insurance charges on farmers between £15 and £50 valuation and on a large proportion of insured workers who at the moment have got medical cards.</P>
    <P>The further point was made by Deputy O'Higgins in his opening remarks that the present dispensary service is inadequate and not suited to our needs.  While his argument may have some validity in regard to urban centres, it falls to the ground completely when you seek to apply it to remote rural areas.  I think Deputy Leneghan from North Mayo referred to the dilemma that would occur in his area, and certainly Deputy Donnellan and myself are aware of areas in the West of Ireland where you would have no medical services in the event of the dispensary service being abolished.</P>

      <P>I do not see it in the <Col N="1405" /> motion and certainly it is again an example of the ill-conceived, ill-thought-out way in which this proposal has been worked out.  As I say, it bears all the marks of an election stunt which is getting some <i>post factum</i> justification in the form of a hastily drawn up scheme after the event in order to justify the fact that it was pushed to the forefront as a plank in the middle of an election campaign.  When examined on a practical basis, it falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>The present Health Act, as I have said, may have defects in regard to its administration.  These can be examined by a Select Committee.  As Deputy Corish said, there is no body better equipped, particularly members of the House who are also members of local authorities, to deal with what defects there may be than such a Select Committee.  Now is the practical time to do it.  We have had the Health Act of 1953 in operation for seven or eight years and most of us are aware of its virtues and its defects. A practical investigation can go into these virtues and defects.  It is a far more practical proposition to have a Select Committee now than when one was suggested by Fine Gael during the passage of the Bill in 1953. At that stage, before the Act got under way, they suggested a Select Committee. Now that the Act is under way and has been administered, surely this is the time to have the investigation suggested in the Government amendment, an investigation by a Select Committee composed of members who have had practical experience of the working of the Act?</P>

      <P>I should like to repudiate entirely the suggestion that the Health Act, the present system, should be rooted out, lock, stock and barrel.  I fully agree with Deputy Corish in his reaction to that suggestion. It is entirely a destructive line of reasoning.  As I sought to point out here, it is a line of reasoning which is in fact retrograde, which seeks to impose additional penal levies on people who are at the moment entitled to free, medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that the 1953 Health Act brought in two services which at the moment apply to 85 per cent. of our people&mdash;free specialist treatment and free mother and child treatment, subject only to the maintenance charge.  Those two key points in the 1953 Act have been of tremendous benefit to 85 per cent. of our people. The outstanding burden prior to 1953 was the burden of heavy specialist expenses.  These specialist expenses, which often had to be suddenly met, sometimes amounted to hundreds of pounds.  They can now be met by 85 per cent. of our people under the 1953 Act, people in the low and middle income groups.  There is a similar position in regard to the mother and child service under the 1953 Act.  It applies also to those groups and is subject only to a maintenance charge payable by the middle income group people.</P>
    <P>In regard to the maintenance charge, Deputy O'Higgins was ill-informed in stating that the figure of 10/- per day applied to all middle income group patients in hospital. In fact, that statement is incorrect. For the year ended 31st March, 1961, the position was that, of all the patients charged for hospital services, only 50 per cent. were charged 10/- per day, approximately 20 per cent. were charged between 5/- and 10/- and approximately 30 per cent. were charged 5/- per day.</P>

      <P>That charge of 10/- is the only statutory charge.  It is a maximum charge, and in 50 per cent. of the cases, much less than 10/- has in fact been charged.  This proposal of Deputy O'Higgins seeks to impose on a large number of people, to be accurate, on, first, 103,000 farmers, additional penal taxation in the form of what he calls an insurance charge but which I would call an exaction of £1 6s. every six months for 33,000 of them and, for the balance of 70,000, a charge of £2 12s. every six months, and they do not have to pay these charges at the moment.  As well as that, it seeks to impose on a large proportion of insured employees the further additional burden of paying on a different coloured stamp an additional ?d. a week, apart from the equivalent burdens on the employers. I feel the sensible thing is to agree, and I feel the House will agree, to a Select Committee being set up and to a thorough investigation into the administration of the Health Act, the principles of which are admirable.</P>

      <P>Having regard to how the Health Act affects working-class people, it has been heartening to listen to what the main Opposition speakers and the Parliamentary Secretary have said.  The Labour Party have made a sensible approach to the problem. Our speakers have indicated that there <Col N="1409" /> are certain features of the Health Act that are by no means objectionable, but there are other features that need to be remedied.  Naturally, we must welcome this wind of change because it is an indication that people who felt happy and contented about the Health Act since its inauguration in 1953 have suddenly come to realise it has certain defects.</P>
      <P>I submit that one of the main defects in the Health Act is the manner in which medical cards are issued.  I was intrigued when the Parliamentary Secretary said that every local authority had a guide or rule of thumb in regard to the issuing of medical cards. I think that is a pious wish.  That is not the situation in Dublin, where the lack of a guide for the issuing of medical cards is causing a tremendous amount of trouble among the people. You have people in exactly the same circumstances, living alongside each other, and one person gets a medical card while the other does not.  While the Act says that people who cannot provide for their own needs should be given the necessary services, the unfortunate situation is that that is left in the hands of an individual burdened with the responsibility of keeping down the rates.  That individual must realise that we cannot spend too much money by way of extending medical services to the people in the area for which he is a representative.  The problem in relation to medical cards has also created difficulties among assistance officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down a Question to the Minister for Local Government last week, Question No. 27, asking him the number of motor vehicles licensed for road use in Dublin city and county, including Dún Laoghaire, in 1960; the amount paid in road tax, the amount received by Dublin City from the Road Fund; and if he would give similar details for the counties of Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Kilkenny.  The Minister very fairly gave detailed figures in reply to that Question.  Today I had a further question asking for information on the number of road vehicles licensed for road use in each city and county not mentioned in his reply to the earlier question.  I further asked him, in Question No. 78 today, the amount paid in road tax by each area and the amount allocated from the Road Fund to each area.  I also asked him if he would now treat Dublin City and County on an equitable basis, having regard to the number of motor vehicles registered in these areas, by an appropriate increase in the allocations from the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
      <P>The statistical information requested is in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> Road Fund grants are not based on the number of motor vehicles registered in each area, but on the mileage and condition of roads in each case, subject to the overall limit on the amount available for distribution.  Both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have received a substantial increase in their Road Fund allocations in recent years.  The total amount of these allocations for 1961-62 will be about £376,000 more than in 1959-60.  Furthermore, the major part of a special provision of £500,000 for the arterial roads leading out of Dublin has not yet been taken up.  I cannot agree in the circumstances with the suggestion that the areas in question are inequitably treated as regards Road Fund grant. </P>
    <P>Needless to say, with such detailed figures it would only confuse the House if I went into too much detail so I intend, in a general way, just to give some example of the way those figures work out.  Let me take two places for a start.  We have the contributions to the Road Fund from Dublin City and County which amount to £2,121,149.  There were 85,297 vehicles registered.  The average contribution per vehicle was approximately £22 10s. and the amount allocated from the Road Fund out of that £22 10s. per vehicle was approximately £4 15s. per vehicle to Dublin City and County.</P>
    <P>If we look at another figure we will see that the allocation from the Road Fund to the city and county of Dublin was approximately frb5/4fred. in every £ contributed.  We come down then to Galway Corporation and Galway County Council to show the very big difference.  First of all, I should like to point out that I have noticed, for the country as a whole, a fair average allocation of about £20 per vehicle registered.  That is about the average road tax, taking into consideration the heavy lorries, the light cars and the very light motor cycles.  Taking Galway County Council, there are 10,660 vehicles registered.  We see that Galway Corporation and County Council received <Col N="1412" /> approximately 31s. out of every £1 contributed in the form of motor vehicle tax.  In fact it works out at something like an annual allowance of £36 per vehicle from the Road Fund, compared with £4 15s. per vehicle in Dublin City and County.</P>
    <P>There are other examples I can give. Take Cork County Council.  They got 28s. back from the Road Fund for every 20s. contributed.  Limerick County Council received over 20s. out of every £1 contributed.  That, of course, balances out fairly well.  We can then take Carlow where, having contributed an average of 20s. per vehicle, they received back 15s. per vehicle.  We come to Clare where they got 60s. back for every £1 contributed.  Donegal received back £2 for every £1 contributed, Leitrim got back £3 for every £1 and Longford got back £2 for every £1.  But Dublin City and County got back only frb5/4fred. for every £1 contributed in road tax.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister would argue that there is a longer mileage in these places but I am asking the Minister to consider basing the grant from the Road Fund on the weight of traffic, the number of vehicles registered in any licensing authority.  It would be much fairer than the present system. People coming into Dublin City on the various roads of Dublin county criticise Dublin County Council because its roads are not modernised but it has taken Dublin County Council all its time to keep the existing road surface in a fit condition to carry that heavy rate of traffic and it has not received enough money to enable it to modernise its roads and bring them up to the standard which exists in other areas where very generous allocations have been made.  Imagine some counties getting 60/- for every 20/- subscribed while Dublin City and County get only frb5/4fred. for every 20/- subscribed.</P>
    <P>Considering that there are 85,000 vehicles registered here in the city and county it is only fair to expect that Dublin City would get a greater allocation. If that greater allocation were made available, it would in the long run mean a considerable saving to the ratepayers of the city and county.  It seems that the central authority are <Col N="1413" /> making a profit of £1,500,000 out of the registration of motor vehicles in Dublin city and county which is then available to give other places three times more than they subscribed in the form of motor vehicle tax.  Nothing like the profits made from other areas is made in Dublin city and county.  Apart from the unfair distribution of the funds collected, not all the payments in respect of motor vehicles is given back toward road construction and maintenance. The Central Fund makes a handsome profit from road tax and some of that money, as the Minister knows, is used for other purposes.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that in most other counties they either break even or get much more back in the form of road grants than they contribute in the form of motor vehicle tax, I am asking the Minister to change the system so that grants will be made according to the weight of traffic carried per mile on any road.  A count is often carried out on the roads coming into Dublin city to show how many vehicles per minute or per hour pass along those roads.  The weight of traffic carried on a mile of those roads could, therefore, be compared with that carried on a mile of any other road in the country.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Dublin City and County are not being fairly treated if we consider the weight of traffic that those roads carry.  Everybody knows that it is the weight of traffic that affects the condition of any road surface.  We saw, for instance, where a heavy vehicle came out of Dublin on to the Naas road and the imprint of the wheel of that vehicle is still there in the middle of the road.  If 100 vehicles per hour pass over one mile of road and only five vehicles per hour pass over another mile of road, it is obvious that the road carrying the heavier rate of traffic should get a more generous allocation towards its upkeep and maintenance.</P>
    <P>I have no complaint to make against the Minister who is operating the system.  As he said himself he has increased the grants in recent years available to both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. However, in view of the handsome <Col N="1414" /> profit that is being made at the expense of the motor vehicle owners in those areas, I am asking him to change the system in the manner I have suggested.  It is all very well to give a grant per mile.  Take Cork County, which is a huge area.  In driving from Dublin to Cork City, when you have just gone inside the Cork County boundary there is a long journey to Cork City, and driving across from Cork City into West Cork entails another long journey.  Those are very long roads but they are not carrying anything like the weight of traffic or the number of vehicles per mile that Dublin City or County is carrying.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council on several occasions made the case to the Minister for Local Government and his Department that we should be more generously treated.  People coming into the city are critical of the county roads and it is obvious we need a more generous allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Rooney was quite well aware and as I have said in my reply here today, road grants are allocated on the basis of mileage and not on the basis of the number of vehicles registered.  While we might find there are certain adjustments that could be made here and there, not necessarily in Dublin City and County, I think, overall, this system in relation to county road authorities, which was introduced in 1949-50 by the Coalition Government, of which Deputy Rooney's Party formed the large majority, has worked reasonably well since then.  If a change were to be made it certainly could never be conceived that it should follow that all of the tax collected annually in a place such as Dublin City should be spent within the actual local authority area in which it was collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to follow that to its logical conclusion in regard to all other taxes we should wind up with a number of small republics approximating to our county boundaries and city boundaries throughout the country with a completely different standard of social and other services being <Col N="1415" /> given to our people and the county boundary would be the deciding factor. I do not think anybody can conceive such a development.  If followed to its logical conclusion this would lead to such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the case made here by Deputy Rooney&mdash;in all good faith, I have no doubt&mdash;in regard to how the County and City of Dublin have fared with the grants they are getting from the system as it has been operating for the past 12 years.  The present situation is that Dublin City's and County's total overall additional grants this present year are no less than £376,000 more than they were a couple of years ago.  Taking Dublin City again on its own, its share, heretofore, has been £90,000 a year.  This year, they are empowered to spend £400,000 and they have been told that they may have the same amount for the next two years as well so that they may have continuity of planning and execution of their works.</P>
    <P>The most amazing feature of all is&mdash; Deputy Rooney is aware of this and, if not, he must be after today&mdash;that, as far back as 1947, the special problem of the arterial roads leading in and out of Dublin was recognised.  Special recognition was given to that problem and, under a Fianna Fáil Government, £500,000 was allocated for these very laudable purposes.  Deputy Rooney and some of his colleagues know even better than I do why over all these years that £500,000 is still unspent to the tune of £330,000 and why no works to consume all this money have been forthcoming in the sense that £330,000 out of that £500,000 is unallocated, not alone unspent.</P>
    <P>I deprecate some of the approaches to Dublin.  I know the northern approach best, for which, I am sure, Deputy Rooney has a soft spot.  It is no credit to the local authority area in which it is.  Yet, we know that money could be got and was available to do that type of work.  Some start appears to have been made in some places. Those starts and the cutting of the bends and the widening of the roads, particularly at Collinstown, are still <Col N="1416" /> very evident with the briars and brambles growing across what was once started and never finished.  I am happy to know that, after all these years and this neglect and the fact that the money was available, some effort is now being made and £170,000 of that £500,000 has now been called upon by way of allocation for works proposed to be done or, in some cases, that are at this moment being done.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that Dublin County and City areas have all of their roads dust free.  In other words, they are tarmacadam or concrete surfaces. The national average of our roads throughout the country so dust free is only 43 per cent.  Are we to build roads, and to build roads beside roads, merely to expend money because it is collected in Dublin City while, down the country, there still is a justifiable clamour for more and more road improvement and while only 43 per cent. of the entire road system outside the Dublin area is in that condition to-day? Many millions of pounds will be needed for many years hence to make a real impression on that problem. To talk of making a profit out of the Road Fund is ludicrous when we consider this very brief résumé of the position of the Road Fund for some short few years back.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the Road Fund was in debt something under £2 million.  By 1957, that debt had risen to over £4 million. This year and, at the moment, the debt on that Fund has been reduced to approximately £3 million.  We are still in debt.  We are more in debt but we are trying to pay off some of that debt.  Far from making any profit for the general Exchequer from this particular matter, the Deputy and the House are well aware that even in the recent past £1 million additional money was made available from the general Exchequer to supplement the then somewhat down and out Road Fund in order that we could give the special railway closing grants to various counties.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also remember that it is not so very many years ago, when there was an order to maintain even the progress that was being made on our roads, the Fund was in such a <Col N="1417" /> deplorable financial mess that somewhere in the region of £900,000 had to be got from the general Exchequer in order that over 4,000 road workers would not be forthwith paid off.  That is the situation in regard to the profit-making capacity of this Fund.  If that Fund is there for as many years as either Deputy Rooney or I will be in this House, and if it continues even in its present state, every last penny that will come into it will be required if the roads throughout the entire country are to be brought to anything approaching the standard generally obtaining in the Dublin City and County areas which are now being complained of.  I say that to the Deputy in the full knowledge that he naturally would like to see more money and more road works in his constituency.  So would we all.  But our claims elsewhere are so much stronger than are the claims of Deputy Rooney's constituency, as everybody can see who traverses these roads, that there just does not seem to be, on the face of it, any real case to be made.</P>
    <P>The council have made representations to be received by me.  They have made representations in the past to be received by other Ministers.  I mean no discourtesy to them when I indicate that I see no purpose in meeting them in the circumstances.  I am only following what has been the practice in these matters for some time past and by various Ministers in the <Col N="1418" /> past because, to receive one county in this matter, we would have to receive them all.  What county, local authority or road authority in the country is there that has not a case it could make and, I would say, a better case than can be made by Deputy Rooney, for higher grants?  We have a certain Fund there.  The Fund has in many cases been jeopardised. It has been put into bad condition. We have brought it back to a fair sense of balance.  It is limited and every penny going into it is being used and used for road purposes.  We have not any further moneys.  Therefore, what is the point in meeting these people?</P>
    <P>Dublin County and Dublin City have had £500,000 lying at their doorstep for the past 14 years and they did not spend it.  Why urge now that they in particular should have a special case? How they expect to establish it, I do not know.</P>
    <P>I promise the Deputy that any representations he may make to back up what he has said here tonight will be carefully considered by me.  If found to contain something of substance, which I may think of importance, they will get full consideration and, who knows, we may even better their lot.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state in respect of each county council the rate of wages paid to road workers on 1st December, 1961, the amount and operative date of wage increases in 1961, and details of proposals awaiting sanction in his Department; and further if he will state the local authorities which have revised the differentials for supervisory duties and the nature of such revision and the operative dates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of wages of county council roadworkers and the amount and operative date of each <Col N="1312" /> increase in wages granted in 1961 are set out in the following statement. There are no proposals for the award of wage increases to roadworkers awaiting sanction in my Department. All county councils except Carlow, Kerry, Longford, Mayo and Sligo have revised the differentials payable to supervisory roadworkers.  The revisions had the effect of increasing the maximum differentials of 10/-, 7/- and 4/- per day for the three generally recognised grades of supervisory roadworkers to 15/-, 10/- and 6/- respectively. Pro rata increases have been granted to related local grades.  The operative date of the adjustments in each case is set out in column 4 of the statement.</P>

    <P>BASIC WAGE RATES.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the incentive bonus scheme, the wage rates paid to forestry workers were the same as the rates payable to Co. Council road workers in the various counties.  With effect from the first pay week in January, 1958, a new basic wage structure for forestry workers was introduced.  Two increases in basic rate have since been granted.  Details are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  Basic rates from 4th January, 1958 to 2nd January, 1960.</P>
