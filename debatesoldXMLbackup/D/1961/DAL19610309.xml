    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I dealt mainly with the industrial position in my constituency and in the surrounding districts.  I can say that with the exception of the town of Fermoy, the other towns in the constituency have no unemployment.  I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach and the <Col N="335" /> Ministers concerned in having brought about that satisfactory position.  They have eased the unemployment position not only in my constituency but in others as well from which unemployed people used to come to my constituency looking for work.</P>
      <P>There are in that respect a couple of things to which I should like to call notice.  I should like to ask if there is any hope of ending the tide of emigration. The solution lies in the provision of industries which would give at least as good working conditions as are obtainable across the water.  It would also be necessary to have industrial expansion at least every ten years and to bring in still more new industries to all areas to give employment to young people who are now just growing up. If we are to stem emigration that is the line we must follow.  I am glad that the time has arrived when young men in this country, instead of looking abroad for employment, instead of running away to England, are able to find decent employment at home.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to agriculture is not so happy.  The time has arrived when the Minister for Finance and the Government will have to look at the question of rates on agricultural land from an entirely new standpoint. The prices for agricultural produce have remained either static or very much reduced over the past few years. In 1952 and 1953 the price of feeding barely was around 48/- per barrel; to-day it is 38/- per barrel.  The price of wheat dropped from 82/6 per barrel to 70/- per barrel.  As a result of the bovine T.B. eradication scheme there is a cloud over the livestock industry generally, and no one knows where he stands.  It is unfair that the burden of social services should be thrown on the ratepayers.  The time has come when that will have to stop or else there will be wholesale non-payment of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the bovine T.B. eradication scheme is working very unfairly in the southern counties.  These counties have been the Cinderella of the scheme.  County after county has been declared a clearance area and <Col N="336" /> the reactor cattle of all descriptions removed from the land.  If we can place any reliance on the circulars received from the Department of Agriculture and the views expressed by the veterinary inspectors of the Department, any reactor kept on the land is bound to spread that disease to the rest of the herd.  Yet the position is in the southern counties that, while milch cattle reactors have been removed, no steps have been taken for the removal of bullocks and maiden heifers.  They are left to continue to spread the disease.  I believe that is a great obstacle to the attainment of the day when we will see this disease completely wiped out.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to grain growing is very unsatisfactory.  Last year there was a flood of wheat going into the mills.  I saw the wholesale rejection of that wheat at the mills. The unfortunate farmers had to carry over that wheat, in some cases for a fortnight or three weeks, while negotiations were going on with the milling companies.  In most cases that wheat went sour.  You had unfortunate farmers paying, in some cases four times, for the removal of that wheat to the mills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to expand on it.  In my opinion, the country was defrauded by the millers this year.  I believe that the method adopted eventually to clear the wheat meant that good, sound and millable wheat was deliberately mixed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We might as <Col N="337" /> well go into industrial production in detail then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  Last night I was dealing with one method by which, I believe, we could increase production here, that is, by increased production of beet and, consequently, increased exports of sugar. I should like the Minister to tell us when replying what is the position in regard to the levy paid to Britain on the import of sugar and sugar products which cost the country £530,000 last year.  I first raised this matter over 12 months ago.  I think 12 months is sufficient time for any Department of State to rectify that situation, even though I admit it was due to the blunders of the Minister's predecessor in office.  This has resulted in a big loss to the agricultural community, in particular to many people in my constituency, which is a large beet-growing area.  I should also like the Minister to tell us what is the position in regard to securing a decent quota from the United States for our sugar and sugar products.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, I am glad that the day has arrived&mdash;at least in my constituency&mdash;where the young men can earn at home at least as good as, if not better than, they would earn if they went across the water.  Due to the expansion of industry there, there is hope that there will be even greater employment and that we shall be able to solve the problem of emigration so far as East Cork and other portions of the county are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only hope that the same aspect that prevails in my constituency in the industrial policy will be continued in other constituencies so that young men, instead of having to look abroad for employment, will find it at home. The Government and the Minister can be heartily congratulated on the change.  I do not care who claims the credit for this, that and the other, but the people of Cobh in my constituency saw what did happen.  They saw an industry expanding, a change of Government and an immediate stoppage, and felt the harsh wind of unemployment until the mixum-gatherum <Col N="338" /> Government was removed and progress could again be made in our industries.  I have no doubt that they are far more intelligent than some of the people I see in this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the flight from the land. The only basis on which I can go as to the value of the earnings of any man on the land is what we allow for it in the beet industry, where the prices are based on costings brought up to date each year.  This year the amount allowed in the costings for the earnings of an agricultural worker is about £5 18s. a week.  If you have that sum on the one hand for the small farmer working on the land producing beet and on the other hand wages are from £9 to £16 per week in any local industry, then it is no wonder that in some places you have doors locked and the small farmer gone to earn in industry what he has no hope whatever of earning on the land.  Nothing will change this except a radical change in outlook on the part of the Government and all those responsible for the present condition of affairs.  You cannot expect these men to take any other line when you see on the one hand reduced prices and on the other increased rates.  This makes a man feel that he must go somewhere and get something for his labour.  That is the attitude very largely adopted by the young people.  We were long enough in the position where the old farmer when talking about the bad times said: &ldquo;Thank God I am a week ahead of the bailiff.&rdquo;  That day has gone and we thank God for it.</P>
    <P>The position as regards wheat growing is completely changed.  To-day wheat growing is in the hands of a bunch of ranchers who refused to plough during the emergency and refused to grow wheat.  They are now in the position that no matter how low wheat goes, so long as they can knock a couple of £s an acre out of a 500-acre ranch they are satisfied. But the farmer with 20 or 40 or 50 acres has no hope of supporting his wife and family on £2 an acre.  That is also the position as regards grain generally.  I do not wish to go further into the question of agriculture except <Col N="339" /> to congratulate the Government on what I have seen good in their policy. We shall, perhaps, have other opportunities for criticising what I consider bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The record sum of over £131,700,000 which is being extracted from the people does not include all the demands which the people will have to meet.  Numerous additional charges will have to be met. Some of them have been increased recently and involve severe imposts on many people.  In the sum which is being extracted under the Estimates for the coming year the amount provided for the supply services totals over £7,000,000 more than what was taken in 1957-58.  When the present Government were elected they undertook to examine the Estimates and to effect economies where possible, and in the first two years a gesture in that regard was made.  The first two years showed a reduction in the Estimates for the supply services amounting to £4,000,000 odd.  Included in these reductions was the very substantial reduction due to the saving in respect of food subsidies.  The flour and bread subsidy alone saved £6,900,000 and the butter subsidy £2,500,000.  But this year and last year the supply services have again increased, showing that, taking the four years since the change of Government, the net increase in the supply services is over £7,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, very many additional charges have been imposed both directly and indirectly.  Earlier this year the social welfare contributions were increased substantially and the ordinary rate for employers and employees has been increased from 2/4d. which it was in 1955 to 4/6d. for an employer in 1961 and 4/6d. for an employee in respect of male workers.  In the case of women the ordinary rate has been increased from 2/- for the employer to 4/2d. and from 1/4d. for the employee to 3/5d.  These increases this year imposed a very severe additional impost.  While these increases have to be borne people have had to pay higher bus and train fares <Col N="340" /> and higher charges for a variety of services that people have to avail of, as well as the very substantial increases that have occurred in the cost of living.  Since February, 1957, compared with February, 1960, train fares have increased by 12.88 per cent.; bus fares have increased by 14.19 per cent. The cost of living, as shown in the consumer price index, has increased from 135 in February, 1957 to 148 in November, 1960.  All these additional burdens have been imposed and have to be borne by all sections.</P>
    <P>At the same time as there has been that increase in the consumer price index, the food index shows an increase of 16 points between February, 1957, and November, 1960; clothing an increase of four points; housing and sundries an increase of 11 points in each case; condensed milk has increased by four per cent., cocoa by 12½ per cent., biscuits by 10 per cent and other groceries by 15½ per cent.  Probably the most significant increases were those in respect of flour and bread.  Flour has increased by 89 per cent., bread by 69 per cent. and butter by 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>These burdens have all to be borne by the people in addition to the very large sum of £131,700,000, which is being taken in respect of the current Book of Estimates and which includes, as I say, a sum of over £7,000,000 more for the supply services than was extracted in 1957 before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>It is significant that that large sum of money has to be paid by fewer people.  One of the undertakings given by the present Government prior to the last election was that they would provide 100,000 new jobs over a five-year period.</P>
    <P>If we look at the statistics issued prior to the Budget last year we find in two tables the numbers of persons at work.  Those tables show that the latest figures available for persons at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing&mdash;at Table 7&mdash;showed a drop between 1956 and 1959 of 20,000 persons.  That drop was commented on here earlier to-day.  When we turn <Col N="341" /> to page 16 we find that between 1956 and 1959 there were 26,000 fewer people employed in non-agricultural economic activity.  If we total those figures it is obvious that instead of increased employment there are 50,000 fewer people employed here than before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>There are other figures which show how serious the situation is.  Undoubtedly, the numbers registering as unemployed show a reduction, but what has happened?  According to official figures published in Britain on 16th December last, the number of persons who went to Great Britain from the Republic, as it was described, totalled 64, 494 in 1959 and 58,316 in 1958.  These figures were based on the number of insurance cards issued to people from the Twenty-six Counties entering employment in Britain for the first time and do not include non-working dependents or persons under 16 years of age who go for work but who are not obliged to stamp cards.  It is significant that in two years 122,000 persons secured employment in Britain for the first time.</P>
    <P>Four years have now elapsed since the change of Government and one would have expected that some instalment of the promises and of the plan which was offered to provide 100,000 new jobs would have been given.  Instead, there has been a very substantial increase in emigration and a drop in the numbers employed from the numbers employed in 1956 or early 1957.</P>
    <P>While that has occurred, every economic index and economic factor has been in the Government's favour. Prior to the change of Government import prices had been rising.  Since February, 1957 import prices have fallen and, despite the fall in import prices, costs here have increased.  Rates in 1956 amounted to £17,745,000. Rates to the end of March, 1960 amounted to £21,400,000, so that the fewer people left in the country have not only to bear a higher burden in respect of the Book of Estimates and the supply services but have to pay more for the essentials of life and also have to pay higher rates and higher social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> When the present Minister introduced his first Budget he said&mdash; Column 940, Volume 161 of the Official Report&mdash;</P>
    <P>The existing Civil Service structure seems too elaborate for our needs.  The grading system is, to my mind, unduly complex.  I intend that these matters will be examined and radical changes made which will, I believe, ultimately produce worthwhile economies.</P>
    <P>A Question was answered yesterday which showed that including the total of 2,700 persons who were formerly included as coming within the description of civil servants, and who are still employed in the public service but are not included for descriptive purposes as civil servants, there are now between 500 and 600 more civil servants in the State than was the case in March, 1957.  Therefore for a smaller population we require more civil servants for the administration of government and instead of economies having been achieved the Civil Service is as costly and is larger than it was four years ago.</P>
    <P>With proper and efficient business methods applied to the Civil Service I believe it would be possible to achieve a reduction in the numbers without disemploying existing civil servants. It should start with a reduction in the numbers recruited.  The present system in many cases is outmoded and antiquated and many extremely competent civil servants are obliged to work under a system that is neither efficient nor economic, but because it has been in operation for many years it continues to operate.  It is significant that according to the Minister's statement at column 940, volume 161 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>The Civil Service itself has been concentrating for quite a while on organisation and methods studies. Useful results have been achieved, but the total cost of administration none the less remains too high.  The abolition of certain services would, of course, yield economies, but specific proposals in this direction rarely commend themselves to the public, however much a general reduction in <Col N="343" /> costs of administration may be desired. Work could, however, be expedited and expense reduced if delegation of duties were extended and the appropriate degree of responsibility were fully accepted and exercised at all levels of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing and, indeed, will come as a great surprise to the public that after four years, while this study and examination has taken place, instead of a reduction there is an increase in the numbers and no effect given to the undertaking which was expressed in the Budget Statement in 1957.</P>
    <P>While some sections of the community have received wage and salary increases to offset rises in the cost of living&mdash;and for some these increases may ease the burden, for State employees, workers in certain undertakings such as statutory bodies and some employed in private concerns&mdash;in certain cases the increases granted have not measured up to expectations.  Quite recently there was considerable dissatisfaction among Army personnel at the pay increases compared with what was expected and many statements as to the effect on morale have been made in respect of these increases.</P>
    <P>While some benefit has been given to those categories either of State employees or persons employed in private industrial concerns or in statutory organisations, what of the large numbers of the community who have received no increases, the self-employed, small shopkeepers, the persons who run their small businesses either individually or as family concerns? These people have had to pay higher rates, have had to meet a higher cost of living and in the case of those who employ, as all of them do, some assistance, they are obliged to pay higher social welfare contributions in respect of them.</P>
    <P>These people have not been able to compensate themselves for the very substantial increase in costs they have had to meet.  They have been obliged to meet higher rate demands, higher costs in respect of the essentials of <Col N="344" /> life, such as food; they have had to meet higher bus and train fares and recently a five per cent. increase in electricity charges.  How can these self-employed people offset the demands being made on them?  How can they compensate themselves for the added charges and costs they have been obliged to meet?  These sections of the community, many of them white collar workers, persons endeavouring to pay their way and establish businesses or undertakings in which to provide for themselves or their families, are obliged to meet substantially increased burdens without any compensatory increases in respect of salaries or wages such as other sections secured.</P>
    <P>In that connection a recent decision added a further charge to the white collar section, that is, the decision to increase the interest on Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans.  The section of the community that availed of these loans is a section that deserves encouragement and assistance.  They are people who through their own exertions, through their desire to provide better accommodation, proper homes for themselves and their families undertook the liability without imposing a charge on local authorities.  Many of them through great personal exertions have availed of these loans and indeed are people deserving encouragement and assistance.  I believe that the recent decision to raise the interest rate is one that will add considerably to the burden and responsibility which are borne by that section of the community.</P>
    <P>One of the developments which the last Government encouraged was an expansion in industrial policy for the promotion of industrial exports.  We recognised that in the present competitive economic conditions if industrial expansion was to be effected not alone should we have the existing facilities which were available but that we should endeavour to provide an added incentive which would secure not only an expansion in industrial employment but a much needed expansion in industrial exports.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the last <Col N="345" /> Government we introduced tax remission in respect of industrial exports. That was introduced in 1956 and while it has been improved on since, a start had to be made.  It has often been said: &ldquo;Rome was not built in a day,&rdquo; and the decision to initiate that policy was taken by the last Government. Quite recently a very distinguished economist, Professor Carter, who is the Professor in political economy in Queen's University, referred to this when he spoke in Belfast.  He said:</P>
    <P>Progress in industry in the Republic has been remarkable.  The biggest technical factor in the change has been the tax exemption for export industries.</P>
    <P>There was an unsolicited comment by an impartial expert on what had happened.  As I say, the increase in industrial development and particularly the expansion in industrial exports are directly attributable to that decision.</P>
    <P>In addition, we welcomed and sought foreign capital for the purpose of providing capital where necessary and technical know-how where it was not available here.  There have been many examples of the success of the efforts to attract foreign capital as well as the effort to secure technically qualified persons to establish and, in the initial stages, operate industries here where we either had not the capital resources available or the technical knowledge and skill requisite for the particular undertaking concerned.</P>
    <P>Some few months ago, a question was answered in the House which showed the number of industries and factories established with the aid of foreign capital and technicians.  It shows the figures for the year ending 1955/56 to 1959/60.  During that period a total of 80 new factories were established which had foreign capital or technicians.  The period in question covered two years of the last Government and three years of the present Government.  It is significant that during the first period of two years 39 such factories were established and during the three years of Fianna Fáil only 41 such factories were established. <Col N="346" /> I cannot understand what has happened to the drive and enthusiasm initiated prior to the change of Government and which seems to have tapered off to such an extent that it takes three years for the present Government to achieve what took only two years under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly expressed the view that we should encourage industrial expansion on the basis of private enterprise by the exertions of our own people which can be stimulated and encouraged by tax concessions and other assistance and that where we have not sufficient knowledge, technical know-how or where capital is not readily available, we should seek external capital and technical know-how to establish industries here.  We believe that private enterprise should be encouraged in the first instance.  In any particular cases where it is not possible to secure through private enterprise the establishment of a particular industry or undertaking, the State should take the initiative.  The economy as a whole depends upon private enterprise and private endeavour, but where private enterprise or individual efforts or initiative are not sufficient, then it is essential for the State to take action and initiate the development of the requisite undertakings.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of that policy we established the Industrial Development Authority to promote industrial enterprise. Indeed, since it was established, very considerable progress has been made on the basis of the initiative of that authority and the knowledge and experience which the members of the Industrial Development Authority have employed in the provision of knowledge and experience for industrial development and expansion.</P>
    <P>In that connection, comment has recently been made on the change which has taken place in the considerable number of foreigners who have come here and purchased large farms and estates.  While we have, as I say, repeatedly expressed the view that steps should be taken to encourage foreign investment, we believe that in this matter care should be taken to see <Col N="347" /> that no undue encroachment is allowed and that no estates or farms are acquired by foreign interests which could be acquired by the Land Commission and made available for agricultural holdings here.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I believe that the Land Commission should operate on the basis of providing larger holdings than were provided in the past.  I mention that <i>en passant.</i>  It is not a matter that we can discuss on the Vote on Account in detail, but it is obvious that with the changes in agricultural techniques, the development of machinery, scientific knowledge and experience and the general pattern of the economy, the size of farms which were in the past never economic will be even less so in the future.  An effort must be made to provide farms of a larger acreage.  It is, therefore, important that the Government should watch with the greatest care the possible serious social and economic problems which will occur if the large scale purchase of estates and farms by foreigners is allowed to continue without a careful assessment of the consequences as well as a careful assessment of the number of purchases.  It is possible that the numbers being bought are not as large as would appear from time to time but, in order to allay public uneasiness and suspicion in this matter, care should be taken to compile accurate figures of the purchases and in that way have available statistics which will show the extent of development.</P>
    <P>I believe that from the present Book of Estimates in so far as it is possible to judge it this Government have no comprehensive policy which will provide for the needs of the country.  When they were elected, they undertook to provide an additional 100,000 jobs.  To-day we find fewer people in employment. Over four years no fewer than 200,000 persons have emigrated to Britain.  We find a higher cost of living, higher charges in respect of social services, higher bus and train fares, higher charges in respect of hospital accommodation, which have been increased from a maximum 6/- to 10/- a day.  All these are added burdens.  We find that, instead of having a smaller <Col N="348" /> Civil Service to administer the affairs of the country, we have more civil servants than were employed four years ago.</P>
    <P>We have fewer people in the country and they have to bear greater burdens. If that is the record of the Government after four years, I only hope that the Government will spare us the agony of another year of Fianna Fáil administration.  I believe that recent indications of public opinion justify the belief that the people are anxious for a change and that they are only waiting the opportunity to effect that change on the earliest possible occasion. The Government can give the people the opportunity and the sooner the people are afforded that opportunity the better.</P>

      <P>So far as I can see from the debate up to the present, there is no new approach by the Opposition.  It is the same old story.  The same methods are adopted. In short, it amounts to telling the people that if this is a fine day it is due to something the Coalition Government did but if it is a wet day tomorrow that is due to what Fianna Fáil did.  Anything that is good resulted from the action of the Coalition Government but anything that is detrimental or not popular with the public is due to the incompetence of Fianna Fáil.  I am afraid that the people expect more than that.  The people expect a new approach, if that was ever possible, but putting old wine in new bottles is not a new approach and we have the same type of negative argument being played up here again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party was more realistic.  He agreed that there were signs of improvement generally but deplored the fact that they were not as great as they should be.  He was satisfied we were correct when we claimed a marked increase in exports, that the balance of international payments had improved, when we held there was increased productivity, but naturally he wound up by saying that these increases should be more marked.  All of us would like <Col N="349" /> them to be more marked.  We are all delighted with the progress made, especially since it is progress in the right direction&mdash;increased productivity and improved national income.  The desire, however, of every member of the Government and of those who support them, must be that that progress should be accelerated as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I was looking over speeches made when the Opposition members were on this side of the House and it is lamentable to read those speeches and compare them with what is being said now by members of Opposition. Excuses were being made for the lack of progress and all sorts of arguments were produced to show why there was a falling off in agricultural employment. There was not one speech on the Vote on Industry and Commerce in 1956, which I have before me, but had a gloomy note and a general apology for the state of affairs.  In this debate, every note of discord is harped on in order to get sympathy from the people generally and I would particularly like to refer to increased E.S.B. charges.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country at the present time there is a carefully planned effort to stimulate unrest amongst E.S.B. rural consumers, no doubt with a definite purpose, because the E.S.B. reaches the homes of practically every rural dweller.  Now, irresponsible representatives of Fine Gael attend meetings of the consumers in local halls and are very glib in telling them that this increase is due to some action of Fianna Fáil.  They insinuate that it is the simplest thing in the world for the Government to have these charges reduced. As a matter of fact, on one occasion at a meeting at which I, or any other Deputy was not present, Fine Gael spokesmen pointed out that the E.S.B. had approached the Government for a loan and when they did not get it, inevitably they had to increase their charges.  These people forget to remind the consumers that when we were in in the midst of what was described as the financial crisis in 1956, when the income of the agricultural workers and farmers generally was <Col N="350" /> lower than it is now, when, on the figure given by the Minister then, there was a 16 per cent. reduction, the fixed charges of the E.S.B. were increased by 8½ per cent.  The present charges are calculated to increase revenue by 5 per cent.  There was no effort made then to bring the people together to protest against the failure of the Government of the day to take action, there was no effort by the same people who are trying to stimulate unrest when there is an inevitable increase now which is directly due to action taken by the Coalition Government at the time.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question&mdash;a reply which was very much overdue&mdash;the Minister stated that the increased charges now are due to the E.S.B. having to call on reserves which have been depleted, due to the withdrawal of the subsidy in 1955.  I challenge contradiction of those facts and it is only right that the people should know them.  That does not for a moment mean that any member on this side of the House does not regret. as much as those who shed crocodile tears on that side of the House, the increase in E.S.B. charges.  But let us not try to misrepresent the position or mislead the people by telling them something which is a falsehood and in no way represents the facts of the situation.  Every speaker who got up on that side of the House, from the ex-Minister for Finance down to the last speaker, referred to the increased E.S.B. charges, which they should be ashamed to mention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we have this negative type of cry anyhow? Would one not think that we would have something more constructive, something more definite?  If, in 1961, we still talk about the abolition of the subsidies, would it not be much better and more constructive if the Opposition would say: &ldquo;We are going to bring these subsidies back, if we are returned to power?&rdquo;  Why not be honest and say: &ldquo;They are gone and we do not propose to bring them back?&rdquo;  Furthermore, when they were <Col N="351" /> proposed, we were told they were no good and that they were only putting the money, the taxpayers' money, into one pocket and taking it out of another. They were condemened when they were introduced; they were useless but now they are the greatest thing ever produced and their removal was a terrible loss to the people.</P>
      <P>I think we have reached a stage at which the people will analyse for themselves the approach of any Party to any problem.  We have speakers going around the country, as we had in Sligo-Leitrim, telling them: &ldquo;Your E.S.B. charges have been increased&mdash;this has been increased and that has been increased,&rdquo; and, at the same time, these people are pointing out that they are not getting enough subsidies or enough grants for this, that or the other thing. For their own sake I suggest it would be a much better approach if they had a more constructive outlook.  Let us note the number of houses closed by emigration but let us also take heart from the thousands of new houses that are being built and have been built and the demand there is on grants available to assist the repair, reconstruction and erection of houses.  We can still see that thousands of people are prepared to give themselves better conditions and better homes and form the nucleus of a stable community remaining on the farm.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker pointed out that an evolution in farming due to mechanisation had left us in the position where the small holdings are becoming more uneconomic than ever and in which new methods must be adopted.  That is true.  The system operated by the small-holder 30 years ago is not sufficient today if he is to maintain the increased standard of living which he now has.  I take great heart from the present Estimates because they show expansion and activity in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every speaker opposite saw fit to criticise what he regarded as the huge burden on the people, they failed to point the reasons for the various increases.  And there are good reasons, even for the increased number of civil <Col N="352" /> servants about which much play has been made.  Either these speakers did not examine the position or did not want to do so.  After a superficial examination I find that the main increase takes place in Post Office construction activity.  It is not a sign of retrogression by any means when we have a queue for telephone installations greater than the existing staff can cope with.  Every member of the House knows how frequently he is approached to expedite telephone installations, very often in areas where such facilities were not dreamt of a few years ago.  That is a very marked sign of progress.  I was interested to note that the main increase in the Civil Service is in the Post Office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main thing to be drawn from that heartening activity is that more and more people are providing themselves with facilities which can only be associated with greater commercial activity and better standards of living.  I challenge any member of the Opposition to point out any better means of improving conditions in rural Ireland than by giving modern amenities such as electricity, water supplies, better housing, better roads, better conditions for livestock, grants for piggeries and subsidisation for fertilisers.  I challenge any member of the Opposition to point out any better means of improving the lot of the people in rural Ireland than the activities that have been vigorously <Col N="353" /> pursued by the present Government. No Opposition member believes that the rot of emigration can be arrested overnight but what&mdash;unfortunately&mdash; they deplore is that the foundations of a sound, expanding economy have been well and truly laid.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker, who is usually fair-minded, referred to industries. We have come a long way in industry. I have not been a great length in this House but there is a refreshing breeze blowing through the debates now as compared to what they were ten years ago.  Nobody would venture to get up in the House now and say that industry is not essential even to our agricultural economy and the &ldquo;back-lane factories&rdquo; that were the subject of jeers and sneers are now referred to as industrial undertakings of high standing capable of breaking into the export market and securing figures such as those we have had in recent years.</P>
      <P>These things were not achieved without some calculated risks, as Deputy Booth said, and stern opposition but they are now a <i>fait accompli</i> and let nobody suggest we should pause in our onward drive in industrialisation.</P>
      <P>The increasing cost of living is the main theme of the Opposition at the present time but would they try to explain what consolation the public will get from the Opposition's denunciation of the increased cost of living in the last four years when the increase in their short period of 2½ years was greater than it has been for the Government's full term of four years?  I cannot see what kudos are supposed to flow to the Opposition in condemning the increased cost of living now when the most marked weakness in their own period of office was that they took no action to curb the spiral. That was a Government which was not quite in agreement on policy and they allowed wages to go up and prices to follow and then wages to go up and prices to follow again.  The vicious spiral went on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the number of industries started during their term of office.  He said &ldquo;two years&rdquo; in order to make the period <Col N="354" /> seem as short as possible but it was 2½ years and in that term not a single industry started that was not on the stocks when the Coalition took office. In fact many of them carried over until the 1957 period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not one single industry during those two and a half years was started that was not a success before the Coalition Government took over and many were carried over to the present time.  I admit that a few were initiated during the time they were in office.  Let us face the facts.  That is actually what the position was.  There is no gainsaying the facts and just the same position would obtain if we went out of office tomorrow.  Scores of industries, now initiated, would inevitably receive a set-back because a weak Government would deter their development. That is the point I want to make.  If <Col N="355" /> there is one thing which creates a wrong atmosphere for progress, particularly for industrial development, and particularly in the matter of foreign investment in industries here, it is a Government in power which is likely to disintegrate overnight.  That is a climate to which no one wants to return.</P>
      <P>I do not want to harp again&mdash; everyone has been flogging it&mdash;on the 1957 election, and what Fianna Fáil said and promised.  I remember listening to the Taoiseach at one election meeting when he pointed out that we were making no promises.  He emphasised that we were making no promises. The fact of the matter is that Fianna Fáil could not have avoided getting back into power at that time of gloom, despondency, crises and credit squeezes.  The people had practically lost hope.  I heard a good business man, a supporter of Fine Gael saying: &ldquo;Oh, no, not that again.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those are the facts.  It is not necessary to distort or exaggerate them in any way.  Nothing we can say here, and nothing the Opposition can say, will in any way pervert the minds of the people who are well aware of what is, what was and what might have been.  These are the things they must think about.  I remember Ministers in the Coalition Government speaking long and loudly about the flight from the land, and going to great pains to point out that that was common to all agricultural countries in the world, that machinery was moving in and that there was less employment in the agricultural industry. No suggestion was made as to how that position might be improved.  In fact, Deputy Manley, who is reputed to be manly, on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce on 27th June, 1956, at Volume 158, column 1128, of the Official Report, said:</P>
      <P>It is a gloomy prospect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>He was referring to agriculture, coming to the end of a Coalition period</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the young people who have passed through vocational schools <Col N="356" /> and even for our university graduates that they must go to other lands to find a living after so much time and money have been spent on them here.</P>
    <P>People have now been talking about these things as if they all started yesterday&mdash;not yesterday, but the day the Fianna Fáil Government came back into office.  How will the country ever come to a sense of reality if that type of puerile debate dominates every occasion on which this Estimate is before the House?</P>
    <P>I believe there are people on the other side of the House capable of rising to higher things than adopting that negative attitude.  If any Vote shows a decrease or an economy, they point out that the Government are falling back, that there is a lack of activity, or that something is not getting the support due to it, indicating that the Government are slipping and that fisheries, forestry, or some other branch, would show lesser activities in the years to come.  All these things are being pursued at the present time.</P>
    <P>After full consideration, when we have the increased activity in afforestation, in tourism, in industrial development, when we spend millions of pounds on the eradication of bovine T.B., when we build better hospitals, houses and other facilities for our people, I believe we are going in the right direction.  I challenge anyone to point out that we are not bringing about increasing activities under every one of these heads.</P>
    <P>I also believe&mdash;and I offer this advice to the Opposition for what it is worth&mdash;if they are ever to get anywhere, they had better accept what has happened and say: &ldquo;If we are ever in office, we will do more in the same direction as Fianna Fáil, but we will do it better&rdquo;, rather than adopt the negative attitude of trying to make the people believe what Deputy Blowick tried to make them believe yesterday. I wonder is there a child in the country who would believe Deputy Blowick when he said: &ldquo;The policy of Fianna Fáil is to put the small farmer out of existence.  They do not want to say it openly but that is their policy.&rdquo;  What <Col N="357" /> is the use of nonsense of that kind? Does everyone not know that a child in infant standard would not believe that?  It is useless talk and does not get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that progress is marked.  I am not satisfied that it is sufficiently rapid, but I believe it could be accelerated, and I believe it will be accelerated.  Everyone in this House should endeavour to ensure that it is. After all, we are here to do a job. Some people on the other side of the House would like to be back on this side but they must remember the country cannot afford the luxury of that nonsense.  The approach to it should be rather on straightforward lines, not using tricks, or gimmicks, or juggling of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Our financial position is sound.  Our finances are being held without resort to any tricks or gimmicks.  I am no economist but I have some idea of the rudiments of economy and I say that no progress can be made unless things at the top&mdash;our finances&mdash;are first made sound and unless the basis is laid for expansion in our economy through increased productivity and improved permanent employment, not fortnightly relief which creates only a false sense of prosperity.  Those are the fundamentals of progress.  Although, as I say, I am not an economist, I challenge anybody to say that is not true.</P>

      <P>This Vote on Account gives us an opportunity of stocktaking as to our national income and national expenditure.  The present President of Ireland, when he was Taoiseach, speaking in this House some few years ago said we had reached the limit of back-breaking taxation.  I think it is right we should compare the limit which we had then reached with the limit we have reached today. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance a few moments ago said he welcomed the trend of national income and national expenditure. So it is no harm that we should examine it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  Those were his words.  Let us take the year 1959.  The national income then was approximately £503,000,000.  Last year it is estimated it was £525,000,000&mdash; a steep rise if you wish.  But in 1959 the percentage of income taken away in taxation was one-fifth.  Last year the percentage taken away in taxation was one-fourth.  In other words, the more we earn the more we should be taxed.  That is as far as I can make out the policy of Fianna Fáil.  But let us remember that if we continue in that way we shall find ourselves in the position in which Britain found herself some years ago where, through super taxation, when one earned a pound one was permitted to pocket only 6d. of it.</P>
      <P>That would appear to be the policy of Fianna Fáil&mdash;the greater the income the greater the percentage of taxation we will have to take from our pockets. That is a serious problem.  We must examine the position.  Two things mainly affect us, more employment which would bring more income, and less of this curse of emigration.  Since Fianna Fáil took office we find there are 50,000 fewer employed in this country.  I know that is a very controversial figure.  The Fianna Fáil people say it is not true, that we have more employed today than in the days of the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>We must get down to the fundamentals of this question where we can find out what is the truth between our statement and that of the Government, which are completely opposite: we say we have less, they say more. The register of unemployed is not a true one for this reason: there is no reference on it as to the rate at which the unemployed emigrate.  But there is one true test and that is the register of employed.  We have reached the stage at which social benefits are so attractive that no matter what his employment a man is highly interested in being entered in the register of employed. So we have got to get down to that register because it is there the truth of this matter lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever, on the figures supplied by the Social Welfare <Col N="359" /> Department and by the Government, that there are 50,000 fewer employed today in this State than there were in the days of the inter-Party Government. If there are more employed then they are not on the register of employed. With these attractions of social security I am quite certain there are not 50 people in genuine employment who are not so registered.  Therefore, that is the only test we can apply other than the word of each Deputy.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied we have had 200,000 migrants now that we did not have in the days of the inter-Party Government.  Migration was not the curse that some people made it out to be 10, 15 or 20 years ago.  In those days, people migrated for a few months in the year to a maximum of five months but they returned to this country with their earnings and savings. Unfortunately, that is no longer the position.  When a man migrates now he not only goes himself but he takes his wife and family with him and he is a complete loss to the State. That is a different kind of migration. In fact, it is emigration which has become a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Again, I may be asked where I get my figures and how I know that there are 200,000 fewer people in the country than in the days of the inter-Party Government.  It is difficult for me to prove that but if we look at recent litigation in our courts we will get some corroboration.  Quite recently in our courts it was held there has been such a flow of population out of rural Ireland that the number of Deputies must be considerably reduced in rural Ireland.  It is from the rural parts of the country that this flow of emigration has occurred, though I know Deputy Sherwin will say there is as much emigration from the City of Dublin.  I have no figures from Dublin but I have from rural Ireland.  In my own constituency of West Donegal there has been a fall of over 10,000 in the population over the past 10 years.</P>
    <P>It has been said we have had more employment.  There is one place in which more employment is provided. but it is a peculiar place in which to have corroboration of the statement, <Col N="360" /> namely, the Civil Service.  The present Minister for Finance, in his first Budget speech here, about six weeks after he had taken office, gave a promise that one of the things he would do would be to streamline the Civil Service, to dovetail one position with another and to reduce its numerical strength.  There are 400 more civil servants today than there were when the Minister for Finance came into office. If he wants to quote that figure for more employment, he is right.  He can prove there are 400 more civil servants today than there were then.  But certainly that is not one of the places in which we hoped to find more employment when he took office.</P>
    <P>We are told there are more industries in Ireland today.  I get annoyed when I hear all this boasting about industries.  Where would we be today without electricity?  I do not think we could have very many industries, particularly in rural Ireland, were it not for electricity.  So you remember what the Minister called the initial scheme of electricity here?  It was called a white elephant.  Fianna Fáil abhorred and detested it so much that they left that white elephant in complete isolation for over 20 years before they decided to take him out of quarantine. Then they boast of the offspring and progeny of this white elephant.  Without it, I am afraid, no Government would have very much to crow about from the point of view of industry.  I often wonder do we give credit at all to the pioneers of electricity in this State? Do we think of the late Deputy Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan who in the early stages of the State initiated this scheme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to less employment and to more emigration.  They are one of the acid tests as to whether we are progressing or otherwise.  The other one <Col N="361" /> is the cost of living.  Without a doubt the cost of living has gone up.  I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that Deputy Breslin was not present in the House a few moments ago when our colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, spoke.  He spoke of Fine Gael going around the country bemoaning the increased E.S.B. charges and organising protest meetings.  I am surprised that he should accuse Fine Gael of being the organisers. Deputy Breslin and I had an opportunity of attending many of those meetings.  I am satisfied they were not organised by Fine Gael.  Deputy Breslin and I attended these meetings, which were held at Falcarragh, Gweedore, Annagry, Dungloe, Fintown and Maghery, and gave an undertaking we would do our best to ensure that, if this 10 per cent.  Increase was not abolished, there would be no further increases in the future.  It is wrong of the Parliamentary Secretary, who did not attend the meetings attended by Deputy Breslin and I, to say they were Fine Gael caucus meetings.  They were meetings of angry men to protest against this charge.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us the reason for this charge was that in 1955 the inter-Party Government removed the subsidy on rural electrification.  He said that with his tongue in his cheek.  If that were so, then he has sat with his tongue in his cheek during those six years without trying to restore the subsidy.</P>
    <P>The charter of the E.S.B. lays down that, taking year in and year out, the E.S.B. are prohibited from making a profit, and rightly so.  In 1955, they were able to pay their own way.  There was no necessity for a subsidy on rural electrification.  In order to relieve the Exchequer, that subsidy was removed. But since then the expenses of the E.S.B. have gone up so much that they now find it necessary to resort to this obnoxious method of increasing the charge to the consumer.</P>
    <P>You may ask me why have the expenses of the E.S.B. gone up. Primarily, in my opinion, because of the increased wages paid by the E.S.B. to their employees.  It is but right that these increased wages should be paid. But do we ask ourselves why have we <Col N="362" /> had these eight and ninth round of wage increases?  Is it not to meet the increased cost of living caused by the slashing of the food subsidies away back in the first Budget introduced by the Minister for Finance?  It is for that reason, and that reason only.  If we are threatened today with a bus strike and if the employees of C.I.E. want more pay, is it not because they find they cannot meet the increased cost of living without this increase in their pay?  It all stems back to the slashing of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that he heard the present Taoiseach say in an election address on one occasion recently that he made no promises.  That is quite true.  The Parliamentary Secretary may have heard him say that, but we have read the promises he made.  We know what he and his then Leader, the present President of Ireland, Promised when they said in the west and in Waterford that if returned to power they would not interfere in any way with the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance also said that one of the signs of progress and prosperity was the increased demand for telephones.  I am now coming to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which has also imposed another burden, with increased charges for telephones, for postage and for telegrams.  Despite that, the Parliamentary Secretary told us that it is one of the signs of prosperity when people look for telephones.  If this is a sign of prosperity may God look to us when we come looking for signs.  We have increased social service charges. Now the employee must pay 4/6 per week contribution and the employer must pay the same, and what are the benefits from it?  They are an extra 11/6 per week on the old age pension. In other words we pay 9/- per week to obtain an extra 11/6.</P>
      <P>Need I talk about the poor rates? In my county the poor rates are now 52/3 in the £.  Why?  Because we have new increases in the costs of the various services, increased cost of maintenance and upkeep of patients in mental hospitals, district hospitals and county hospitals.  The other day we had announced an increase of 25 per cent.  In private motor car insurance premiums.  I remember some years ago, in the inter-Party Government days, the insurance companies sought to increase premiums.  The inter-Party Government refused to accept that, and referred it to the Prices Advisory Body.  As a result of the advice tendered to them, the Government prohibited this increase. Now we no longer have such a body. It has been abolished by the present Government, and of course the insurance companies can give us a 25 per cent.  Increase for no reason whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital charges have gone up under the Health Act.  When Deputy O'Higgins was Minister for Health, the charge to patients in district and county hospitals was 6/- a day, but the present Minister for Health has raised it to 10/- a day.  That, of course, is <Col N="365" /> again a burden on the middle class people of the poorer type who have to pay for their own maintenance.  It has gone up by almost 40 per cent.</P>

Those are the methods adopted to find out whether the poor people can afford to pay for hospital treatment or otherwise.  Did we ever consider or try to think of where this national income has been derived from?  The Parliamentary Secretary put his finger on it when he said that it came from the various natural resources of the State.  Incidentally, we might talk about the main industry. No matter how we shut our eyes to it, as the Minister for Agriculture said yesterday, the main industry in this country is agriculture.  He went further and said that the main branch of agriculture is grass.  I remember the time when Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture was branded throughout the State as the Minister for grass.</P>

      <P>Do you know the national income of the agricultural industry has fallen by £17 million since 1956?  Do you know that we tried to put fisheries on its feet, and succeeded, despite the efforts of the Minister for the Gaeltacht to sabotage it, by buying up old German trawlers which he afterwards threw on the scrap market?  Do you know that, in spite of our efforts to put it back on its feet, it was again sabotaged by Fianna Fáil by the pouring of £110,000 into a factory in my own constituency, a factory which went burst after 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find to-day?  The Gael Linn society for which I have a great deal of admiration have now stepped in to try to revive the fishing industry.  Were it not for Gael Linn, I wonder what would have happened to private fisheries in this country? Gael Linn have now stepped in to try to save the language after the botch Fianna Fáil have made of it.  I do <Col N="368" /> not think it can ever be said of Gael Linn that they were politically disposed towards inter-Partyism, but they have become disgusted with Fianna Fáil and have now stepped in to try to save the language and the fisheries Finna Fáil made such a botch of agriculture that the sugar company&mdash; another white elephant&mdash;have stepped in to try to revive it by going into the British market with vegetables, a development which the Government should have been sponsoring.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about industries.  I am told there were seven factories set up in my own county.  I know of only three.  There is one in Killybegs which got a grant of £110,000 from the State, plus a very liberal overdraft from one of the banks which has now got its fingers burnt.  It went burst inside 18 months.  Another factory, a cannery, which was never opened, received a substantial grant from Fianna Fáil. The only other one I know, thank goodness, is progressing very well, the veneer wood factory at Creeslough.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make a very long intervention in this debate.  I merely wish to make a few references to general Government economic and financial policy.  It does seem to me there is a considerable degree of social injustice in our community, a degree of social injustice which, to my mind, is a disgrace to a Christian community.  What I mean by social injustice is a level of poverty, and indeed destitution, which is capable of being alleviated.  If we are deemed, by reason of inadequate resources, to be a poor community then that is the way this community has been created: if, on the other hand, it is possible for us to alleviate our present conditions and to improve the standard of living of our people and that is not done, then there is social injustice in our community.</P>
      <P>The depressing fact which has to be faced is that notwithstanding the increase in the national income over the past few years, notwithstanding the increase in industrial employment over the past few years, the labour force in our community has been declining and the prosperity which has occurred in some sectors has not spread over the vast majority of our people.  That fact must be faced, that the level of our economic activity is totally inadequate for our needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's whole economic programme was based on the concept, first of all, that the public capital programme was going to decline and, secondly, because of this and in order to keep up economic activity, that funds should be made available, particularly to the private sector of the economy, in order to make good the declining activity resulting from the decline in the public capital programme which has taken place.  The public capital programme has, in fact, declined in the past few years.  Increased funds have been made available <Col N="370" /> to the private sector of the economy, but it is obvious from our experience over the past two or three years that the private sector of the economy is not capable of taking up all the slack in our economy at the present time.</P>
    <P>The increase in the activity in the private sector of our economy is to be welcomed.  The fact that we have increased in certain aspects of industrial activity and the fact that industrial employment has increased in the past few years is something that is to be welcomed.  The point to be made, I think, and it is the depressing fact which has to be faced, is that industrial activity in our community in the past few years has been inadequate to deal with the falling employment in agriculture and the falling employment in other aspects of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals were based on a certain level of capital formation and investment in the community&mdash;a level which, in my opinion, is too low.  I can see no other remedy but a considerably expanded Government public capital programme in order to assist in creating employment and to assist in creating a home demand and so increase economic activity.</P>
    <P>One of the figures which would indicate the level of economic progress is the figure for domestic capital formation. I know that this figure can be criticised.  I know that in many ways it is a residual figure in the national income accounts.  I know that in many ways it is a figure which can be subject to a considerable degree of error but it is at any rate an indicator.  One of the factors that economists not only from this country but from abroad who examined the problems of the Irish economy have most marked has been the low level of capital investment in our country.  The depressing fact, again, is that we have not yet reached the levels which we were able to attain in 1954 and 1955.  In regard to domestic capital formation, I know there has been an increase&mdash;and a welcome increase&mdash;in the past few years.  Following the decline that occurred due to our balance of payments difficulties, there has been an increase.</P>
    <P>The fact is that our level of domestic capital formation is still at much <Col N="371" /> too low a level and even if the Government's proposals are fully carried out&mdash; and that is very problematical &mdash; the level of capital formation in this country will still be too low.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of Government financial policy to which I think particular attention should be paid is in respect of the proper co-ordination of our plans for capital formation.  There is no proper economic planning in this country.  To my mind, we need proper economic planning in order to get proper economic activity.  I think it is wrong to hold out panaceas to people and to suggest that, by means of an economic plan or economic planning, we can produce prosperity.  The fact that investment by local authorities, the State, State-sponsored bodies and private individuals is so unco-ordinated has meant that we have not got the progress which otherwise could have been achieved.</P>
    <P>There is no proper co-ordination at the present time of the manner in which our plans for capital investment are to be carried out.  One of the matters which I think require to be immediately attended to is the manner in which our economic planning is carried out.  I spoke in this House before concerning the position of the commercial banks and the Central Bank in this country.  It is easy to suggest that persons who talk on these matters are cranks and inexpert in what are very technical fields.  One of the things which it is of interest to note is that if their speeches are looked at over the past five or 10 years&mdash;the speeches of persons who were critical of the banking system here&mdash;it will be found that a good deal of the criticism made has, in fact, been followed up and a remedy sought for the defects involved.  A number of people who were regarded as iconoclasts and cranks made suggestions over the past five or 10 years in regard to the defects in the banking system.  It will be seen that a number of these defects have been remedied and the suggestions taken up, but the fact still remains that there is considerable work that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>We are at the present time, and <Col N="372" /> have been for the past couple of years, fortunate in having no balance of payments difficulties.  This Government, if they wish, may claim credit for that. I do not think that Government action in the past few years has been the major factor in avoiding balance of payments difficulties.  The major factor was the terms of trade which were favourable to this country and I sincerely hope they will remain so.</P>
    <P>The fact, however, must be faced that in times of severe imbalance in our trade and deificit in our balance of payments, a severe strain is now being put on our banking system. When there is a deficit in the balance of payments and, perhaps, another crisis in our balance of payments which may come next year or the year after, that is not the time to deal with our banking and credit institutions but rather now when cries of alarm and cries of lack of confidence in our banking system need not be heard.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the technical aspects of this problem.  I know they are many and varied.  I do not accept the view that it is not possible for the Central Bank in our economy &mdash;a particularly open economy&mdash;adequately to control the credit policies of the commercial banks in such circumstances.  At the present time, we are unique in the world.  I do not think there is any country in the world which has a banking system such as ours.  Every country in the world claims the right to control credit policy.  Every Government, some by more effective means than others, have the power to direct the credit policy of the commercial banks.  This country has to rely entirely on exhortation and consultation which may in some circumstances be effective, and, in others, may not.  It seems to me that now is the time, before we are faced with another balance of payments crisis, to deal with this particular problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out one extraordinary factor.  At the present time we are required to maintain 100 per cent. backing of foreign securities for our note issue.  I know there have been proposals that that should be <Col N="373" /> slightly altered, but the effective position is that we require 100 per cent. backing for our note issue by foreign securities.  In fact, the Central Bank has a considerable amount of securities which cannot be used in times of balance of payments difficulties to ease these problems and to make less drastic the steps which have to be taken to remedy them.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary position is that Nigeria, which is, to some extent, in a position rather similar to our own, has built up its external assets and its note issue dependent on those external assets.  That country, which has been free for only six or eight months, requires only six per cent.  backing for its note issue, while we retain the absurd and antiquated system of requiring 100 per cent.  backing of foreign securities for our note issue. These are not merely academic suggestions; these are not the ideas of cranks or persons unqualified to deal with this problem.  These are very real matters which affect the livelihood of our people.</P>
    <P>At the present time, when there is no balance of payments crisis, when the economy is expanding, these problems do not arise.  The point I wish to stress is that now is the time when they should be dealt with, and not when we face&mdash;as we are certain, in the nature of things, to have to face&mdash; a deficit in our balance of payments sometime in the future.</P>
    <P>There are various types of criticisms which could be made of the Estimates now before the House.  By and large, people do not like increased Government expenditure, but there is one item on which I should like to see increased Government expenditure, and would welcome it, that is, in the field of education.  I feel that we are spending inadequate sums on education and that we will have to spend much greater sums in the future.  We are, in fact, living in a country in which there is great inequality of opportunity, in which a person's future is dependent on the stratum of society into which he is born.  That should be changed and the way to change it is through education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> The level of education given to the vast majority of our children is totally inadequate.  I do not want to go into detail now.  I shall deal with the question of the Irish language and the problem of teaching in the national schools more fully when the Estimate for the Department of Education, is before the House.  Those problems must be tackled immediately and a radical change will have to be brought about.  As I say, it seems to me that we will have to face increased expenditure on education in order to bring about more just conditions in our community.</P>
    <P>This debate has been characterised by Government spokesmen's efforts to suggest that speakers on this side of the House do not welcome the signs of improvements which have been made. Government spokesmen say there have been improvements and that they hope for more.  That is a sentiment with which everyone would agree, but the problem I see, and the reason I am not an optimist with regard to our economic progress, is that for so long our economy has been sick, for so long we have been an underdeveloped country with real problems of unemployment, poverty and destitution in our midst.  There are slight signs of an improvement in parts of our illness. It is as if the fever in a sick man has gone down slightly and he starts talking of being well again.</P>
    <P>The signs which have been there for the past couple of years&mdash;an increased national income, an increased level of employment in industry&mdash;are all welcome. They may or may not point to a future of steady progress.  The economic history of this State over the past 10 or 12 years shows that we have had periods of limited progress followed by periods of decline again.  That has nothing to do with whether the Government in power have been composed of different people.  It is largely dependent on the balance of payments position.  That problem may be repeated and I feel that this sick man with whom we are dealing, this sick economy with which we are dealing, will need very radical remedies to bring it on to the point at which we can say we have a really buoyant and healthy economy.</P>

      <P>This debate is normally used by the Opposition to spotlight the effects of Government policy on the economic life of the country.  Subscribing to that view personally, I nevertheless deplore the fact that, listening to the debate, one must be struck by the fact that all Government Deputies see the economic life of the country, and its future prospects, through the rosiest of spectacles, while, on the other side of the House, the vast majority see nothing in the future but gloom and disaster.  I think neither side is correct.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that Deputies on all sides of the House, because of the side they now occupy, allow the picture to be so distorted.  In my view, that is causing the utmost confusion throughout the country.  Where, but to Dáil Eireann, will the ordinary people look for guidance and direction, and if they get nothing but pessimism, distress and gloom from one group and prosperity&mdash; which they know does not exist&mdash;from the other, is it any wonder that when an election, be it a by-election or a general election, is held, the ordinary people appear to lose faith and take no interest in it at all?</P>
      <P>The right freely to elect a Government to run a country, and to change that Government if the people so desire is a privilege we do not appear to value sufficiently highly.  Many countries throughout the world, and throughout Europe, would be very pleased to have that privilege.  The apparent lack of interest must, in my opinion, surely stem from the fact that we have caused by our contradictory expressions of opinion in this House and elsewhere, so much confusion that the people have lost faith.</P>
      <P>In common with other Deputies, I intend to take advantage of this debate to indicate the parts of Government policy which I believe need to be changed.  I welcome any improvements that have taken place over the past number of years, irrespective of what Government were in power.</P>

      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of Section 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister kindly agreed to recommit this section by reason of the fact that we discussed it before we were aware of the problem which led to the introduction of the indemnifying legislation of Tuesday last.  As I understand this section, it is the machinery which replaces that which had been there up to this for the extension of the period of detention of temporary patients.  I gather that the real change effected is that instead of the Minister in future signing an extension order such order extending the period of detention may now be signed by the chief medical officer of the institution in which the patient is detained.  That is understandable and, in principle, it is probably a desirable change.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that the resident medical superintendent or the person who has the medical care of the patient&mdash;who is best qualified to know his position and what the future has in store for him and who also has the responsibility of acting as his adviser &mdash;should be the person on whom the obligation is placed of ordering his further detention.  I am anxious to examine a little bit further what safeguards are in the section in relation to the chief medical officer acting on a wrong basis or for a wrong motive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that notice of the extended period of detention must be given to the person concerned&mdash;that is, the patient&mdash;and to the person who applied for the temporary reception order.  After such notice is given an objection may be sent either by the person concerned&mdash;the patient or the applicant&mdash;and, on an objection being lodged, as I read the section the case or file is referred to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  He requires the chief medical officer to submit to him <Col N="377" /> forthwith a report, presumably a medical report, with regard to the patient concerned.</P>
    <P>The section then says that on consideration of the report the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall take such steps as he considers necessary for ascertaining whether or not the detention of the person to whom the order relates should be continued.</P>
    <P>What is it envisaged the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will do?  If there is an objection coming from, say, the person who is the subject of the extension and the chief medical officer certifies his further detention is necessary and reports to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals that in his opinion the person is suffering from some mental illness, what is it envisaged the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will then do?  As it stands, the subsection is rather vague.  It says &ldquo;such steps as he considers necessary.&rdquo;  Does that mean he may say &ldquo;I shall not do anything.  Having read the report from the chief medical officer, I now consider no steps are necessary.  I am satisfied with the report&rdquo;?  Is it envisaged that he will himself carry out a full examination of the patient concerned and, if necessary, call in further medical assistance to confirm or not to confirm the report?</P>
    <P>I mention that because we may be dealing with poor, ignorant, uneducated persons who have been received into an approved institution after examination because they are suffering from a mental illness.  In fact, such a person may be suffering from some temporary nervous upset.  The chief medical officer in any one of our district mental hospitals may be dealing with anything up to 1,500 or 2,000 patients.  In that number he may have 200, 300 or 500 temporary patients.  He may have the obligation imposed on him to consider whether and to what extent this proportion of temporary patients should be continued under detention.</P>
    <P>When, in fact, the objection will probably come only from the patient in the form of a letter there is a very great and grave temptation to say: <Col N="378" />&ldquo;This is a letter from some poor mental case and it is not to be regarded as deserving of much consideration.&rdquo; I should like to be sure that when any objection does come the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will not be satisfied merely with the medical report of the chief medical officer of the institution concerned but will conceive it to be his duty, and if necessary act and say it is his duty, himself to examine on the spot the patient concerned and decide for himself on his condition.  Indeed, I should prefer that he would do that without having been first armed with the report from the chief medical officer and without being put in a position that convenience might dictate.  The easier course is to agree with the view of the man who has responsibility for detaining the patient.</P>
    <P>I should prefer that when an objection comes, the Inspector would examine the patient whom it is proposed to continue to detain and if he forms the opinion that there is nothing wrong with the person he can then inform the chief medical officer of that opinion.  Some procedure may be designed to ascertain the correct medical position.  I am horrified that the Inspector should just get a report and opinion from the chief medical officer and, armed with that report, should then examine the patient.  The temptation is to say that the man on the spot must be right and to dissolve any doubts the Inspector may have in favour of the man who is on the spot.  I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We must start from the assumption that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and his assistant or assistants will discharge their duties conscientiously.  That is the basis upon which we have to consider this and all similar legislation&mdash;that the officers concerned with the administration of it will do their duties conscientiously and zealously.  The next consideration we have to bear in mind is that mental illness is not like physical illness.  The symptoms are not always apparent; one does not take the pulse of a mental patient, take his cardiograph or his blood pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> What one has to do in considering such a case is to keep the patient under observation more or less continuously for a definite period of time.  In these circumstances, we have to consider that the Inspector is going down, not so much in the role of a detective or as a supervisor, but as a consultant and if he is going to get anywhere in respect to the condition of any patient, he will naturally have to discuss the patient with the medical officer who has taken upon himself the responsibility of endorsing the order for the retention of the patient for treatment.</P>
    <P>In order to do that, the Inspector is bound to know, or should be in a position to ascertain, the grounds upon which the medical officer concerned has decided to retain the patient for a further period.  Consequently, I cannot see any objection to the Inspector asking the medical officer concerned to give him a full report on the patient's condition.  Surely the Inspector is bound to ask on what grounds the patient has been detained, and surely it is, in justice and equity, right that the medical officer should be permitted to state these grounds before the Inspector goes down so that, among other things, the Inspector may fully consider those grounds and have satisfied himself as to what precisely he should investigate, or what are the elements of doubt in relation to the detention of the patient that he should have clarified.</P>
    <P>I think that is justification for asking for a report in the first instance.  When the Inspector goes down and is not satisfied about the propriety of retaininig the patient, he is bound to go forthwith and take such steps as he deems necessary to ascertain whether or not the patient is properly being detained. If he has any doubt at all, he cannot allow that doubt to remain for any significant period of time.  He must straight away investigate the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 239 of the main Act, it is laid down that where the Inspector of Mental Hospitals becomes of the opinion that the <Col N="380" /> propriety of the patient's detention requires further consideration, he should report the matter to the Minister. After consideration of the report under the relevant subsection, the Minister may require the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to visit the patient and make his report on the mental condition of the patient.  It can be taken that once the Minister is informed by his officer that it is doubtful whether the patient should be kept in, the Minister would forthwith direct the inspector to visit the patient.  That is provided for in Section 239 of the principal Act.  Then, after consideration of the report, the Minister, if he thinks fit, directly discharges the patient.</P>
      <P>There is a further general obligation in respect of all persons in respect of whom the detention order has been endorsed. That can be found in Section 33 of the present Bill.  There the obligation is laid upon the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to see every patient the propriety of whose detention he has reason to doubt.  Later, he must on an ordinary visit ascertain whether or not, since his previous visit, any extensions under Section 189 of the Act have been effected and if they have give particular attention to the patients concerned.  Later, he shall include in his report to the Minister, information with respect to any patient the propriety of whose detention he doubts and notify the person in charge of the institution that he has doubts.</P>
      <P>He is bound to draw the attention of the medical officer to any case in which he has doubts as to the propriety of detaining the patient further irrespective of whether he has received an objection to the detention.  I think we have gone as far as it is reasonable for us to go in this matter.  We cannot guarantee that every person will do his duty as laid down under the Act.  We could do that, perhaps, by inordinately increasing staffs and arranging that inspections would be very much more frequent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to a matter raised by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins on Tuesday on the 1961 Bill, I can say that with regard to the checking of these extensions, we shall take some steps to <Col N="381" /> ensure that a register is kept in the institutions and that it will be regularly inspected.  In addition, I would hope that, when we have relieved the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the Assistant Inspector of the heavy burden of paper work now placed upon them, we would be able to make more frequent inspections of these mental institutions than has been the case hitherto.</P>

      <P>This procedure in relation to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals comes into operation after the chief medical officer has, on the reception of the order, authorised an extension of the period of detention. There is then an objection and there is consideration by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  What, in fact, happens if the Inspector of Mental Hospitals says: &ldquo;This patient should not be detained?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the receipt of the report and the objection, all that can transpire at that stage is that a doubt will be created in the mind of the Inspector.  The Inspector has then to ascertain whether that doubt is well founded or not.  He then reports to the Minister, who then can forthwith order the discharge of the patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder? Has the Minister had advice on this? Under this Bill the Minister is fitting into the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, a new form of machinery.  That machinery is being fitted into an Act under which the ultimate responsibility for detaining a temporary patient rested on the Minister.  The Minister signed the order.  Accordingly, everything fell into place because the Minister would not sign the order until he was satisfied that all the doubts that may have arisen all along the line were resolved and until he had eventually on his <Col N="382" /> desk a document submitted after consideration by the Inspector and everybody else.  He then signed the extension order and there could not be any appeal from that.  That is definite. But in place of it is an extension order made by the chief medical officer with a check on that by the Inspector.  However, there is not in this section any statement as to what shall happen when the Inspector says that an order, which has already been made, should not have been made.  I do not see where, in those circumstances, authority is given for the release and discharge of the patient whose detention should not be continued.</P>

      <P>It is not, but it is in the general context.  When he has fulfilled the obligation imposed on him under Section 18 of ascertaining whether or not the detention of the person to whom the order relates should be continued, there are then the other sections&mdash;but perhaps it would be better if I used the phraseology of the section:</P>
      <P>Where the Inspector of Mental Hospitals becomes of opinion that the propriety of the detention of a patient ... requires further consideration, he shall report the matter to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inspector, on receipt of the report from the medical officer, may come to the decision that the detention of the patient requires further consideration. He then reports to the Minister and the Minister directs him to go and see the <Col N="383" /> patient.  As a result of the report then submitted by the Inspector, the Minister, after consideration, may think fit to discharge the patient.  I think that is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit worried about it.  I can understand that section being the apt and proper section with the machinery as it was up to this.  For instance, that section applies generally, not merely to temporary patients.  It is the ordinary safety valve in the mental treatment code.  As I understand it, it comes into operation this way.  The Inspector is around inspecting mental institutions. He comes across a patient and has a doubt; he is a bit worried.  He reports that doubt to the Minister.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Very well.  You had better have a full examination.&rdquo;  Then, on his report, he may discharge.</P>
      <P>That is the ordinary safety valve that should be there.  There is not&mdash;and there could not be up to this&mdash;any method for dealing with the discharge of a temporary patient after his original period of six months was up. The Minister, by not approving his continued detention, automatically ordered his discharge.  But that has been taken away from the Minister now and there is a new procedure being put into operation.  Frankly I do not think it fits very well into the safety valve section, Section 239 of the parent Act.</P>
      <P>May I just put this to the Minister as an example of what I have in mind?  It is the case of a temporary patient, a patient for only six months. He is in only for six months under a temporary detention order.  Therefore it was felt at the time he was admitted that in all probability he was going to be there still in a few months time. One can imagine that through some neglect, lack of attention or something else, his detention is ordered by the chief medical officer for a further period of six months; he objects, and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals gets the objection.  I hope the Inspector would go and see the patient.  He then forms the opinion that his detention should not be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> If the only way that patient can be got out is to throw his case into the Section 239 machinery, months may pass before the Minister has an opportunity of considering the matter and the patient may be detained for the greater part of the continued six months period.  There should be some procedure under which, if the inspector thinks the person should not be detained, no time should be lost in ordering his discharge.  This Bill has to go to the Seanad and I do not want to delay it, since I understand that in relation to some other parts of the Bill there is urgency.  However, would the Minister consider that aspect of it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I am quite ready to consider it, though I think the situation is covered, perhaps rather cumbersomely.  We have first of all to agree that it would perhaps impose an unnecessary obligation on the Inspector of Mental Hospitals if he were to see every patient in respect of whom an objection might be lodged, particularly an objection emanating from the patient himself. Everybody knows that it is one of the symptoms that despite other symptoms the patient thinks himself in good mental health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection must be considered in the light of the condition of the patient, and not in the light of what he himself believes that condition to be, and, therefore, there must be some sifting of these objections. If, having read the report from the medical officer and the statement of the grounds on which the person has been detained, those grounds are sufficient to satisfy the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in the matter, I do not think it would be practicable to insist that the Inspector should, notwithstanding his opinion, again go to inspect him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only when a doubt arises that the Inspector should then take the matter further, and there he is bound to take all such steps as <Col N="385" /> will satisfy him that the patient is being properly detained.  If he has any doubt about the matter he does not necessarily have to see the patient first. He can go immediately to the Minister, and the Minister can direct him to go to see the patient, and if he has satisfied the Minister that, despite what the medical officer has said, there is still such a doubt about whether he should be detained he may be directed, and he can, indeed, go without any direction, to see the patient.</P>
      <P>He can at any time inspect a mental institution and see a mental patient.  He is, in fact, on his normal visits of inspection bound to see all those patients covered by Section 33, but he can at any time visit a mental hospital and see a particular patient.  He may have to advise the Minister that he is going. That would be a formal request to the Minister to direct him so that he may go down armed with that authority.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to whether it would be necessary to arm the Inspector in that way, or whether it would be just as well to put the obligation directly on the Inspector immediately he himself has any doubt about the period of detention of a patient.  As it stands under Section 239, he can report the matter to the Minister, who can direct him to visit a patient and to report directly to the Minister, and the Minister can then forthwith order the discharge of the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could be done possibly in a simpler way.  I should like to consider it.  That way would be that the Inspector should himself, without any ado, go down and see the patient and that he should as a result of his visit on his own responsibility order his discharge.  There is one objection to that which we must carefully consider. It would impose on the Inspector of Mental Hospitals all the responsibility for running the institution, because that could happen in respect of every patient there in regard to whom a detention order had been made.  It could also mean a conflict of opinion if no other man was brought in to determine what would happen.  It would lead to a weakening to some <Col N="386" /> extent of the position of the chief medical officer of the institution, and that would be a rather serious matter. However, I should like to study the matter more closely and shall see what can be done by amendment in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>It is only due to the House to say that I very much appreciate the assistance given to me by those who have participated in this debate.  The Bill is in some respects better than when it came to the House. There are one or two matters to which I should like to refer.  The first is the point raised by Deputy Corish as to the difficulty which the staffs in mental hospitals may have in appreciating what their position will be under the new superannuation code.  As I said on the Second Reading, I shall endeavour to have a memorandum prepared which will enable them to form an accurate opinion as to how they would stand under the three codes with which some of them may be concerned.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that in relation to the question of having a record made which would be subject to continuous review of the patients detained under Section 18 I propose to deal with that under the regulations.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: Go léifí an Bille ath-uair anois.  Tá soláthar a dhéanamh le hAlt 1 de'n Bhille seo chun pinsin sheirbhíse agus pinsin mhíthreora is iníoctha faoi na hAchtanna Um na Connaught Rangers (Pinsin), 1936 go 1960, a mhéadú cúig faoin gcéad, is é sin an céatadán ceadhna a údaróidh, le haghaidh pinsinéiri seirbhíse míleata, ag an Aire Airgeadais ina Ráiteas ar an gCáinaisnéis in Aibreán, 1960.  Tá éifeacht ag na méaduithe ón lú Lúnasa, 1960, agus tá siad á n-íoc ón lá sin i leith ar údarás Mheastacháin Bhreise a ritheadh sa Teach seo ar an 20ú Iúil, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá foráil in Alt 2 den Bhille a údaraíonn aisiriú phinsin a chúlghairmeadh fé Alt 16 den Act Um na Connaught Rangers (Pinsin) 1936 i gcás phinsinéir a daoradh chun priosúntachta ar feadh aon teárma is sia ná trí mhí, iar chiontú i gcoir. Ceaduigheann códanna phinsean eile pinsin a chúlghairmeadh ins na toscaí <Col N="388" /> sin a aisiriú ach ní raibh gá go dtí seo pinsean Connaught Rangers d'aisiriú.  Tá mé tar éis cás den chineál seo a thabhairt fé ndeara le déanaí agus is féidir liom déileáil leis faoin bhforáil seo.</P>
    <P>Mura mian le haon Teachta tagairt a dhéanamh do phointe áirithe, ní dóigh liom gur gé a thuilleadh a rá i dtaobh an Bhille.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill provides that service pensions and disability pensions payable under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts, 1936 to 1960, shall be increased by five per cent., that is, the same percentage as was authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of April, 1960, in the case of military service pensioners.  The increases became effective from 1st August, 1960, and they are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on 20th July, 1960.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill contains a provision to give authority to restore a pension which has been forefeited under section 16 of the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936, in a case where a pensioner, convicted of a crime, has been sentenced to a term of more than three months' imprisonment.  The power to restore pensions forfeited in such circumstances is contained in other pension codes but the occasion for the restoration of a Connaught Rangers pension has not hitherto arisen.  Such a case has now, however, come to my attention and this provision will enable me to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Bill calls for further comment unless any Deputy wishes to raise a point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, the purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to what has already been done.  I am glad that the Minister has taken power to restore a pension where the recipient has been disqualified from holding it but I am disappointed that he ties himself up, that the pension will be payable &ldquo;from such date (not being earlier than the date of the order restoring it) as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;  Is the Minister <Col N="389" /> not tying his hands very much in that provision?  If the Minister is satisfied that the pension should have been restored 12 months or two years earlier, why tie himself so that he cannot do it no matter what the merits of the case might be?  I feel that it is neither fair to the pensioner nor to the Minister because it means that the Minister can simply plead: &ldquo;I admit it should be done but the Act says so and so.&rdquo;  Here the Minister is tying his hand without providing any alternative.</P>
      <P>I do not know, Sir, whether I would be in order or not in asking the Minister if he is satisfied that all the persons who are entitled to pensions under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act are in receipt of the pension.  I have had various complaints, letters and claims within the last year or two from persons stating that they are entitled to a pension under the Act but have been denied it.  I should like to know from the Minister, subject to the rules of order on this Stage, if he could say what the position is regarding the restoration of a pension that has been forfeited and the granting of a pension so that we can get a picture of the whole situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of thanking the Minister sincerely for introducing this legislation.  It is quite some time ago since I explained fully in this House why a person who was in receipt of a pension lost it.  I stated then and I state now that the men who laid down arms in India when we were fighting for independence here were as brave as any of those who took up arms in the Independence movement here.  One can appreciate how men in those circumstances might become mentally ill as a result of having to endure the rigours of imprisonment in India.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy MacEoin, I am rather disappointed that payment is not retrospective.  The person I have in mind was convicted of a very trivial offence, taking a bicycle, as far as I remember, and bringing it a few miles. Being mentally ill and being alone in the world, he was unable to make the defence which it was absolutely necessary for him to make.  I am sure <Col N="390" /> that if the learned justice had been informed at that time that the man would forfeit his pension he would have considered it altogether too severe a sentence to be so deprived of his pension in addition to serving four months in prison.</P>
    <P>I know the poor man very well indeed.  He, with the rest of us, at one period was worshipped by many people because it was fresh in their minds then that we had accomplished something, that we were one generation in 700 years.  It might appear strange to the young men in this House to be told that neither the person concerned in this Bill nor any other person was paid during that time, that on the contrary, which might appear even amusing, the soldiers of the I.R.A. had to pay for being soldiers.</P>
    <P>I know that the man concerned is very badly off in the winter of his life. If the Minister would consider some retrospective payment that would give him even an opportunity of providing himself with decent clothes and boots it would be very helpful.  I can assure him that I would appreciate it as much as I appreciate his thoughtfulness in tempering justice with mercy.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister has done.  It is good that in public life we have men who will honour their bond. Ministers, above all, have a very important role to play and in this instance, the Minister is to be congratulated. The person concerned is now a poor, insignificant man and it is good to think that a man of his state is to benefit and to have restored to him a measure of happiness which I feel he richly deserves.</P>
    <P>In view of the position in which these men found themselves, their actions and this man's action earned them honour and admiration.  They laid down their arms in faraway India to give help that was very much needed at that time when, in one generation, something was accomplished which the previous 700 years had failed to achieve.  This man was one who contributed to that and he deserves consideration and sympathy, although perhaps he acted wrongly. His contribution to the struggle for freedom must be remembered. As time goes on, I hope other old <Col N="391" /> soldiers who are badly off and in need will be remembered by the Minister and given some measure of comfort. That can be achieved straight away by further increasing their pensions, especially in the case of those who have no other means.  Again, I thank the Minister.  County Tipperary knows the individual concerned very well and will greatly appreciate the Minister's action in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest and for sentimental reasons, would it be possible for the Minister to give us the number of survivors of the Indian mutiny?  I happen to be familiar with the circumstances of some of these men and I must admit that what Deputy Davern said about them is correct. They were serving the British Empire thousands of miles from home and the spirit of the national movement motivated them to take certain risks.  Any generosity the Irish people can display to them through the Government, is merited.  It is in keeping with our ideals that those people should get whatever increases are to be given to those who served the State.  Our aim should be to ensure that these men will be as well off as if they had served the full time without the mutiny.  In view of that, this gesture can be very well justified.</P>
      <P>The present generation, I believe, are not aware of the stand and the sacrifice these men made and the risk they took at a time when they were serving in a foreign army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the number surviving is concerned, 25 pensioners survive at present.  I do not know of any others who may have taken part in the mutiny.  I am tied under this Bill to restoring the pension from the date of the order.  While there is only one case involved here, the principle is of much wider application and it is a principle which I fear cannot be departed from.  The person concerned was eligible to apply for a special allowance at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point raised is whether I am satisfied that all those who are entitled to these pensions are covered and in fact drawing these pensions. <Col N="392" /> To qualify for a Connaught Rangers' pension, what had to be established was that the person concerned took part in the mutiny and the criterion adopted was whether the person was sentenced by the British court martial that tried the people accused of taking part.  That was accepted as proof and it is hard to see what other proof we could get or in what other way it could be established that a man took part in the mutiny, if he was acquitted by the court which tried him for the offence.  I think it is true that, so far as it is possible to establish, all those who qualified for pensions have got them.</P>

Ní bheadh ach £3 11s. sa tseachtain ag an duine sin dá méadófaí an tsuim bhliantúil iomchuí de 5/- sa tseachtain, mar sin de, tá ráta speisialta&mdash;£134&mdash;á fhorordú mar shuim bhliantúil iomchuí chun 9/- breise sa tseachtain a thabhairt dó a ardós é go £4 sa tseachtain. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, is ionann san agus méadú de £36 10s. sa tsuim bhliantúil iomchuí a bhaineann fé láthair le duine pósta in aois 70 mbliain nó ós a chionn.</P>
    <P>Duine san earnáil seo fé láthair go bhfuil pinsean neamh-ranníocach aige féin agus ag a chéile comh maith, meastar gur fiú an dara phinsean 24/-sa tseachtain mar mhaoin agus sa chás sin tá gar do £3 10s. 6d. sa tseachtain mar iomlán aige idir phinsin chomhshuimithe agus liúntas speisialta.

    <P>Nuair atá duine i dteideal pinsean sean-aoise ranníocach de £2 sa tseachtain agus liúntas breise de £1 8s. 6d. sa tseachtain dá chéile, measfar 31/- den £3 8s. 6d. mar mhaoin agus, toisc an tsuim bhliantúil iomchuí a bheith méadaithe, gheobhaidh seisean gar de £4 sa tseachtain idir phinsin chomshuimithe, liúntas breise agus liúntas speisialta.</P>

Féadfaidh mé a rá, mar mhíniú ar na tagairt in alt 24 de phinsin dalla fé Achtanna na bPinsean Sean-Aoise go mbeidh siad sin ar an dul chéanna le phinsin sean-aoise neamranníocach.  Ar an ábhar sin, luaitear iad go sonrach.</P>

Arís, leis an cás is simplí a thógaint mar léiriú&mdash;duine neamhphósta nach bhfuil de theacht isteach aige ach a phinsean agus a liúntas speisialta&mdash;tiocfar ar an suim de £3 2s. 6d. ag glacadh an mhéadú sa tsuim bhliantúil iomchuí san áireamh, tré 1/- de phinsean neamh-ranníocach 28/6 sa tseachtain agus 12/6 de phinsean ranníocach £2 sa tseachtain a mheas mar mhaoin.</P>
    <P>Mar atá léirithe agam, sé cuspóir atá ag na hathruithe seo ná uassuimeanna níos mó a chur ar fáil agus pé michothromaíocht a d'eascair as an mbealach a meastar maoin fé láthair na huaire a léasú.  Leis na tairiscintí nua seo méadófar liúntas speisialta gach duine fé 70 mbliain d'aois&mdash; aicme iad seo in a bhfuil níos mó ná leath an iomláin&mdash;más rud é nach méaduítear a maoin ar bhealaigh eile. Mar an gcéanna dóibh siúd in aois 70, nó ós a chionn, atá i dteideal pinsean neamh-ranníocach agus ortha seo, go bhfios dúinn, tá furmhór na bpinsinéirí sean-aoise ag a bhfuil liúntaisí speisialta.  Tá méid áirithe de na pinsinéirí seo, áfach, i dteideal pinsin ranníocach de £2 sa tseachtain agus i gcásanna áirithe i dteideal liúntais bhreise de £1 8s. 6d. sa tseachtain, nuair nach raibh cheana ach pinsean neamh-ranníocach amháin de £1 8s. 6d. sa tseachtain ag teacht isteach.  I gcásanna mar seo, in ainneoin méadú ar na suimeanna bliantúla agus measú níos fearr ar an phinsean sean-aoise, laghdófar na liúntaisí speisialta agus i gcásanna áirithe na bhfuil liúntaisí beaga i gceist cealófar iad toisc go mbeidh an ioncam iomlán, ar a n-áirítear an tárdú mór sa phinsean agus maoin eile inmheasta, níos mó ná an uas suim a bheartaitear anois.  Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, beidh roinnt mhaith daoine nach raibh i dteideal liúntais speisialta cheana incháilithe anois de bharr na méaduithe sna suimeanna bliantúla iomchuí, na bealaigh nua ar a meastar pinsin sean-aoise agus na huas-suimeanna nua.</P>

      <Col N="397" /> Tá súil agam gur cabhrach mar mhíniú ar an mBille an cur síos atá déanta agam air agus, le linn dom bheith ag críochnú, déanfaidh mé trácht ar aon phointí eile ar gá eolas nó míniú a thabhairt ina dtaobh.</P>
    <P>This Bill is mainly concerned with the grant of increases in wound, disability and married pensions and in certain allowances to dependants of deceased persons, payable under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1960.  The increases are effective from 1st August 1960, and in fact are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on 20th July, 1960.</P>
    <P>The increases dealt with in sections 2 to 23, inclusive, 25, 26, and 27, are broadly in accordance with the increases for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement in April 1960. Officer pensioners whose pensions are related to their Army pay at the date of their discharge are receiving an increase of 7½% if discharged before 1st September 1949, and 5% if they were discharged on or after that date and before 2nd November, 1955.  (The 1st September, 1949, being associated with an Army pay change is considered to be a more appropriate qualifying date than 1st November, 1948, the first critical date mentioned in the Budget Statement for other State pensioners.) Other pensioners under the Acts, whose pensions are not related to Army pay are receiving an increase of 7½%.  Dependants' allowances (including that payable to the widow of a Signatory of the 1916 Proclamation) are, generally being increased by 7½% also but the allowances payable to the sisters and children of the Signatories of the 1916 Proclamation as well as those payable under Part II of the Act of 1953 to relatives of deceased pre-Truce servicemen qualify for the lower rate of increase (5%) because the basic rates of these allowances were fixed after the first critical date, 1st November 1948, mentioned in the Budget Statement. The annual cost of these increases is estimated at £17,102.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Budget Statement to the proposed allocation <Col N="398" /> of a further sum of approximately £30,000 to increasing special allowances payable under the Acts to persons in receipt of pensions for disablement attributable to pre-Truce service, to persons eligible for pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts or the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts and to holders of medals in respect of service with, or membership of, certain organisations.  Following detailed consideration of the position, it has been decided to allocate approximately £75,000 a year, instead of the £30,000 originally envisaged, to the improvement of special allowances. These improvements will take effect from the 6th January, 1961, which is also the date of commencement for the new old age (contributory) pensions under the Social Welfare Acts, and the cost of the increases expected to fall as a charge on the current year's Vote is estimated at £11,000.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill provides for the increase of the &ldquo;appropriate annual sums&rdquo;.  These now become higher by £13, except in one instance, which I shall explain later, where the increase is £36.10.0.  As well, there is an addition of £1.6.0 a year for each reckonable child.</P>
    <P>Persons under 70 years of age, whether married or unmarried, will, therefore, receive an increase of £13 a year, or 5/- a week, in their special allowances, together with the increase for reckonable children in the cases of married persons.  The opportunity has been taken of reconsidering the position of persons of 70 years of age or over in the light of the introduction of old age (contributory) pensions. Hitherto, only non-contributory pensions have been involved, and since special allowances are designed to supply for the lack or inadequacy of other means and should, as far as possible, avoid accentuating inequalities in means, certain adjustment of the current methods of assessing means are considered necessary in the cases of old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>What is contemplated is that a married person of 70 or over should have by way of old age pension or pensions, other assessable means and <Col N="399" /> special allowance combined, a sum of £4 a week approximately.  To illustrate this, I shall take the simplest type of case&mdash;that of the person who has no income other than an old age pension or pensions and special allowance.</P>
    <P>At present, such a person who has a non-contributory pension of his own, but whose spouse has not, receives by way of aggregated pension and special allowances, approximately £3 6s. a week.  His old age pension is completely ignored as means in the assessment of his special allowances.  An increase of 5/- a week in the appropriate annual sum would bring such a person up to £3 11s.  a week only, so, in order to give him the additional 9/- a week necessary to bring him to £4, a special rate of appropriate annual sum&mdash;£134 &mdash;is being prescribed.  That, as I have said already, is an increase of £36 10s. in the appropriate annual sum at present applicable to a married person of 70 years of age or over.</P>
    <P>Where, at present, a person in this category himself has a non-contributory pension and his wife also has one, the second pension is assessed as means to the extent of 24/- a week, and the income by way of aggregated pensions and special allowance is approximately £3 10s. 6d. a week.  In future, only 19/6d. of the second pension will be assessed and that, taken in conjunction with the increase of 5/- in the appropriate annual sum, will also bring him to approximately £4 a week by way of combined pensions and special allowance.</P>
    <P>Where a person is eligible for a contributory old age pension of £2 a week and a supplementary allowance of £1 8s. 6d. a week for his spouse, 31/- of the £3 8s. 6d.  will be assessed as means and he, too, having regard to the increased appropriate annual sum, will receive approximately £4 a week by way of combined pension, supplementary allowance and special allowance.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, these proposals bring about a very considerable improvement in the present position. Where there are reckonable children, allowances for them at the increased <Col N="400" /> rate will, of course, also be payable.  I may add, in explanation of the references in Section 24 to blind pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, that such pensions are treated in the same way as non-contributory old age pensions, which is the reason why they have to be specifically mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the light of the £4 a week envisaged for married persons, it is considered that, in the cases of unmarried persons of the age of 70 or over, a combined income of £3.2.6 from old age pension, other assessable means and special allowance, would be a reasonable figure.  Again taking the simplest case for the purposes of illustration&mdash;that of the unmarried person who has no income other than his pension and special allowance&mdash; the sum of £3.2.6 will be reached, regard being had to the increase in the appropriate annual sum, by assessing as means 1/- of a non-contributory pension of 28/6 a week and 12/6 of a contributory pension of £2 a week.</P>
    <P>As I have shown, the aim of these adjustments is to provide higher ceilings and to remove certain inequalities which have developed as a result of the current methods of assessing means.  Under these new proposals, special allowance holders under 70 years of age&mdash;and they make up about one-half of the total number&mdash;will receive increases in their special allowances, provided, of course, that their means do not increase in other directions.  So, in the main, will persons of 70 or over who are eligible for non-contributory pensions only, and they constitute, as far as we know, the bulk of the old age pensioners who are in receipt of special allowances.  A number of such pensioners are, however, now eligible for the contributory pension of £2 per week and in some cases for the supplementary allowance of £1.8.6 a week, where previously only one non-contributory pension of 28/6d. a week was coming in.  In such cases, despite the proposed increases in the appropriate annual sums and more favourable assessment of old age pensions as means the special allowances will fall to be reduced, and in some marginal <Col N="401" /> cases where the allowances are small, they will cease to be payable for the reason that the big increase in pension, taken in conjunction with other assessable means will bring the total income above the ceiling now fixed.  On the other hand, many people who had hitherto been ineligible for special allowances will now become eligible because of the increases in the appropriate annual sums, the revised methods of assessing old age pensions and the higher ceilings.</P>
    <P>I hope that the outline which I have given of the contents of the Bill will have proved informative and helpful and I will endeavour to deal, when I am concluding, with any points on which further information or explanation may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Bill with which we have just dealt this is a Bill legalising what is already being done.  It has the further addition of improving the conditions of persons who are in receipt of, who are entitled to, or who may claim special allowances and the appropriate sum, as it is called, is being raised.  For that reason it is welcome, that, as the Minister has said, it is an improvement on the existing position, but I think that is all that can be said about it, that it is an improvement.  It is very hard to understand, and even those who have experience of it find it hard to understand, how the calculation or the assessment is made to arrive at the appropriate sum.  There are very great differences in the position of several applicants who have been refused and who, any reasonably minded person, on examination would say were entitled to succeed.  However, by raising the ceiling of the appropriate sum it does bring in a substantial number and increases the special allowance being paid to them. It is an improvement and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some indication&mdash;leaving out the old age pension; it is quite clear how the assessment there is arrived at&mdash;as to how the assessment is made in respect of a person who has not an old age pension but who has a small bit of <Col N="402" /> land or is residing with a family or something like that.  It is very hard to know how the pension officer assesses it.  I shall give an example. The Minister has given an example in the Bill of what I mean.  A person qualifies for a full old age pension but prior to that he would not qualify for the special allowance and when he gets the old age pension he does not qualify for it either.  If the applicant's means are over £100 roughly, he cannot get the full old age pension but supposing it is £104 divided by two in respect of himself and his wife, he gets the full old age pension.  The appropriate sum in that case was £52 at the most.  In that case the applicant should have received the special allowance up to the time he received the old age pension but he does not. Because he was housed and supported by a son or daughter or some other relative, that is assessed as means.  I submit that should not be because it is putting a strain on everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me to understand on the last occasion that if a member of the forces who had a disability pension died, his widow would become entitled to a widow's pension.  In a great number of cases that has turned out not to be so and the Minister should reconsider all these cases.  It would not cost a great amount to meet them.  I have one case in mind which the Minister said does not qualify although it was a wound pension case.  The widow is disqualified and left without any means except the ordinary widow's pension which she gets under the Social Welfare Act.  I agree that 1949 is a more appropriate date for assessing the Army pensions.  It is a pity we could not go a bit further and take a later date.  However, I suppose we have to be grateful for small mercies.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister the necessity not only for increasing existing military service pensions but for dealing with complaints arising from the failure to secure service certificates. I know it is not appropriate under this Bill to say it but when we are dealing with increases for the existing recipients and with increases for disability pensioners it ought to be considered. <Col N="403" /> There is not a Deputy on either side of the House, at least among those who had any association with former days, who is not receiving requests day after day.  Time is flying and there are two things the Minister can do in that regard which I commend to him: first, to cater for widows of pensioners who were in receipt of disability pensions and, secondly, to make some provision for the issue of military service certificates.  I know the Minister argues that these increases in the special allowance represent compensation and that a person who has a medal is being fairly treated.  I admit that is so and that the special allowance is much greater than that to which he would be entitled under the certificate of service but the certificate of service is the badge, the proof of service.  The medal, even though it is of monetary value, is not of so much importance as the material fact that the certificate of service puts the stamp of approval upon the service that that person rendered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin has raised some points I should like the Minister to entertain favourably.  With regard to the special allowance, in 1932 the Fianna Fáil Government by amending the Old Age Pensions Act abolished what is known as means in kind.  They abolished the assessment as means of support from anybody regardless of whether it was a relative or a complete outsider.  I would urge upon the Minister that means in kind should not be assessable in the granting of a special allowance.  It is outdated. It was an old penal assessment and in 1932 we abolished it in regard to old age pensioners.  Having done so, it is only in keeping with our policy that we should abolish such assessment in the case of special allowance applicants, If a person is fortunate enough to have support from some relative or wellwisher, that is completely outside the scope of assessment. I would also like to see the special allowance extended to the widows of men who were in receipt of special allowances.  Those surviving are in the winter of their lives and are the <Col N="404" /> only monuments that are left of the struggle for independence.</P>
      <P>The independence of this country was won very cheaply.  I know there was much loss of life, and I am not, by any means, putting a cheap assessment on it but, in the matter of money which we are now discussing, I do not think any other country won its freedom more cheaply.  Not alone did these men we are now discussing win freedom for their country, but they were a headline to the whole world of enslaved peoples, and a glowing example of how a country should free itself from tyranny and slavery. Therefore, the men who are so very readily deserving of thanks should not alone be appreciated here, but by every enslaved people in the world.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the pensions extended to widows and, over and above all, it is high time some fund were created from which the Department could contribute in certain cases to people with meagre means&mdash;I do not like to use the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. I should like also to see a fund created to defray the expenses of the funerals of old soldiers.  The British Army has such a fund.  When a British soldier dies, his funeral expenses are defrayed to an appreciable extent out of a fund provided by the British Government. Our soldiers are as deserving of decent funerals as any other soldiers under God's sun.</P>
      <P>The service pensions and wounds pensions have already been increased since 1st August last.  It is only natural that those of us who at one time held high rank should urge the Minister not to forget that another increase is not only necessary but fully justified.  I know the Minister has the interests of the old soldiers at heart.  Few members of the House have shown such appreciation of the Old I.R.A. as he has shown.  Every Deputy who has the interests of the Old I.R.A. at heart feels that the Minister is deserving of our very sincere thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy MacEoin in asking the Minister to give further consideration to the military service pensions.  I should also like to say, in passing, that many soldiers of <Col N="405" /> the Republic were denied pensions because they were not able to make a case, or because of the green-eyed monster of petty political jealousy&mdash; which is a characteristic of some of our people&mdash;many of our people were denied pensions.  The Minister should consider those people at as early a date as possible.  Giving them a pension now would not be of any great help to them, but men who can prove to the satisfaction of a board that they gave service, and good service, to the nation, should get so much for each year of service by way of a lump sum.  That is the only way which will satisfy them.  Many of them will go to the grave with a grudge, and feeling they gave good service but that unfortunately it was not recognised to the extent to which they think it should have been.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by tendering to the Minister on behalf of many Old I. R. A. men the thanks he deserves.  I hope and pray that the sympathy for the old soldiers which he has shown up to now, will be shown again in a practical way by an increase in service and wound pensions.  Nothing can compensate a man who loses a limb.  He should be shown the very first consideration. I hope and trust that many of those men who were turned down for pensions will be given a lump sum with a view to showing a just appreciation of their services to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy MacEoin of an ex-member of the Defence Forces who had a disability pension and died, and whose widow did not qualify for the widows' pension arising out of the pension he was entitled to under the Army Pensions Act, the position is that in order that that pension will be payable, it must be established that the person's death was attributable to the disability in respect of which he had the pension.  The case Deputy MacEoin has in mind must be a case in which a person died from some other cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned that he found it hard to understand the manner by which the means of an applicant for a special allowance are assessed.  I answered a Question in <Col N="406" /> the Dáil on 16th February, and I circulated with the Official Report a fairly easily understood statement of the items included in the assessment of means and the items omitted, which I think should be of help to anybody who wants to inquire into the way in which the means have been assessed in any particular case.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the taking into account of maintenance by some relative of special allowance applicants and Deputy Davern referred to the same matter.  There is provision for ignoring free maintenance, if it can be established that the provision is a hardship on the provider.  It is a fact that in some cases a person may qualify for an old age pension and may not qualify for a special allowance. There is a practice in assessing the means of married couples for old age pensions where there are two applications, under which the means of the applicants can be divided into two and a half assessed as against each applicant.  In the case of the special allowance, it is the joint income, the total income of the man and wife, that is assessed as means. That is how the anomaly arises.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions were made by Deputy Davern as to how certain relaxations or amendments in the means test could be introduced.  There have been some relaxations, and other suggestions can always be considered in future, but I cannot give any undertaking with regard to further relaxations. If the Deputy brings particular points to my attention, I shall have them considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying when I moved to report progress that I was anxious to use this debate to bring a few points to the attention of the Government. In common with most Labour Deputies and in common with most Deputies in the House I view with alarm the steady emigration of young boys and young girls.  Only the fit and the best qualified for work leave our shores.  In the main, the reason for that emigration is lack of employment at adequate wages.  Anyone who glosses over the position is doing a disservice to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Taoiseach sought to prove by figures that for the past few years emigration has been steadily declining.  To say that people are leaving our shores more for adventure than for economic reasons is doing a disservice to the country.  It must be clear to anyone who takes an interest in the position that if advertisements appeared in our newspapers offering employment at even ordinary rates of pay there would <Col N="408" /> be hundreds of thousands of applications for the jobs from persons wishing to return from Great Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Every month since I first became a Deputy I have received requests from Irish people abroad to help them to find even menial employment in this country.  They always conclude their letters by saying they would prefer to live here and to bring up their families here.  It is ridiculous to suggest that in the case of 95 per cent.  of those who emigrate the reason is anything other than economic necessity. It may be true that some people are leaving employment here but if they are it is because the wages are altogether inadequate.  That is mainly our trouble.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the average national wage is between £6 and £7 per week.  Probably the very low wage paid to those employed in agriculture is responsible for that.  I shall not dwell now on whether agriculture can afford to pay a higher wage but it is a fact that the agricultural worker's wage is taken as a standard on which wages in other industries are based.</P>
    <P>All the time when increases are sought we are referred back to the basic wage of agricultural labourers. There is strong objection in this country to the fact that people engaged in industry should be so restricted.  It has a deflating effect on the economy of the country.  It means that the people who work cannot receive sufficient by their industry and their productivity to keep themselves in the ordinary frugal comfort to which they are entitled not to speak about their lack of money for what might be considered luxuries.</P>
    <P>That kind of thing must have a deflationary effect on the consuming market.  I cannot understand why it is that Irish workers engaged in industry here must suffer great disadvantages by comparison with their counterparts in Britain and elsewhere throughout the world.  They work as hard, possibly harder, but do not get the same proportional reward.  On the other hand, it cannot be said that the goods produced in this country are not as <Col N="409" /> good as those elsewhere.  In fact sometimes they are much superior.  I cannot understand why our employers who have the advantage of cheap labour in plentiful supply also seek tariff protection.  Why can they not produce their goods as cheaply as some of the articles we import here, having the advantages to which I have referred?</P>
    <P>I believe the reason is that many of our industrialists&mdash;not all of course; there are some exceptions&mdash;want to make quick and large returns from their investments.  Many of the people who went into industry when the State was founded, while their activities were laudable, believed that their investments should yield an immediate high return.  Consequently the products their factories manufactured were not turned out at a competitive rate.</P>
    <P>If the Government could achieve a higher standard of wage rates throughout the country, I feel sure this would be reflected in an upliftment of conditions in industry and in agriculture. I accept the Government's claim that they are anxious to solve unemployment. I think any Government taking office in this country would be just as keenly interested in that problem. I accept in good faith the Government's promises that as time goes on a solid foundation is being laid that will produce results in the future, but I would say that in the meantime there is an urgent need for the Government to face up to its responsibilities of providing as much work as possible, even short term employment. The Government must realise that while our register of unemployed may show figures of between 60,000 and 70,000 there may be thousands of boys and girls leaving school who are not on that register and who will be on the labour market very soon to be added to the large numbers already unemployed.  Unless the Government devises and pushes forward a short term policy of employment in such projects as house building, sewerage, water supplies, road development, land reclamation and various other projects, we will only be adding to this flood of boys and girls who are leaving this country every day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> Many excellent projects put forward have been nullified by the fact that the local authorities have been asked to make a local subscription towards any grants available.  That condition may seem a worthwhile way of working out employment problems.  It is only natural that where a particular scheme favours a particular county the local authority concerned would be asked to contribute part of the cost but there are many instances where this nullifies efforts to give greater employment in rural areas.  I would suggest that the unemployment problem should be tackled immediately by the State, even to the point of setting up a special Ministry to deal with it.</P>
    <P>On the question of State aid to investors in this country.  I deplore the fact that many counties not west of the Shannon should be deprived of the aid they would secure had they been situated in a depressed area.  The conditions of employment in a county cannot have much relation to geography. In a case in my own constituency an industry could easily have been secured were certain State grants available.  Unfortunately our geographical position forbade the Government to make a grant and consequently the industry was lost to the district.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when progress was reported, due to the fact that it is not classified as a depressed area, the constituency I represent has failed to qualify for grants similar to those which would be given on the western seaboard, notwithstanding the fact that in that constituency only last week the chairman of the Irish Council of Trade Unions of Waterford, speaking at their annual election of officers, made the statement that within the past year over 4,000 single tickets to Great Britain had been purchased at the Waterford Station, and notwithstanding the fact that though those 4,000 people had left there still remained on the unemployment register practically 1,000 names.  When you consider, as I have said earlier, that to that must be added hundreds of boys and girls of school-leaving age who have never previously secured employment, and who have not registered at the employment exchange, there must be in the city of Waterford alone a potential labour force of something in the neighbourhood of between 5,000 and 6,000 people seeking work that is not there for them.  That position cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was keenly interested in the remarks by Deputy Declan Costello in this debate when he expressed the view that now was the time for the Government to take some steps to secure through the Central Bank control over the activities of the commercial banks operating in this country.  I would suggest in addition that control over the activities of the insurance companies should be a joint effort.  It is amazing to consider that in the city of Dublin there are thousands of middle class citizens who have not taken advantage <Col N="435" /> of the Small Dwellings Acts paying various amounts of money every month.  In one instance it came to my notice recently that the occupant of a house was paying £6 per month&mdash;a very normal easy rent, as I told him.  To my amazement I found that of that payment only £2 went to pay off the capital debt.  The balance of £4 had to go to pay off interest on the loan.</P>
    <P>That is a state of affairs that certainly deserves investigation and redress. I am aware that the Minister will tell me that if the grants from the Government, plus the supplementary grant from the local authority were not paid the Government could possibly afford to give a loan at a much lower interest.  Whatever way the desirable result can be achieved, it is essential that cheaper money be made available to people desirous of expanding their business or doing worthwhile jobs like providing their own homes.</P>
    <P>In connection with insurance activities, I was amazed to learn recently that in the case of a certain company covering third party risk on motor cycles when an owner went to pay his renewal premium he found not a 25 per cent., but a 100 per cent.  increase on last year's premium.  This was notwithstanding the fact that he was entitled to a no claim bonus and was not being penalised for any previous claim. It is essential that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should under the 1936 Act use the powers given to him to investigate and restrict these sweeping increases in something that is compulsory upon the people, if they are to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>My main object in intervening in this debate is to draw to the attention of the House and, in particular, to the attention of Ministers what has happened as a consequence of the increases in payments under the scheme of contributory old age pensions and the other contributory types of pension, such as widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment benefits. It has been stated in the Press and can be borne out from examination of the Book of Estimates that the contributory <Col N="436" /> old age pensions scheme has relieved the Government of certain commitments. Not only are the Government relieved directly, but, flowing from an instruction of the Minister for Social Welfare, boards of health, or boards of assistance, as they were formerly called, have now taken advantage of the increase in pensions to reduce home assistance payments, blind pensions and disability pensions to dependants of recipients of contributory pensions.  I am aware of a specific case where the increase secured by the man and his wife was exactly £2, representing 11/6d.  to himself and £1 8s. 6d. to his dependent wife.  He lost a sum of 35/- formerly contributed by the local health authority, made up of 18/- home assistance, 12/- blind pension and 5/6d. turf allowance. The total increase represented by the contributory pension is only 4/-, while the son of that worker has to pay a new amount of 4/6d.  per week as his contribution to those increases.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party keenly supported the Bill that provided increases in pensions because we believed in the principle that one should make provision during a period of employment to cover illness, unemployment or old age, but we did not foresee that, by regulation and direct instruction, benefits that formerly were contributed to by the Government and the ratepayers and passed on to the most needy sections of the community, would be withdrawn by the local authorities on the pretext that the contributory pension benefits so lauded at the time of introduction would more than compensate for what was being withdrawn. It is regrettable that the Government should have assumed that attitude.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the Minister for Social Welfare has said that that is not his province, that it is up to the local authorities to do what they wish in matters of that kind.  That is quite so, but during the period of another Government, when it was drawn to the attention of the then Minister that local authorities were taking advantage of increases in allowances to old people, an order was issued forbidding the local authority to take credit for certain amounts of those increases.  This <Col N="437" /> time, quite the contrary has happened. Instead of such an order, a circular was issued directing the attention of local authorities to the fact that increases had been given and that appropriate action to reduce subsidiary benefits should be taken.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister responsible, even at this late stage, to review the matter and to consider issuing instructions that the benefits received under the contributory pensions scheme should not be used by local authorities to effect reductions in their payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates on which the Vote on Account is based shows rising expenditure over the previous year.  If the expenditure is related to our population, it means that approximately £45 per head of the population is required to administer the services in the coming year.  Taking the number who will actually contribute it represents a contribution per head of about £80 to £85 a year.</P>
      <P>When the Minister produces this Book of Estimates to the House, the House is entitled to expect that the Minister will justify the expenditure on the grounds that there will be increased production as a result of it and that some of the expenditure will reach rural areas and help to solve the problem of emigration and unemployment. In that case, the increases would be welcome.  No amount of money can satisfy for the loss of our young people who are leaving the country permanently and flying from the land.  The Minister might prefer to justify the increases on the basis of an increasing cost of living and the consequent increased provision that has to be made by way of remuneration of existing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment prospects were not touched on in the Minister's statement. The Minister did mention undeveloped areas, Shannon Airport, drainage, but he did not indicate what the prospects are of increased employment under those headings.  If the provision of extra money for undeveloped areas had the effect of retaining people in those areas and providing employment for them, the expenditure would be justified.  We had no clear <Col N="438" /> statement in regard to the general policy on employment.  Industry has been referred to and we would certainly welcome any expenditure which would bring industry where it is needed.  In the constituency for which I speak, we are very interested in the fact that while neighbouring territories can obtain generous aid through the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act, we, who have similar problems quite close by, cannot get the benefits of this legislation. There seems to be a concentration of industry in the larger centres of population, in the Dublin area and in Cork, and Limerick seems to have been left out.  It is very strange that areas in Kerry and across the Shannon can qualify for these grants and that we in Limerick, with similar problems, cannot. Nobody will deny that it is rural areas that suffer most from unemployment at present and the only way, to my mind, that we can arrest the flight from rural areas is to seek new methods by which to keep the people on the land.</P>
    <P>The majority of holdings in any part of the country are very much under 30 acres and in areas where land is poor, it requires more concentrated effort to obtain a living from it.  Very often, the occupiers must fall back on part-time work, building and road work, to stay in the locality in which they were born.  That tendency in Irish rural life at present is being impeded to a great extent by the mechanisation of which Deputy Booth spoke yesterday as a sign of progress.  He said that anybody watching heavy machinery leaving Dublin for the country could not but be struck by the fact that there was money in the country for these things. A Deputy who followed suggested that many of these machines were bought on hire purchase.  I do not rely on that argument, but since the Deputy mentioned this social revolution, I would say that it is a social revolution when people depart from their traditional way of life in the rural areas and flock to the cities and, in some cases, emigrate.  The combine-harvester is an innovation perhaps but no indication of real prosperity which <Col N="439" /> should be counted in terms of the well-being of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>It would be a completely false picture to think that in modern conditions everybody who has got machines can afford them.  To my own knowledge, you may have one machine in a parish with an individual earning a living by moving the machine from one farm to another and doing work which now, unfortunately, is not being done by local labour.</P>
    <P>The progress of mechanisation and the dispersal of labour are not calculated to promote the welfare of the country.  It is better that we should keep families in the country on a reasonable standard of living and that such work as is available should be done by them rather than that we should export large sums of money for expensive machinery and export our youth to work in other lands.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see increased provision in the Book of Estimates for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. In the southern counties, this is at present our greatest problem and we hope the extra money will bring about a speedier solution of it.  The prosperity of the dairying industry and the cattle industry depend on this. We should have liked to see some further provision beyond the eradication, which certainly does help, to encourage dairy farmers to get rid of their problems faster by means of a direct reward for the eradication of reactors from their herds by an increased price for milk.  I know it will be said that this would mean an increase in the price of butter, but that is a problem we shall discuss on the Vote for Agriculture.  I do not wish to elaborate on it now.</P>
    <P>Forestry is another means by which employment can be provided in rural Ireland, but I notice that the Estimate is in or about the same as previously and, if anything, there is a very slight decrease.  There is no prospect of increased employment so far as that service is concerned.  An increase of about £140,000 is being made in the provision for arterial drainage.  This is a welcome development and I wish <Col N="440" /> the increase had been greater.  It is one thing that we should proceed with as quickly as possible, as the machinery is available, and try to bring into cultivation lands which have been flooded.  We have had disastrous floods in the past few years and I was on deputations to the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary seeking speedy intervention to remedy the continuing losses the people of the areas concerned had sustained.  I hope that as far as my own constituency is concerned there will be no jealousy in its regard by any other place.  I hope that the scheme in so far as the two major rivers are concerned will not be long more delayed, that we will have some work on the Deale before this year is out, and that the survey of the Maigue, when it is completed, will be speedily dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is another factor in regard to employment in rural areas.  Again, it is linked with this question of the flight from the land.  How can we operate a land policy in this country?  It seems to me extraordinary that we should keep young men working on their own farms, serving their apprenticeship and attending local vocational schools and evening classes and yet when they have reached the stage of being craftsmen and are qualified to do any farm work &mdash;they are skilled at that stage in farm management&mdash;and when they apply for land, we meet them with the answer that because they have no land, they cannot be considered.  That is something which should be tackled. We ought to help to re-establish these younger elements on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture the night before last told us that everybody knew that the land in this country was held by elderly people and that it was not passing on to the young people.  It is an extraordinary thing that when we have land to give away, we exclude the younger people by the type of answer that, because they have not got land, they cannot be considered. This is something which would be a positive contribution towards keeping the younger people on the land.  They should be given a sense of ownership and a sense of responsibility. <Col N="441" /> They should be allowed to establish families of their own on the land.</P>
    <P>Housing is a matter to which Deputy Booth also referred.  I looked at the national figures.  I saw a decline in the number of houses provided for in the Estimates presented here.  I do not see any significant increase in the provision for my own area.  There are many people waiting for houses.  For some reason, this progress in house building is not as rapid as many would desire.  As Deputy Corish said, it would contribute to even temporary employment, not to speak of solving the housing problem.  I found on a couple of occasions, when I inquired into the matter, that as between the technical advice tendered at local level and that tendered at Departmental level, there seemed to be a clash which caused this type of delay.  Again, I suppose this is something to which one might refer on the Vote for the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>This Book of Estimates, which is the national bill, does not take into account the local bill.  I have seen our manager's estimate for local services seeking a further increase in rates. That, of course, is an addition.  In the ordinary way, when everything else seems to be going up, one would imagine that the provision of increased money, whether locally or nationally, ought to result in increased employment. Yet the figures published in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> do not seem to give us any extra employment for this increased money.  Therefore, the only other thing that can be assumed is that this increased bill is due to the increased cost of living and the increased cost of public services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth said that the establishment of rural industries was the envy of Fine Gael.  As one Fine Gael Deputy, I want to say I have nothing to be envious about.  There has not been any industry established in that way in my constituency.  I do not know of any.  I hope that some of the grants will be made available in my constituency for the provision of work.</P>
    <P>It is a fallacy to say that an increased demand for electricity and increased mechanisation is a sign of <Col N="442" /> prosperity, to use his own words.  This social revolution is something which has been coming for a long time and if people in the rural areas are now getting the benefit of electricity and of these other services based on electricity, then it cannot be held to be increased prosperity which is bringing it about.  It is something which, in the ordinary way, the people had been waiting for.</P>
    <P>If one type of new machine comes into a place, as, for instance, the combine harvester, several mowing machines go out of operation.  The fact that we replace mowing machines by combine harvesters does not make any real difference so far as the people or their employment is concerned. Our main problem at the present time, to my mind, is that we have a declining population.  That is a problem over which the Government in some measure have some control.  Then there is this problem of emigration for which, in the ordinary way, no Government can provide a ready and quick remedy, but the Government can influence employment.  In so far as they can influence employment to a large extent in the rural areas, then I think they should give a lead and try to keep the people on the land.</P>
    <P>No matter how much industry we may place in towns, the successful operation of these industries depends upon two factors: One, the consumption at home and the other, the export market which may be broken into.  If one should fail, then the other cannot long survive.  If the products of Irish industry at home were to lose their markets as a result of the flight from the land, then we would need a large export trade to compensate for that loss.  This year's Vote is something which will have been received by the public with very mixed feelings.  As I said at the beginning, I do not think anybody would cavil if there were to be increased employment or the arresting of the decline of population, the flight from the country.  In that case the moneys would be well spent but in the light of the circumstances as they are given to us at the present time, I am afraid we can only ascribe the position to fewer people <Col N="443" /> having to pay more for somewhat the same service.</P>

It would appear that they are satisfied to seek to promote discontent and not attempt in a positive way to win public support for any policy or plan.  Obviously many speakers feel that the first essential step in promoting this feeling of discontent would be to weaken, or undermine in some way, the public confidence which has been built up steadily and solidly over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am not surprised to find them attempting to represent this national confidence as a false, baseless optimism, artificially built up by Government spokesman.  In other words, there is a clever attempt to sow seeds of doubt, an attempt to weaken the confidence which now characterises the nation's activity.  In that regard I should like to point out that the confidence and optimism do not result from the speeches of members of the Government alone but are buttressed by many statements of people who have no particular stake in the fortunes of the Government Party as a political Party.  It is also worth pointing out that these statements which inspire confidence have been, as far as I have seen many of them, merely a listing of indices of economic activity, ungilded and without exaggeration.  That an ordinary flat statement of the facts of economic activity in the country should be regarded by the Opposition as exaggerated, optimistic statements is an indication in itself of the very positive advance that has been made in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that Opposition speakers up to now have set a standard of perfection, if you like, by which to judge this Government.  They <Col N="444" /> overlook any progress that has been made and they look for the ills which still exist and the ones which have not been completely eliminated in a very limited period.  If I might remind the Opposition their type of destructive activity requires far less time than the activity of rebuilding and putting a strong foundation under an economy. I would remind them also that, since nobody is perfect, the activities of the Government should be judged not against standards of absolute perfection but against the standards of any alternative Government that may be set up.</P>
    <P>This Government took office in 1957 at a time when, for the first time since the war, there had been a drop in production, the highest unemployment figures ever, a serious imbalance in external payments and an absolute shortage of money, to meet not the great plans which we hear about, now they are in Opposition, but to meet the ordinary everyday payments of grants particularly, as Deputy Corry said, through the local authorities. Now after four years it is possible&mdash; and it is recorded this year&mdash;to show that the unemployment has been cut by 30,000; that the national income has increased far beyond what we hoped when we set out to plan what could be done; that external trade is balanced and, to replace the dismay and hopeless feeling which existed in 1956, there is an air of confidence in the country.</P>
    <P>That is a comparison of the activities of the present Government with the activities of those who would wish to replace it.  The achievements of the Government over the past few years remind me of Dr. Johnson and the performing dogs when he said, &ldquo;The wonder is not that they do it so well but that they could do it at all&rdquo;.  In this case, the wonder is not that we could do it so well but that we were able to recover at all from the activities of the Government that came before us.</P>
    <P>Any branch of public activity at the moment gives us a good indication of the progress we are making.  The spending and activities in the Department <Col N="445" /> of Education are as good an indication as any.  This year, for the first time, we have reached the level in post primary education where 70 per cent.  of the pupils from 14 to 16 years of age are attending post primary education, full time.  There are about 76,000 children in secondary schools; and the annual increase in the number in the secondary schools over the past few years is well over 3,000.  This is a double indication not only of the increased amount the State is spending but also of the number of people who are willing and able to provide post primary education for their children.</P>
    <P>For the past couple of years, the national school building programme has reached the record figure of 90, which is about double what it was four years ago, and, as I announced recently in another place, the Government have sanctioned the building of a science block at University College, Dublin.  Science is so important at the present day that we must regard ourselves as fortunate in being able to afford the necessary buildings which are to go up.  It might be noticed from the Book of Estimates also that there is a token estimate for science in the secondary schools, whereby I hope to give some assistance towards promoting a greater interest in the subject of science.  I have not yet worked out the details of that, but the token is there as an earnest of what we intend to do.  As I announced recently, I hope to introduce this session a scheme of scholarships.  I am not saying it will be the miracle to cure all our ills but it will be a pattern for future development.</P>
    <P>The money for all these activities has been made available by proper management of our affairs.  None of these activities would have been possible four years ago before Fianna Fáil took office.  Much of the extra money spent is on salaries, which again is an indication in one Department of what is happening throughout the economy. People are getting up to a better salary level without any marked effect in taxing the rest of the community.  Any Department's activities can be quoted; <Col N="446" /> I took the one with which I am familiar.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a function of planting trees and I was able to tell the children at the school where the function took place that the State has this year hit the target of 25,000 acres planting of trees per annum and now holds 330,000 acres of plantation.  It looks forward to the continuing of planting at this level.  That, in itself, is another indication of the availability of money for investment and the wise investment of money in a field where employment will be made available and where there will be a good return for the money invested.</P>
    <P>Speakers are inclined to overlook the bright spots.  I was struck by the thought, while listening to the Opposition, that they become louder and braver, not as the next election approaches, which seems to be the obvious explanation, but as the last one gets further away.  They are getting further away from their sins and their disabilities so their courage is returning.</P>
    <P>Of the one dark spot mentioned, emigration, I should like to say it is a problem of which the Government are very conscious.  People, especially people who regard themselves as permanent Opposition, are inclined to hand this big problem completely to the Government for solution.  It is a national problem.  On the economic level, emigration is due mainly to the movement of population which is occurring not alone here but in every country.  People will not stay on the land now, unless the land can give them a standard of living comparable with what they can get elsewhere.  Our people are leaving the land at about the same rate as people are leaving it in any country in western Europe. I think it is about two per cent. per annum.  In any other country, as has been the case for many years, the man leaving the land could seek employment in one of the cities of his own country, but our people have had to go abroad to the cities of America or England.</P>
    <P>There are very many other reasons for emigration but in that economic <Col N="447" /> situation where people are leaving the land and looking for employment in the cities, the obvious answer is to make available here at home the employment for which they are looking. Government policy has been directed and most energetically directed towards the development at home of manufacturing industries to give that employment.  The successful results of the activities up to now are quite obvious.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up one point with Deputy Esmonde who seemed to think that factories are taken away from the east and encouraged to go to the west.  I think the actual state of affairs is that any advantage going to a person establishing a factory in the west is just enough to balance the disadvantage of being so far from the centres of population and any other disadvantage which arises from being in an area specially marked out as an undeveloped area.  In my own experience, one factory disappeared from Ennis and turned up in the east of the country, so the advantage is not always as he states.</P>
    <P>Emigration is a movement of people.  We will not get anywhere by wishful thinking or saying it should not happen.  We have to accept it as such and deal with it as such, influence the stream as much as we can.  In respect of those who are leaving the land and who cannot be supported on it, we must do our best to promote employment elsewhere in Ireland in manufacturing industries, and, at the same time, improve the capacity of the land to carry the population that remains on it, as well as improve the various facilities and amenities so that people will be more tempted to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>Much of the Estimates expenditure under consideration is concerned with agriculture.  The eradication of bovine tuberculosis is essential in order to keep that part of the farmer's income safe and to increase it.  The progress of the scheme is a measure of the energy put into it by the Minister for Agriculture.  I believe that in the middle of this year, there will be nine <Col N="448" /> counties attested as free from tuberculosis which is a great achievement in organisation by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Other money is set aside for fertilisers to improve the land, and further money is provided for a Milk Marketing Board and a Pigs and Bacon Commission, which will again help to raise the standard of the man working on the land.</P>
    <P>That is not to say the problem of emigration is solved.  That is not to say we are satisfied that it will be solved in a particular period.  It is just to show we realise the problem exists and are doing something about it.  We hope that those outside of the Government who have some part to play in stemming emigration, and who can play a part, if they wish to do so, will play their part.  This is a matter for a national effort and not just for a Government effort.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which the private individual and individual organisations can help to stem the flow of emigration, or to divert the stream of emigration from the land towards work at home.  We need the fullest national effort to achieve an end to the problem of emigration and indeed the other problems which face us and which will arise from time to time.  If we are to have adaptable intelligence available to us to meet problems in a healthy way, we shall have to spend not less but more money, on education.</P>
    <P>Education can no longer be regarded as something which the individual gets to promote his own welfare.  Education of every section, and at every level in the community, must be regarded as essential to getting a complete national effort which will help us on the road to what we all want to achieve&mdash; national prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Book of Estimates, there is an increase in our financial demand this year.  I would not object if a few more millions were added, because I am very dissatisfied with the position of the people receiving public assistance, including the old age pensioners and those who received the increase in the contributory pensions. <Col N="449" /> I do not expect them to compare exactly&mdash;there is no comparison&mdash;but they do not compare at all with statements made by unemployed people in Britain, that they do not need to work because they can get as much without working.  No one can say that in this country.</P>
      <P>People emigrate to get a job or for excitement, but I believe one of the main reasons for emigration is the miserable social assistance provided here.  If people got a reasonable amount of social assistance, they would probably be satisfied to stay here idle, as it seems to me in many cases they are satisfied in Britain.  It may be said that we do not want to cultivate that form of life here but it happens in Britain.  If people have no work, they must get a reasonable income to keep them satisfied.  If there is no work and they do not get a reasonable income in the form of social assistance, they leave the country.</P>
      <P>I do not see any great chance of increasing employment in this country. There may be minor increases but there will never be substantial increases. Commonsense tells us that we lack certain materials available in other countries.  We depend on the goodwill of other countries, so far as our exports are concerned, and I admit that we are worried about what other countries might do to keep us out of foreign markets.</P>
      <P>Taking the long view, we cannot ever expect any substantial increase in employment.  We all know that, with the march of time, there will be more mechanisation and that adds up to fewer persons in employment.  The average person is out to make more money, even if he is making enough already.  He will avail of any mechanisation or automation available and employ fewer people, so that whether we like it or not, there will be no substantial increase in employment. Therefore, there will be emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to keep people here, so far as I can see, apart from the efforts that are being made&mdash;I do not deny that efforts are being made by the Government; efforts to establish industries are to be commended but that is not enough&mdash;there may be one <Col N="450" /> or two ways of doing so.  With the introduction of machinery, working hours could be reduced, but we might then reach a stage where we were working only two days a week.  Social assistance could also be increased.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social assistance granted recently I thought the contributory benefits should have been at least 50/-.  People with insurance stamps should get a substantial increase which would give good grounds for giving an increase to people in receipt of social assistance.  So far as I can see, the Minister is afraid to give a substantial increase to people with insurance stamps in case he might have to give other increases.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that I am a miracle man but I recognise what we are up against.  I recognise the sort of country we have.  We have no raw materials.  The Minister should give a substantial increase&mdash;and should always aim to do so&mdash;to insured persons and persons in receipt of social assistance.  Why complain about emigration?  We will always have emigration.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about Dublin.  I do not profess to know much about the rural areas, although we all have some general knowledge of them.  We are not ignorant of conditions in the rural areas but we take a more specialised interest in our own areas. There are about 15,000 unemployed persons in Dublin.  I admit they are mostly of the labouring classes, but I foresee less employment for them. Because of the increase in wages last year, the whole aim of business people was to get in consultants to see how they could save money to meet that increase.  As I see it, there will be another general increase shortly and there will be more efforts to lay off workers.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, from the point of view of employment and emigration, the Government have failed.  I will not say that it is their fault, but they led people to believe they would succeed, and that is where they are at fault.  I suppose it is difficult to blame anyone in politics for making exaggerated statements: that is all part and parcel <Col N="451" /> of politics.  At my first municipal election, I remember people saying: &ldquo;If you do not put us in, the country will be invaded.&rdquo;  What that had to do with the election, I do not know.  It was said, but certain people would say anything.</P>
    <P>Exaggerated statements were made about the flow of money and the apparent prosperity in the form of facilities and amenities, but there is no plan I know of that will give any substantial employment or prevent emigration. I hold that the increase in wages of 10/- is now worth 2/6.  What worries me in particular is that a high proportion of inferior goods is being sold.  A short time ago, a woman I know bought an umbrella.  After two days, a strut broke.  It was repaired, but after two weeks another strut broke.  The same lady bought a handbag.  After a very short time, one side gave way and then the other side did likewise.  There are many such complaints.  People say they are being robbed in an indirect way.</P>
    <P>Half the people who are considered prosperous are up to their eyes in debt. They buy everything on the hire purchase system and before a thing is paid for, it is worn out.  It is obvious that things are not going as well as the Minister would have us believe.  I pity not so much the worker who can always demand another 10/- as the people who get only 1/- or 2/- and who must bear the increases in the cost of living.  For example, no allowance is made for increases in bus fares.  I am concerned about these people not merely those on assistance but those on social assistance&mdash;and I appeal to the Minister to give them a decent increase. The cost of living has gone up substantially.  Boot polish has gone up a penny and pins a halfpenny.  Everything has increased in price in the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal statement by Government speakers from the Taoiseach down is that they deserve praise and credit for an improvement in the balance of payments and a considerable increase in our exports.  Recently, the Bishop of Cork said that to tell people our exports have increased and our balance <Col N="452" /> of payments position has improved is no solution of the problem in rural Ireland today.</P>
      <P>I often wonder if this Government are in touch with rural Ireland or if they are dreaming of a fairyland of prosperity.  Many speeches by members of the Government give the impression that we live in a state of outstanding prosperity.  No statement by them bears any relation to present-day problems in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Last year, our agricultural community went through the worst year for a century, during which their income dropped considerably.  It was a year in which they had to accept less for their produce and to pay more for everything they purchased.  That disastrous year, coupled with bad management by the Government has reflected far beyond the farm field. Its repercussions have been experienced behind the counter of the shopkeeper. Every shopkeeper in rural Ireland will admit that his takings are down but his bills are greater. A larger percentage of people are seeking credit and less cash is being registered in the till.</P>
      <P>A great depression has settled on our farmers, farm workers and the ordinary labouring class, not to speak of those who can be described as belonging to the middle income group and the lower income group.  Our people are finding it very difficult to exist.  Naturally, their unhappy financial position reflects itself in less business in the shops and at fairs and markets.  More business houses are available for sale but there is a lack of buyers.</P>
      <P>Due to the new licensing laws and to emigration and unemployment, there has been a considerable reduction in the volume of trade in the licensed business.  In one way, that may be no harm, but it reacts adversely on those employed in the various branches of that industry.  Eventually, it will mean a reduction in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many small shopkeepers are being put out of business.  They are being compelled to draw down the blinds or nail up the shutters permanently.  That <Col N="453" /> is a national disaster.  The shopkeeper cannot sell his goods and, because of widespread unemployment, he cannot collect moneys due to him.  The result is he has no alternative but to draw down the blinds, put up the shutters and clear out.  There is practically no town in rural Ireland today in which there is not clear evidence that, since the change of Government, many people have gone out of business and that those remaining in business&mdash; country shopkeepers&mdash;are finding it increasingly difficult to carry on because of the burdens of taxation imposed on them by Government policy.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the manner in which the Valuation Office has left nothing undone, particularly in the past two years, to impose additional burdens by way of increased valuations on business people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just making a passing reference to it in relation to the added difficulties which are driving people out of business. This is a time in which plans for the future should be placed before the House and it is only proper that the seriousness of the problem should be drawn very strongly to the Minister's attention.  It is a matter calling for urgent investigation and particular attention.  Let us hope this is the last year of office of the present Government, the last year in which there will be a Government operating a policy designed to obstruct and destroy progress in this country.  I cannot understand why, on the threshold of a general election, the Government have not availed of this opportunity to present to the House and to the country more of their plans for the future because Fianna Fáil have been a quarter of a century making plans, talking of plans and pigeonholing plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We never see the results of these plans.  The Fianna Fáil Party are great people for talking loudly outside church gates.  They are a Party of <Col N="454" /> loud-mouthed emptyheads.  There is no comparison between the speeches they make outside the church gates and those we hear in the House.  That is what is responsible for keeping tens of thousands of our people from exercising their right at general elections. The false promises made by them before elections have served to undermine the confidence of the people in this Parliament.  It should be the duty of any Government to tell the people at election time exactly what they plan to do.  But to tell the people what their plans are and then to take action in the opposite direction is something that disgracefully undermines the people's confidence in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>If we judge the Government on their conduct over the past four years, we have a very sad picture.  They have fulfilled none of the promises made before the last general election.  I have here a leaflet sent out by Fianna Fáil before that general election. It is headed: &ldquo;Let us go ahead,&rdquo; and it was published by the Fianna Fáil Party at Upper Mount Street, Dublin, printed by <i>The Irish Press Limited,</i> Burgh Quay, Dublin.  That was a plan for farmers, giving them an assurance of markets, access to credit and expert advice.  Every farmer in the country fell for that plan.</P>
    <P>On this leaflet, there is a photograph of a stack of wheat, a cow and a pig, which meant to convey to the farmers that they were going to get more for their wheat, more for their milk from the creameries and more for their pigs, be they grade A, B or otherwise.  What has been the result? The Government's policy has driven farmers into workhouses throughout the country.  It is responsible in the west of Ireland for the putting of galvanised iron on the windows and padlocks on the doors.  In parts of the midlands farmers have set their land and flown to England looking for employment.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, I can remember farmers being told even after the last general election that they would get 82/6d. per barrel for their wheat. The next thing we saw was a statement <Col N="455" /> saying there was no question of such a price being made.  Then it was a levy on the farmers.  They were compelled to pay a levy and a substantial sum of taxpayers' money was put into the pockets of the millers.  This Government were more concerned with the millers who could write out a big cheque as a contribution to the Fianna Fáil organisation.  The farmers could not.  But the taxpayers' money went to pay the millers for handling the farmers' wheat, while the farmers' income was drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>I represent a wheat-growing area and I know how disappointed the farmers were at the failure of Fianna Fáil to fulfil their promises.  The farmers felt that when Fianna Fáil got back into office, they would restore the price of wheat to 82/6d. per barrel. But last year the price of wheat was reduced and, just a few weeks ago, there was a further reduction.  The Government decided that the price for wheat bushelling 57 lbs. would be 70/- per barrel, a reduction of 2/6d.  on the 1960 price; for wheat bushelling 55 lbs., 62/- per barrel, a reduction of 7/6d.; and for wheat bushelling only 54 lbs., 57/6d., a reduction of 11/- per barrel.</P>
    <P>Were the farmers told before the last general election: &ldquo;If you vote for Fianna Fáil, you will get a reduction of 11/- per barrel in the price of wheat&rdquo;?  Not at all.  Through dishonest, insincere and foul means, they obtained the votes of the farmers by saying: &ldquo;You will get 82/6d.  per barrel instead of 57/6d. per barrel for your wheat.&rdquo;  It may be noted that, in 1954, 52 per cent.  of the wheat delivered to the mills bushelled under 57 lbs.  and, in 1956, 36 per cent. bushelled under 57 lbs.  Therefore, in the years 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956, on average, a quarter of the wheat had bushelled less than 57 lbs.  If the wheat in the coming harvest is to show the same average, there will be a reduction of from 2/6d.  to 11/- per barrel in the price.  Yet we are told by Fianna Fáil that the farmers are prosperous and have plenty of money to spend.  How can any Minister for <Col N="456" /> Finance or the head of any Government tell the farmer that his income is increasing and he has more money to spend, if he is also to be told that the best they can do for him in 1961 is a further reduction of from 2/6d. to 11/- per barrel in the case of wheat bushelling under 57 lbs. and, on top of that, a levy and a payment for the sack?</P>
    <P>But the strangest thing about it was the manner in which that was put over on the public.  There are many people who think that the Government's policy in regard to the price of wheat for 1961 is the same as last year.  They have been led to believe it is the same as last year.  The strange thing is that I think there are Fianna Fáil Deputies who have been caught up in this web, too, and who firmly believe the price of wheat will be the same for 1961 as for 1960.  Of course, they may know, but being politicians and toeing the Fianna Fáil Party line, they believe that, if they tell the farmers often enough the price of wheat is not being reduced, they will believe it.</P>
    <P>On 7th February this year, the Government Information Bureau issued a statement on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the price of wheat.  It is difficult to understand why there was only a brief announcement in the 10.15 news bulletin from Radio Éireann on 7th February in regard to the statement on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture concerning the price of wheat and feeding barley.  No stress was laid on the fact that, in respect of wheat bushelling under 57 lbs., the price had been reduced.  The Government did not allow Radio Éireann to broadcast in that news item the true position in regard to the reduction in the price of wheat; but if it had been something that would have brought grist to the Fianna Fáil mill, it would have been announced ten times over on the radio.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance what responsibility the Government have for failing to communicate to the wheat growers the true position in regard to the price of wheat, since Radio Éireann was not allowed to broadcast the announcement in the form of the statement issued on behalf <Col N="457" /> of the Minister for Agriculture by the Government Information Bureau.  It is right to mention also that there was no mention of it in the news bulletins from Radio Éireann on the following morning, 8th February, or on any other occasion.  There was only one brief announcement, that the price of wheat was the same as last year.  No details were given of the reductions from 2/6 to 11/6 per barrel.  To make the matter more serious, the National Farmers' Association held a meeting to discuss the statement made on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture.  They also issued a statement and sent a copy of it to Radio Éireann.  But that was never broadcast in any news bulletin, either.</P>

      <P>In relation to the price of bread and flour, the Government had a plan before the last <Col N="460" /> general election.  They also had a plan in relation to the food prices, but the plan for food prices met the same fate as the plan they had for agriculture.  It was dishonoured and disowned and disrespected the moment they got into office.  It is only now, four years after, they are being found out, and that is why the Minister for Finance is so worried.  He knows that he was a cog in the wheel of all this dishonesty, perhaps a big cog, and that the wheel is turning more and more slowly and the dishonest cogs are becoming more evident to the public today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm for the Minister to get a lecture on dishonesty, because the entire policy of Fianna Fáil in relation to the price of flour and bread, and their agricultural policy in general, is based on dishonesty and deceit practised at the last general election.</P>
      <P>Let us again probe into the statement I have read from the Fianna Fáil election propaganda, in which they said that an assurance of markets must be given to farmers and that, in addition, expert advice was also to be given to them.  What did they do in regard to expert advice to the farmers?  They completely finished the operation of the parish plan, which was designed to set up for each parish or group of parishes a proper advisory service for farmers. It had been set up and was most effectively working and giving good results in many areas, but because, like the Land Project, the parish plan had been sponsored by Fine Gael, the Government left nothing undone, through sheer spite, in their attack on the Land Project, and now there is less land being reclaimed than ever before.  Section B of the scheme was dismantled, and, in addition, the parish plan was completely abandoned.  Section B of the Land Project will be immediately restored after the next general election. It is only right that that should go on record.</P>

      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act and Section B of the Land Project will be restored &mdash;those are two undertakings which Fine Gael solemnly give to the electors in the coming general election.  As soon as the general election is over and the new Government assumes office, one of their first steps will be to restore what Fianna Fáil took from the people.  By depriving the people of the benefits of the parish plan, of the agricultural advisory services that were there for them, they were denying the farmers what they were entitled to, a proper advisory service based on the parish agent responsible for lectures, advice and everything relating to the promotion of agriculture in a parish or parishes.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were also to place at the disposal of every farmer, according to their undertaking at the last general election, access to credit.  Did they get it?  What new credit facilities are available to the farmers since the Government took office?</P>

      <P>Everybody knows today that there is less money available to assist the farmers in the purchase of land, the securing of machinery or in any other way.  The facts are that, at the last general election, the farmers were led to believe that the moment there was a change of Government, they would have nothing to do but to make application to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and cheques would be coming out to them at an express rate, but that is not the position.  I cannot see in rural Ireland where the big volume of money is to assist people to purchase livestock, to re-seed their lands and to obtain supplies of fertiliser.  I want to assure the Minister for Finance and the House that there are many farmers in rural Ireland today who were led to believe that, through Fianna Fáil policy, credit facilities would be made available to them, but they have now discovered that, in addition to the many other promises made, the promise of credit for small farmers was only another votecatcher, a promise designed to deceive the people.</P>
