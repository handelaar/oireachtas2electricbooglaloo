    <P>TITLE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete all words after &ldquo;Court&rdquo; in line 8 to the end of line 11 and substitute &ldquo;The High Court and other Courts of First Instance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to change the Title and to make it more consistent with the constitutional position. Article 34 of the Constitution is referred to in the Title as it stands:</P>
      <P>An Act to establish, in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court and the High Court and Courts to be called respectively the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Circuit Court and the District Court,...</P>
      <P>Article 34 of the Constitution does not refer to these courts by these titles.  It refers merely to Courts of First Instance and Courts of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal is described as the Supreme Court and it is to be called that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest it is more in consonance with the wording of the Constitution <Col N="790" /> to establish the Supreme Court, High Court and other Courts of First Instance. I have a particular objection to saying the Court of Criminal Appeal is established in accordance with Article 34 of the Constitution.  The argument I used last night was at least accepted to the point of having further consideration given to the matter.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is a hybrid court.  It is not a Court of First Instance; it is not a High Court because members of the Supreme Court are compulsorily in it; and it is not a Court of Final Appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree that it would be desirable to amend the Long Title in some fashion, particularly in view of the fact that we have undertaken to have another look at the idea of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If the Deputy would be prepared to withdraw his amendment, I shall undertake to have the matter re-examined in consultation with the Parliamentary draftsman with a view to introducing an amendment on Report Stage.  I imagine it will not be exactly in the form Deputy McGilligan has suggested but possibly it will be along those lines.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 12, after &ldquo;Courts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution&rdquo; and to delete the said words where they occur in lines 15 and 16.</P>
      <P>This amendment has a different purpose. I have argued that in this piece of legislation a dangerous precedent is being established.  A judge can, so to speak, disappear from the court system by retiring, by reaching a certain age limit, whatever it may be, or by being dismissed and that can take place only on grounds of stated misbehaviour or incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation at least indicates another way in which anybody who wants to interfere with the courts hereafter may use this as a precedent, <Col N="791" /> namely, that one can abolish offices and can disestablish courts.  I want to avoid any chance of this being taken as a precedent for that.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Long Title reads:</P>
    <P>...to specify the constitution of those Courts, to provide for the vacation of judicial offices and the filling of vacancies therein, and, in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution, to disestablish the several Courts...</P>
    <P>I suggest that the words &ldquo;and, in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution&rdquo; should be moved so that they would take their place after line 12 and read:</P>
    <P>. . . to specify the constitution of those Courts, and, in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution, to provide for the vacation of judicial offices and the filling of vacancies therein, . . . .</P>
    <P>It would bring the matter of vacating all offices under the one way determined here, namely, that when a person who holds an office of judge vacates that office, the court will cease to be abolished.  I think it is better to put that inside the framework of Article 58 of the Constitution.  Apart altogether from Article 58, we are not establishing a new way of getting rid of judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may be under some misapprehension. In lines 13 and 14, the Long Title speaks about providing for the vacation of judicial offices and the filling of vacancies therein, and refers entirely to the future.  The judicial offices in that context are the judicial offices to be created under this Bill and not the present judicial offices.  Therefore, Article 58 of the Constitution has nothing whatever to do with this.  In fact, Article 58 deals only with disestablishing the various courts of justices as they exist at present, whereas the preceding lines refer entirely to new judicial offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fully an answer.  Section 7 of the proposed legislation deals with the existing <Col N="792" /> courts and by an amendment accepted yesterday subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>When a person who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts . . . .</P>
      <P>That is not the future&mdash;&ldquo;any of the existing courts.&rdquo;  When he has vacated that office certain things happen.  The vacation of an office under Section 7 clearly relates to the existing courts and I want to have the whole matter tucked in under Article 58 which deals with the courts which were in existence which are now being carried forward and being determined otherwise in accordance with law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the whole matter of disestablishment of the existing courts and the abolition of these offices should, as Deputy McGilligan says, be tucked in under Article 58.  In fact it is, because the long title goes on to say:</P>
      <P>in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution, to disestablish the several courts of justice mentioned in that Article and to abolish the offices of the judges and justices thereof.</P>
      <P>That clearly encompasses the whole procedure of disestablishment and abolition of the offices and is all within the ambit of Article 58 of the Constitution. But the other part of the long title which is not expressed here as being in pursuance of Article 58 of the Constitution, namely, providing for the &ldquo;vacation of judicial offices and the filling of vacancies therein&rdquo; is correctly removed from the ambit of Article 58 because it has nothing to do with Article 58.  It is the new courts only that are involved in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The vacation of the existing judicial offices is being done under Article 58.  I shall read Section 7 again if necessary.  It refers to the existing courts, to a person &ldquo;who immediately before the commencement of this Act held the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts&rdquo; and continues with the amendment carried last night: &ldquo;has vacated that office...&rdquo; Therefore it is completely wrong to say the vacation of a judicial office looks entirely into the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;judicial office&rdquo; is expressly defined to mean the new offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>An existing office surely is being covered.  The word &ldquo;vacating&rdquo; applies, in accordance with Section 7, to an existing office.  I think that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Therefore it is wrong to say that the use of the phrase in regard to the vacation of judicial office applies only to the future.  It certainly applies to the vacating of the existing offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Because &ldquo;judicial office&rdquo; is exclusively confined to the new offices, so when you speak of vacating &ldquo;judicial office&rdquo; you are referring only to the new offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not as defined in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not as defined in Section 6 which we understood last night was supposed to refer exclusively to the new office, but, by an amendment introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary himself, we have brought in a reference to the existing offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It ties Section 6 <Col N="794" /> in, or at least it prevents its being regarded as exclusively connected with the new offices.  Certainly that subsection deals with existing offices and these are what are to be vacated. It would save a lot of argument hereafter if this were cleared up. One could have judicial offices of the new type vacated by disestablishment of the courts.  It is another way out.  If anyone wants to look for a means of getting rid of judges it seems to open another door though it is not very necessary to open such a door.  While judges may be dismissed only for certain reasons all judges may be retired in accordance with law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make this as clear as I can.  The long title can only refer to this Bill and &ldquo;judicial office&rdquo; in this Bill has a very distinct and specific meaning. It refers exclusively to the new offices to be created under the Bill.  For that reason, as &ldquo;the vacation of judicial offices and the filling of vacancies therein&rdquo; are not even contemplated under Article 58, it would be quite wrong to have this part of the long title within the ambit of Article 58.  Sections 6 and 7 are quite clear, either as they stand or as amended, that &ldquo;a judicial office&rdquo; means one thing, a new office, whereas when we want to refer to the existing courts we speak of &ldquo;the office of judge or justice of any of the existing courts.&rdquo;  The vacation of those existing offices is provided for, in pursuance of Article 58, in the long title under the phrase: &ldquo;to disestablish the several courts of justice mentioned in that Article and to abolish the offices of the judges and justices thereof.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 8, after &ldquo;Court&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and in the said Act thereafter called &lsquo;the Chief Justice&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is merely a matter of names again. In the definition section the phrase occurs &ldquo;the existing Chief Justice&rdquo;. We are saying he is the judge of the existing Supreme Court who was, immediately before the operative date, President of that Court.  I just want to say that his title under the 1924 Act was &ldquo;the Chief Justice&rdquo;.  This is merely carrying forward that definition and providing that the President of the Supreme Court shall be called &ldquo;the Chief Justice&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In line 28 we have a definition of the words &ldquo;justice of the District Court.&rdquo;  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;justice of the District Court&rdquo; includes, except where the context otherwise requires, the President of the District Court;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night it was quite clear from the other Act that we are appointing a judge to the district court and that no person other than a judge may be appointed to the district court.  Now we come to how they are to be <Col N="797" /> addressed in court.  The people miscalled justices of the district court are to be addressed as &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo;. That is the word which is used for a judge of the Supreme Court, a judge of the High Court and a judge of the Circuit Court.  The only place in which &ldquo;justice&rdquo; occurs is in a translation of the title of judge of the district court, which is put inside brackets in a certain part of the legislation just dealt with.</P>
    <P>Clearly, this is looking forward, not looking back.  It seems to me to be odd that we are going to determine that the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; means the President of the district court when in fact the court is to be composed of judges and that the method of addressing these people in the district court is to be the same as the Irish version of the word &ldquo;judge.&rdquo;  What we are defining here is the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and that certainly is not a post to which I hope these people will be appointed.  It is only a translation of the description of these officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything inconsistent here with what I was arguing yesterday.  Section 5 of the Establishment Bill appoints judges and goes on to say that, from that moment onwards, they should be styled and referred to as &ldquo;justices.&rdquo;  Here we have that system of nomenclature carried forward.  The styling here is in accordance with what is laid down in Section 5 of the Establishment Bill, namely, that these judges are styled &ldquo;justices of the district court.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference to Section 5 is the reference I was making myself.  Section 5, as it has gone through Committee Stage, says:</P>
      <P>On the commencement of this Act, a Court of First Instance, which shall be called An Chúirt Dúiche... shall stand established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on to say that the district court &ldquo;shall be constituted of the following judges.&rdquo;  The first is a judge who shall be styled in a particular way and &ldquo;such number of other judges.&rdquo;  Let me leave out the President for a moment.  It will be composed entirely of judges.  The Irish title of those, other than the <Col N="798" /> President, is &ldquo;Breitheamh.&rdquo;  That is the word used earlier in the first Bill as the translation of &ldquo;judge.&rdquo;  The only place in that Bill where the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; occurs is in the bracketed translation put after &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We come back to the Supplemental Bill and define the type of person, not the office to which a person has been appointed and not even the Irish version of that office.  We define by reference to a phrase which is merely an English translation and a bad translation&mdash;certainly a translation inconsistent with all that has gone before&mdash; of the word &ldquo;Breitheamh.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is it not queer in this Bill to go to all these lengths to enjoin upon us that the judges are to be known as &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche&rdquo; and, five minutes afterwards, to ask us to deal with a fundamental Bill, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, in which the Parliamentary Secretary himself enjoins upon us:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the High Court&rdquo; means the Court established by <i>section 2</i> of the Principal Act; &ldquo;justice of the District Court&rdquo; includes, except where the context otherwise requires, the President of the District Court;</P>

      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the history of this matter.  It shows how the proceedings of this House can be made ludicrous by foolish publicity.  It is notorious to all of us who have any information about these matters that these two Bills were drafted several years ago, sometime in 1955 or 1956. What happened is that they have been plucked out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they?  At any rate, they were there in our time. They were plucked out by this Government and, having plucked them out, in order to give a demonstration of his <Col N="799" /> energy and his exertion, the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced into the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill a whole lot of fraudulent trimmings.  Everyone has apparently been too lazy to go through the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill and the consequential measure, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill and make the proper adjustments that should have been made if the trimmings were to extend to the whole corpus of the legislation.  The result has been that on several occassions, to which we have already directed the Parliamentary Secretary's attention, we are in the ludicrous position that we enjoin on all loyal citizens of the State that the Supreme Court is to be known hereafter as An Chúirt Uachtarach ; and, in the next subsection of the Bill where that is laid down, we ourselves describe it as the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>It is now enjoined upon us to describe a district justice as Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche and in the next paragraph almost, we ourselves describe him as a district justice.  I have a very deep instinct that this is a demoralising kind of activity.  We all know it to be so fraudulent, so specious, so shamelessly vote-catching and such a prostitution of something that we ought to respect, and for which I have a deep regard&mdash;the Irish language&mdash;that I feel we are all made cheap by this Bill, and anyone reading our legislation will deride us for our own manifest incompetence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has been directed by the Government to institute all these Irish titles and to enjoin upon us, when speaking English, to use the Irish words, as if no one could be persuaded to utter a word of Irish in this country unless required by statute to do so, and that in itself is a most offensive proposition, if that is to be the law, then let the law be consistently and properly drafted and enacted.  Let us not have law propounded to us in this House that is self-contradictory and which bears on its face all the marks of fraud.  There is something humiliating and demoralising in that. <Col N="800" /> We ought not to be so lazy in our enactments in this House that we cannot bother to present our legislation in correct form because, after we have put in the trimmings, they have served their purpose and the consequential adjustments requisite to make the legislation seemly is too much trouble.  Let us have it one way or the other, but do not let us have a slapdash performance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take from the Parliamentary Secretary any credit he may wish to claim for producing this legislation, legislation he has taken out of the files of the Department.  I do put it to him, however, that in so far as his influence has been brought to bear upon it, the result has been pretty slapdash.  The corpus of these Bills is good and carefully done.  The Parliamentary Secretary's handiwork upon them has not improved them. It is not a good start for any person first brought into contact with the responsibilities of office to acquire the reputation of being slapdash.  It is not a good reputation to build.</P>
    <P>Worst of all, where careful work has been done and a proper instrument prepared for submission to the legislature, it is most regrettable that political considerations should impose upon the House the ludicrous frauds that are manifesting themselves in these two Bills.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should take early measures either to drop all the fraudulent cod which he has sought to associate with this necessary legislation or, else, to burn sufficient midnight oil to ensure that the fraudulent cod, although it must remain fraudulent and although it must remain cod, shall at least be consistent and not introduce an atmosphere of farce into that aspect of the legislation with which his activities must be associated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting fairly well used to the Opposition tactic of making it absolutely clear that the credit for anything that is good in these Bills should be attributed to somebody else and that the blame for anything that is bad or derogatory should be firmly placed on my shoulders.  We will let that pass, however, <Col N="801" /> and deal with the particular proposition put forward here.</P>
      <P>First of all, there was the suggestion that even if I were, to use a Northern expression, a through-other, slapdash sort of character, my officials would allow into this House a measure which was not carefully examined and gone through in every detail.  That suggestion is, of course, absurd.  There is no question of our having interpolated these titles in the first instance and then of not bothering or forgetting to carry them right through the Bill.  I have already explained that there is a very clear and precise pattern and, indeed, an inescapable logic in what has been done.</P>
      <P>When dealing with the establishment of offices as such, and with the fundamental process of bringing these offices into being, we have, in an earnest and sincere desire to carry out the spirit of the Constitution, used the Irish and the English form side by side in an endeavour to emphasise the Irish form of the name.  Having done that in the basic establishment sections, from there on throughout the Bill, in the English text of the Bill, we use the English form only.  Nothing could be simpler, more straightforward or logical than that.  I think that should be sufficient to deal with the argument that the Bills are self-contradictory in some way.  They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other point with regard to styling justices here.  I have already dealt with that.  The Opposition are picking on this one particular point of styling.  Surely they can see that when we go on throughout the Bills to refer, for instance, to the President of the High Court, we do not use the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo; there.  If Deputy McGilligan were to be consistent in his criticism, he should insist that anywhere in the Bills we use the title of the President of the High Court, we should say &ldquo;the judge who for the time being is President of the High Court&rdquo;, if he wants to have this insistence on &ldquo;judges&rdquo; throughout the Bill.  I maintain that that is not necessary and I think it is quite clear from the whole construction of the Bills that it is not necessary.  When we are <Col N="802" /> establishing these people, we establish them as judges and we go on in parenthesis to say that they shall thenceforward be styled justices.  That clears the way from then on for the use of the styling &ldquo;justice&rdquo; wherever it occurs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question about who is responsible or who gets credit or lack of credit for anything, I want to make the position, as far as I understand it, clear.  This body of legislation was drafted by the late Mr. Gerald McCarthy who had been put into a special office which he filled in a way that everybody who knew his reputation would expect him to fill it until the date of his untimely death. When all this legislation was drafted, the first version I saw of it was one that bore the date&mdash;I am not absolutely certain of this&mdash;of 1953.  I saw it in 1954 and certainly there was a date on it which indicated that it had reached a second draft earlier than the year in which I got it taken out of a safe in a particular office in Government Buildings.  I have a feeling that the first version went back as far as 1950. There is no doubt the bulk of this work, all this amazing repeal of statutes and all that, was peculiarly the type of work the late Mr. Gerald McCarthy was efficient at and it is his hallmark that is on all this.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Dillon and I complain of is that that very good piece of work was taken hold of and rather messed up by this pretence of favouring the Irish language.  It is to that that we take exception.  I say &ldquo;pretence&rdquo; and I have used the word &ldquo;pretence&rdquo; and I have used the words that a substantially good draft of legislation has been somewhat spoiled by this effort at pretence of favouring the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we do with regard to the Irish language?  The Parliamentary Secretary says now that we have established the courts and have given them Irish names.  We do not give them Irish names.  We give them a double name.  The Irish name comes, as far as the first piece of legislation is concerned, in the first place, and there is <Col N="803" /> a translation in English, but the English part is put in brackets and that is the translation.  The Parliamentary Secretary's enthusiasm for the Irish language is at fever heat in the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, so that he takes the Irish phrase out of brackets and gives it precedence and puts the English phrase into them.  That glow vanishes when you come to this legislation.  We then forget all about the Irish language.  We have done our duty, so to speak, by the Irish language in using Irish phrases in the titles of certain courts, in respect of certain personnel, and then forget all about it, put it aside and come back here and say: &ldquo;Now, we know where we are. We are going to speak of `justices'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Look at line 41 on page 5:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo; means the Court established by <i>section 1</i> of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I turn to Section 1 of the Principal Act.  We have established the Court of Final Appeal and &ldquo;in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution it is to be called An Chúirt Uachtarach (The Supreme Court).&rdquo;  Of course, as was pointed out yesterday, it is not in pursuance of Article 34 that the title &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; has been put upon the Court of Final Appeal. That is completely wrong but still we have accepted it and in the first Bill, we have then established An Chúirt Uachtarach translated in brackets (The Supreme Court).  But then, on that matter, having done our duty by the Irish language, let us forget all about it when we come to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1959 and say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo; means the Court established by section 1 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I think that is a pretence.  I would not mind if the pretence had been carried forward and if it said &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach (The Supreme Court) is the court established by Section 1 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  We drop the whole folly once we come into this particular piece of legislation and we simply say: &ldquo;justice of the District Court&rdquo; may include the President <Col N="804" /> of the District Court and &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo; means the Court established by section 1 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The only other point that has been raised is in regard to the President of the High Court, that if I want to insist on calling him a judge, I should say &ldquo;the judge known as the President of the High Court&rdquo;, which would be better probably, but, in any event, there is no disparaging effect in the use of the words &ldquo;President of the High Court&rdquo;.  There is when you have established people as judges of the district court and then you suddenly turn around and say all the way that the phrase &ldquo;justice of the district court&rdquo; means or includes some individual. There is something derogatory in the use of the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.  It is taking away from his status.  Saying that a person is a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court does not take away from his status; it is an addition to it.</P>

      <P>I put this amendment down for the purpose of inquiry.  This section deals with certain pension rights.  It carries forward certain enactments relating to pensions of judges and they are to continue to apply.  There is then put in a saving clause:</P>

      <P>The section proposes to carry forward certain rights.  Subsection (1) of Section 21 of the 1937 Act deals with the carry forward of rights and obligations where statutes are repealed.  The idea of the draftsman in putting it in this fashion was that he <Col N="805" /> feared, if you like, that when he stipulated particular rights that were to be carried forward, the very fact that he was doing so might be read to infer that no others were to be carried forward, so, he decided it was safer to save the general operation of subsection (1) of Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.  It is, if you like, excess of caution but it is deemed wiser to do it. Is that clear?</P>

The phrase I want to remove is &ldquo;without prejudice to subsection (1) of Section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937.&rdquo;  If that is left out, the section would read that the enactments mentioned in a certain schedule are hereby repealed to the extent mentioned in certain columns of the schedule, but such of those enactments as relate to the pensions of the judges and justices of the courts established by the Act of 1934 shall continue to apply.

      <P>Where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  revive anything not in force or not existing immediately before such repeal takes effect, or</P>
      <P>(b)  affect the previous operation of the statute or portion of a statute so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, or</P>
      <P>(c)  affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the statute or portion of a statute so repealed.</P>

      <P>It is all operative but this is the particularly important part &ldquo;any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the statute or portion of a statute so repealed.&rdquo;  That is the general provision of the Interpretation Act with regard to repealed statutes. Now we are providing in Section 3 specifically for the carry-forward of certain rights related to pensions.  It might be construed or inferred from that specific provision that when we provide that these shall be carried forward, by implication, nothing else is carried forward, and we want to preserve the position under Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.  We do so by making it clear that, even though it is stipulated that certain rights shall be carried forward, that is not to say that the general carry-forward provision of the Interpretation Act shall be negatived.</P>

The Parliamentary draftsman is part of the Attorney General's office and he drafts legislation which is coming into this House from the Government side but he has his own point of view.

If, on a very technical matter, a very technical point, a confused point or a confusing section, we were told that there are alternatives and this is the one the Parliamentary draftsman thinks is best, I could understand it, but to be told that just because this is what the Parliamentary draftsman has decided, we have to accept it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that I never attempted to suggest that just because the draftsman said something, the House must accept it. I was merely replying to Deputy Dillon who put to me what he regarded as a reasonable proposition, namely, that if I say to Deputy McGilligan: &ldquo;I have consulted the draftsman and he feels this is the best way to do it,&rdquo; the Opposition might accept it.  Deputy Dillon put that to me in so many words.  I replied to the effect that I consulted the Parliamentary draftsman on this amendment and that he is satisfied this is the best way.  Deputy McGilligan then ignores that and proceeds to argue on the merits of the thing.  If Deputy McGilligan or any other Deputy does not accept the proposition that I have consulted the draftsman and that he is satisfied that technically this is the best way to do it, and proceeds to argue on its merits, surely I am entitled to give my views on the merits of the situation?</P>

I have already explained in relation to the No. 1 Bill that this is a matter of drafting technique and a matter of facilitating the construction of the Bill. There are in the Supreme Court five judges, one of whom is the President or Chief Justice and four ordinary judges.  From time to time, it is necessary to refer to the Chief Justice as such and at other times, it is necessary to refer to judges other than the Chief Justice, We say therefore that the Supreme Court shall consist of the President or Chief Justice and four ordinary judges.

It is not beyond our capacity in this House to recognise that there are many ways of achieving <Col N="814" /> the same thing in a set of words, some 12 or 14, in this subsection. What we suggest and what Deputy McGilligan suggests in his amendment is that the same object and purpose is achieved by providing that the judges of the Supreme Court shall be known as judges of the Supreme Court, without making a distinction between them, which is strange and may be misunderstood.  It is quite unnecessary to distinguish between the Chief Justice and other judges of the Supreme Court by using in relation to the judges the term &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The whole construction of the Bill is set up along certain lines, the House will agree. Deputies have argued that we must use the phrase in regard to judges in a certain definite connotation because of the Constitution.  When we come along to establish the offices, we say the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; which is important in that section, if we are to be fair to the Constitution, includes Chief Justice and everybody else.  It is the proper constitutional description.  Therefore, the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; as such is no good to us as a phrase to describe the Chief Justice as distinct from the other judges.  It must, of necessity, include both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is now put to me by the Opposition that it is sufficient to use the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; for everybody.  The term &ldquo;judges&rdquo; must be the one from a constitutional point of view.  That is so, but from time to time there are things which will apply to the Chief Justice which will not apply to the others and it is therefore necessary to refer to them in a different context.  For that reason, if &ldquo;judge&rdquo; is common to the two, it must be common to the two by virtue of the Constitution and we have to distinguish between them in the way we do.  When we refer to the Chief Justice and four ordinary judges, what is the objection to it?  There is nothing derogatory about it.  It is just that the person is an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, if he is not Chief Justice.</P>

      <P>We are clear on that.  Their position, status, jurisdiction, power and all the rest of it are defined by the court to which they are appointed.  They are judges of the Supreme Court&mdash;the five of them.  Of that number, one is Chief Justice.  That is perfectly clear.

      <P>Why should it be necessary?  Of the five, one is Chief Justice and nobody else.  One of those judges is Chief Justice.  The others are judges of the Supreme Court but not one of them is Chief Justice. It is perfectly easy, proper, right and mannerly to refer to the other four judges of the Supreme Court as being judges of the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice, if it is necessary to distinguish between them but here we use a new term, a new adjective&mdash; an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court.

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has put the whole thing very well. He put his finger on it when he says that it will be necessary from time to time throughout the Bill to refer to the Chief Justice as doing something and that it is necessary to refer to a judge of the Supreme Court who is not Chief Justice.  The simple way of doing that is to speak of an &ldquo;ordinary judge&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Higgins admits that we would have to use some such phrase as &ldquo;a judge of the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice&rdquo;.  That is a cumbersome phrase.  The same effect is achieved very simply by this procedure.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is quite incorrect in his suggestion that the term &ldquo;ordinary judge&rdquo; is new.  It is contained in the 1924 Act.  There is nothing new about it.  It is there, known and recognised as a term.</P>

I am directing attention to the action of Deputy Sherwin who asks: &ldquo;Why do you call them `ordinary judges'?&rdquo;  I think there is a certain importance in that reaction which highlights the case we have made against the employment of this term.</P>
      <P>The more the judges can be elevated in the eyes of the people, the more conviction can be brought home to the people that the judges are extraordinary people, far removed from the litigants who come before them, whether they be the Executive or a humble criminal defending his personal liberty.  Once they appear before a judge and he is in that extraordinary position that, before him, they are all equal, the more useful the work we in the Legislature do.</P>
      <P>Everything we can do to persuade the public that judges are not ordinary people, the better.  The idea is that judges, in the discharge of their duty, should not be ordinary people.  They should have that extreme detachment which the rest of us find it so difficult to have.  Deputy Sherwin's intervention is extremely illuminating.  This is an unfortunate turn of phrase.  It is carefully avoided elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be one of an archaic series of titles with which the Scottish people are familiar.  There is force in the point I am urging, in relation to Deputy Sherwin, that the one thing we do not want in the public mind is an ordinary judge.  The more extraordinary we can make it, the better it is for the administration of justice. That concept belongs to the battle which has gone on in this House ever since the State was founded.</P>
      <P>One always found elements in this House who said, in effect: &ldquo;All panoply associated with the judiciary should be abolished &mdash; wigs, gowns, guards of honour, and so on.  They are just ordinary people.  They should do their job and have done with it&rdquo;; but there has always been the prevailing opinion here that that is all a mistake and that the more panoply that surrounds a judge the better for the humblest creature who has to appear before him.  I take that view and it is in that general context that one demurs at the adjective &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is most illuminating that Deputy Sherwin, who has no professional association with the courts, who looks upon judges as ordinary citizens and is not concerned with the day-to-day life of the courts, instinctively reacts against describing a judge of the Supreme Court as an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; judge.</P>

      <P>The reason I intervened was to point out that we have already dealt with the Committee Stage of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, 1959, which sets out in Section 1 (2) (b) that the Supreme Court shall be constituted of four ordinary judges.  We have had an unduly <Col N="820" /> long discussion on that point already. We cannot upset the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, 1959, by an amendment of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1959.  I think all the arguments about whether judges should be regarded or styled as &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; have been given and fairly met and that the House has made a decision.</P>
      <P>I wanted to see if we could expedite the handling of this Bill.  I think we are going back over the same points with a great amount of repetition which is getting us nowhere.

      <P>In reply to Deputy Sherwin as to the use of the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;, it is a word which is well known in the context.  In this context, it means not I think what Deputy Sherwin would normally regard as ordinary.  By definition, it means &ldquo;by permanent appointment, not temporary or extraordinary.&rdquo;  When you <Col N="821" /> speak of an extraordinary appointment, it is an <i>ad hoc</i> temporary appointment whereas &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; means a permanent appointment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the amendment itself, the last day we did say the Supreme Court was to be constituted of certain judges. Then we made a distinction.  There is the Chief Justice, the President, who is to be called Chief Justice under an Irish title; and such number, not less than four, ordinary judges as the Dáil may decide.  I had amendments down yesterday against the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; judges and they were beaten.  The fact that they were beaten does not at all destroy the amendment put down now which is to the effect that the number <Col N="824" /> of judges of the Supreme Court shall be five.  That is not in any way contrary to what was passed this morning in Section 1.  I am avoiding discrimination between the Chief Justice and other judges; I am not describing any of them.  I am simply saying the number of judges shall be five.  That is what Section 1 determined yesterday; they are all judges, five in number, with the possibility of a judge being brought up <i>ex officio</i> in the person of the President of the High Court.  My amendment is quite in order notwithstanding what happened yesterday.  Notwithstanding yesterday, we are still entitled to say the number of judges of the Supreme Court shall be five.  That is what I am arguing should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary and the House that there is in this section quite a wrong distinction drawn between the judges of the Supreme Court and the judges of the High Court.  We are providing in subsection (1) that the number of ordinary judges of the Supreme Court shall be four.  In subsection (2), we provide that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall be not more than six.  That means that the High Court can be depopulated of judges as a <Col N="826" /> result of vacancies occurring and these vacancies not being filled.  We did have that situation obtaining in the courts not so long ago and it led to quite a considerable dislocation so far as litigants, persons desiring to have their cases heard, were concerned.</P>
      <P>As I understand the staffing of the courts and the number of judges felt to be adequate and proper, all that has been carefully considered in relation to the volume of business and so on. If it is, as it is, the view that there should be five judges in the Supreme Court and a High Court Bench of seven judges&mdash;six ordinary judges and the President&mdash;in my view, the section should provide that that will be the norm.  One should not permit a situation to arise where one authority of the State, or persons with no particular knowledge, may succeed in having a decision adopted not to fill a particular vacancy.  It is undesirable and I feel the section as it stands should be reconsidered by the Parliamentary Secretary in order to provide the same basis for both the Supreme Court and the High Court.</P>
      <P>When vacancies occur, they should be filled.  The courts should be facilitated and enabled by the prompt filling of vacancies to function normally. I should like to point out that particularly in the High Court, the division and distribution of business, which is the responsibility of the President of the High Court, is done in the knowledge, first, of the volume of business available and, second, in relation to the <i>cadre</i> of judges, which is a total of seven.  If, in fact, one of these judges retires or dies, then there is a gap and somebody has to fill in.  The filling in means that for a period there is a dis-organisation in the way business is done, a dislocation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in those circumstances, the President of the High Court were told that permanently the number of judges available to him would be a reduced number, presumably he could devise some new plan for the organisation and distribution of business.  There is nothing worse than a vacancy continuing to exist with nobody knowing when and how it is to be filled.  Certainly the business of the courts is not <Col N="827" /> facilitated if that situation is allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only this comment.  I am a layman, but I hear the views of the public.  I am most dissatisfied at the long delays there are in the courts.  Vacancies should not be allowed to cause delays and hold decisions in abeyance.  I know of one case where a person who was anxious to have a case come to court had to wait seven or eight months.  It was appealed and he was told that that might take another nine months.  The public want to see the business done.  They do not want vacancies and delays.  There is too much delay in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great difference between the Supreme Court and the High Court in this regard.  The essential difference is that the Supreme Court sit as a composite court&mdash;they sit together.  For that reason, we decide differently the constitution of the Supreme Court.  It is the aim and desire of the Government, as I think it is of the majority of the House, that the Supreme Court should always sit with five, if at all possible.  We do give discretion to the Chief Justice to have courts of three.  But, generally speaking, we want a composite court of five sitting together.  Therefore, we stipulate that the Supreme Court shall consist of five judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A really different set of circumstances operates in regard to the High Court.  There you have different judges sitting separately.  Each judge sits and conducts his business as an individual judge as a general rule.  From that point of view, therefore, it is wrong to suggest that the same provisions should apply to both.  In the High Court, we try to provide by law from time to time what number of judges are adequate to deal with the business coming before it.  In present circumstances, the decision is that the number should be seven.  It is possible that from time to time there may be a falling off in the volume of litigation and that six, or even five, might do.  It would then be open to the Government simply not to appoint a judge.  But if <Col N="828" /> we stipulate that there shall be a fixed number, then the Government have no option but to keep the High Court up to that number, even though that full number might not be required.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think it is much better to leave the section as it is and merely state that there shall not be more than six ordinary judges, that is, a court of seven, including the President. Then, so long as the volume of business requires seven judges to deal with it, the figure will remain at that, but it will be open to the Government, if the volume falls off, to reduce the number of judges, without further legislation.  But if the situation envisaged by Deputy Sherwin arose, where the volume of business was such that seven judges were unable to deal with it, then it would be necessary to increase the number by legislation.  The way we are proceeding in this Bill leaves it open to the Government to achieve an economy if it offers, without having recourse to further legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin talked about the delay and congestion in the courts. That was the case some years ago.  I understood the back-log of arrears had been cleared off but then an unfortunate circumstance happened.  That was a very notable criminal trial which has occupied a very big number of judges over a very long time and is not yet settled.  It took a whole term in the Court of Criminal Appeal, with one judge of the Supreme Court and two judges of the High Court, who had to devote their whole attention to this one case over an entire term.  It is not to be expected that that type of case will occur often or will, even if that type of alleged criminality goes on, take so long to examine.  If there is any congestion at the moment, it is due entirely to a completely exceptional matter not likely to recur.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) (a) sets out the qualification for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court as being 12 years standing at the Bar. It appears to me&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;that, as the subsection stands, since there has been care to distinguish up to this in the Bill between the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court and ordinary judges of the Supreme and High Court, it may be questioned whether the qualification in subsection (2) (a) applies to the Chief Justice or to the President of the High Court.

That qualification should be expressly inserted not only in relation to ordinary judges but also in relation to presidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I get the intention clearly?  I take it it would not be the intention, judging by what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, and neither would it be desirable, that the law should be such that the Chief Justice could be appointed only from the existing number of judges of the Supreme Court or that the President of the High Court could be appointed only from the existing number of judges of that Court.  That would not be desirable.  It has certainly not been the position up to this.  It may be the usual thing to appoint as Chief Justice a person who had been President of the High Court, and so on, but it would obviously not be desirable that the law should restrict appointment to these two important judicial offices.  With that in mind I examined the subsection with particular care and I found the omission in relation to the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court which I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to subsection (2) of the first Bill which defines the Supreme Court as being constituted of the following judges: <Col N="832" /> the President thereof, namely the Chief Justice, and such number not being less than four ordinary judges, and so on.  Then there is the provision that the President of the High Court shall be an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the Supreme Court.  From a strict interpretation point of view I wonder if that is satisfactory.  There is a distinction drawn there between ordinary judges&mdash;we are discussing the Supreme Court now&mdash;and the President of the Court.  The same distinction is carried later in relation to the High Court.  I am not happy that the subsection as it stands is clear and will include not only ordinary judges but these two particularly designated judges of each court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be as well if I made clear that it is the intention of the Government that a person who is, for the time being, a practising barrister of not less than 12 years standing should be qualified for appointment as Chief Justice or an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court or as President of the High Court or an ordinary judge of that Court. That is the clear intention of the Government.  I am quite happy&mdash;I have had the matter examined carefully&mdash;that what I say is the correct position ; the intention of the Government is given full effect to in Section 4 of the Supplemental Provisions Bill because the provisions of the No. 1 Bill, the Establishment Bill, are quite clear.  A judge of the Supreme Court includes both the President and the ordinary members.  It is absolutely clear in the context that a judge of the Supreme Court includes the President, who is the Chief Justice, and the ordinary judges.  The same position applies with regard to the High Court.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should have a look at it.  We know of two instances, one rather remote in point of time, and another perhaps more recent.  In relation to each instance there was considerable concern that an appointment should be made where in fact the person appointed possibly might not have had&mdash;I am not saying did not show it later&mdash;but possibly might not have had the experience and knowledge gained from practice.</P>
      <P>Certainly, I should imagine that everybody on both sides of the House would regard it as very wrong indeed if a person were appointed to a high judicial office who had only a few weeks or a few months practising experience at the Bar.  It certainly would be wrong.  While the Parliamentary Secretary is correct in saying that, strictly speaking, under the form of words here used that might happen, it should not be beyond the wit and genius of the draftsman to find a form of words which would ensure that that will not happen because, obviously, it should not.</P>

      <P>It is the same phrase&mdash;so many years standing.  I do want to say that, apart from that individual who has been a not very remote appointment, Deputy O'Higgins was talking of a very remote appointment. It was in his case that I understood that the courts gave an interpretation of the type I have mentioned, namely, if a person is in practice at a particular moment and has been called 12 years, that counts.  There was a person who was known in the Library many years ago as the banshee because he never came to the Library except when there had been a vacation of judicial office by a death and he appeared to be in practice, put himself in practice.  He had the standing in the sense that he was called for many years.  He eventually succeeded to a judgeship and an effort was made to say he was disqualified and it did not succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That great translation might have an effect on that and, certainly, this side of the House would promise the Parliamentary Secretary great support.  The phrase is there.  I thought the introduction of the words Deputy Sherwin had lit on &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; had made some difference but apparently it does not.  Section 16 says:</P>
      <P>a person who is not at the date of his appointment a practising barrister of 12 years standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some difference.  I have not compared the phrases but, certainly, at a time when the qualification <Col N="837" /> was being a practising barrister and having so many years standing, a person fitted in under that and was sanctioned by the court because he had been called longer than the period and he was in practice at the particular moment and the appointment was operative.</P>
    <P>If it is not intended, then this phrase ought to be changed but there will be difficulty in changing the phrase.  If the phrase is &ldquo;in active practice&rdquo; or &ldquo;in practice for so many years&rdquo;, then you might have the case where a person had, say, through influenza or a couple of bouts of influenza, lost a year.  It would be quite wrong to have that person disqualified on account of health.  At the same time the phrase as it is at the moment does not require any real practice.  It means that the date of call shall give a person standing and if a person shows himself in the Library so as to be available to get briefs he is in practice no matter what work he has done.</P>

      <Col N="838" /> To delete subsection (2) (b).</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on this amendment.  I hope anything I say will not be misunderstood.  Certainly, it is not intended to refer to two exceptional cases.  The fact that they were exceptional cases does not interfere with the principle I have in mind. Certainly in the past 25 years there were two particularly outstanding men who adorned not only the Circuit Court but subsequently other courts, but that is apart from the principle I have in mind.  It is a principle which we should adopt, that there should not be from court to court a procedure facilitating judicial promotion.  In my view when a judge is appointed as a judge of the Circuit Court he should be facilitated to operate, realising that that is going to be his court for as long as he continues to be a judge. I do not think it is desirable that we should facilitate an elevation or a promotion from the Circuit Court to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that, in the instances in which it has occured in the past, the two persons concerned were exceptional judges and the promotions were very satisfactory, but the appointments of these two men initially to the Circuit Court bench was done at a formative period in the life of the State.  Perhaps under ordinary and more normal circumstances their initial appointment would have been to the courts to which they were eventually appointed.  I do not like the idea of judicial promotion and it is for that purpose that I suggest subsection (2) (b) as it stands is a means of facilitating a Circuit Court judge's appointment to the High Court.  He can be appointed a Circuit Court judge if he has ten years standing at the Bar on the terms we have already discussed.  He can be appointed a High Court judge only if he has 12 years' standing.  The purpose of subsection (2) (b) is to deem his service as a Circuit Court judge sufficient to fill up the two years he may require.  That facilitates promotion and I do not like it.</P>

      <P>The manner in which <Col N="839" /> Deputy O'Higgins argues against himself supplies me with the justification for the retention of this subsection (2) (b).  It is true that there is an undesirable content in the idea of promotion of the judiciary but, after all, we are dealing with the higher echelon of the judiciary and we have recognised and accepted promotion from the High Court to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>It is a very valuable thing and something nobody would complain about.  All that is involved here is the idea of taking a Circuit Court judge and putting him into the High Court.  Deputy O'Higgins admits there were two particularly outstanding successful instances of that sort of promotion.  That in itself is the very justification for what we are doing. Such promotions have not been made for a long time and might very well be regarded as a dead letter.  On the other hand, we should envisage the situation arising where some particularly outstanding judge in the Circuit Court would be ideally suited for a vacancy in the High Court.  In such a case, the Government should not be debarred from selecting that judge and putting him into the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of promotion has not been made for a long time, as I say, and it is not likely to be made in future.  Indeed, the proposition generally accepted by most Governments of this country would be that such promotions should be very rarely made.  On the other hand, I do not think we should legislate that it should not be possible at all in any circumstances.  We should leave the door just that little bit open. In this regard we must have some regard to tradition.  Admittedly we have a written Constitution but tradition and precedent will also, more and more, play an important part in our institutional affairs.  There is the tradition that such promotion would not lightly be made, and that is the best way to leave it.  Leave the door open and in a case, such as Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, of a particular individual being available for promotion <Col N="840" /> to the High Court, the door would be open that little bit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have amendments 14 and 15 down but I have been told that amendment 15 is out of order on the ground that it <Col N="841" /> could possibly increase charges on the State.  There is that remote possibility that it might involve a charge.  I have protected myself by moving to delete subsection (2).  On that, judges once appointed, subsequent to the provision about retiring, are protected in their office.  If it comes to dismissal they can be dismissed for stated misbehaviour or stated incapacity and a judge may vacate his office by sending in a letter of resignation.  There are special pension terms arranged in such circumstances. If a judge retires through infirmity, not having five years service, he gets no pension.  The position is that if a judge serves five years or more and then goes out, vacates his office on the grounds of infirmity, he gets a pension.  The distinction is that if he is dismissed&mdash;and there are only two reasons for dismissing a judge, misbehaviour or incapacity&mdash; he should go without a pension, and if he becomes infirm and resigns after five years service or more, he should get a pension.</P>
    <P>It is proposed here to give exceptional treatment to a judge who is dismissed or removed from office.  If he is removed from office on the grounds of incapacity, he is deemed to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.  I do not think a person dismissed because of incapacity or stated misconduct should get a pension.  If he is dismissed for either misbehaviour or infirmity, he should get no pension.  If he is dismissed on the grounds of incapacity, it should have the same effect as if he were dismissed on the grounds of misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>I am confining myself to the amendment, which, if accepted, would leave the position as it was before.  If a judge is dismissed from judicial office, and if the Dáil joins with the Seanad in saying that a person has been guilty of misbehaviour or incapacity and dismisses that person, I do not think he should be given a pension.  In a case of real infirmity or incapacity, he has the option that he can vacate his office by resigning, but I do not think he should be paid a pension if he just will not resign, even if he is completely infirm and incapable.  If he is suffering from <Col N="842" /> complete incapacity and will not send in a letter of resignation, we should say: &ldquo;Out you go,&rdquo; and he should get no pension.</P>

      <P>May I seek clarification? Does the word &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; envisage a judge who is mentally unstable and incapable of tendering a valid resignation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the interpretation, then it seems to me there are grounds for the proposal in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan one hundred per cent. with regard to individuals who have to be dealth with by the Oireachtas, and we have to move their dismissal because of stated misconduct. Such a case has never arisen and we hope it never will arise but if that sanction is invoked by the Oireachtas, it should be of the utmost severity with regard to his emoluments and pension.</P>
      <P>If there is a judge&mdash;and I think this has happened in the past&mdash;who is incapable, or on the threshold of incapacity, and cannot tender a valid resignation, and there is no other means open to him, I think the proposal in those circumstances is fair and valid. We should remove him but we should not be prejudiced by the fact that he has become incapable validly to resign on the grounds of incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point.  First of all let me point out that this provision has applied to district justices since 1946, and we are now merely extending it to the Supreme Court and the High Court.  The idea behind the proposal is to deal with exactly the sort of case the Leader of the Opposition has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be the case of infirmity of the nature instanced by Deputy Dillon, insanity.  There could also be a case of paralysis or some other form of infirmity by reason of which the judge was physically incapable of resigning. The only alternative is for the Oireachtas to move for his removal on the ground of incapacity.  In those circumstances, <Col N="843" /> it would be completely unfair to deprive him of his pension rights. The provision is intended to deal purely with that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better in those circumstances to insert the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; before &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo;? It would seem to me to indicate clearly that we were concerned with that category of people who were incapable of resigning validly.  I apprehend that the word &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; without qualification could in extreme circumstances justify the Executive in approaching the Oireachtas where it had a dominant position and saying: &ldquo;The judgements of the judge suggest incapacity and the judgements are so outrageous that we are asking the House to remove him on the ground of incapacity.&rdquo; The Oireachtas might not understand that that does not deprive him of his pension or emoluments.  I think the Government of the day should be called upon to justify before the Oireachtas, when they seek to remove a judge for misconduct, whether by reason of aberration or evil intent their resolution to remove him with all the sanctions that are employed, so that the Oireachtas would be brought smack up against the proposition they are called on to pass involving onerous strictures on a judicial person.</P>
      <P>I think there would be unanimous agreement on the proposition that we should retain in our hands the power to remove a judge suffering from physical incapacity, if he is not able validly to resign.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that and see if some clarifying word could be introduced to give a more precise significance to the word &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is reference to that matter in the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, with regard to district justices.  May I follow what Deputy Dillon has said?  As the section stands at the moment, it means that a judge removed on the grounds of incapacity shall be deemed to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.  That applies to such incapacity as brings a resolution for his removal before the Dáil and Seanad, if a judge is incapable, and if he is not able to resign because he has reached such a state of infirmity of body or mind that he cannot send in his resignation and puts us to the trouble of dismissing him.</P>
      <P>As the section stands, it can apply to another judge who, in the extreme conditions the Parliamentary Secretary talks about, is incapable of performing his duties.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary this question: supposing the section or the subsection were not there and a case occurred of a judge who became so mentally and physically incapable that he could not pen a letter of resignation, is there anything to prevent the Dáil voting him a pension?  I do not think there is.  If a resolution for his dismissal has been brought in on the grounds of incapacity, there could then be another resolution giving him a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the possibility of this is so remote that we ought not to open wide the doors to give pensions to people who are in some way infirm but not so infirm as to be in the extreme position the Parliamentary Secretary talked about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the district court.  In connection with the district court the position was that a district justice, removed on account of mental or physical incapacity, was deemed for the purpose of pension to have vacated his office, owing to permanent infirmity. Let us not forget the circumstances in which that occurred.  The first situation with regard to the district justices was that they had no permanent status whatever. They were not given, like judges <Col N="845" /> of the Circuit Court, the status of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court in regard to removal from office on account of misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>A tribunal was established consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General.  Those three&mdash;originally it was two&mdash;had the control of the district justices.  It was then thought that they were rather weakly safeguarded and it was thought that it was better to have the provision that if a justice under those circumstances was dismissed he should be deemed to have vacated his office owing to infirmity.  Those were entirely different circumstances.</P>
    <P>A later Act gave district justices the status of High Court and Supreme Court Judges in this regard but the corresponding matter to this occurred at a time when the district justices were under the control of a committee of three.  In any event the district justice is in an entirely different position.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is not proper to leave this in its present form.  Either incapacity should be defined as being incapacity of the extreme type talked about or, alternatively, drop the subsection with the understanding that if a person gets so ill that he cannot send in a letter of resignation the question of a pension would be considered.  In that case the person would not really be dismissed at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection says:</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court is removed from office on account of incapacity, he shall be deemed for the purpose of pension to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.</P>
      <P>Suppose a judge became a &ldquo;drunk&rdquo;, is he entitled to a pension if he is removed from office because of his incapacity?</P>

      <P>The analysis of the situation with regard to district justices is not quite right.  The district justices got this right in the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946.  It <Col N="846" /> was in that same Act that they got the same tenure as judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court, so that at the time of giving them the status the Act also gave them this provision.</P>
      <P>Let us look at it in this way.  A judge is either incapable or he is not. Either he suffers from incapacity or he does not.  If he is incapable, then he is removed from office and if he is not incapable, he is not.  I do not think there can be any question of defining degrees of incapacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's suggestion now is that we should remove the subsection altogether.  A man is or is not incapable.  I find it very difficult to visualise a situation in which a person would become so incapable that he would not be prepared to protect his personal rights. I do not want that situation to arise. We are providing here the conditions and the circumstances of the tenure of judges.  This is a further provision in that regard and we want to write that into an Act of Parliament.  If a judge is to be removed for incapacity &mdash;and it is impossible to visualise the sort of incapacity which would be the judge's own fault&mdash;we want to ensure that in such circumstances the <Col N="847" /> law would provide that his pension would be safeguarded.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan says that when such a case came before the House, the House would award the judge a pension.  It would require legislation to do so.  Is it not far simpler to make provision in this piece of legislation so that the matter would be looked after for evermore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that legislation would have to be brought in would be a minor matter having regard to the rare occasion on which a judge would have to be dismissed for incapacity of such a nature that he was not able to sign a letter of resignation.  That is a very exceptional case.  This opens the door wide to giving a pension to a judge who is incapable but who will not resign on account of his health and he forces this House and the Seanad to take action against him.  I think that man should be provided for.</P>
      <P>Let us take the circumstances of a man who is gone so bad that he cannot even write a letter of resignation. Since the State was established there was a Resolution tabled once in regard to a judge.  It was not preserved in because the judge resigned.  He was reluctant up to that particular point. A Resolution appeared on the Order Paper in this House but was never gone on with.  The occasion did not arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to incapacity, the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, refers to incapacity in a certain way.  The two reasons for removing a judge are either stated misbehaviour or incapacity.  In capacity is not defined. A person can get so drunk as to be incapable. A person could still be drunk and pull himself together again, so to speak, for the occasion of a sitting of a court.  I think that is misbehaviour and I would argue that in this House if the matter came up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the district court is concerned, the matter has been defined by law.  Under Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, there is power for the Minister to request the Chief Justice to investigate <Col N="848" /> certain conditions in regard to a district justice&mdash;&ldquo;either to investigate the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a justice or (b)&rdquo;&mdash;and this swings over to the misbehaviour&mdash;&ldquo;to enquire into the conduct (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) of a justice, either generally or on a particular occasion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As far as the district justice is concerned, that will cover the case of a person who indulges so much as to be a chronic drunk.  I cannot consider that to be on the grounds of incapacity. Certainly, it has relation to health, either physical or mental.  It seems to me that where a person who goes round notoriously drunk on every occasion and pulling himself together for a case it is misbehaviour.  I do not think there would be much difficulty in getting the House to agree to that. I think this is too wide as it stands. The alternative is to drop it or else to determine or define the incapacity to meet the extreme circumstances of a person so incapable by reason of mental or bodily infirmity that he is unable to consider the question of his resignation. Then it would be all right.</P>

      <P>Only this.  It is quite easy to think of, say, 1924 when four new Courts were being established: then, one thought in terms of jurisdiction.  Then, one went back to the Court of Appeal for Ireland and said: &ldquo;such jurisdiction as was vested in a Court and capable of being exercised by.&rdquo;  One could think of matters that were vested in the Court and <Col N="850" /> other matters not vested in the Court but capable of being exercised by it. That is all right in 1924.  We are now in the year 1961 and we are again speaking of jurisdiction that was vested in the Court or capable of being exercised by it.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that by this time we would have the ground well enough surveyed to realise whether there was anything of value in this phrase &ldquo;capable of being exercised by.&rdquo; Is it possible that since 1924 up to the present date there were jurisdictions that were incapable of being exercised by the Court which had not been vested? The vesting would have had time to take place and I imagine would have taken place in important matters.  I do not know what is preserved in this phrase.</P>

      <P>It is a case of not wishing to disturb the phraseology which has been used.  I think there is a principle in the construction of all Acts of Parliament that without some good reason one should not discard well-known and well-accepted phraseology. It may be that this section can achieve all we want it to achieve with regard to the Supreme Court without the use of these words but the phrase is in existence and unless some particularly overwhelming reason could be advanced as to why it should be dropped I would not be in favour of dropping it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) (a), page 7, line 32, to insert after &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo;&ldquo;and not being a question as to the validity of a law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I regard this as a matter of substance. The run of this section is that from subsection (3) onwards appeals to the Supreme Court are to be heard by a full court of five people but then, to get the five, one may either have the President of the High Court brought up or one may have any judge of the High Court brought up at the request of the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that enlarged group the suggestion here is that appeals or any matter to come before the Supreme Court should be heard by a court of five.  That is all subject to subsection (4).  Subsection (4) gives leave to the Chief Justice or to the senior ordinary judge available to determine that a matter can be heard and determined by three judges.  Therefore, although there is a sort of hint, there is nothing in the way of a firm suggestion to the court that there should be five sitting all the time.  It is left entirely to the discretion of the Chief Justice or a senior colleague available: &ldquo;...the <Col N="853" /> appeal or matter to which the determination relates shall be heard and determined by three judges ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that there are two reservations. One is: &ldquo;not being a matter so cognisable under Article 12 of the Constitution&rdquo;.  That is the very remote matter of declaring the President to be permanently incapacitated.  In that situation there must be a full court of five.  The second reservation is &ldquo;not being a matter so cognisable under Article 26 of the Constitution ...&rdquo; That is where a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court by the President.  There again the Constitution lays down that there must be five judges.</P>
    <P>The surprising thing to me is that constitutional cases may be determined by three judges.  My amendment seeks to remedy that by inserting the words: &ldquo;and not being a question as to the validity of a law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution&rdquo;.  There may be what I call rather minor constitutional points made and it would be wrong to have a Supreme Court of five sitting for that.  Generally speaking when a constitutional matter comes before the Supreme Court there would be five but there are quite a number of instances where there would not be.  There was a case tried about five or six years ago where the question was raised as to whether a particular Circuit Court judge had been properly appointed under the Constitution.  As far as the courts were concerned, they felt the present courts were properly functioning under the relevant article of the Constitution, that new appointments had been regularly made and would continue to be made.  In fact it was a decision which said the courts are in existence and are carrying on satisfactorily and there is no necessity for legislation such as we have before us now.  That case was heard by a court of three, I think.  It may have been four but certainly not five.  In regard to the recent case which Senator O'Donovan won, if that case had gone to appeal, as the law stood, it could have been heard by a court of three because the five are required only in two special instances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> It is wrong that we cannot make it a constitutional obligation to have five judges to hear a case in relation to the Constitution.  We should make it mandatory that, if a constitutional case comes before the Supreme Court, it should be heard by five judges.  I am not referring to the type of legislation under Article 26 of the Constitution.  This brings in all constitutional matters, if there is a question brought up as to the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  If the Constitution is to be given any importance at all, anything that tends to question the constitutionality of laws passed in this House should be determined by a full court.</P>

    <P>4.  Before section 12, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax, where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fares paid on public transport in travelling between his normal residence and the place where the income is earned, he shall, subject to a maximum of fifty-two pounds in any one year, be allowed such expenditure as an expense wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by him in earning such income.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputies P. Byrne, Cosgrave and Ryan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not very much more can be said on this amendment.  I think we have already made the case.  It is a most reasonable, restricted and conservative one, and I think we are entitled to ask the Minister to accept it.  Last night, the Minister posed a fair question in regard to this series of amendments and asked whether or not it was better to introduce reliefs in the manner advocated here as an alternative to a reduction in the standard rate of income-tax.  I believe that the greatest need in tax reform at present is to provide more relief for the individual taxpayer.  It is significant that the reduction in the standard rate means more to the big taxpayer than to the small one.  It means more to the corporation with profits of £50,000 a year than it does to the family man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes the case of a married man with two children with an income of £1,000 a year, he is gaining less by the reduction in the tax rate proposed by the Minister this year&mdash;the reduction of 8d. in the standard rate&mdash;than he would have gained by an increase in the child allowance of £10, and £10 is a very minor increase in the rate of child allowance.  The reduction in the standard rate applies to all taxpayers, <Col N="857" /> to the person with unearned dividend income, to the large corporation, to the big property owner.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the answer to the Minister's query as to what is the right course of action to adopt is, to my mind, that the larger need is for relief for the individual, particularly for the wage and salary earner, those taxed in full for every 20/- in the £ of their taxable income who have no reliefs such as business people have.  That is a matter we shall touch upon in a later amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amount involved in this amendment would be very small.  It would also, I presume, probably have the effect of taking certain people at the bottom of the scale out of the tax bracket altogether. The Minister is aware that the cost of collection in relation to the taxpayer at the bottom of the scale is proportionately very much higher than that for those further up.  I shall not deny, of course, that there possibly is, on the other side of the scale, a social argument to be made.  But, regardless of all that, I am inclined to think that the real case to be made here is not entirely on the taxation end, but that it is good social policy <Col N="858" /> to try to get our workers living outside the centres of our cities.  Otherwise, the congestion and difficulty which will arise in obtaining sites in or near the centres of our cities will be very substantial.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is that there would not be the same pressure in certain respects on insisting that all new working class building schemes be very near the centre of our cities.  I am inclined to the view that we are going to meet very considerable difficulties in Dublin, and I think they say the same thing in Cork.  Only recently, we saw Cork Corporation having to apply to take further land into the corporation area from the county council.  Judging by the reaction of certain Deputies here, that seems to have provoked a rather bitter war between the corporation and the county council.  The trend should be the other way.</P>
      <P>One of the ways in which the Minister could influence the trend is by acceding to this amendment, if the cost is not going to be quite prohibitive and I do not think the cost should be as prohibitive as all that. Certainly, I am prepared to maintain that the cost will not be so prohibitive until the Minister gives me an official guess, apart from a personal guess, as to the cost.  So long as the Minister is merely guessing personally at the cost, his guess is, perhaps, as good as mine.  If he is prepared to give me an estimate of the cost, then I might have to review my views if that estimate shows the cost was too great as compared with the benefit involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was possible, and indeed probable, that it would be equal to a reduction of 6d. in the standard rate, particularly from the point of view of the amendment with regard to medical expenses and the amendment with regard to the definition of expenses.  That amendment might cost a huge sum.  Taking them together, it might amount to 6d. in the £.  I think it would be much better, if we have the finance at our disposal, to make a reduction of 6d. in the £ because one would then benefit the man who had to <Col N="859" /> meet medical expenses, the man who had to meet travelling expenses, the man who had to meet professional expenses, and so on.</P>
      <P>The income tax code must be fairly simple.  I admit it is not simple enough at the moment, but to make it more complicated would be a great mistake. If all the Schedule E taxpayers were to get a reduction of 10/- a week&mdash;this amendment would allow of a reduction of up to £1&mdash;that would amount to about £750,000.  It might be argued that they all want the benefit of this. Suppose only half benefited, that would be £375,000.  I am not resisting now on the grounds of cost but because it is a bad principle to adopt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it No. 5:</P>
      <P>Before section 12, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax, where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fees paid to an educational establishment for the instruction of his child, step-child or legally adopted child there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the expenses so incurred subject to a maximum deduction of £50 in respect of each child and provided that the child is not entitled in his own right to an income in excess of sixty pounds per year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide relief in respect of fees paid to an educational establishment subject to a maximum of £50 in respect of each child and provided the child has <Col N="861" /> not got an income of his or her own in excess of £60 per year.  The tax allowance in relation to a child now stands at £120 per year.  What is the purpose of the allowance?  What is the purpose of any personal allowance? Is there any theory governing allowances? Are they intended to cover certain specified outgoings or expenses? It is not laid down in our tax code, but I think it is accepted that the personal allowance and the allowance granted for a child are intended to provide minimum subsistence needs on the principle that there is no taxable income until subsistence has been provided for.  In scaling the figure of £120 as being the appropriate figure at which to provide a child allowance, is it the official mind of the Minister and his Department that this figure includes educational fees?  Is there any science to the calculation?  I suppose the answer is that there is not.  The time has come when we should consider fundamental principles in relation to all of these allowances.  Indeed, it might be a very good thing if the Minister would ask the Income Tax Commission now sitting to look into that matter.</P>
    <P>Ours is a country with very few natural sources of wealth.  Our primary source of wealth is the brainpower of our people.  Irish brains are second to none, if properly developed. There has been since the end of the war a growing demand for educational services in this country and throughout Europe.  There are now 2½ times as many children undergoing secondary education as there were 10 or 12 years ago.  In many forms and in a variety of ways the tax code provides encouragement for capital investment. There can be no more productive form of capital investment than investment in education.  In that connection it is interesting that recently in Germany economists have decided that the one really significant factor which contributed more than any other to the fantastic recovery of the German economy since the war has been the high standard of general education in that country.  Education is coming to be regarded as one of the prime factors in production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> It is appropriate that the tax code should recognise the fact that investment in education is as sound a capital investment as the purchase of a machine by a businessman or the re-equipment of industry by an industrialist. In this connection it is desirable that regard should be had to the fact that in this country little State aid is provided for education. We were discussing that matter on the Vote for the Department of Education last week.  There would appear to be very little prospect in the foreseeable future of prevailing on the Minister for Education to provide capital grants for the extension of educational services.  That, of course, is another day's work, but it is a factor which should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>School fees here are very high and have increased very considerably in recent years.  This amendment provides for a maximum deduction in respect of education of £50 per child, so that it is reasonable and restrictive. We are not asking or suggesting that the school fees paid to any of the snob schools should be recognised as deductible for income tax purposes, but merely that the minimum rates normally charged for reasonable educational services by secondary schools should be so charged.</P>
    <P>In connection with university fees, it is of course true that £120 is allowed under the tax code in respect of any child over 16 years of age who is continuing in full time education.  Particularly in regard to children attending at a university, it is necessary to ask ourselves is £120 per year a reasonable estimate of the expenses of a university student, including subsistence in addition to educational fees? Of course, it is not.  Even in U.C.D., the institution with which most of us would be familiar, fees have increased tremendously in the past 10 years.  For example, the annual fee for a course in the faculty of Arts and Commerce, which 12 years ago was £20, is now £50.  In addition, students' digs are now much more expensive than they used to be.  In some faculties in U.C.D. the academic fees alone amount to £75 and £80 a year and that <Col N="863" /> does not cover examination fees, hospital fees and other extras which arise in the case of medical students and students in other faculties also.</P>
    <P>Ours is a country which has a high and proud tradition in the matter of education.  Our people have always put a premium on education.  The average parent who is sending his son or daughter to a university usually makes great sacrifices to do so.  He is a person who is most deserving of sympathetic treatment and encouragement in all his endeavours and it is very desirable that encouragement should be provided to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister can rightly say that only a year ago he increased the child allowance from £100 to £120, and that it remained at £85 from 1954 to 1960. I do not know what the cost involved in this amendment would be.  If it seems exorbitant and if the Minister is in any way favourably disposed towards the principle which we are advocating, I would suggest to him that he should have a look at the allowances granted in Britain, which are on a sliding scale.  It is a graduated children's allowance, graduated to the age of the child and providing an increased rate of allowance for a child of 16 years who is engaged in full time educational pursuits.  I think they call it the three-tier allowance and it is a principle which we should reproduce here.  I suspect the Minister will repeat the argument which he made a few moments ago that he prefers to reduce the standard rate of tax.  That is a very good thing to do and I know it is easy to advocate reforms and to bring in amendments but we are doing this in a constructive spirit to try to indicate the lines upon which we believe the tax reform should be instituted.</P>
    <P>For my part, I believe that a major need in our tax code is to provide more relief for the individual and the family man.  As I said last night, and I have no hesitation about repeating it, I believe that for the moment industry has received enough by way of tax concessions and until an instalment of equity and justice is given to the individual <Col N="864" /> taxpayer, and, in particular to the family man, we should not consider giving any further major concessions to industrial taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These personal allowances are not, of course, geared to actual expenditure.  They are calculated to help a man to keep his wife and, if he has children, to keep them, but what the cost of keeping a wife or a child is was never measured exactly. They are merely a way of grading taxation on the family man and on the single man.  When a taxpayer gets these allowances, he pays his tax and is free to spend whatever he has on food, clothes, education or whatever it may be.  We cannot get down to every single little item and try to compensate him for the various things mentioned here.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were to be accepted, I do not think we could stop at this point.  It would be soon pointed out that a person was sending his boy to a boarding school and paying a fairly substantial fee and that the boy was boarded out.  Another might send his boy to a day school and he would have a very equitable claim to get two allowances for boarding the boy as well as paying the fees.  It would inevitably lead to a demand to have this £50 increased. I do not know what the cost would be but it would be fairly substantial. The allowance for a child was increased in 1960 from £100 to £120 and it was, of course, extended to take in apprenticed children in 1959.</P>
      <P>The Deputy gave the figures for England, where they are graduated and start at £100 for younger children and go up to £150 for children being educated.  It may be a good system. At the time I put the last proposal before the Government for increasing children allowances, I did put the alternative of leaving the young child at £100 and increasing the allowance for the other, which would have cost less but on the whole we thought it better to give the increase all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the older children may be costing more when they are going to schools where the fees are high, the younger child costs a good deal, too, and there is not much of a case for <Col N="865" /> making a distinction between them. It is fairer on the whole to have the same allowance all round.  I should also like to remind the Deputy that, in Britain, the children's allowances paid under social welfare are taxable but they are not taxable here, so that there is slight advantage here over the British system of children's allowances and therefore on the whole I am opposed to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's point of the difficulty of looking at every single item of expense which the taxpayer incurs, under Schedule D, the inspector of taxes looks at every single item of expense the taxpayer incurs, and insists on accounts being submitted so that he can scrutinise them.  In regard to children in boarding schools, there is no doubt that when a child goes to a boarding school there is a considerable saving in regard to some expenses so far as the basic children's allowance covers his subsistence in his own home and the necessity for that no longer arises.  If a parent is paying £200 a year to send his child to one of the snob schools which cater for the rich and the thick&mdash;and for whom I am not looking for any particular concession here&mdash;he is doing so by his own choice.  Such children would not necessarily obtain a better or superior education and he would have no grounds whatever for complaining about the allowance being restricted to £50 a year.</P>
      <P>I am interested to hear that a year ago the Minister did have a look at the British system of graduated children's allowances and I would ask him to have a second look at that principle and perhaps ask the Income Tax Commission to report on the desirability of extending that principle to this country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before section 12, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Rule 9 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E contained in the Income Tax Act, 1918 is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;reasonably to incur expenditure for the appropriate performance&rsquo; for &lsquo;to expend money, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had some considerable discussions about this matter on an earlier Finance Bill and the more I think of it, the more I feel that I am not absolutely happy about the position as it is at present.  When we were discussing this question then, we understood, accepted and appreciated the difference that exists in the phraseology in respect of the expenses allowable for persons assessed under Schedule E as compared with persons assessed under Schedule D.  That means, of course, that there is a different law for a person who is employed by another from the law for the person who employs himself in relation to a claim for expenses for purposes of income tax assessment.  The case made by the Minister at the time was that the person under Schedule D would determine much more for himself having regard to the balance of profit from his business and that the cost was primarily on him and, in addition, that when bearing that cost himself, it was proper that he should be the judge in a loose way of what expenses were necessary for the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to suggest at all that in relation to the assessment of these allowances the Revenue approach is niggardly. My experience is that it is not. Having regard, but only having regard, to the phraseology of the statute under which they are acting, that statute is restrictive beyond question.  Let me say at once that so far as the question of <Col N="867" /> the cost of this amendment is concerned, it would depend to a very large extent on the phraseology used.  For reasons which I shall give in a few minutes, I have deliberately chosen phraseology analogous to that which was recommended in the British Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income.  The final report of that Commission was published in June, 1955, I think.  The reference is CMD 9474.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the rights or wrongs of whether the existing rule is fair or unfair, it is an undoubted fact that there is a very strong feeling abroad that it is a most rigorous and unfairly restrictive rule.  I am sure the Minister has met that opinion in his experience as a Deputy, quite apart from his experience as Minister.  I am sure he has met it in relation to problems about which his constituents come to see him who have the necessity to incur expenses from the point of view of carrying out their job in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>We all know that employees, if they are to do their job properly, must on occasion take into account that if they happen to meet a customer of their firm outside the door of a licensed premises, they will be regarded as extremely mean if they do not suggest that he should come in and have a drink, even though it may not be necessary in regard to their actual job that they should make that suggestion. But it is, as we all know, standard practice and it would be regarded as mean and not in the least calculated to promote good relations, if expenses to that mild degree were not met from time to time.</P>
    <P>The existing wording of Rule 9 is so restrictive that it does not take into account the expenses employees have to incur in a variety of cases.  So far as I am aware&mdash;I speak subject to correction and I should be grateful to the Minister if he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;there is no statutory relaxation in any way of the Rule 9 provision as between this country and Great Britain.  So far as I am aware the Rule 9 provision operates in exactly the same way here as it <Col N="868" /> operates across the water.  I am not going to offer an opinion as to whether the gentlemen who operate the Rule here are more or less humane than their counterparts on the other side of the sea.  I have experience only of the ones here and I am not making the case at all that their interpretation is unfair.  I am making the case that the statute governs their interpretation in an unfair manner.</P>
    <P>When the Royal Commission to which I have referred were dealing with this matter on the other side, they made recommendations in a series of paragraphs, some of which are so apposite to the problem as I see it in Ireland that they are worth quoting.  Paragraph 129 reads:</P>
    <P>It seems to be the general impression that the Rule governing the deduction of expenses in respect of offices or employments, under Schedule E is too narrow.  It will be convenient to refer to it by its old name as Rule 9.  We had before us a great many representations complaining of the operation of the Rule in various respects, to which we gave our careful attention.  In making these criticisms our witnesses were doing no more than apply to their own particular circumstances the substance of a series of comments which have been made by Courts of law during the last thirty years.  There can have been no part of the income tax code which has been so regularly the subject of unfavourable notice.</P>
    <P>May I stress that last sentence?  For a Commission solemnly sitting in relation to the whole gamut of taxation on profits and income to say categorically that there can have been no part of the income tax code which has been so regularly the subject of unfavourable notice is a very striking commentary.</P>
    <P>They go on to say in paragraph 130:</P>
    <P>Rule 9 has been variously described as &ldquo;jealously restricted&rdquo;, &ldquo;strictly limited&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a very narrow and strict rule&rdquo;.  Its words are said to be &ldquo;notoriously narrow <Col N="869" /> in their application&rdquo; and &ldquo;notoriously rigid, narrow and resticted in their operation...stringent and exacting.&rdquo;  Nor has judicious sympathy been withheld from those to whom the &ldquo;very strict words laid down in Rule 9&rdquo; have been applied.</P>
    <P>One of the judges in question made these comments:</P>
    <P>This case raises a question of hardship.  I may go further and say the position really is unreasonable... A great number of these cases have produced, in my judgment, extremely hard results ... a ...rule ... which undoubtedly causes a considerable amount of hardship when applied to particular cases.</P>
    <P>That the &ldquo;position really is unreasonable&rdquo; is a commentary that frankly requires considerable explanation from the official point of view.</P>
    <P>There was another Committee in England in 1936 which considered the codification of certain income tax laws and their reference to this section was &ldquo;the extreme rigour of the existing law&rdquo;.  It is fair enough to say that even though these criticisms have been made all along the line, nothing was done about it at all.  I am not aware as to why exactly that was so but the difficulty that has arisen in the strictness of its application is that perhaps, in a very large industrial country such as England, there are so many facets that it would be impossible to alter it in the easy way in which it could be altered in a small country such as ours and particularly one which does not have the same type of industrial employment.</P>
    <P>There must clearly be some statutory principle, some statutory guide, by which to judge whether expenses are proper to be incurred or not.  It would, of course, be quite unreasonable to provide that the employee himself be the sole judge of what expenses he should or should not incur and by incurring them, claim deductions for income tax purposes. At the same time, I think that the obligement in the existing rule which lays down that the guiding <Col N="870" /> course to be steered is that the person concerned will be asked if he does not incur the expenses is far too rigorous.</P>
    <P>An employee's duty can be performed in two ways&mdash;willingly or grudgingly.  This rule is based entirely in its phraseology on the old conception that an employee does his work only grudgingly and that it is only the very bare minima he is bound to do under pain of dismissal he will do. I do not think that is a fair and just presentation at all of the approach of the vast majority of employees at present.</P>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House by going over all the arguments put forward in that Commission's report but they consider, first of all, whether the alternative solution was to have exactly the same rule for Schedule D as for Schedule E.  Having rejected that, they then, in paragraph 140, came to the conclusion that the best solution was to recommend the rewording of Rule 9 on less restricted lines than at present.  The wording they suggested would allow the deduction of &ldquo;all expenses reasonably incurred for the appropriate performance of the duties of the office or employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have just merely turned that around here because so far as our phraseology is concerned, the verbs are at the beginning rather than at the end. We believe that our suggestion would give a more liberal form of allowance to employees to ensure that the employee who was genuinely making an effort in certain respects to assist his employer, quite apart from making an effort to improve himself, would be, in consequence, enabled to claim.</P>
    <P>It is not, for example, laid down in the contract of employment of an assistant solicitor that he will keep himself abreast of the law in respect of the particular side which he is carrying on for his employer but everybody appreciates and understands that you cannot do a job like that, unless you do make an effort to keep abreast of the law in that respect, but it is not necessary to incur expenses in regard to it, although it certainly is desirable and certainly is designed to increase efficiency, but yet, as I understand the situation, expenditure incurred for that <Col N="871" /> purpose, because it is not actual expenditure that must be incurred under pain of dismissal, is not allowable as the law stands at present.</P>
    <P>One could go through the various facets of our employees and produce a great many examples but I do not think there is any necessity to do so. I think everybody who is aware of the problem knows all the cases that have been met and realises that in relation to those cases, there is undoubtedly something that is not quite fair in the rigidity of the existing statute.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister may say that on the phraseology here, the cost would be very large.  I do not think so. If it were very large it is one that could be met by a relaxation of the existing rule in the direction we have in mind. If we could not get the full amount of it, it certainly is a case that needs to be considered away and apart from any question of the standard rate to which the Minister refers.  It is a case I have never heard fully argued out from the point of view of adhering to the existing rule which is certainly not at all in accord with modern times and not in accord with the spirit of willingness and anxiety to further the interests of the employer which is, thank goodness, abroad in the type of person to whom such a rule refers.  If it were not abroad we would have a poor outlook as a nation.  I think the Minister should lend his quota to acceptance and understanding and appreciation of that spirit that is abroad at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to Rule 9 of the rules applicable to Schedule E in the Income Tax Act of 1918&mdash;a British Act, of course.  It is in fact intact in the 1918 Act from the earlier Income Tax Act of 1853.  I am not sure if it goes back any earlier than 1853; it may very well do so.  But I know for a fact that its present wording in our tax code is exactly as it was laid down in the Income Tax Act, 1953.  Even its very verbiage is hopelessly old fashioned and archaic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Rule which provides for, amongst other things, the keeping and maintaining of a horse to enable an employee to perform his duties, as if <Col N="872" /> it were one of the major expenses which he had to incur.  It is a very good example of that type of archaic provision which is crying out for reform in this country.</P>
    <P>These rules which determine what expenses may be allowed against receipts for determining taxable income are of fundamental importance.  They are important because they affect the yield of revenue.  They are important in the relative sense in so far as equity demands that taxpayers with comparable incomes should receive comparable treatment for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>It is an old maxim that equity is a stranger to income tax.  I do not know who first said that but I suggest it is a maxim which we should repudiate entirely in this country.  There is a very grave social and moral obligation upon us to endeavour to make our tax code as equitable as we can.  That obligation may not have been a very strong one in years gone by.  Even up to 15 or 20 years ago very few people paid income tax.  There was no crying need for reform of these archaic provisions in times gone by because so very few people were affected.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think this Rule is defective right from the days it was first laid down.  In Britain, certain disquiet was expressed about it.  It is a very significant fact in regard to much of the clamour about income tax in Britain in its early days that the critics were quietened by the assurance that income tax was only a temporary tax which, of course, has long ceased to be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has quoted some of the strictures passed on this Rule by learned judges in court.  As he said, no section of the income tax code has been more strongly criticised. It has actually been described as unreasonable and unjust.  It has been held that it raised questions of hardship and inequity.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say that notwithstanding the recommendations of the Royal Commission in Britain in 1955, the British Chancellor has not effected the reform which the Royal Commission recommended.  I hold that that is not at all a valid argument in this <Col N="873" /> country.  I do not know why the British Chancellor has not accepted his Commission's recommendations and I do not care.  The simple fact of the matter is that in this country there is a far graver obligation upon us to do justice to the Schedule E taxpayer, to the wage-earner and the salary-earner than there is in Britain.  We are relying on the wage-earner and the salary-earner to a far greater extent, relatively speaking, than the British Chancellor for tax revenue.  Eighty per cent. of our taxpayers are wage-earners and salary-earners.  Since the introduction of P.A.Y.E., their number is increasing considerably.</P>
    <P>I think it should be enough to point out to the Minister what the Royal Commission has said about this Rule, to point out to him the need for applying that recommendation to Irish conditions.  It should not be necessary either for Deputy Sweetman or myself to go in to very much detail in advocating this cause.  It is rather a technical matter.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the Minister, if he has not already done so, to read what the Royal Commission have to say about it.  He should make inquiries about cases of inequity which have arisen in this country.  It is completely unreal to draw a distinction, as this Rule does, between those expenses which an employee is obliged to incur in the physical performance of his duties &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo;&mdash;and what it is desirable he should be able to do in order to perform his duties.  The interpretation placed by the courts on this Rule is an extremely rigid and narrow one, even allowing for the fact that the Rule itself is a narrow one.  The Rule draws a very unreal distinction between the type of expenditure which one is obliged to incur and the type of expenditure which it is desirable one should incur in order to be able to carry out the duties of one's office or employment.</P>
    <P>The Rule specifies that those expenses which one is obliged to incur wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of one's duties are the only expenses which may be deducted from the emoluments of a wage earner or a salary earner.  It is a <Col N="874" /> fact that expenses may be necessary to one in the performance of one's duties, without being exclusively incurred for the performance of those duties.  They may be exclusively incurred in the performance but not wholly referable to the performance of those duties.</P>
    <P>The contrast between the treatment meted out in this respect to the wage earner and salary earner under Schedule E and that given to the business person under Schedule D, is particularly marked.  The Rule under Schedule D is more liberal.  I am not suggesting that it would be a good thing to liberalise the Schedule E Rule to the same extent as the Schedule D Rule, and our amendment does not open the door to fantastic and outlandish expenses.  Our amendment is a very conservative one.  It is the amendment recommended by the Royal Commission.  The Royal Commission, before deciding on that wording, had considered various other means of catering for this need and had rejected them.  It does not mean, for example, that the employers' individual choice is the test of an allowable expense.  Under our amendment, the revenue authorities would have the protection, which they have not got under Schedule D, of the condition that the expense must be reasonably directed to its purpose.</P>
    <P>One could provide examples of the type of expense which is disallowed under the existing Rule and which is allowed under Schedule D to a person in comparable employment.  The best example I can give is that of a professional person employed, say, as an architect or an engineer in the Board of Works who cannot even claim as an allowable expense his subscription to his professional association, notwithstanding the fact that if he ceases to pay that professional subscription, he will be struck off the professional register and will cease to be a professional man.  However, we are providing specifically for that aspect in amendment No. 7.</P>
    <P>It was slightly incorrect for Deputy Sweetman to say that the British Chancellor has done nothing at all about reform in this respect.  He at <Col N="875" /> least brought in a provision allowing for the expense of professional subscriptions for professional persons. That is in Section 16 of the British Act, 1958.  There is an increasing tendency for professional people in this country to go into employment. This is an age of managerial revolution and there is developing a new managerial class of professional persons who are in fact employees.  It is futile to argue that such persons are not compelled to keep at the peak of their profession in the academic sense, that there is no need for them to expend moneys on professional journals, books, instruments and so on.  They are a class of persons who are particularly deserving of consideration.</P>
    <P>The kernel of our case here is that there is a very grave need to provide equity for wage and salary earners in our tax code, equity which is at present denied to them.  The contrast in many ways between the taxation under Schedule D and that under Schedule E is very marked.  Many wage earners and salary earners labour under a sense of grievance.  They feel it is inequitable that their employers should be compelled to act as taxpayers, because they have no way out of the tax net as have some business people.  We may as well face up to that.  The employee cannot resort to the legal avoidance or evasion of tax.  Many persons taxed under P.A.Y.E. have this sense of grievance. They believe, rightly or wrongly&mdash;and I am not expressing an opinion on that &mdash;that other sections of the community pay less tax on comparable incomes.  I would urge the Minister to discredit this old maxim that equity is a stranger to income tax and should resolve to provide equitable treatment for all our taxpayers, but in particular for those who are taxed under Schedule E.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everyone agrees there is justification for a difference in treating expenses under Schedule D and Schedule E.  The Schedule D taxpayer must go out and look for business and try to build up profits for himself.  If he increases expenses, it is for the purpose of earning more or making bigger <Col N="876" /> profits and the case is therefore fairly clear that expenses should be allowed.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Schedule E taxpayer, he is engaged to perform duties for somebody else.  His field of activities is very well defined and very limited and he will get his remuneration so long as he performs his duties.  It is no part of his duty to expand the business he is working in by spending money for that purpose.  Therefore, on general principle, it must be admitted the only expenses he should be allowed would be those he must incur in order to keep his job.  On that basis, the definition appears to be all right, &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily.&rdquo;  If a Schedule E taxpayer claims expenses not wholly expended on his job, nobody would argue he should get the whole lot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same would apply to &ldquo;exclusively.&rdquo;  The only dispute concerns &ldquo;necessarily.&rdquo;  What other word could we get?  Deputy Byrne pointed out that these words are there since 1833.  It is a long time, of course.  His argument is that they are so long there that they should be changed.  But I think the argument could be made the other way, too. They are so long there that it is fairly evident no good substitute could be found for them after 110 years.  Even though the Royal Commission recommended a change, it is fairly evident that the British Government and the Revenue Commissioners have been unable to frame alternative words to meet the case.  That is why they have done nothing about this Report from the Royal Commission.</P>
      <P>Since the Royal Commission's Report has been quoted in favour of making this change, perhaps I might quote an opposing view.  There was a recommendation of dissent to the Final Report by Mr. G. Woodcock, now Sir George Woodcock, Secretary of the T.U.C., Mr. H.L. Bullock and Mr. N. Kaldor.  The words they used are&mdash;they were very blunt&mdash;that Rule 9 of Schedule E was &ldquo;a powerful safeguard of good adminstration.&rdquo; That was their summing up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give it to the Deputy.  This case was raised by Deputy Sweetman last year.  We argued the case for some time and I think I said, as I am saying now, that this was a matter which should be considered by the Commission on Income Taxation, because they are considering this matter of allowances of various kinds.  Deputy Sweetman was satisfied with that.  My Private Secretary wrote afterwards to the Commission, conveying the Official Report, I think, but at least what was said on that occasion.  Although I cannot say definitely, I presume they will report on this matter.  But they may find it difficult, as it has been found difficult over the years, to provide alternative wording for these words that have been there for over a century.</P>
      <P>I do not claim to know very much about the technical side of income tax, but, personally, I have never heard a very serious complaint with regard to the expenses for a Schedule E taxpayer. From time to time a complaint is heard, but it is never very serious. I have heard much more serious complaints in respect of expenses not being allowed, say, for the upkeep of a younger brother or sister.  That appeared to me to be rather hard on the person concerned because it was a big matter and one which, from the human point of view the taxpayer could not avoid.  That does not say, however, we should devote all our time to cases of that kind and not consider the particular cases made.  I think the whole difficulty is to find the alternative words.  That is why I would appeal again to the Deputies to await the report of the Income Tax Commission to see whether or not they, in their wisdom, suggest words that would be acceptable.  Deputy Sweetman asked me for the page of the Royal Commission Report.  It is page 393.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister took one phrase out of the paragraph.  I shall quote the whole paragraph.  It says:</P>
      <P>In our view if the Schedule E expenses rule were relaxed the same problems which now beset Schedule D assessment would be reproduced in the case of Schedule E&mdash;new avenues would be opened for tax avoidance and for disputes between the Revenue and the taxpayer&mdash;with little, if any, net gain in equity, as between one Schedule E taxpayer and another.  We do not support therefore the change in wording of the Schedule E expenses rule recommended by the Majority, a change which in our opinion does not go nearly far enough to remove the difference between the two conceptions of income...</P>
      <P>That is somewhat different from the portion the Minister quoted.  My recollection of the Minority Report was that the alteration would not be sufficient on its own.  It was because it was not sufficient on its own that it was going to create difficulty in administration. I do not think it is fair for the Minister to ignore that and to quote these three learned gentlemen.  Mr. Kaldor's forte was tax on expenditure. While it was a wonderful theoretical scheme, it would require 2,500,00 people to administer it and collect the tax from the other 500,000 who would be left in the country.  The Minority Report does not come down quite so flat-footedly as the Minister seems to think.</P>

It went on to recommend a lower rate of tax for the wage-earner and the salary earner because of this difference in treatment. If the Minister opened that particular door, I think he would have cause to regret his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much a question of putting strain on the Parliamentary <Col N="890" /> session.  There is also the question of the drafting of these proposals and that is a consideration to which we must have due regard in the present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Committee which has devoted itself diligently and assiduously to the discharge of the task assigned to it has been led to believe that, if it could get through a second report to the Minister, legislation based on that second report would be introduced before the Dáil dissolved and, having regard to the fact that the proposed legislation is agreed and that there will be no contention about it and that all Stages of a Bill could go through this House in 24 hours, would the Minister not reconsider the matter at least so as to enable the agreed recommendations to be implemented by legislation ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully sympathise with the views expressed by the Deputies but the House will appreciate that these matters must come through the normal channels.  Despite the fact that they may have been agreed by the Joint Committee, it does not follow that they will be accepted by the House.  In fact, I think somebody in the Opposition benches stipulated, when this Committee was being set up, that what was agreed might not be acceptable to the House.  I have no way of knowing that what has been agreed by a Committee of the House will be accepted <i>in toto</i> by the House. In addition, there is the difficulty of getting all the various legislation drafted and before this House and through this House during this session. The drafting is a problem and a difficulty over which I have no direct control. It would have been my hope that the course advocated now by the Deputies in the opposite benches could have and would have been followed. However, in so far as this electoral law is concerned, I have already expressed my appreciation of the Committee's efforts and so far as putting its recommendations into operation and bringing them before the House is concerned, I have done and will continue to do everything possible to have them <Col N="891" /> before the House as soon as possible but I cannot give any undertaking.</P>

It is not a question of reconsidering my decision.  It is a question of having regard to the facts of the situation as I have outlined them, both in regard to the business of the House during this session and also, and very important, the work in the hands of the Drafting Office, which to a large degree decides the pace and the amount of work which we can put before this House.

Now the Committee is told for the first time that it is not likely to see its second report implemented, which means that if we have the normal election of a four or five-year Parliament following this Dáil, these recommendations will have no value whatever until four or five years elapse.  Surely the Minister at this stage should make an effort at least to express in a tangible way his appreciation of the work of the Committee by giving effect to its recommendations, which are all agreed recommendations?</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before section 12, but in Part 1, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section there may be deducted from the emoluments of any office or employment to be assessed to tax, if defrayed out of those emoluments, any annual subscription or membership fee paid to a body of persons approved for the purposes of this section by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Revenue Commissioners shall, on the application of the body, approve for the purposes of this section any body of persons, not of a mainly local character, whose activities are carried on otherwise than for profit and are solely or mainly directed to all or any of the following objects, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the advancement or spreading of knowledge (whether generally or among persons belonging to the same or similar professions);</P>
      <P>(b)  the maintenance or improvement of standards of conduct and competence among the members of any profession;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the indemnification or protection of members of any profession against claims in <Col N="897" /> respect of liabilities incurred by them in the exercise of their profession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment springs from the previous one.  It endeavours to give effect to the principle of the previous amendment in a very minor respect. The purpose of the amendment is to permit the taxpayer engaged in business, who is a professional person, to charge up against his emoluments for tax purposes any subscription which he pays to a professional association, or body, of which he is a member.  As I said on the last amendment, it is extraordinary that a young engineer or an architect say, who is a member of the Board of Works, or any other member of the considerable community of professional people engaged in employment, cannot claim as an allowable expense for tax purposes the subscription which he pays to a professional association, non-payment of which will mean that he will be struck off the professional register with the result that he will no longer be able to practise his profession.  It springs from the rigid nature of Rule 9 about which we were speaking.  This is the Rule so strongly condemned by judicial authorities and by the Royal Commission.</P>
    <P>In relation to the previous amendment, the Minister was able to say that the British Chancellor had not acted upon the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Rule 9.  He cannot say the same in relation to this amendment.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that the wording of the amendment is in fact borrowed from the British Finance, Act, 1958.  I make no apologies for borrowing a section like this from the British precedent, because the Minister himself does it every year.  Last year, we had an amendment to our Finance Bill which ran to two of these sheets and was taken in full from the British precedent.</P>
    <P>In a broad sense, it is undesirable that we should be so much in the hands of the British in relation to these matters. It indicates that we fail to strike out on our own and adapt the tax code to our own purposes but in another sense, it is inevitable and in the very <Col N="898" /> nature of things that so long as we continue to operate under the British Income Tax Act, 1918, we will have to remedy whatever defects come to light and are rectified by the British Chancellor.</P>
    <P>Because of the rigid nature of Rule 9, the technical argument has been that an employed person paying a subscription to his professional association does not incur that expense in the performance of the duties of his office, which is absurd and quite unrealistic. There is a growing number of professional persons in employment, generally speaking, the class of person for whom it is desirable to provide every possible encouragement and independence; the class of person who stands on his own two feet and does not look to the State for this or that; the class of person who is, in fact, the backbone of the community.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not accept the previous amendment, but I will concede at least that he was able to say that notwithstanding the report of the Royal Commission, the British Chancellor took no action in that matter.  He cannot say that on this amendment, which is simple and straightforward.  It does not provide for allowance for tax purposes of membership fees or subscriptions paid to any body of persons who may be self-appointed as a professional association. It restricts the allowance to a body of persons approved by the Revenue Commissioners as complying with certain conservative provisions laid down.  In subsection (2), it is restricted to a body of persons whose activities are carried on otherwise than for profit, for the purpose of the advancement or spreading of knowledge and the maintenance or improvement of standards of professional competence and behaviour.</P>
    <P>There can be only about 20 or 25 such bodies in this country.  I think I read somewhere that, in Britain, after this provision was introduced, 3,000 bodies came to light which claimed this concession for their members. There is no possibility of such a number of applications in this country. There is, perhaps, one slight defect in <Col N="899" /> the amendment in that it does not lay down any machinery for appeal against a decision of the Revenue Commissioners, but, on that score, I feel confident that the general provisions of the Income Tax Act will apply, and an appeal from a decision of the Revenue Commissioners in this matter would lie, in the first instance, to the Special Commissioner for Income Tax, and the usual provisions of a case stated and an application to the courts would be held to apply.</P>
    <P>The amendment is very reasonable and very conservative and I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the case that is not ruled out under Section 20 because it was shown that the taxpayer is obliged to be a member of the body in order to obtain and retain his employment.  In that case, the expense, whatever it might be, is allowed in present circumstances.  The whole thing depends on what is necessary and not necessary.  The Deputy says that this section was taken broadly from Section 16 of the British Finance Act, 1958, but on comparing the amendment with the Act referred to, I find that he has left out two very important provisos in the British Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, if the Deputy is going to follow the British Act, he should at least let us know why he does not follow it completely and why he thought it wise to leave out these provisos.  The first proviso in the British Act is that if the activities of a body are to a significant extent directed to objects other than those mentioned, the Commissioners may make an apportionment.  I want to draw attention to the time and labour that would be spent by officials of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with that proviso.  It then goes on to deal with another point and says that a fee shall not be deducted, unless the subscription is paid to a body whose activities, so far as they are directed to the objects mentioned, are relevant to the office or employment.  Again, that is a very involved proviso which would <Col N="900" /> give a great deal of trouble to the officials concerned.</P>
    <P>I might mention that this amendment, as drafted, probably would not cost a great deal of money.  I think, though, that the cost of administration would be a great deal more, and in any proposal put before this House for the spending of money, or the giving of money for relief, we should all like to see that at least the cost of that expenditure is a small proportion of either the money taken in or given out.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that many provisions brought in here are taken from British Acts.  I do not think we should deny ourselves the advantage of any clause in a British Act if we think it is needed here but, on the other hand, we should not follow them blindly.  I think in this case they were pursuing a course that was not by any means a good course.  I quite agree that the idea behind the proposal is a praiseworthy one and I should like very much to give it further consideration but the big difficulty I see is the difficulty with regard to administration. It is only a difficulty with regard to administration but it is a really big difficulty in this case.</P>
    <P>I mentioned several times here already on Committee Stage that the Commission on Income Tax are considering this whole question of expenses. If they consider this particular one, I can only hope that they will give us a workable scheme to cover it.  If they do, then I have no doubt at all it will be adopted.  If they do not report, I should be inclined to ask the Revenue Commissioners to consider the matter again to see if they can give us a more workable scheme than the British one. I think the British scheme is very cumbersome and gives rise to a great deal of queries, questions and disagreements in administration.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is possible to get a simple scheme.  I should like to get a scheme which is more simple than the one the British have worked out.  It may look as if I am trying to shelve a lot of the amendments by asking that we wait for the Commission to report.  As the Commission are about <Col N="901" /> to report on all this question of allowances, I think it is a fair request enough to make.  They may give us something we can adopt.  I think we should wait until we hear from them on this matter.</P>

Does the Minister know whether or not there is a concession in regard to trade union subscriptions paid by members of a trade union ?  Also, would this amendment, if adopted, or some other amendment, include a concession in respect of trade union subscriptions ?

      <P>The proposed concession is confined to bodies of a purely national character and it might be possible that some of the local type trade unions would be restricted on that account.  For my own part, I would certainly consider it proper that trade unions should be included in the scope of the concession, particularly because wage earners and salary earners are so harshly treated by the provisions of our tax code.  All trade unionists are either wage earners or salary earners.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, a fact that this amendment does not follow Section 16 of the British Finance Act of 1958 right through to the end.  The apportionment of a professional subscription in respect of that portion of it which may not be applicable to the spreading of knowledge is, I suggest, a very pedantic and niggardly approach to this matter.  It is a sort of conservative approach to reform which I would appeal to the Minister to discard.</P>
      <P>Throughout this discussion, the Minister stated that if an employee were obliged to pay a professional subscription to retain his employment, such subscription was allowable against Schedule E, but in this respect we are up against the very rigid interpretation placed on Rule 9.  I could advise the Minister on many cases of professional persons in employment whose subscription to their professional association is not allowable.  In so far as it may be allowed in the ordinary case by concession, I think it is right to say that the law of the land should not be administered on a concessionary basis, where that is avoidable.  In general terms, it is not desirable that the law should be departed from.  It is up to us in this House to lay down what concessions shall be granted and face up to the necessity of revising our tax codes to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers that this proposal would be expensive to administer, there is an alternative.  It would be very easy, indeed, to list specifically the 12 or 15 principal professional associations whose members <Col N="903" /> are employed in this country.  It would be very easy to bring in a new section saying that subscriptions paid to the following bodies shall be allowed for income tax purposes :&mdash; the Medical Association, the Incorporated Law Society, Cumann na nInnealtoiri and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. There are no more than 12 or 15 such bodies in all.  However, in so far as the Minister has indicated a certain limited measure of approval of the principle, perhaps something has been achieved by causing him to think on new lines in relation to the matters we discussed in this debate.  I think that is a good day's work.  Last night, I said that a wind of change should blow through the offices of all concerned with taxation in this country.</P>

      <P>The amendment deals with the advancement of knowledge.  I would take it therefore that if a trade union such as the printers' trade union had a manual giving information, it would be exempted.  I do not know how sub-paragraph (b) of subsection (2) applies &mdash; the maintenance or improvement of standards of conduct and competence among the members of any profession.  Sub-paragraph (c) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the indemnification or protection of members of any profession against claims in respect of liabilities incurred by them in the exercise of their profession.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was referred to in the Medical Association where they have a medical protection society.  You pay a subscription and if you make a mistake in treating a patient, they will defend you.  That would be included in this amendment.  Therefore, if trade unions came in, I do not see under this amendment anything that would be included except the subscription to a trade manual or a trade journal.</P>

      <P>Section 12 is the section which implements that part of the Budget statement in which the Minister announced his intention to increase the tax on tobacco and cigarettes to bring in an extra £930,000 this year.  The effect of the Minister's increase in duty on tobacco means he will take this year out of the pockets of tobacco smokers, on the assumption that consumption is more or less the same as last year, £4 million more than was taken from them before he acceded to office.</P>
      <P>Four million pounds is a pretty substantial sum.  It arises because of the various increases which the Minister has imposed in Budget after Budget on tobacco.  One is inclined to wonder sometimes whether the whole basis on which the Minister has been framing Budgets, one after the other, of putting everything on tobacco, is not overbalancing the whole picture.  The proportion of our total revenue now accruing from tobacco is such that if anything were to happen to that source of revenue, we would be in the position of having put all our eggs, or virtually all our eggs, in one basket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this section because the Minister and his Party, in the 1957 general election campaign, made it <Col N="905" /> clear they felt taxes were then too high.  This is the final instalment of successive increases in tobacco tax <Col N="906" /> imposed by the Minister since he acceded to office.</P>

      <P>On one occasion, I tried to have my licence back-dated because I found it was very much out of date. I went into the Tax Office, produced the old licence and pointed out it was five months out of date.  In an outburst of conscience, I asked that the new licence should be dated back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the offensive remark made to me by the official &mdash; that I was trying to get a licence dated back to avoid proceedings. I pointed out to him that such a procedure was impossible because the licence itself is stamped with the date of issue.  He accused me of trying to dodge legal proceedings by producing a licence dated back.  I pointed out to him I could not defend any proceedings on that basis because it would be perfectly clear on the face of the licence that, although it was dated back, it had been issued five months after the date of commencement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite possible to collect very much more revenue if some incentive were given to people to produce their old licence and have the new licence dated to run from the expiration of the original, even if a small cash incentive were given for so doing. Therefore, people coming for a driving licence the first time would pay a few <Col N="909" /> shillings extra.  If they could produce their old licence, however, they would get some cash discount, but the licence would be dated back.  I am convinced that the number of people frequently driving with outdated driving licences is very considerable and there is a loss of revenue.  It is only on a Bill like the Finance Bill that that matter can be dealt with.  It is a complicated matter. I am sorry I did not put down some amendment to give the Minister some advance warning, but I think it is something which is worth exploring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any consideration given to the alternative to refunds, that is to say, if a licence were taken out for four years, that it could be taken out at the price for three years with no refund?  That would mean, I think, more or less no change from the point of view of revenue, but certainly would cut out the administrative costs in respect of refunds.  Unless you give an inducement for the longer period or unless you have refunds, clearly you will not get people to take a licence out for a longer period.</P>
      <P>I should have thought a cash inducement, by paying a slightly lesser fee for a period of years and that once it was taken out for that period, it was gone, would have been an even better inducement and would have cut down administrative costs by having the licence taken out in one year for a period of three or four years.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that also?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 17, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Government may, as respects all goods which are shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be of a kind to which the rates of duties of customs referred to in section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, applied at any time and to which those rates have ceased, whether before <Col N="910" /> or after the passing of this Act, to apply, authorise the Revenue Commissioners to allow the importation thereof upon payment of the duties of customs chargeable thereon at the rates which would be applicable if the rates referred to in the said section 8 applied to goods of that kind.</P>
    <P>(2)  An authorisation under this section may be revoked or amended by the Government and may relate to all goods of the kind referred to in subsection (1) of this section or to any class or classes thereof defined in such manner and by reference to such matters as the Government think fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Act passed in 1919, where preferences known as Imperial preferences were given, it was laid down that where a country left the Commonwealth, or what it was called at that time, the preferences ceased.  That law still stands as far as we are concerned. Where we have preferences with a member of the Commonwealth and that member leaves the Commonwealth, the duties ordinarily go up.  I think it is wrong that we should have that system here; in other words, that we should penalise a member for leaving the Commonwealth.  Therefore, this amendment is brought in so that the Government can authorise the Revenue Commissioners to continue the preferences as they were, but the Government can change them at any time, if they so see fit.</P>

      <P>As I said on the last occasion, this is the final chapter in the dishonest propaganda of Fianna Fáil in 1957 in relation to the Special Import Levies.  Anybody who had anything to do with shopkeepers in the city of Dublin knows very well that every shopkeeper was canvassed by Fianna Fáil, on the basis that, if they got in, they were going to repeal the levies.  Some of them have been honest enough to come to me and tell me they were told to go out and canvass with those instructions.  Deputy Booth suggested on Second Reading that I never said this before.  I am sorry for the offensive insult he has given me of never having read any of my speeches in the past four years.  I have said it every year on every Budget debate over the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his reply made his case that the Special Import Levies amounted to £4,000,000 and that he had repealed the vast majority of them. What are the facts?  They are that they ceased to call them Special Import Levies and proceeded to call them permanent duties.  For the year ending <Col N="912" /> 31st March last, the Minister collected by the duties he had put on&mdash; to call a rose by another name&mdash; £1,916,000 and in addition to that, collected just over £1,000,000 in Special Import Levies.  That means, in effect, that out of £4,000,000 in Special Import Levies to meet a temporary situation, £3,000,000 are still being collected by him, notwithstanding his promises on that occasion.  It was made clear, beyond question, that the Special Import Levies were imposed for the temporary purpose of righting the balance of payments.  They should have been relaxed and relieved as the balance of payments position improved. Instead of that, this Government have carried them into permanent taxation in such a way that it is doubtful if anybody will ever in the future be able to unscramble the egg.</P>

      <P>This section confirms two Orders made&mdash;one the Imposition of Duties (No. 104) (Miscellaneous Customs) Order and the other the Imposition of Duties (No. 105) (Motor Vehicles) Order.  Under the procedure for dealing with orders of this kind it is not possible to amend and the only course open is to put down a note to oppose the section.</P>
      <P>These two Orders confirm the levies as permanent duties.  In addition, they increase the levy from 15 per cent. to 37½ per cent. in respect of a variety of motor vehicle and motor cycle parts.  It does not matter from the point of view of the purchaser of these particular parts whether it is described as a levy or a duty.  What matters is the amount that has to be paid.  The Minister in the course of his Budget statement said that this change was designed to simplify the existing rate of levy by consolidating it in the one Order.  In so far as it goes, that might be reasonable enough but the position which will inevitably arise is that, instead of these parts being liable to a levy or duty of 15 per cent., a great variety of them will be liable to a duty of 37½ per cent., a rise of 22½ per cent. These parts are used in the repair of motor cars, motor cycles, scooters and mopeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> An important element in all this is the fact that, if these parts are brought in unassembled, they are imported at a lower rate of duty. One of the advantages of that is that employment is provided in the assembling of these parts, in the first instance, and in repair work subsequently. It is unnecessary at this stage of development in motor vehicles to stress the large numbers employed in that industry and the indirect employment given in garages, workshops, and so on, in repair work. I have here a list of 25 items.  To give an example of the comprehensive nature of the articles included in these Orders, they range from brake linings for motor cars and commercial vehicles to engine valves, silencer boxes, clutch linings, valve springs, and a whole lot of small items like trafficator arms, kingpins, bushes and different articles used in the assembly and repair of motor vehicles.  These Orders will undoubtedly increase the cost of motor vehicle repairs.</P>
    <P>In recent years motor users have had to bear a great number of additional burdens.  They have been obliged to meet higher costs for petrol, higher costs for oil and, this year, a substantial increase in insurance.  Now, on top of that, the changes made in these two Orders will involve not merely the simplification which was mentioned, and the continuation of certain duties at the existing rate, but also an increase in respect of a variety of parts amounting to 22½ per cent.  That will, in turn, involve a very substantial increase in the cost of repairs and is bound to put an added burden on motor users. It will probably ultimately have an effect on the cost of commodities because commercial vehicles used in the distribution of goods will fall for repair and therefore for liability for these increased costs.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to draft an amendment to the Orders concerned but, in view of the procedure laid down, it is not possible to amend specified parts of an Order.  The only method open was to oppose the section.  If it were possible to amend an Order by deleting the items concerned, I <Col N="914" /> would have framed an amendment to cover only those items affected by this change.  On Report, I believe the Minister should consider introducing an amended series of Orders to allow these parts, particularly unassembled parts, because that touches the vital question of employment in the repair industry as well as in the assembling of them originally, to remain at the existing level of 15 per cent. instead of increasing that level by 22½ per cent. to 37½ per cent.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to an aspect of this matter to which I have endeavoured to draw attention on two occasions by means of Parliamentary Question.  When anybody wants a spare part he wants that part cleared in the Customs as quickly as possible.  I have twice asked the Minister to look into the expensive and prolonged delays which occur in clearing goods through the Customs.  I have had innumerable complaints from business people, manufacturers of machinery, those concerned in the sale and repair of motor cars and farm machinery, of repeated frustrating delays.  The Minister has replied on both occasions that he does not believe there are any delays in the Customs and asked me to give him specific instances.  That is a naïve sort of reply. Invariably, if one offers to make representations, one is asked not to use the person's name.  Those who import want to get their stuff cleared and people fear that, if names are given, there will be subsequent repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the other day I was approached because of an extensive delay in regard to vital machinery required for agricultural purposes.  Matters do not wait in agriculture.  One is always anxiously scanning the sky overhead in the hay-making season and harvest time.  I suggested that, in making representations, I should name the firm concerned. The reply I got was a request to get the machinery freed but not to disclose the identity of the complainant because, if I did so, he would get the machinery this time but he would wait longer the next time.  I put it to the Minister that there are continuous, prolonged, frustrating delays in the <Col N="915" /> clearance of machinery through our Customs.  That is not confined to the port of Dublin; it is universal.  My view, which I think is a reasonable view, is that the customs officials are the servants of the public and ought to endeavour to clear these goods as quickly as possible and give the necessary service to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is scooping quite a healthy revenue on this.  He is getting a revenue which, as Deputy Sweetman said, many people did not expect he would get or that they would have to pay.  If the Government impose duties on the people they ought to see that the people have not to face these hardships and troubles.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should place observers on the ports, not only in Dublin but on all ports, without anybody being aware of the fact, to take due notice of the stuff that comes in and as to whether there are delays or not.  The Minister will find that what I say is perfectly correct.  The people who have made representations to me are not of any particular political affiliation.  The Minister will find that there are delays. Whether they are due to inefficiency or whether it is intentional on the part of the people concerned, I do not know but I would ask the Minister to give the matter his attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the consolidation of these duties on motor cars, we approached the matter with three main objects in mind.  One was to consolidate the duty on the body and chassis coming in because I am told that, in modern cars, it is very difficult to segregate what belongs to the body and what belongs to the chassis in certain cases.  The rate was 20 per cent. on the body and 25 per cent. on the chassis, or the other way round.  Anyway, it is 20 per cent. all round now. The second aim was to eliminate, as far as protective policy would allow, the range of duties applicable to spare parts and to try to get a flat rate there again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many instances, I agree with Deputy Cosgrave, where the duty on parts has gone up.  There are instances also where it has gone down. <Col N="916" /> I cannot say definitely that the number and the value of the parts the duty on which is going down would equal the number and value of the parts the duty on which is going up.  Probably, taking the whole range of parts, the duties are a bit higher because the duties on the body and chassis have gone down.  The third aim was to maintain the same revenue from the whole range of motor cars and motor parts as there was before.</P>
    <P>With regard to delays in customs clearance referred to by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, it is very difficult to answer that charge unless you get a specific instance or instances.  I quite see the Deputy's point that a complainant sometimes does not like to give the name, although I must say I get many complaints where the complainant sends his full name and address and the matter is investigated. I have not had any complaint from the person that he was victimised afterwards as a result of that.  I do not think that would happen.  Not only have I got these complaints direct, but many Deputies send me letters giving the name and address of a person who has had difficulties in the customs in getting his goods released and, again, I have had no complaints afterwards that they were victimised for complaining in that way.</P>
    <P>The first aim was simplification and the second aim was to maintain the revenue in or about what it was.  We have only had six or eight weeks' trial of this new range of duties but we have not had any complaints. I admit I have had complaints, the same as Deputy Cosgrave, that the duties on parts had gone up and that that was a serious matter which in all probability would mean that the cost of repairs would have to go up also.  Apart from that, I think the scheme is working smoothly and should have the desired result of making it easier for customs officials to deal with them and, therefore, to have a more expeditious release of parts coming through.  It will be much easier for any customs official now to assess the duty because he will not have the trouble of finding out whether the part belongs to the <Col N="917" /> radiator or some other part of the car.  He will be able to assess the duty straight off.  That should make for expedition in release through the customs.  I think we should give the new system a little more trial before we condemn it outright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is a past master at the bland reply.  The real truth is that these and other duties of a similar character, primarily designed to raise revenue, are part of a general policy of passing taxation off the income tax-payer on to the non-income taxpayer. It is quite true that most people who buy motor cars pay income tax but it is not at all true that most people who buy goods that are carried by motor vehicles pay income tax.</P>
      <P>This is a very gradual and subtle process but the fact is that, since this process was inaugurated in 1957, the cost of living has gone up 15 per cent.  That means that out of every £ a man earns the Government are collecting 2/6d. in taxation.  It means that, as a result of the accumulation of these duties which the Government impose of one kind and another, the old age pensioner who is now receiving 30/- in cash is in fact receiving the equivalent of 26/9d. in 1957.  That is bad enough and it is cruelly manifest that it is unjust taxation of the poor for the benefit of the relatively well-to-do, but it is also true that everyone who is paid for a barrel of barley or wheat, for a pig, a bullock or a calf, out of every £ he receives today, the Government are deducting 2/6d. through the medium of the increase in the cost of living which is being carefully constructed by a series of impositions of this kind, all designed to expand indirect taxation for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a bad system.  It is having thoroughly bad repercussions in our society.  One of its great evils is that it is extremely difficult to associate its results with its causes. We see the results throughout the country and are only too conscious of whence they flow but it is not so easy to persuade Deputies of this <Col N="918" /> House of the appropriate remedy, that that rise in the cost of living, which is due in part to impositions of this kind, is driving the small farmer off the land, is making the pensioner and the other beneficiaries under the social services bear a tax burden they should not be asked to bear.</P>
    <P>Last, but not least, I object to the provisions of this particular Order because I can remember very well that when the motor vehicle duties were first put on, they were designed as a method of restricting excessive imports of motor vehicles during a period when we wanted to mobilise our resources to house the poor, to build hospitals, to carry out other kinds of social capital investment. So anxious were we to underline and emphasise that spirit the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, announced that all revenues derived from these customs duties, or levies as they were called, would be appropriated to capital and not brought into current revenue at all. We were told these were iniquitious impositions which the Fianna Fáil Government, if they got into office, would wipe out the following morning.  They did get into office and they took the levy off oranges, the net result of which was that oranges went up in price and the consumers derived no benefit at all.</P>
    <P>A great many of the more substantial levies were incorporated into permanent taxation.  A few were abolished and this section, I gather, repeats the process of consolidating and making permanent as revenue tariff what were denounced as unjustifiable levies a short four years ago.  I am primarily concerned to regard them as what they truly are, the coping stone of a taxation structure which has operated to tax every wage earner, old age pensioner, widow, orphan and unemployed man to the tune of 2/6d. in the £, so that from that revenue other tax reliefs could be provided for sections of the community which I do not think stand as gravely in need of solicitous care as do the categories to whom I referred.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has oversimplified the position and has based his simplification on a very unfortunate example from his point of view, because, in 1957, one of the things we did in the Budget was to reduce motor taxation.</P>
