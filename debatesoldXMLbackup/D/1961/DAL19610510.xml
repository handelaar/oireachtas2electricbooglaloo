      <P>The amendments are put down on the basis of the discussion we had here on Committee Stage when I withdrew an amendment in order to reconsider certain suggestions or criticisms which the Minister made.  I have redrafted the amendments making certain changes which I believe are an improvement and which endeavour to secure the same arrangement as was proposed under the 1959 Act for the three constituencies concerned, Dublin South-East, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and, with certain modifications, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the arrangements proposed in the 1959 Act were more appropriate for those areas in so far as they secured the retention of reasonably compact areas.  While any one of a number of arrangements might be proposed for those areas, there is one distinct advantage in the amendment I have put down, that is, that it makes the county constituencies of Dublin less unwieldy, whereas the arrangement <Col N="172" /> proposed in the Bill as it stands leaves a very lengthy constituency which covers the whole of the county and stretches almost entirely around the city of Dublin.  The proposal in these amendments would mean that Dún Laoghaire and the adjacent hinterland would be one constituency and that Dublin South-East would consist largely of the existing constituency with the addition of the adjacent urban areas of Dundrum, Milltown and others.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the city boundary has been extended to what was formerly the county area, particularly on the Milltown side of the area, but on the south side, it has extended outside the existing boundary.  Therefore, the adjacent areas are likely on some future date to be incorporated into the city.  Consequently, I included those areas adjacent to Dublin South-East. While any particular amendment could be decided upon, it does seem to me that this proposal has the advantage that it will shorten the area concerned and, as far as the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency is concerned, these areas have been the scene of considerable building in recent years and there is a very large urban area which, in future, will result in a very substantial growth in population.  In a short time, the constituency will once again be substantially above the limit laid down by the regulation.</P>
    <P>I think, and believe, that this is a reasonable proposal and that the amendment now put forward, and the two amendments consequential upon it, might be accepted.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to approach this matter in the reasonable fashion in which he approached it on Committee Stage and that it will be possible to secure the acceptance of the amendments which conform with the borders laid down for this constituency in the 1959 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, on Committee Stage I suggested to him that we would try to find every possible solution to the problem as we saw it and as it was outlined at that stage.  Several new divisions have been tried in addition to those already <Col N="173" /> tried out before we came to the House with the Bill.  In all of these, including these amendments which the Deputy now has before the House, we find that the pattern of the constituencies and their boundaries are not an improvement and, indeed, are a disimprovement on what we have proposed.</P>
      <P>In the case of the constituencies as they would be outlined if the amendment were made, we have the situation of the South-East constituency, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin County which would be changed from those which we discussed in the Bill itself.  The result of the amendment would be that the boundaries, and the shape and size of the constituencies, would certainly be unwieldy.  Apart from that, we have now, as far as we can ascertain, a ratio in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency which would be, in fact, the highest ratio of any constituency in the entire Bill.  It would, in fact, increase the ratio above the national average by approximately 200 and would bring it to approximately 21,155.  Apart from that, what is also difficult about this amendment, and I am not saying that there is any alternative to it in the Bill, is the fact that, taking the amendment, we find that the constituency of Dublin South-East will have the same flaw as it had in the earlier proposal on Committee Stage, that of stretching southwards from the Pigeon House to Foxrock and then across to Rathfarnham.</P>
      <P>That, again, would not appear to be really objectionable were it not for the fact that, pocketed within these two extremities, we have Dromartin, Milltown and Dundrum, surrounded southwards by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Those three areas, in that small pocket, actually belong to the Dublin County constituency as now proposed.  It gives a most unusual and confusing lay-out to this county constituency and it would also be confusing for the two adjoining constituencies of Dublin South-East and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in that they are practically isolated from the rest of the Dublin constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The finding of a solution to the problem <Col N="174" /> of these constituencies has been most difficult, difficult in the sense that we have tried, in so far as we possibly could, to maintain, where possible, existing known boundaries.  The city boundary and the city perimeter have been breached in one place, and in one place only, from the time we leave Howth until we get to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That one place is at Ballyfermot, part of which is now returned to the County constituency. While some confusion undoubtedly may exist in the future as a result of this breach of the city boundary, on the other hand, as I say, it is not so much taking part of Ballyfermot from the city and putting it into the county but rather that the county has now ceded part of Ballyfermot to the city but in the operation the city boundary has been breached.  That is the only breach of the entire city boundary between that and the county.</P>
    <P>In the instance we are now discussing, we would, in fact, breach the boundary again.  That, together with the figures which I have quoted and together with the very awkward and confusing boundary line this amendment would have the effect of creating brings about a situation and a pattern of constituency which is certainly no improvement on what we had.  It is, to my mind, a very distinct disimprovement in some of its aspects.</P>
    <P>It may appear to Deputies, and particularly to those who know the area well, that what is now proposed would be a workable proposition.  I think that is not really sound because when we apply this to the maps, as we have done, we find part of these three areas of Dundrum, Milltown and Dromartin entirely isolated from the rest of the county constituency with only a very narrow corridor connecting the two.  I feel that that in itself will cause very great confusion to the electors in areas adjoining this boundary line and will be a cause of difficulty in operation during an election and the taking of a poll.  The question of a poll scheme, I am sure, could possibly be fitted into this pattern.  It is not so much the question of a poll scheme or, indeed, the question of the ready manner in which prospective <Col N="175" /> Deputies or candidates at an election could operate that is in my mind, so much as the confusion that would be created amongst the electorate in areas adjoining these boundary lines. I think we would have very great difficulty and very great confusion.</P>
    <P>While what is proposed in the Bill may have its faults, I feel that taking it all in all, and from my knowledge of the multitude of patterns we tried to work out, the proposal in the Bill is the best of those that could be found and is unquestionably a better pattern of constituency boundary than is now proposed.  In fact, I think it is better than anything we can find.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House on Committee Stage&mdash;and I should like to repeat it&mdash;we have sought ways and means whereby the points raised by Deputy Cosgrave could be overcome. In trying to find the best pattern of constituency before the Bill came to the House, I felt that what we were presenting was the best.  I undertook to examine the matter.  I have since examined very thoroughly and very carefully any possible alternative, including in particular this suggested rearrangement as outlined in Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.</P>
    <P>Having examined it carefully and as sympathically as possible, I am very firmly of the opinion that this is not an improvement and that, in fact, no suggested improvement of the proposal in the Bill has been forthcoming, nor can I foresee or find it in all the various attempts we made to get some change that would meet what the Deputy has suggested.  On that basis and for those reasons, I am regrettably in the position that I cannot recommend or lend support in the House to the acceptance of what is proposed in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, in the Schedule, in the second column of the entry relating to Carlow-Kilkenny, to delete &ldquo;Tombrack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ballybeg, in the former Rural District of Gorey&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> This amendment also arises out of the discussion on Committee Stage when the Minister indicated to me that, as I felt so seriously about the matter, I should put down an amendment concerning these two areas.  I stated, when speaking on Committee Stage, that I considered, apart from other matters, that the geographical situation of these two areas made it impracticable for them to be included in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency. In the course of the debate Deputy Corish asked the Minister what was the highest figure in the equated situation about which the Department of Local Government, the Minister and his advisers throughout the country had taken so much trouble.  The reply was that it was 20,916 per seat.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of Wexford and Carlow-Kilkenny are well defined.  I understand the Constitution to provide that there shall not be more than a population of 30,000 per seat.  I also understood the Constitution to read that there should not be fewer than 20,000 per seat.  This is somewhat obscured by a decision of the High Court judge in the recent legislation. What I understand the learned High Court judge to have said was that where the figures were somewhat fewer one way or the other, it would not really matter and that it would be in keeping with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should like to see Wexford retained as one unit.  It seems to me that if Wexford is retained as a unit, that arrangement will still be within the Constitution, but I accept the fact that the Minister and his advisers must have given considerable time to working out the figures in relation to Wexford as it is placed within the equation inside the whole country.  For that purpose I am confining my amendment to the two areas pushed right out of the middle of County Wexford.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to this point: in the framing of the new constituencies the idea was to contain them within the figures but at the same time due consideration was to be given to the question of fair <Col N="177" /> representation.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill I pointed out that the new constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny will come within two miles of Ferns.  We have got to take the existing situation as it was at the last general election.  There were then three Deputies elected in the northern half of the County&mdash;the late Deputy Denis Allen and myself who lived approximately in the one district and about nine miles from Ferns, and Deputy Browne who still represents County Wexford like myself and who lives about eight miles from Ferns and ten miles from the prospective new boundary of the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.</P>
    <P>If consideration has been given to fair representation to give Deputies an opportunity of giving the best possible service, it does not seem feasible to have Tombrack removed quite a distance and put into Carlow-Kilkenny and take it away entirely from those in County Wexford who live next door to it.  Exactly the same situation applies in the case of Ballybeg.  The only difference there is that, taking the elected representation in the last general election, the late Deputy Allen and myself were in greater proximity to that area than was Deputy Browne though Deputy Browne is within a reasonable distance of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a rural Deputy as I am.  Perhaps he has even longer distances to travel and he must know very well how desirable it is that it should be possible for constituents to approach in person the Deputies who represent them to discuss their individual problems.  I put this amendment to the House as being a reasonable one.  Now I should like to get to the figures involved.</P>
    <P>The figures I have are the Minister's own figures which he was kind enough to send to me after the discussion on the Committee Stage.  In the Bill at the moment Wexford has been reduced to a population of 82,607 for four seats and Carlow-Kilkenny has a population of 102,629.  By the inclusion in Wexford of Ballybeg, 372, and Tombrack, 625, a total of 997, the population of Wexford, if the amendment <Col N="178" /> is adopted, would be increased to 83,604, giving an average of 20,901 per seat.</P>
    <P>It was stated a few moments ago in answer to a query from Deputy Corish that the highest figure is 20,916. Therefore, the suggested figure for Wexford would be below the highest figure and though, as I pointed out in my remarks earlier, it is totally within provisions of the Constitution it is also within the mathematical equation of the Minister and his advisers. Carlow-Kilkenny, by losing the 997, for five seats will have a population per seat of 20,326.  It does not seem to me to be a very big difference. There are only 600 in the difference between the two averages.  But there is a big question&mdash;that of taking away from an historic county two areas for which there does not appear to me to be any justification on the figures.</P>
    <P>Another angle I want to stress is that we in Wexford are out on a limb by ourselves.  If any other constituency needed the figures to keep up its representation&mdash;and a high representation is obviously necessary in a nation where the State is spending the greater part of the money and where a Deputy's work is accordingly increasing&mdash;I could understand it.  But Wicklow does not want any votes. Carlow-Kilkenny, strictly speaking within the Constitution, does not want any votes at all and in fact if the few votes, taken out of Carlow-Kilkenny at the bottom end of the constituency and put into Waterford, were left in Carlow-Kilkenny there would be a full quota of 20,000 to give Carlow-Kilkenny its full representation under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is with regard to this Bill.  I felt that the adjustments made were to try to keep as fair a representation as possible in every constituency.  I can see absolutely no reason for taking away those two areas from Wexford.  The Minister was good enough on the Committee Stage to indicate that if I felt strongly enough about it I should put down an amendment.  I do feel strongly about it and I should like to tell the Minister that I am not the only person who feels strongly about it.  We have our own <Col N="179" /> standard of values in Wexford and we, Wexford Deputies&mdash;I think I can speak in this case for my political colleagues in the County&mdash;feel happy and contented to represent the people there. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  If he accepts the arguments I adduced that he is within the Constitution in doing so, I would have no objection at all if he gives us the whole of Wexford back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to the House on the Committee Stage in respect to this matter and in respect to what Deputy Esmonde said on that occasion, this question is not just as simple as the Deputy seems to think. In fact, if it were, the Deputy would not have had any need to have recourse to an amendment such as is now before the House.  The Deputy mentioned that the judge, in his summing up in the High Court, said that a little bit one way or the other did not matter. To my knowledge the judge did not use any such words or give such understanding. If the Deputy can find in the judgment of the High Court some words to that effect that have escaped my reading it is news to me.  If there had been any such words in the judgment it would have made things much easier for me when framing the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the judgment suggested that a little this way or that way did not matter in regard to what the Constitution says&mdash;that there cannot be fewer than one Deputy for every 30,000 of the population or more than one for every 20,000 of the population. These figures cannot be applied strictly but in a given constituency they are the figures which determine the maximum or minimum number of Deputies which we may have under the law.  While we are opting in this measure as in previous measures for the maximum number allowable under the Constitution, it does not follow that every seat must of necessity represent 20,000, 21,000 or 22,000.  The Constitution does go quite a way to determine how the ratios in the various constituencies within the country as a whole may vary when it says that they shall be, so far as possible, the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> That applies to the constituencies in which a division has had to be made, in which, for instance, a bit of Wexford has had to be taken and put into the adjoining constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, which makes these two so far as possible the same.  There is a difference of only 90 in the ratio of constituency member to population.  In the proposed amendment the difference in ratio would rise from 90 to 575. Therefore, nobody can say that in arriving at a difference of only 90, as against 575, we are going against the Constitution which demands and dictates that the ratios shall be so far as possible the same.</P>
    <P>It is quite natural that Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies who come from a constituency which up to now has been a county complete in itself without either additions or deletions in the past, would not like to see changes made.  They would rather have reduced representation in their own county.  I think that applies to all of us representing any constituency. We would willingly accept a seat less and be left with the old territory and population.  In my own constituency of East Donegal we have had a change of population from one constituency to another of about 12,000.  In the area where we have had to lose that 12,000 I would very happily agree to a three-seat representation instead of the previous four-seat representation. Unfortunately, I cannot do that.  I must change the population from one constituency to the other.  A greater number is being changed in my constituency than in Wexford for instance, and I deplore it equally with Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies who feel likewise in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde suggested that Tombrack and Ballybeg should be left in Wexford rather than be among the eight district electoral divisions being transferred to Carlow-Kilkenny.  If there were a choice in the matter of these eight divisions, I wonder would the other Wexford Deputies be of the same opinion as to the areas that should remain in Wexford?  On the Committee Stage another Deputy from Wexford, Deputy Browne, suggested that some areas other than those mentioned <Col N="181" /> by Deputy Esmonde should be left in Wexford and not taken into Carlow-Kilkenny.  We have not had the views of the remaining two Deputies from Wexford but it is very likely that the other two would have different opinions from those expressed and if we were to satisfy all we would have to leave the eight in Wexford instead of as the Constitution dictates, taking the eight out of Wexford.</P>
    <P>These things seem quite easy to arrange and to justify when one is discussing them from the Opposition side of the House or, as in this case, when one is talking as a Wexford Deputy.  I can quite understand Deputy Esmonde's being convinced that his amendment provides the proper way to effect the necessary changes.  However, even if there were a free choice and all the Wexford Deputies agreed on Tombrack and Ballybeg district electoral divisions being left in Wexford, the fact remains that it could not be done for the very good reason I have given earlier in regard to the population in Wexford constituency, that at 87,000 odd it is far below what would be held to be legal for five seats in the future and also far too high to have only four seats.  It was quite obvious a change had to be made.  It so happened the adjoining constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny had such a population in relation to the number of seats, coming near the 100,000 mark, that from the legal point of view and from the point of view of constitutional requirements it was capable of containing within it sufficient additional population which, taken from Wexford, brought Wexford within striking distance of the national average.</P>
    <P>In that way, Wexford has come to cede this part to Carlow-Kilkenny rather than to some other part.  Without any doubt whatsoever, the addition of these eight electoral divisions brings the Wexford average to 20,652, and on the other side of the boundary, by adding these 4,652 people in the eight district electoral divisions to Carlow-Kilkenny, the Carlow-Kilkenny ratio per member is brought up to 20,562, a difference in ratio, as I have pointed out, of only 90 as between the two constituencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> If, side by side with that, we were to leave the two electoral divisions of Ballybeg and Tombrack in Wexford&mdash; that is, 997 people, just short of 1,000 &mdash;it would appear that that surely could not make much difference, but the effect would be to bring about a difference in ratio of 575, Wexford having 20,901 per member and Carlow-Kilkenny 20,326.  As I say, looking at it initially it would appear that it would not make much difference, but, in fact, it makes a considerable difference when it is expressed in this manner, and related to the constitutional requirement that the ratio of population per member should be the same, so far as possible.  By this division and this addition to Carlow-Kilkenny from Wexford, we have gone as far as possible to keep the member-population ratios as close as we can. There is just 90 in the difference.</P>
    <P>A disimprovement in that position at this stage, particularly by way of amendment, surely could not go without notice.  If I had unwittingly put it to the House, in the first instance, in that manner, it might have been accepted.  It might have got away. But after consideration of the Bill, we have got a ratio which is so closely similar in these adjoining constituencies&mdash;and we have been obliged to make certain changes to conform with the Constitution&mdash;that I am afraid the expanding of that difference deliberately and wilfully, as it were, by way of amendment, with our eyes wide open, would not get away.  We would be asking for quite an amount of trouble in the future if we were to propose to do that.</P>
    <P>The big difficulty in all these divisions is not the question of getting agreement.  You cannot have agreement; there never is agreement and there cannot be agreement.  If my constituency is losing to another constituency, I will not agree to the part that is being lost.  I am not satisfied, and neither is any other Deputy satisfied if he is losing portion of his own constituency which he has worked in and got to know, and the people of which have got to know him.  It is natural that we should resent that. Deputy Esmonde is just like the rest of us who find ourselves in that situation. <Col N="183" /> I must say I sympathise with him, but further than giving him my sympathy I cannot go.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall division, while it is objectionable from the Wexford point of view, it is a division which we were obliged to make.  It has been done to conform with the constitutional law of the country and, while it is not acceptable to all concerned, nevertheless I think it will be agreed to be the best arrangement that could have been made in the circumstances.  For that reason, I suggest the amendment should not be carried by the House.  I suggest that the proposals in the Bill in regard to these two constituencies and these divisions, are the better arrangement, because they conform to a much greater degree with the requirements laid down.  I very strongly recommend to the House the proposals in the Bill in that regard and I suggest that we should retain those proposals, rather than change them in the manner suggested in the amendment, or indeed in any manner that would, in turn, throw out of gear the ratio figures I have already recounted to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister certainly gave us a very long statement on his point of view, but I should like to submit to the House that he is not living in realities; he is living in Custom House statistics. Everything is being worked out on paper and according to figures.  My case is a very simple one.  It is that the county of Wexford need not have been interfered with at all and nothing the Minister has said will satisfy me that if he accepted my amendment, and further, if he not only accepted my amendment but returned <i>in toto</i> the electoral areas he has taken out of Wexford, he would still be within the confines of the Constitution.</P>

The Minister for Finance is a member of the Government and, obviously, he must have discussed this Bill with the Government. Deputy Browne is also a member of Fianna Fáil, the Party in Government at the moment.  The Minister comes in here and tells me he does not know what they think or what they think of my amendment.

      <P>Certainly.  I was hoping they would say something about it.  Apparently the Minister was speaking on behalf of his Party.  That is why I am replying to him.  Nobody else has said anything at all.  The Minister has no intention of accepting my amendment.  He has no intention of accepting any amendment whatever. This Bill was drawn and drafted and the order of the Government was that they were to stand firm on that.  It would have been better had the Minister said on the Second Stage that he did not intend to accept any amendments whatever.  He has made really no attempt to answer my arguments in the long and woolly reply he gave here this morning.  He did not make any reference to incommoding Deputies or to the fact that, in the case of the Carlow-Kilkenny representatives, who have no interest in Wexford, their Wexford constituents would have to go miles to see them.  He said he had to take all these areas out of the Wexford constituency and push them into another constituency.  He did not even justify it by saying he was conforming with the Constitution.  When he referred to what I said about the learned judge's statement, he did not even clarify what the judge said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this protest before I sit down.  I have the honour to be a member of an old political family.  We have represented Wexford long before the Minister or his Party were heard <Col N="186" /> of.  I guess that we shall have the opportunity of doing so for a bit longer. But in all the years we have represented Wexford we have had the right to represent the Wexford people. It rests with a gerrymandering political expedient of the Fianna Fáil Party to remove that.  Were it necessary to do so I would be happy and content, but it is quite unnecessary.  It shows that political preference counts for more than anything else in Ireland to-day. That is the reason people are becoming politically disinterested.  So long as that Party carry on the way they are, we shall have that state of affairs in Ireland.</P>

    <P>This amendment offers to the Minister a final opportunity of solving the difficulty of whether South Tipperary or Waterford is entitled to get an additional seat.  I believe it is a fair and just amendment.  It does not give any special privilege to either side.  It takes the combined populations and allocates the same number of seats as if there were separate constituencies.  If accepted by the Minister it will lay at <Col N="187" /> once the charge that the Minister is using his position for political advantage, because in the final analysis it will be the people of either South Tipperary or Waterford who will decide which political Party will secure the additional seat.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan suggested a compromise solution on the Committee Stage.  The Minister indicated he did not favour that solution because, he said, the combined constituency would then be as unwieldy as other constituencies about which there had been complaints.  Having looked at the map in the Library, and without taking scale measurements, I believe the area from where I live on the coast up to the other extremity at Thurles would be less than 60 miles.  I would say from a visual examination that the Roscommon-Leitrim constituency is larger than the area from Waterford city to Thurles. Of course, Roscommon-Leitrim is a four-seat constituency; and with seven Deputies spread over the proposed combined constituency, I cannot see what would be wrong with such a solution.  It would be preferable to have such a constituency rather than have it happen, as has been said, that one-third of Waterford constituency, 17,000 people, will be loath to vote at all in the coming general election because they will not have an opportunity of voting for any Waterford representative.  It would be most unhealthy if these people accepted the advice tendered to them&mdash;certainly not by me&mdash;and refused to exercise the franchise at all.  I trust that will not happen.  I believe it is the duty of every citizen to register his vote at election time.  I disagree with that type of advice but I can see it could be very effective.</P>
    <P>I realise this is not the ideal solution. It is not the solution I should have liked but I want to confine myself strictly to my amendment today. I shall have an opportunity later, on some other stage, to make general remarks.  At the moment, I want to confine myself strictly to the position. I have put the facts.  The Minister must know them as well as I do.  I feel we could comply with the High <Col N="188" /> Court ruling and at the same time satisfy the feelings of the people in both constituencies.  I suggest the Minister has a way out of what is to me a very unsatisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne says it is not an ideal solution to put the whole of South Tipperary and Waterford into one constituency.  It certainty would be a further step on the road the Minister indicated he was travelling towards a more satisfactory arrangement of the principle of proportional representation.  He indicated he had substantially increased the number of five-member constituencies.</P>
      <P>There was a time when the whole of Tipperary was a seven-member constituency. When Fianna Fáil policy began to dig the foundations from under the principle of proportional representation, the old seven-member constituency of Tipperary was wiped out.  The seven-member constituency of Tipperary would be an ideal type of constituency in relation to the old principle but, if we are on the way back, I suggest there are very good reasons why a step on the way back could effectively and satisfactorily be taken by putting South Tipperary and Waterford together.</P>
      <P>We heard the Minister on the difficulties created by a range of mountains in Donegal and on how necessary it was to change the situation there in order to get rid of the effect a range of mountains had on people's political convenience.  To take part of Waterford and to put it into South Tipperary creates for the Waterford people and the people of Tipperary in the one constituency the type of difficulty the Minister said it was important to remove from the path of the political workers in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The River Suir is a binding link between the boundaries of Waterford and Tipperary right up, you might say, the whole length of the Suir, in so far as the presence of the river can offset the difficulties created by the higher ground on the South.  Some kind of an argument could be made that the concentration of interests and the concentration of contacts brought about by the River Suir in its most navigable <Col N="189" /> reaches in the eastern part of the constituency would help to overcome some of the difficulties that arise in the west now.</P>
    <P>If West Waterford is to be considered in relation to these economic, social and general contacts it is more connected with East Cork than with South Tipperary.  Therefore the Minister has in Deputy Kyne's proposal, while from many points of view not a satisfactory arrangement, an arrangement that would have an axis of potential satisfaction running through it in the circumstances that the River Suir runs from Waterford to Clogheen, right through the whole length of the joint constituencies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept the proposal Deputy Kyne puts before the House and to allow a joint constituency of Waterford and South Tipperary.  A seven-member group would have the joint interests and the joint outlook of the two areas which have a very close affinity on many matters.  Such a group would have an opportunity of expressing that outlook in this Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member for Tipperary when it was a seven-member constituency.  I was very happy when the constituency was divided because of the tremendous difficulty involved in travelling maybe as many as 100 miles from one part to the other. I think the figures of distance given by Deputy Kyne were the minimum rather than the maximum.  From a purely personal angle, I would wish that Waterford would be tacked on to South Tipperary.  It would suit me admirably.  At the same time, I do not see that it would be any improvement whatsoever on the present position.</P>
      <P>Many accusations were made against me on the Committee Stage so far as the Bill was concerned.  Deputy Kyne, as reported in the Official Report, said I consulted with him in connection with the division of the constituency. If he is correctly reported, I deny categorically that I ever had any consultation whatsoever with Deputy Kyne on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the division of Waterford <Col N="190" /> is concerned, I regret it very much.  I should much prefer that Waterford would remain a distinct constituency just as I should prefer that Tipperary South Riding would remain a distinct constituency.  But, while uniting the two counties and forming one big constituency would suit me perfectly, I still think the division in the Bill is better for all the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh!  I am still stumped.  However, let it be one thing or another.  The fact is that the proposal in this amendment is that Tipperary South Riding or the constituency of South Tipperary, as it is delineated in the Bill, added to all the County of Waterford should become one constituency and be represented by seven members in this House.  As I indicated on an earlier stage here, I do not agree with that suggestion, but let me just to some degree elaborate on some of the reasons why I would not agree with such a suggestion, whether it concerns Tipperary or Waterford or any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>The fusing of these two areas would bring about a situation wherein roughly 145,000 people would be in that constituency, a rural constituency in the main.  It would embrace approximately 1,000,000 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who think otherwise can break it down to the other figure.  However, it is formidable.  No matter how you describe it, it is a big area.  There is a big population and, in addition to that, the distances would undoubtedly be extended and I think somewhat beyond what Deputy Kyne suggested.  He mentioned a figure of 60 miles, but I have one of approximately 76, from a point in the southern extremity of Waterford through Carrick-on-Suir right up to the north-west of Tipperary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really making a point of it, whether it is five or ten miles more or less.  What I am saying is that the fusion of the two areas makes a population of 145,000 and gives approximately 1,000,000 acres of territory and distances of somewhere around 60, 70 or 75 miles from one point in the proposed constituency to another.</P>
      <P>Let us look at it in another and, perhaps, a more understandable way. If we can conceive of Counties Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan being put together, the result would approximate to the size of what is now proposed in the fusion of South Tipperary and all of Waterford.  I think anybody would regard the putting of Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan into one constituency &mdash;and with pretty good reason&mdash;as objectionable because of the unwieldy size of the constituency created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can look at it nearer home.  If Wexford and Wicklow were put together, that would be approximately the same area and extent as is involved in this proposal.  I think it is true that smaller areas and smaller populations make for better service to the people concerned&mdash;whether in three-seat or four-seat constituencies is not of any great importance.  We must have threes at times and fours at other times and so on.  As things now stand, we have <Col N="192" /> nothing greater than five-seat constituenies. I believe under the 1923 Act some years ago we had a considerable number of large-size constituenies which were reduced under the 1935 Act and disappeared altogether in the 1947 Act.  Certainly I do not hope to see them revived but this amendment would have that effect. Such a revival would not be in the best interests of the people whom we and those who come after us will represent. In smaller areas, with smaller numbers of Deputies, better service can be given and Deputies get to know the area better and more particularly the people get to know the Deputies better.  All these are very good reasons for not reverting to something that has been well tried in the past and has proved not to be very workable, with the result that the large size constituencies were dropped until we now have only the five-member constituencies since 1947.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Mulcahy referred to the possibility of East Cork and Waterford or East Cork and Tipperary being combined and that people in such a combination would have more in common than what we propose in this Bill.  I do not disagree, but while I may appear to disagree in certain cases as proposed in the Bill, I have not changed my mind in regard to the objectionable features I see and understand to exist where dissimilar populations are put together in constituencies. I still have my opinions, but, for the purposes of this Bill, what I feel or believe does not matter; it is what the law says should be done and what it says we should have regard to that count.  These are things which we have been expressly told we are not required to have regard to, as well as quite a number of other things that I should like to take into account. All of them have been brushed aside and if I now appear, in putting this measure before the House, to be contradicting what I said on the earlier Bill in 1959, it is for the very good reason&mdash;not that I have changed my mind&mdash;that the law has been interpreted. These matters I believed&mdash; and still believe&mdash;in have been said not to be of any account in the delineation <Col N="193" /> of constituencies in these revisions.</P>
    <P>I suppose these matters will come under discussion in the years to come but let those revisions take care of themselves.  Coming back to the amendment, the creation of large constituencies is not desirable or advisable. Experience has shown that.  In this instance, I cannot see what advantage these areas of Waterford or South Tipperary would gain by putting them together.  Deputy Kyne spoke of the possibility of the people of Waterford not voting at all if joined to South Tipperary.  He said there were those who might advise them that that would be their remedy.  About 17,000 or 16,000 of these people are joining Tipperary South Riding constituency.</P>

It is that there are sufficient people on the register in that part of Waterford which it is proposed will go into South Tipperary to make it well worth their while to vote, sufficient to give them a Waterford man as their representative. They have more than a quota. They have much less grievance on that account.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is correct for the Minister to say that there is more than a quota in this area and that that quota could send a Deputy into this House.  On figures, there is more than a quota, but it would need a witch or a wizard to get all the voters there&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Labour, Fine Gael, Independent&mdash;to vote for one candidate.  I am sorry I could not be here for the whole of this discussion.  I was here last week, and I do not think it was correct for the Minister to say at column 1571 of Volume 188 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I have not heard for quite a long time, nor do I hope to hear again for quite a long time, such a befuddled, muddled calculation as was adduced here by Deputy Kyne.</P>
      <P>That was not fair to Deputy Kyne. Deputy Kyne gave a figure of 73,718 for South Tipperary.  I have here the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1960 and Table VIII at page 18 of the Census of Population gives the figure 73,718 for South Tipperary and 74,031 for Waterford. Those were the figures given by Deputy Kyne.  They are the correct figures.</P>
      <P>It is not just a matter of Deputy Kyne, myself, or my colleagues from Fianna Fáil, or anybody else, trying to influence people to vote or not to vote.  I am convinced that when the election comes, there will be wholesale absention in both the South Tipperary and Waterford area.  I have been in the area twice since last week and I was surprised to discover how oddly people feel about this.  People who have never voted for my Party told me how sorry they were.  I think the amendment tabled would cover the position.  It would be infinitely preferable to leave the existing boundaries of Waterford stand.</P>

Certain local councillors hoped to be elected.  Now that the area has been put into County Dublin, they will not go forward for election because they believe they will not have a chance.  The three outgoing members representing County Dublin reside miles away from Ballyfermot. One lives in Whitehall, one in Lusk, and one somewhere else.  Not one of them resides in Ballyfermot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, as on previous occasions, the Minister falls back on the one excuse.  He tells us that much that is now being done is not his wish, that it was the High Court decision.  The High Court did not decide.  The learned judge did not say to the Minister that one-third of Waterford should go in with South Tipperary.  It is a bit late in the day to suggest that the High Court advised that there should not be a seven-member constituency within the area of Waterford and South Tipperary. Whatever defence the Minister may have and whatever ground he may put forward for his opposition to a seven-member constituency, he cannot avail of the pretext that he would like to have a seven-member constituency, but the High Court objects to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, so far as I am aware the High Court decision did not say that one-third of a county should be given to another area.  I think it is right to say that the natural approach would be to take in the lesser area. That was discussed at another stage and the Minister objected.  It must have been obvious to the Minister that <Col N="197" /> this was not the remedy, even though Deputy Loughman would wish for the remedy of taking one-third of Waterford and giving it to Tipperary.  Like Deputy Lynch, I would say that it is nonsensical, muddled and befuddled, to use the Minister's own words, to suggest that they can find an agreed candidate and say: &ldquo;This is our man against South Tipperary.&rdquo;  Deputy Loughman and others know that that could not be because it would be a sad day for any county if we could marshal the people to such an extent as to deny them the right, even within one-third of the county, to vote for the candidates from the different political Parties.</P>
    <P>I believe the remedy is to have a seven-seat constituency.  It is obvious that a large portion of Waterford will be victimised, if not disfranchised.  In the proposal before the House, there is no suggestion whatever of victimisation of the people in South Tipperary because, contrary to the view of the Minister that the Waterford people can forget politics and provide an agreed candidate, in this suggestion, Tipperary with seven seats would still be an entity and fighting for the third or fourth seat, whichever it may be, which would be fought out in the seven-seat constituency.  Certainly that could not be suggested as victimising the people in South Tipperary.  It is because we know what would happen to the people in west and north-west Waterford that we are asking for a fair measure of protection for these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to his abhorrence of breaking up boundaries. That may be so, but the Minister had the remedy and so had the Taoiseach. It would have been no trouble for them to have introduced an amendment of the Constitution, if they so wished, but they avoided that.</P>

The fact is that if the Minister does believe that victimisation might be the result of breaking boundaries, the remedy is in his hand. Apparently he is not prepared to do that and is apparently not prepared to give fair play to one-third of the population which is being switched over to South Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I was very interested in the views put forward by Deputy Mulcahy. Naturally, coming from another political Party, it was heartening to find that my amendment had the support of that Party, not because I thought it was going to give me any particular advantage but it did make an appeal to the Minister, a combined appeal, and it broadened my amendment to show that all Parties, other than the Government Party, were willing to seek a solution to the situation. Deputy Mulcahy pointed to a time when such a combination of seven seats worked effectively.  The Minister went on to say that flaws were found in it and objections raised in the past.  I have no knowledge of that. I am sure the Minister has not either, but possibly there are records which he consulted.  I have no knowledge of what the defects of the seven-seat constituency were found to be.  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out that the natural line of the River Suir divided the two constituencies and gave them an axis on which to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Loughman's assurance that it would suit him admirably if this should happen, but, having said that, he went on to be the hero.  Of course, there was the natural inference that, notwithstanding what suited him, he put above himself and above every other consideration the things he thought were good for the people of South Tipperary.  I was interested in the 100 miles which Deputy Loughman travelled in this constituency <Col N="199" /> which he knew so well a long time ago.  The Minister has come approximately to the same figure as I estimated for the length of the county. The Minister said 76 miles and I said certainly from Dungarvan to Thurles it was 54 or 56, but I would not quarrel with the Minister's 76.  I suggest that the Roscommon-Leitrim area is 90 miles, 14 miles more.  I know of course that by various ways you can always prove with figures any kind of an argument you want to build up, whether they are for acres or miles.  There is nothing more unwieldy in Waterford-South Tipperary than in Carlow and Kilkenny.  There may be a greater density of population in Waterford.  A population of 28,000 people, all within a radius of 10 miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit.  Of course, the Minister can say that he would like to help but because of a High Court judge's decision on a suggestion made by a Fine Gael Senator, he cannot. Because of that, the whole country must be punished.  We must take our medicine because we were not good boys and went to the courts to prove the Bill wrong.  I want to have it on record that I have not the slightest animosity towards Senator O'Donovan for challenging what he felt was wrong and was proved to be wrong.  It is a good thing that there are people in this country who believe in a principle so much that they will at their own expense contest it, particularly if, as is the case in this instance, they are proved to be correct.  Senator O'Donovan was proved to have been correct in his belief that the legislation enacted by this House was faulty.  That was his view and he was perfectly entitled to it and if the results do not suit me particularly now, I have no grievance against the man who did what he felt was his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tries to avail of the action of Senator O'Donovan to say that he could not do as suggested. <Col N="200" /> When the law permits him to do what I am now suggesting, he is not able to say that the High Court judge is preventing him from doing it.  When it suits him, he says he is forced to take a certain course.  He is forced to break the boundary somewhere.  I pointed out on Committee Stage an alternative.  He then said that the ratio would be too high, that there would be too many left in South Tipperary.  He put in one-third of Waterford, depriving people of Waterford of the right to elect their own county man.  Deputy Desmond and Deputy Lynch dealt with the ridiculous remark that there is nothing to stop them electing a Waterford man, if they all combine.  I am afraid we have not got a Messiah down there who would be all things to all men.  I am not saying that there will not be any Waterford man elected because the Party machinery is already setting about trapping these Waterford votes for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

Deputy Loughman will not be worried&mdash;he is a natural.  When John Fahy takes his place there, he will be happy because it will all be for the Party.  That is beside the point.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by saying to the Minister, who went on to talk about the ratio being changed, that that is ridiculous.  If four seats with a certain population can come within the law and if three seats in Waterford constituency come within the law, on the ratio basis, and if you combine both populations and make it seven seats that automatically changes the suggestion. He went on to suggest, but did not give us any figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister was very nice to me and said that I was so persistent that he would almost like to agree with me.  He regretted it.  I regret it also but for a different reason. He regrets it because I am so persistent; I regret it because one-third of my county has been sold away for political purposes.  I certainly will contest the election.  I am quite hopeful that I will make as good a run as anybody else.  If I am beaten, I will accept that decision.  The time in my life has passed when I had to worry about such decisions.  While I have been here, I have done my best conscientiously. If the people of Waterford want to return me again, that is their business.  I dislike a political Party gerrymandering and trying to keep the people of Waterford from electing me so much as to transfer some 9,000 of them into South Tipperary.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 30.</P>
    <P>48a.  To delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The operation of a consequential, ancillary or special disqualification order shall be suspended or postponed by reason of an appeal being brought against the order or where the order is related to a conviction against the conviction, unless the Court making the order is satisfied and declares that by continuing to drive the person in respect of whom the order was made would or might be a cause of danger to himself or to others.&rdquo;</P>

    <Col N="202" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, as Deputy O'Higgins explained last night, is to provide that where a disqualification order is imposed on conviction in the district court, if the convicted party appeals, the disqualification will be suspended or put in abeyance pending the appeal.</P>
      <P>As things stand at the moment, there is not a little doubt as to whether a district justice, on convicting and imposing disqualification, can in fact suspend disqualification pending the hearing of an appeal in the circuit court.  There are some justices who refuse so to suspend and, indeed, my own opinion for what it is worth is that they are right in refusing because the law does not permit them to convict and to suspend the suspension of a driving licence pending the hearing of an appeal.</P>
      <P>What Deputy O'Higgins is seeking to bring about by this amendment is that a district justice will be allowed to leave a disqualification order in abeyance, pending an appeal in the circuit court, unless the district justice is satisfied that if he were to allow the convicted person to continue driving, he would be a danger to himself and to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the amendment is necessary because there have been cases where, on appeal to the circuit court, the district court conviction has been upset.  There have been cases where the circuit court has held that the man was not guilty of dangerous driving or drunken driving or some other offence under the Act.  Because of the state of the law as it stands at the moment, there have been and there will be in future, unless the amendment is accepted, cases where people are declared by the circuit court to be innocent of the charge, but who nevertheless have had to suffer a period of three months' disqualification between the time of conviction and the hearing of the appeal.  It is obviously wrong to impose a penalty on a man in relation to an offence of which he was never properly convicted.  If he appeals his first conviction and is successful he should never have to suffer the penalty of disqualification.  I urge <Col N="203" /> the Minister to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is offered, as an amendment to prevent further injustice.</P>

      <P>The position is that what we proposed in the Bill is as the law now stands and as we have operated it in the past and up to the present.  I am also informed that the law in Britain is the law as it is here and as we propose to continue it.  I may not have properly caught what the Deputy said because I understood him to say that at present if a man is convicted in the district court and part of the penalty is disqualification, that disqualification cannot be removed pending an appeal. Did I understand the Deputy to say that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done by some justices but not by others.  Some feel that they would be wrong in doing it. The matter has not yet been challenged as it would be expensive to do so, but there is considerable doubt about it at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I said that is that I am quite aware of its having been done.  There may be the question that some justices are not operating it, but it might be purely coincidental that in the cases in which they were asked to do it, they felt they could not do it.  There is no doubt whatever that the justice is entitled to do this, if he so decides and if the nature of the case is such that he believes he should do it.  It is on that basis that I put the provision in the Bill for continued operation in the future and that justices will have power to suspend the suspension, as it were, pending the hearing of the appeal, if they are satisfied that it is correct and just to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which the Deputy has proposed and supported here is in another direction, that is, that where a suspension follows a conviction, the justice shall be obliged to suspend the operation of the suspension, unless he is satisfied that the continuance of driving by the defendant would be a danger to the defendant himself or to others.  Candidly, I am inclined to <Col N="204" /> think that in a case like this we should continue to operate that which we have been operating without any cause for grievance or concern and that which, in the experience of our nearest neighbours in the matter, they have been satisfied to continue in their most recent traffic and transport legislation.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I feel that what we propose in the Bill is the best course. Because of that experience of workability and satisfaction, I would feel very loath to depart from that and to adopt some new suggestion such as that contained in the amendment.  From our experience, it would seem that there has been no real injustice done or no grievous complaint about the provision as we have been operating it.  We have put in that matter because of our experience of its workability and we are inclined to keep what we know rather than change to something new which is possibly not as good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be difficult about this matter.  The Minister has assured me that the section as drafted is similar to the provision in the existing Act.  If that be so, it would appear that you would still have justices who feel that they have not got the power.  I am aware, from my own professional experience, that I can tell clients in advance that from Justice X they will have suspension of the disqualification but that Justice Y believes that he has not the power to do it.  That is a fact of which any solicitor in the courts can give evidence. In that regard, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and let us have the result of that reconsideration on Report Stage.  If he inquires from the members of the district court bench, he will find that what I say is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question as to whether what we propose in the Bill is similar to the existing law, the answer is that the section is the same as it was in the 1933 Act. I do not at all doubt the Deputy's statement that some justices believe they have not the power to suspend a disqualification and that other justices will agree to do so.  I suppose it is impossible that we should get uniformity <Col N="205" /> in the matter but does that fact operate against what has been happening up to the present?  Would it not also be likely in the future that, when one can anticipate what a justice can do under the present Act, one could also anticipate what the justice would do under this Bill?</P>
      <P>I cannot see that the actual individual outlook of the various justices is going to be fundamentally or radically changed by what is proposed in the amendment.  The lack of uniformity will still be there and the terms of the amendment will not eradicate it.  I would say that in a matter such as this, we have got to rely on our district justices and our judges, and that is only right.  We must have that reliance and it is really a question, with regard to the proposals in this Bill, of relying on the justices to use their discretion and their good judgment as to what to do where a suspension of a disqualification is sought on the basis that an appeal is pending. There is no doubt that is a matter which we must leave to the discretion of the justices.  As I say, we leave so many things to their discretion that we are not, I think, adding unduly to the number of things which are at their discretion at the moment. We are not, in fact, adding at all.  I am merely asking that we should leave to their discretion that which has been within their discretion for the past 27 years.</P>
      <P>On that basis, I should be inclined to say to Deputy Ryan and to those who support the amendment that, by and large, it is a matter of leaving it to the discretion of the justices.  The amendment as proposed will not eradicate what the Deputy would seem to regard as the fault in the operation of the law in this respect at the moment.  Since that is so, there does not appear to me to be any advantage to be gained by the amendment.  Indeed, difficulties may be thrown up by the amendment, if carried, which we have not experienced in the past.  On balance, I think, we are better served by continuing what is there than by bringing about a change which does not at the outset hold out any hope of improving the position to any degree that I can see.</P>

      <P>This Bill is now going through the House and goodness knows when there will be another traffic Bill.  With all due respect to the Bench and the courts, we should leave as little as possible to the discretion of the judges and the justices.  It would be better, when this Bill is passed, that the section were definite and gave proper guidance to the justices.  I appeal to the Minister not as a lawyer but as a layman.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case of a man whom a district justice convicts and whose licence is suspended.  The amendment endeavours to give that man complete and fair justice.  This man decides to appeal the decision.  While he is waiting for the appeal to be heard, according to the Bill now, he is disqualified. Then he will appear before the court in a month, two months' or three months' time.  Heaven knows how long the court's delay will be.  It is possible that the higher court will reverse the decision of the district justice.  Then, this man finds he is no longer disqualified, but even though he was innocent, he has been disqualified from driving and, indeed, in many cases from earning his livelihood for whatever is the period between the date of his conviction and the date on which his appeal is heard.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consult his officers in view of what Deputy Ryan said about the legal end of it.  If possible, this section should not be drawn so as to rely on the discretion of the district justice or anybody else, but should be so framed as to give a straightforward direction that if a man is convicted and his licence suspended, if he appeals against the decision, the suspension should be waived until his appeal is heard.  The amendment excepts people the court would say were drug addicts or people it would be dangerous to allow to drive at all. That is covered in the amendment.  The Minister, in consultation with his officers, should say to the House that he is prepared to meet the movers of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this that has caused considerable difficulty in the courts from time <Col N="207" /> to time.  As things stand, the district justice has no authority by which he can even allow a convicted person to drive his car home.  If he is disqualified as a result of the decision of the court, then somebody else will have to drive his car home.  I think that some consideration might be given to that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment itself, disqualification is something that is imposed for a serious offence.  If somebody is convicted in the district court in the month of June and the sentence carries disqualification, the effect of the passing of this amendment would be that he would be allowed until probably the following November during which the disqualification would be suspended. That is a period of four months, which is a long time.  He might then be able to secure a postponement or adjournment of the case until the next session which might not take place until the following February.  Assuming that his appeal is dismissed, he will have succeeded in postponing the punishment which is due to him for a period of eight months.  I do not think that would be desirable.</P>
      <P>As I have said the penalty of disqualification is imposed only for serious statutory offences.  I think that any amendment which would permit a man guilty of a serious infringement of the law to postpone disqualification for a period of eight months is not desirable. I appreciate that if this happened in Dublin, the appeal would be likely to be heard reasonably soon.  If a person were successful, he could have, as Deputy Lynch says, suffered a period of disqualification for which, in the eyes of the law, he was not ultimately liable.  I do not think we should worry too much about that.  I do not think a district justice would impose disqualification in the first instance, unless there were strong evidence to support his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise again that the Bill, as drafted, provides that the suspension must remain unless the Justice makes a contrary order.  What the amendment seeks to do is provide that unless the Justice makes a contrary order the suspension does not operate.  Dealing with what Deputy S. Flanagan said, I do not think it matters a hoot when a man suffers a penalty from what date the suspension operates &mdash;whether it be a week, three weeks or three months.</P>
      <P>However, there have been cases where a justice has imposed a suspension for a three month period and refused to make an order suspending the disqualification pending an appeal. The justice is depriving that person of the right to appeal as far as the penalty is concerned.  Of course he may appeal to clear his name.  There have been cases where a man is convicted on a technicality in the district court for not having insurance but on appeal to the circuit court he has been able, through better proof, to establish that the vehicle was insured and he was let off scot free.  If you leave the law as it stands in this respect you will have continuing cases of injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides that an <Col N="209" /> appeal will mean that the disqualification will not operate until the appeal is disposed of unless the justice feels there is a good reason because of the behaviour of the man before him&mdash; because it might be obvious to the justice that the man is a menace to the public and a danger to himself.  I am glad Deputy S. Flanagan mentioned the difficulty which frequently arises where a defendant drives to the court alone and the justice imposes a disqualification on him.  That man finds himself in the position where he cannot drive the car home.  It could mean considerable loss since he might have to leave the car stranded and get some other means of transport home or get somebody else to drive it home for him.</P>
    <P>I considered it would be more appropriate to make those remarks on the section itself and I am glad Deputy S. Flanagan raised it to give me the opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to it now.  Would it not be possible for the justice to make the suspension order operative from the following day in such cases, so that the defendant concerned would be given an opportunity of driving his car home?  Following disqualification, I do not think such a person would be any great danger to the public by being permitted to drive till the following day.  In fact, I would say his driving would be vastly improved as a result of his conviction.</P>

      <P>What the Minister is providing is that the district justice may, in certain circumstances, suspend the disqualification pending appeal and, as far as I can gather from Deputy Ryan, he seeks to ensure that a person who proposes to appeal may still drive his car pending the appeal unless the court directs otherwise.  I do not see much difference between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment puts a greater onus upon the district justice. <Col N="210" /> He has to explain why he refuses to suspend the operation of a disqualification order.  It will not do for him to refuse to suspend the order just because he does not like the face of the man before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Justices can do a lot of things when they do not like the face of the accused, but it seems to me that, in respect of such offences as parking a vehicle in a dangerous position, there should be automatic suspension for a repetition of such an offence.  In many cases a car may be parked in what would be regarded as a very dangerous spot&mdash;the middle of a cross-roads or near traffic signals&mdash; and I say that the man guilty of such an offence deserves to be disqualified. But there are other circumstances in which a car might be deemed to be parked in a dangerous position, such as six feet from a corner in a town or village, where, when a defendant signifies his intention of appealing, the justice would allow him to carry on driving pending the hearing of such an appeal.  My reason for holding that there is not much difference between the amendment and the section here is that the section gives the justice power, where he thinks fit, to suspend the disqualification order.  I think that ought to be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment more favourably.  The suspension of a licence to drive can be a frightful burden on a person who makes his living by driving.  If you have a fellow who drives a lorry to earn his bread and he is convicted of a traffic offence which involves automatic suspension of his licence and he appeals, if the offence is of the character referred to by Deputy Corish&mdash;parking his lorry too far from the pavement or at an unsuitable place, and he claims he had not so parked&mdash;it seems a dreadful thing to say to him that pending an appeal, which may take months to get heard, he is excluded from earning his living during that period.  On the other hand, we are bound to take cognisance of the gross case where a justice, thinks this man is a public menace or a <Col N="211" /> danger to himself.  That case would, however, be the exception.  There is no use our closing our eyes to the fact that the deprivation of the right to drive for many of us is no more than losing an amenity, but for a great many people it is their livelihood.</P>
      <P>Surely it is not unreasonable for us to say that where a man appeals and claims he is not guilty of the offence charged against him, unless there are special reasons, he ought to be free to drive while his appeal is pending. That is the view expressed by this amendment.  The general power in a district justice to suspend the cancellation of a man's licence throws the emphasis all the other way.  It suggests that the normal thing ought to be that he should not be allowed to drive pending an appeal but in very special circumstances the district justice may waive that and it is a concession.  I do not think it is a concession. If a man professes his innocence and has a right to appeal, he ought to be free from the penalties associated with final conviction pending his appeal.  The emphasis ought to be on that and there should be an obligation on the State to urge on the district justice that this man is a public danger or is a danger to himself and for that special reason he should not receive the customary concession while his appeal is pending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was pointing out that on the south side of Dublin there is one pound for wandering horses and that is situated in Churchtown in a long-established built-up area.  I want to emphasise how ridiculous it is to have one pound catering for the hundreds of wandering and menacing animals on the south side of Dublin.  Most of the itinerant encampments who let loose their animals at night time are situated in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Crumlin.  Short of the Garda superintendent organising a posse of Gardaí to chase and round up the wandering horses of Ballyfermot through seven or eight miles of city streets, there is no way in which the Garda in this area can take action to put these horses where they ought to be.  The pound in Churchtown might as well be in Cork for all the use it is in rounding up these animals.</P>
      <P>The reason the itinerants continue to let their animals loose is that they know they will not have to pay any fines.  If their horses are impounded it is another story and they must pay fines to get them out of the pound.  Only when there are sufficient pounds in and around Dublin city will there be an end to this menace whereby these wandering animals do untold harm to people's gardens and create all kinds of dangers and traps for cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that the Department of Justice, the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council are passing the buck to one another in relation to this urgent problem.  The unfortunate people who have to live with this are driven to desperation.  Yesterday evening when I went home I received another of the not infrequent letters I get from people who are molested by these wandering horses.  This letter said that if the matter was not resolved that very soon violence would be done. The Minister knows well that it is only when such threats are issued and when they are followed up by any degree of public indignation, which is likely to cause a riot, the Department of Justice bothers about the matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing the Garda are doing <Col N="213" /> when the position becomes intolerable is that a man is sent around on a bicycle and he chases the horses out to the nearest field.  Once he has them grazing in the field he goes off and hopes he will not be disturbed again before the morning.  They are not brought to the pound in Churchtown for the simple reason that so many Gardaí would be needed to bring the horses across the city to that pound that the areas where the animals were originally found would be left without any police protection for several hours.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that immediate and drastic action be taken to provide at least two more pounds on the south side and as many more new pounds on the north side of the city.  I cannot speak with any intimate knowledge of the problem on the north side but I am sure that areas like Finglas and the further regions of Cabra must be in a similar plight to that of the unfortunate people in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown and Bluebell.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say we cannot afford the expense.  I do not know whether anybody has tried to measure the cost of damage to private property, the cost of injuries which may have been sustained by cyclists and pedestrians or the cost of frights suffered by young children and women on dark roads at night when these horses come pounding along.  If we had more pounds and if they were used as they ought to be used and if the fines imposed on people wanting to get their animals out of these pounds were stiff enough the pounds would make not a loss but a considerable profit in a very short time, and within another short time it might be possible to close them down.  We will have to convince itinerants and other owners of wandering animals&mdash;they are not all itinerants &mdash;that it would be better for them to rent a couple of acres of a field and to buy feeding stuffs for their animals than to pay the poundage fines night after night.  It is only when they are made respect the rights of other people and when they are made to pay heavy fines that they will bother to provide the necessary accommodation for their animals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> As I mentioned last night, we were told that a year ago it was necessary to have a new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice to resolve this matter.  A year has passed by and nothing has been done except to have a commission sitting on the matter. Sitting is about all they appear to be doing because, while for years past the matter has been carelessly and indifferently handled by the Gardaí and local authorities, it has become very much worse within the past year.  Having passed the buck to a commission in this case, we were then told recently that one of the justifications for the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice was the necessity to deal with the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>What record of achievement do we find here?  We find that a couple of weeks before Christmas a plan which had been drafted many years ago was implemented at perhaps the worst time of the year to implement anything of that kind.  While in the long run it has worked out to some advantage, it certainly was not necessary to create a post which has cost over £5,000 a year to make a simple order, a commissioner's order, specifying certain streets as being one way streets and certain streets as not being available for parking.  It is ludicrous to suggest that it is necessary to have a £5,000 post to make a few simple orders.</P>
    <P>One courageous man could solve the Dublin traffic problem within a month. It is being done piecemeal at the moment.  Notices are put up here and there, and no sooner are they up than there is a game to see how often one can get away with disobeying them. In the past couple of weeks, &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs were erected in Clanbrassil Street and South Richmond Street to indicate that there were two lanes of traffic and there could be no parking.  Such signs are erected, but there is no serious effort to have them respected.  The result is that people in this city become lackadaisical and indifferent about their traffic obligations. It would be far better to have no regulations than to have regulations and signs which are not enforced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> We have also had another contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary. He has given white sticks, called batons, to the Gardaí, allegedly for the purpose of providing better control of traffic.  I state categorically that they are confusing.  They are ridiculous, and even if they had some value&mdash;and possibly they might have some value&mdash;it would appear that the members of the Garda have not been trained in their proper use.  Many of them whirl these sticks around like a lady with an umbrella at a bus stop impatiently waiting for a bus.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This morning, I was crossing at a junction in the city and I saw one man on point duty holding the stick across his shoulder as if it were a shillelagh or as if he were Dick Whittington walking into the city.  The only thing missing was the proverbial red bag with the white dots.  Generally speaking, these white batons are being used in a most confusing and careless manner.  If training in the use of them has been given, it is not being observed.  If training was not given, it is time it was given and the batons should be withdrawn until it has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, and to the minds of very many pedestrians and motorists in the city, the raised hand of a member of the Garda was far more strict and far more forbidding than these white batons, indifferently held in many cases.  Many members of the force also use them with the right hand, without using the left hand, and most of us do not know whether we are getting a &ldquo;stop&rdquo; or a &ldquo;come on&rdquo; signal.  It may be that the Parliamentary Secretary with his car and his two chauffeurs does not keep an eye out for these things himself but the Minister has a duty&mdash;and it transcends any duty given to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and the Commissioner of the Garda has a duty, and if they intend to do their duty, they should know that what I say in this regard <Col N="216" /> is true.  There will be some serious accident or some unfair prosecution, if something is not done about the use of these weapons&mdash;because they are dangerous weapons, certainly, so long as they are used as they are being used at present.</P>
    <P>Many people were appalled to see the photograph in the papers in recent weeks of a member of the Garda with a white band on his hat and a short white coat, for use, we are told, during the summer.  I do not think it lends any dignity to the Garda to dress them like icecream salesmen.  We are lowering the prestige and dignity of the force by putting Gardaí in particular streets in these short white coats&mdash;like page boys or icecream vendors.  I strongly urge that they should be discarded immediately and given to some icecream merchant or whoever wants to use them.</P>
    <P>Aesthetically, they will never look well because, if a Garda is doing his duty properly, he has to raise his hands to various levels.  If one looks at the photograph of the unfortunate person who modelled the white coat, one notices there is a considerable slant in the line of the coat and, against the navy blue trousers, it looks as if it does not fit the man at all.  The only way of curing the slant in the drape of the coat is to make one side longer than the other, but then when the man puts his hands down, he will look even more ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I believe we were right some years ago to relieve the Gardaí on point duty in the city on hot summer days of the obligation to wear a jacket.  They looked a fine body of men and most respectable, when they were turned out in trousers and shirt.  They looked well and the people respected them. Perhaps they looked bigger and more forbidding.  Certainly these little white coats look ridiculous.  I notice that the model chosen had a good figure and was not too wide at the waist, but what would an unfortunate middle-aged man look like?  I suppose the coats would reach the same level, but they would hardly cross their chests in some cases.  I strongly urge that the Garda would have the respect of the citizenry <Col N="217" /> and look well before the tourists&mdash;not that I consider that is an important consideration, but it is a consideration in the minds of some people&mdash;if these icecream coats and white bands on their hats were cancelled immediately.</P>
    <P>One would have hoped, when we were told the Parliamentary Secretary was considering establishment and other matters in the courts, that something might have been done about the atrocious delays which occur, day in and day out, in many Government offices and court offices.  These delays are a serious contributory factor to the law's delays at which the layman loves to scoff.  In many offices, the delays have got worse than they were.  In his statement on this Estimate, the Minister showed himself to be completely out of touch with many Departments when he said he was not aware that there were delays.</P>
    <P>There are delays in the Registry of Deeds certainly.  At one time, it was possible to get a negative search bespoken and available before the close of a sale.  Perhaps all members might not know that a negative search is a search which a solicitor causes to be made in the Registry of Deeds for any mortgages or assignments or items of that nature which exist in relation to a property.  That search must be made to protect the purchasers of houses, to ensure there is no outstanding mortgage or that no one, other than the person who purports to be the owner, has any interest in the property.</P>
    <P>A negative search is of very great importance because it is a search which is the responsibility of the State.  Even if there is a mistake made in the furnishing of a negative search, the responsibility lies upon the State. The State has to make good the loss to a person who acts upon a negative search.  But because of the delays in the Registry of Deeds solicitors have to rely upon searches made either by themselves or members of their staffs or firms who specialise in these searches.  If there is any mistake in these searches the responsibility does not lie upon the State but upon the solicitor who employed the people involved.  That is just not good enough. <Col N="218" /> The fees for searches, unlike fees for many other things, have increased in recent years.  Some drastic steps will have to be taken to expedite the issue of negative searches in time for the closing of sales.</P>
    <P>There is one office which is a laugh in this modern age.  It is the Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy. The Official Assignee in Bankruptcy collects 10 per cent. of all assets, and for that he gives a totally inadequate service to the public.  The result is that it takes years and years in some cases to wind up the affairs of bankrupt estates.  That is not fair either to the unfortunate bankrupt or to the creditors. I appreciate that, perhaps, the only remedy for this is to amend drastically the law on bankruptcy.  We on this side hope the day is not far distant before remedial legislation will be introduced in that regard.  Nevertheless, there is scope for improvement in the handling of the bankruptcy system generally.  I appreciate that, perhaps, the blame does not lie on those in immediate control.  If it is because the headquarters staff in the Department of Justice have been niggardly in providing staff accommodation and funds for this office, it is about time they mended their ways. They make a profit out of this office and a substantial amount of money is available.  They collect their fees before anybody else, and it is about time something were done to improve the matter.</P>
    <P>When the Solicitors Bill was being discussed last year, opportunity was taken by members of the profession on both sides to point out that overheads in solicitors' offices were considerable and that one of the reasons for these overheads was the grossly inefficient and outdated methods in many court and Government offices to which solicitors have to resort.  We still have obligations upon solicitors whereby they have to attend, either themselves or members of their staffs, at court or Government offices for the presentation of documents which could well be transmitted through the threepenny post. The result of all that ridiculous and Gilbertian procedure is that delay is caused to productive work in legal <Col N="219" /> offices.  It is bad enough to have to attend but in some cases, as in the Stamp Office in Dublin Castle, those attending with documents have to join long queues and waste many hours before they can return to their offices.</P>
    <P>Another problem which ought to be easily remedied is the problem of stamping court documents.  At present in the Four Courts the high court office is on one floor; the circuit court office is two storeys above it and the district court office is away in another part of the building.  Solicitors sometimes have to attend at these places.  The length of the Four Courts is longer than the furthest length of Leinster House, and Deputies not infrequently complain about the long corridors they have to walk to get from one end of the building to another.  But if on top of that you had to climb two or three storeys, you would become very exasperated indeed.  But that is what happens day in and day out in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>Solicitors and their assistants have to attend at these offices.  Going in they are informed what stamps have to be impressed on the document.  They have to go down two flights of stairs to the Stamp Office and join a queue to have the documents stamped.  They might find something else requires to be done, and the same amount of walking has to be done all over again.  It is a most wasteful and unnecessary procedure.  It ought to be possible either to have automatic stamping machines in the different offices, or else the money should be handed over the counter when the documents are received.  It should be a very simple thing to keep an account. If the fee in a defence in the High Court is 7/6d and if there are 30 defences in the office at the end of the day, then the clerk ought to be able to account for 30 seven and sixpences.  It should not be necessary to have to waddle along the corridors and join the queue to get a stamp impressed upon a document.</P>
    <P>That may sound confusing and a bit ludicrous to the members of this House but in practice it is ten times <Col N="220" /> worse.  There are some documents on which you have to impress a stamp and others on which you have to lick a stamp.  They might well be documents going to the same office, but the Rules of Court and the practice of the courts require that in some cases the stamp be impressed and in others licked on.  All this is foolish and a waste of time.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, if he is going to remain there, which we hope will not be very much longer, would be better occupied trying to get rid of some of these atrocious ways of officialdom and to improve the lot of the people who resort to these offices.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Office of the Minister for Justice which does not receive the attention it ought is the petitions section.  I wonder if we are right in granting the number of petitions we do grant?  It is true, for some strange reason or other, that more petitions come from the rural areas than from Dublin.  From my own professional experience in Dublin I know of very few cases in which petitions are lodged against fines or other penalties imposed by the courts. In any event, from figures I obtained recently it appears that the average run of petitions here is around 1,200 per year, that is, about 100 every month or 25 per week.  For the last four years one quarter of these petitions have been granted in one way or another.  That amounts either to a reflection on the Judiciary or on the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that most Ministers dealing with petitions will not lightly vary the order of the judge or district justice.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister and his Departmental advisers do not lightly grant these petitions, but we as a nation have granted, perhaps, more petitions than we ought to have granted.  Certainly, looking at the figures for other countries, I have not been able to find anywhere any figures which reach anything like 25 per cent of remissions.  The highest I was able to find was one of about ten per cent. Across the water it is something less than five per cent.  Here we have the <Col N="221" /> position that, of the people who appealed to the Minister against decisions of the courts, one quarter got their fines or penalties mitigated.  I believe that members of the Judiciary are aware of this practice.  The result probably is that many members of the Judiciary, when imposing penalties, have regard to possible reductions which may be made later on by the Minister.  Therefore, in the overall picture, we may have greater severity than we ought to have and only the lucky defaulter gets any reduction.</P>
    <P>We know that no matter how principled the Minister may be he is subject to certain pressures and strains sometimes not only from Deputies of his own Party but from Deputies from all sides of the House who keep pestering him until a reduction is made. Then, being human, it is quite possible that a small percentage of petitions are granted in order to get rid of the persons who are pestering the unfortunate Minister.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that we should have an abuse of the petitions procedure.  That it is necessary, I would be the first to argue.  There are many cases where the full facts, the economic and family circumstances of the accused, may not be known at the time of conviction.  In such circumstances, it is only appropriate that there should be some system which would allow the penalties to be remitted or reduced where there is extreme hardship.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on our whole judicial procedure when there are so many petitions to the Minister and so many are allowed.  I would hope there would be a stiffening-up, on this matter and, at the same time, that there would be an indication that the same percentage of petitions will not be granted in future.  If that were done, the justice would not impose penalties and fines with a view to their being reduced by the Minister later on.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would utter a word of slight criticism in relation to the <i>obiter dicta</i> of some Justices and Judges from time to time.  It has happened from my experience and I have seen it in court that a justice on some occasions, when imposing penalties, <Col N="222" /> recommends that the person penalised should petition the Minister saying that he, the Justice, would be prepared to support the petition.  I think that is very bad.  Either we have our own independent courts which operate independently and fearlessly or we have not.  Certainly, we should not have any member of our Judiciary allocating punishment and in the same breath saying, in effect &ldquo;I think the court may not have done right today and if the person wants to petition against it he ought to do so and I will support him.&rdquo;  We should have a fearless Judiciary who will impose penalties as the cases merit.</P>
    <P>I had occasion in the course of the year to ask a question concerning a certain film which was rejected by the Censor and subsequently approved for limited exhibition by the Film Appeals Board.  At the time I asked the question originally I had not seen the film but I was aware that it had been issued for limited circulation to people over 18 years of age, which might include some children.  The name of the film was <i>The Summer of the Seventeenth Doll.</i></P>
    <P>I was having my summer holiday at a seaside resort on the east coast. This film came down for exhibition. There was no indication, good, bad or indifferent either in writing or by oral announcement outside the cinema or in the foyer that the film was limited to people over 18 years of age.  I went in and saw the film.  When the lights went on at the end there, in the rows customarily reserved for children under 14 years of age, were about 24 or 36 children.  When I asked the Minister about this he said, perhaps facetiously, that I could not expect or was I suggesting that the Gardaí ought to go around checking the age of every person going into a cinema, seeing that any person in short trousers was kept out, and all that sort of thing.  I am not suggesting any such thing.</P>
    <P>I am not setting myself up as a moralist.  I am not expressing any particular opinion on that film but I say that if we have laws and if we have a system in operation which allows certain films to be seen provided they are not seen by people under a certain <Col N="223" /> age we ought to take some reasonable steps to ensure that a certificate issued in such circumstances is respected.</P>
    <P>It surely is a reasonable obligation to require that every advertisement for such a film will carry a note to the effect that it may not be seen by anybody under 18 years of age.  Surely we might go a little further and look for the co-operation of the film industry to the extent that where such a film is to be shown advance notice will be given to the Gardaí in the appropriate town or village.  While not asking the Gardaí to stand at the door, to stop and check each person going in, and to look at their birth certificates, at the same time some reasonable awareness of the limited certificate should circulate through the town.  The Gardaí could look in now and then and if they saw as I did some 24 to 36 youngsters in short pants watching the film or such a film then appropriate action might be taken.</P>
    <P>On the occasion on which I raised this matter the Minister said it was open to me to report it.  I have no desire to act as a common informer to a Department which is failing in its own obligations.  Whatever about the past, I hope appropriate action will be taken in the future to see that where limited certificates are issued they will be respected.  If that is not to be done, let us abolish the system of limited certificates and not pretend we are protecting our young people from such films circulating throughout the country.  We should not act the hypocrite. There are obvious ways of taking the necessary precautions.  I am not suggesting there will not be abuses in the future or that it will keep out each and every child but it will certainly prevent a large number of children from seeing these objectionable films.</P>
    <P>I am aware that such certificates are respected in the first-run cinemas in the main streets of Dublin city but I think that is about as far as it goes.  When I originally put this matter before the Minister I said such certificates were not respected <Col N="224" /> throughout the length and breadth of the land once the first run of the film was over.  From my personal experience and from what I have heard from others, it would appear that what I said on that occasion is true.  It is about time, therefore, some steps were taken to curb that highly objectionable practice.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past year the Rent Restrictions Bill was introduced. Funnily enough, although the Rent Restrictions Bill was intended to lift certain restrictions, some of us warned that it would cause a certain amount of hardship.  While designed to relieve hardship in one sector, it was opening the way to serious hardship for other people.  I am afraid the prophets of misfortune have in many cases been proved right.  In recent months, I have heard of a number of small shopkeepers who have been in a small way of business for many years and just about making ends meet and who have had to close their doors, pack up and find some other means of livelihood or retire because the increases in rent which have been made possible by the Rent Restrictions Bill were just sufficient to soak up any good which was in the business.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be well aware that, in many of the back streets in Dublin where tenement houses have been demolished and flats not yet built, there are several small hucksters remaining on waiting for the day when flats may be built and the population may drift back to the city centre.  For such people an increase of £1 or 30/- a week in rent is a very serious hardship. Such cases are occurring and I ask the Minister to look into the matter and consider whether some steps might be taken to protect small people of that type.  There was also objection to that Bill on the ground that it was allowing increases to landlords in respect of repairs which they might not carry out.  That appears to be happening all over the place.  The landlords have been very quick in imposing the increases, but they have not shown the same enthusiasm in respect of their obligations.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply that the tenants have their rights to force the <Col N="225" /> landlords to execute repairs.  Unfortunately we have no system of free legal aid and it can be a most costly process to force a landlord to carry out repairs.  The practice in many of our courts in such cases has been, even where a decree is awarded to the tenant, to provide that each side bears its own costs.  I hope the Minister will take another look at the Act and consider whether some steps are necessary to ensure that landlords execute repairs where they are obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>To return to the police force in Dublin&mdash;we have many prosecutions brought under the Dublin Police Act of 1842.  There are many things in that Act which are rather incongruous and unsuitable to our modern conditions. I have known cases where prosecutions brought under that Act were really vexatious.  I have seen cases of unfortunate people of limited means having vexatious prosecutions brought against them under that Act.  One case that comes to mind was that of a housewife who was tidying up her garden into which some children had thrown the insides of a mattress which had earlier been dropped by some passing itinerants. The owner of the garden was a prizewinner over many years in a local garden competition.  His garden, in the middle of this working-class area, was a credit to him and was such, indeed, as to improve the appearance of the whole neighbourhood and an encouragement to the neighbours to keep gardens of a similar kind.  Finding this rubbish in the garden, damaging her flowers, the housewife was sweeping it out on to the footpath where there was a vast accumulation of the insides of mattresses when a Garda came along and told her she should put it in the bin.  She did so.  Returning some time later, the Garda found this woman sweeping the path outside her house and he insisted that she was committing an offence, that the litter was hers as it was within her bailiwick.</P>
    <P>A prosecution was brought and she was fined under the Dublin Police Act of 1842.  That occurred in an area in which, it is said, many people are <Col N="226" /> criminally inclined.  I shall not mention the area as it might cause offence. It is in an area where many roads have 600 or 700 houses and if one person from the road is in court every person in the road is labelled in consequence. Where you have such an area in which it is necessary to have co-operation between the public and the Garda I suggest you will not get that co-operation where you have vexatious prosecutions against a person who, as in this case, was breaking the letter of the law in sweeping dirt from her own premises on to the highway, but who was certainly observing the spirit of the law in trying to keep her own place clean and tidy.  It may well be that in this instance&mdash;I think it did happen&mdash;there were certain acrimonious words between the woman and the Garda.  She probably told the Garda where to go when he spoke to her, but I am certain one word borrowed another.  We want to bring about co-operation between the people in these areas and the Garda but we will certainly not do that if we have vexatious prosecutions of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that it is open to anybody to complain to the local superintendent, if such conduct occurs, but the ordinary person does not know that.  In any case, it is very little use doing that after the event.  Such people go to court believing they will get off but find themselves hamstrung by the Act of 1842.  While there are many things in that Act quite appropriate, although couched in archaic language, it is an Act that might be examined and brought up to date to meet modern conditions.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing for the country, I suppose, even if it is an annoying thing for Fine Gael Deputies, that as soon as they make a suggestion or give any advice the Government immediately act.  Knowing that, we of the Fine Gael Party have been, for the past year, vehement about the condition of many of our Garda stations and the facilities available to the Garda.  We had a very well-timed announcement last week that something was to be done.  It would be churlish of me not to express my joy that something is being done and <Col N="227" /> it would be churlish of the Government not to admit that they were under pressure from Fine Gael to do something. If our economy is as prosperous as it is alleged to be, the relatively small amount of money necessary to put Garda stations right should be available.  It is a small sum in relation to national expenditure, but it is a considerable amount because a considerable amount of work must be done.  I believe it is a priority requirement and should take priority over other things.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in recent years about the fact that our prisoners had spring beds.  I think I am right in saying that the beds issued to prisoners are the same as the beds issued to the Garda.  I may be wrong and, if so, I am open to correction.  I know that many of these beds were never intended to be slept in by Gardaí averaging 12 to 14 stone in weight and built proportionately.  Many of them are heavier.  The beds issued to them are utterly inadequate and could not be expected to provide the necessary comfort for sound sleep essential for those in sedentary occupations; neither are they suitable for a man on his feet on patrol all day.  He is entitled to a more comfortable bed than that offered to him in his barracks at the moment.  I do not know if any improvement has taken place recently in regard to press accommodation and privacy.  Up to recently&mdash;I hope it has been corrected; it ought to be&mdash; Gardai had no presses, lockers or cupboards in which to put their own private property.  It had to be left in the middle of the room or the Garda had to invest a few shillings in securing some privacy for his possessions. In some cases he could not do that because there was barely enough room for beds without presses or cupboards.</P>
    <P>Not so long since we had in Dublin a position in which members of the Garda had to sleep in cells.  The offices in Green Street today are quite unsuitable. In the past they must have been cellars or dungeons; I do not know which.  The conditions in which the police have to work are absolutely deplorable.  The Department of Agriculture <Col N="228" /> would penalise severely any farmer who kept his animals under such conditions.  In Rathmines the facilities are deplorable.  Anything the Minister can do to alleviate conditions generally is welcome.  I believe such an approach will pay because it will mean a more contented force.</P>
    <P>Many of the Garda at present come from very comfortable homes and part of the frustration, annoyance and irritation, where the young members are concerned, is related not only to pay but also to the conditions under which they have to live in many of our stations.  I notice that the idea is to have a nation-wide survey conducted by a superintendent.  I am always afraid of surveys.  It will take the man a year to complete the survey.  He will then come back and the next Estimate will have been passed.  It will be two years, therefore, before anything will be done. So much could be done right away that I hope the work will be embarked upon without any delay of any kind.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board has been working very successfully and it is appropriate that we should take this opportunity of expressing our appreciation of the work done by those associated with legal adoption.  It is an excellent thing that such a scheme, a scheme about which many people had many doubts, has operated so successfully.</P>
    <P>Any criticisms I have offered are not intended to be carping criticisms, though the Minister, being a politician like myself, might regard them as such. The criticisms I have offered reflect the opinions of many.  One must examine an Estimate for a Department like the Department of Justice in a critical manner.  Many people consider the Department an unimportant one.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I believe the Department of Justice is one of the most important Departments of State. Lest the Minister feel I have no authority for that view I would refer him to the remarks of Deputy de Valera sitting on this side of the House in 1954.  He said the Department of Justice was the most important Department of state.  Unfortunately he then went on to say how wrong it was of Deputy Costello, Taoiseach at that time, to appoint a Labour man to such <Col N="229" /> an important Ministry as the liberties of the people might be taken away. That was quite a shocking allegation. Perhaps he now regrets having made it. I hope he does.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice is an important Department because it is so concerned with the liberty of the individual. Anything I have said with relation to the new office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice does not detract in any way from the importance of the Department itself.  This superfluous, redundant appointment is having a bad effect upon the Department.  Some years ago it was said by one in a position to judge that it could be said for the Department of Justice, but not for any other Department, that it had never lost its sense of proportion.  It had not unnecessarily expanded.  Parkinson's Law did not operate.  Unfortunately there has been a breach in the walls in recent years, and that at a time when the work should be growing less.  We have a perfect example of the operation of Parkinson's Law in the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary, his private secretary, his two chauffeurs, his car, and his office accommodation, plus the other ancillary posts.</P>
    <P>There is in the Estimates at page 84 an increase of £7,199 in the wages of headquarters staff.  The Minister rushed rather breathlessly through that when introducing his Estimate. He attributed the increase to an increase in salaries.  We know for a fact that the increase includes at least two of the items I have mentioned. Some of the increases are concealed in other Votes.  There is a sum of at least £2,000 odd on the Estimate for the headquarters staff, and all because of the unnecessary appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The other Estimates have not increased by a like amount.  If the increase were attributable to increases in salaries, there would have been similiar increases in other sections of the Department.  There are no such increases.  Last year this appointment was made subsequent to the introduction <Col N="230" /> of the Estimate here.  Because of that the money to pay for this unnecessary and expensive appointment had to be obtained out of the moneys allocated last year.  Because of the anxiety of the Minister not to face the House with a Supplementary Estimate certain essential routine jobs in the Department were neglected.  But the Minister did have to come in with a Supplementary Estimate.  It was alleged to be for another reason.  It is shocking that essential operations of the Department of Justice should be neglected in order to save pounds, shillings and pence so that the Minister could avoid the embarrassment he ought to feel in coming to the House with a Supplementary Estimate to cover a wholly unnecessary appointment.</P>
    <P>Those of us who criticise the appointment are not doing so without cause.  If it could be justified the Minister could have come in openly and courageously with his Supplementary Estimate, but he knew that there were people on this side of the House in a position to challenge the appointment and he resorted to this shabby subterfuge of trying to conceal the increased cost of the Department by talking of the necessary routine work which had to be carried on.  I hope the Taoiseach will revert to the position he took up at the beginning; when the appointment was made he said it was for temporary convenience.  The facts which governed the situation then still operate.  The Minister has been engaged in this House for far shorter hours than many of his colleagues who have no Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <P>I feel that the installation of water and sewerage services in country Garda stations is not being pushed ahead as fast as it should be.  I know of stations in the west, where there is running water piped under the road outside, but it has not yet been connected to the Garda stations.  I know of one that has been connected in the past 12 months, but in general where there is no running water, the least the Department of Justice could do, where there is no piped water, is to build their own concrete tanks and supply the stations with water and sewerage facilities.  Hot and cold running water should be supplied to each station; the Garda are entitled to that comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard of lot of criticism of the introduction of white batons for police on point duty and it has been said that motorists are unable to identify the signals given by these point-duty men.  From the criticisms I have heard, I think it is because of the manner in which they swing the baton when giving their signals and it has been said that the hand signal is much clearer.  I am inclined to agree with that.  It is all right when he raises the baton in the air to stop the traffic, but when he swings it sideways to beckon traffic to proceed it can be very deceptive.  Last Thursday, I saw a motorist misinterpreting a signal and the Guard on point duty followed him and left the traffic in a mess.  On the <Col N="232" /> occasion, I think he could have taken it that the motorist had misinterpreted the signal.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the way this Estimate has been drawn up and submitted.  I should like also to congratulate the Guards throughout the country.  They are very efficient and it would be wrong to criticise them.  They are doing a good job and, at times, a hard and trying job.  The Ban-Ghardaí have been mentioned and I understand they have been sent to Cork and that they are to be sent to Limerick.  They are a credit to the force and I think they should be assigned to all stations.</P>
    <P>In view of the increase in traffic nowadays, I think that more point duty should be done in towns and cities where there are no traffic lights. I remember when point duty was done in Galway fifteen or twenty years ago, but I am sorry to say that nowadays we do not see anybody on point duty. Traffic seems to get along all right, but there would be greater safety, particularly at crossings, if there were men on point duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have waited deliberately to intervene in this debate because there is a matter about which I am extremely uncomfortable and which I think should be brought to the attention of the House.  It is necessary for me to say that the matter to which I propose to refer does not arise in the constituency I represent. I suppose when one occupies the position of leader of a Party, matters reach one through correspondence and otherwise which, perhaps, would not come to a Deputy's ears if they do not arise in his own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular evil does not obtain in County Monaghan but I have been shocked by the number of complaints that reach me about a practice which has grown up, a practice which, in my judgment, strikes at the very root of justice and its dispensation.  It is that in certain parts of the country when the district justice comes to hold his court and dispose of the criminal business, it has become notorious that, <Col N="233" /> before the court sits, he enters into a conference with the Garda superintendent and the State Solicitor.  I think that evil has grown up through an excessively casual treatment of the administration of the criminal law in minor matters, but there is no more precious principle to establish and maintain in this or any other country than that the judiciary is independent and that any citizen of this State who finds himself at variance with the Executive, either in criminal matters or otherwise, is certain that, on going into court, he will hear his case tried and disposed of by an independent judge who will act on the presumption that the defendant is innocent until the State has proved him in open court to be guilty.</P>
    <P>That cannot be true if the district justice is closeted with the principal Garda officer of the district, or with the State Solicitor, before he holds his court for the purpose of disposing of criminal business.  That is a practice that ought to be stopped and I suggest to the Minister that it is his duty, either himself or through the judge with the responsibility for the district court, to make it known that the practice has become an abuse and must stop and that the duty of the district justice, particularly when he attends to discharge criminal business, is to hold himself absolutely independent of both the Garda and the litigants until their causes have been disposed of in the court over which he presides.</P>
    <P>I have got a duty to say, although I find it distressing to have to say it, that it has been reported to me that on occasions circuit court judges attending at their circuit town to preside over criminal business have been known to enter into conference with the State Solicitor prior to the sitting of their court.  These evils have arisen, in my judgment, because people have ceased to respect the fundamental principle that the administration of the law, particularly the administration of the criminal law, must be above all suspicion and that the humblest defendant in the most trivial criminal cause is entitled to the certainty that he will be deemed by the court to be <Col N="234" /> innocent until the State has discharged its obligation of proving in open court that he is guilty.</P>

      <P>But he should not.  I have often heard Deputy Dr. Browne here talking about the desirability of abolishing all the panoply of the judge's arrival, the guard of honour, and so forth.  These are the things designed to emphasise that the judge attends as an absolutely independent and detached person and that he will hear a case discussed only in public in his court and will there dispense justice.  It rather shocks me to hear the Minister intervene to say maybe he is going to see the State Solicitor about something else.  What else could it be? What business has he with the State Solicitor at the circuit court?  The State Solicitor is there to prosecute people before the court.  What other business has he there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the burden of proof rests upon the State and that it must be discharged in the court in public.  I think, if the Minister makes inquiries, he will find, as he has not infrequently found before, that when I direct his attention to a matter of this kind I do not do so without grave deliberation and without good cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that in respect of the circuit court it is exceptional, but happens, and I say that in the district court it is becoming much too frequent.  If the Minister will consult some of his own colleagues they will tell him that what I am saying is true. I believe it arises from an excess of the informality which certain ill-advised Deputies have sometimes sought to urge upon us, a tendency to forget that, although the district justice is a familiar figure in the towns where he has judicial responsibility, he still is a judge and as such should keep the Garda 100 miles away from him and the State Solicitor 100 miles away from him until the criminal cases in his court have been disposed of. Then, if they want to meet in the club or anywhere else and discuss the golf course or anything else, that is all right.  But, as between the State represented by the Garda and the State Solicitor and the defendant, however humble, the district justice is a judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the impropriety of any prior discussion with the State Solicitor or with the Garda authorities, if there was never any impropriety, it is vitally important for the respect in which the law should be held that justice should not only be done but should appear to be done.  It is quite impossible to hope for that if it is generally known that before the criminal business of the court was entered upon a district justice has conferred <Col N="236" /> with the Garda authorities and the State Solicitor.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I can turn to matters which are of more routine character. I have heard the case argued in this House and elsewhere for many years of the desirability of effecting economies by reducing the number of Gardaí in rural stations and I have been told that perfectly adequate supervision can be maintained by Garda patrols.  I want to say with all the emphasis I can command that there can be no more fundamental error than this belief, if our purpose is to prevent crime rather than to detect it, and I think that is our purpose.  The ideal is that there should be no crime to detect and, if that is the ideal towards which we are working, the Garda on the beat or the Garda in the rural station is the supreme guarantee against the occurrence of crime.  It may be true that the motorised patrol can be a useful instrument for the detection of crime.  I want to ensure its prevention.</P>
    <P>Take any small town in Ireland with three or four Gardaí in the station who have established intimate and confidential relations with the people and the people have come to look upon them as their friends.  No crime can be committed in that community substantial information about which will not be in the hands of the Garda within 24 hours.  It is that knowledge that prevents crime and that deters many young people from falling into petty crime.  They know they cannot get away with it.</P>
    <P>If that Garda station is abolished and the Garda service is provided by a motorised patrol from a station eight or nine miles distant, many a youngster will attempt pilfering or minor crime of that kind in the belief that he will get away with it.  It is the knowledge that the Garda know him and all about him and are his familiar friends and that they know all his friends that keeps many a youngster on the rails in these critical and difficult years and that preserves the peace as it is preserved in the vast majority of rural communities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is so little serious crime in rural Ireland that we may fall into the <Col N="237" /> error of ceasing to rejoice in the immunity we enjoy and become careless and make up our minds that we can remove the Garda into relatively large centres and carry out rural patrol by motorised units.  If we do, the very evil that we have now so successfully averted by the relationship which has been built up between the people and the Garda scattered through the various stations in the country will be upon us, and we might find it very difficult indeed to get back to the eminently desirable position of freedom from crime in rural Ireland which we at present enjoy and which, I believe, is in a large measure due to the ubiquity of the Garda and to the confidential relationship between them and the people they serve.</P>
    <P>I do feel it is necessary to press on the Minister for Justice, who is a Dublin man, and on his Parliamentary Secretary, who is also a Dublin man, the fact that the Garda in rural Ireland are not looked upon primarily as law enforcement officers.  If there is any emergency it is the natural thing to look to the Garda station for help and assistance.  It is that relationship between the Garda and the people which supplies the Garda with a ready source of information if there has been any criminal offence in the district. For one reason, the people think that the Garda will be reasonable and, if a youngster has done something wrong, they will not be too hard on him, while, at the same time, exercising the necessary restraint and, secondly, the Garda know so many people that, if serious crime has been committed from some source or other, he will get the information necessary to detect the crime.  It would be tragic if we broke up that whole relationship that has been built up over the last 30 or 40 years.  If we do so we might pay a very serious penalty.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I wish to refer has also been raised by Deputy Geoghegan.  Under the new Garda wages policy, they receive a certain sum as wages and they pay us £1 per week for accommodation if they are single men.  I suggest to the Minister that that imposes on us an obligation to provide them with decent accommodation. <Col N="238" /> The minimum decent accommodation with which they should be provided is a comfortable bed, hot and cold water in which to wash themselves and a water closet for their use.  These three are a modest minima but they do not exist in a great many Garda stations in the country and they ought to be provided forthwith.  I could, with reason, advocate more than I am suggesting here as the minima but at this stage the plain fact is that those minima are not provided&mdash;a comfortable bed, hot and cold water and a water closet.  The Minister should concern himself to see that those minima are provided forthwith in every station and then proceed at leisure with his general programme for the replacement of unsuitable stations.</P>
    <P>The next point has to do with the taking of depositions in the district courts.  This is one of the extraordinary procedures which people sit down and accept as an inevitable evil. It really need not be.  There is no reason in the world why these depositions should be taken down in longhand by a scribe much as it was done in the days of the Pharaohs of Egypt. I understand that they are taken in longhand and then read back.  We have had cases in the city of Dublin where criminals are remanded in custody for weeks while the elaborate procedure of taking down the deposition in longhand goes on.</P>
    <P>There is no other branch of human activity in which scribes still function in longhand.  You can buy for £25 a tape recorder which will take down every word anybody utters and practically every breath they draw.  The modern installation is such that you can wire up a district court and, if you want to be particularly careful, you can use a central recording machine and put up loudspeakers on the witness stand, the judges' bench and on the solicitors' bench.  Whether you do it by that elaborate procedure or by simple tape recorder, I believe that the time used in taking depositions could be reduced by two-thirds if modern methods were installed.  I suggest to the Minister that immediate steps ought to be taken to persuade <Col N="239" /> the courts to adopt a procedure of that kind.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another point and here, again, I sometimes feel that I am like Cassandra.  I see things ten years too soon.  Nobody believes me and then, ten years later, when everybody sees them it is unfortunately too late or grave damage has been done because they have not been seen before. If all the new parking regulations that are going to become part of our daily lives under the new traffic regulations are to be enforced by the ordinary Garda you are going to set up in this society an antagonism between one section of the community and the Garda where there never was antagonism before.</P>
    <P>We have at present a number of Gardaí who have retired at the age of 60 years and members of the Army who are retired at 60 years.  From this body of men it would be quite easy to recruit traffic wardens who would have a different uniform and who would have a restricted duty of enforcing traffic and other regulations. I quite agree that there may be a difficulty about drawing a line as to where their duties begin and end but all the minor business about parking, about giving people tickets and about standing beside their cars could be cast off on that body of men and the Garda could be cut out altogether.</P>
    <P>Until very recently the sight of a Garda was a source of satisfaction to me because it reminded me that they are a fine body of men.  Now, if I see a Garda near my car, my stomach turns over and I wonder if I am going to be upbraided by him or if I am going to be charged.  It has never happened to me in my life but it is fantastic the effect it can have on one's whole relationship with the Garda. Instead of regarding members of the Garda as our normal friends I am beginning to feel like a ticket of leave man, like the unfortunate man feels when he is waiting to be arrested and sees a uniformed Garda.</P>
    <P>Surely that is an unhealthy situation. Surely it would be infinitely preferable that we should have traffic wardens when public reaction would be <Col N="240" /> that if this traffic warden acts like a Nosey Parker a member of the public could look around for an experienced Garda and say to him: &ldquo;Nosey Parker here does not know the law; he is making a damn nuisance of himself.&rdquo; In that way you would restore the old relationship between the Garda and the general public and instead of the Garda becoming a menace to many of us who find it extremely distressing when he even makes an appearance, the Garda would become a friend of the public again.  I do urge on the Minister to consider that and to realise that he has ready to his hand an ample pool of experienced people like ex-Gardai and ex-soldiers who would be glad in the years between 60 and 70 to discharge the relatively light duties of traffic wardens and get a pleasant supplement to their pensions as well.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister is the enamel dinner ware still being used in the prisons?  Surely with the availability of plastic cups, saucers and plates we could get rid of the loathsome old chipped enamel ware, even for those suffering labour terms of imprisonment. God knows they have enough to contend with without the added degradation of having their meals offered to them on what we all know to be the loathsome chipped enamel plate that is inevitable where enamel dinner ware is the ordinary equipment of institutions like prisons. Lastly I would urge on the Minister to try and provide a minimum standard of accommodation in the district courts in rural Ireland.  Some of them are being held in barns and backrooms. We cannot do it overnight but it might be possible for the Minister to turn his mind to it.  It is a matter which calls for prompt action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>Before Section 36 to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations following consultation with representatives of the workers and employers concerned providing for the payment of compensation to any driver of a specified class whose <Col N="243" /> employment is terminated as a result of his failure to pass a test for driving specified classes of vehicles, provided that the compensation referred to does not impose a charge on public funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House is more or less agreed on the desirability of driving tests and of physical fitness tests for drivers.  The Minister indicated very briefly a moment ago what these tests will entail. We all agree that drivers should be fit and competent to drive public vehicles especially large trucks, lorries and other such vehicles.  However, I wonder does the Minister and the House appreciate what might happen in respect of a driver of a public service vehicle or any of these other vehicles who fails to pass this test.  It would be very serious for a man who has been driving for a considerable part of his life to be deemed to be unfit to drive a vehicle, say, belonging to C.I.E. or to another company.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man who is 55 or 60 years of age and who has been driving a bus in the city of Dublin from the age of 20.  He had been trained as a bus driver and he does not know how to engage in any other occupation such as carpentry, plastering or plumbing and at his age he is not physically capable of taking up a job as a builder's labourer.  By what seems to be a simple section in a road traffic Bill we may deprive that man of his livelihood.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that in circumstances such as I have described this man would be compensated. I do not think it is sufficient to say that he can draw either sickness benefit or unemployment benefit or that he can take up another job.  The form of the compensation may be another matter but the onus to a large extent should be on the employer to compensate him in either of two ways. The man could be offered employment which would be deemed to be appropriate to him.  If he is a bus or lorry driver there is no use in offering him, at 60 years of age, a job in the heavy labouring class because having been driving for 35 or 40 years his physical condition would not enable him to <Col N="244" /> engage in such an occupation.  If it is not possible to find suitable alternative employment I suggest, as proposed in the amendment, that compensation should be provided for him.</P>
    <P>The Minister or somebody else might say that the provision of such compensation would be very difficult in the case of private employers.  Take the example of C.I.E.  Over the past couple of years C.I.E. found they had to dispense with the services of some of their staff, engine drivers, footplate men, foremen and others.  They were given compensation either by way of lump sum or pension.  Again it may be said that it is possible to do that because there is a pension scheme or because C.I.E. is a semi-State concern. I appreciate how difficult it may be to implement any sort of scheme that would provide compensation for these men but we should not be so much concerned with the difficulties of framing such a scheme as with the position of the men who may suddenly be deprived of what has been their livelihood for the greater part of their lives.</P>
    <P>It may not be a perfect analogy but there is provision for the compensation of men who are rendered incapable of carrying out their ordinary work due to an accident.  They are provided for through workmen's compensation which means that the worker who is insured&mdash;and the majority of workers in the country are insured&mdash;and who becomes incapable of carrying out his work is compensated to the extent of £4 10s. a week or by a lump sum.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House and the Minister in particular to consider, if not this amendment in its specific terms, what might be done in order to ensure that men who would lose their employment as a result of a provision in this Bill would be compensated either financially or by being given some other sort of employment by their employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in considerable sympathy with Deputy Corish on this point.  We are introducing a new restriction or prohibition in regard to employment which will arise in very few cases.  Deputy Corish, who has been extremely fair, has indicated he <Col N="245" /> understands there may be some administrative difficulties in bringing about the necessary arrangements, but it might be appropriate to bring such men within the ambit of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  The remuneration paid under the Acts would not be sufficient to compensate adequately such men, but there is a commission sitting at the moment which is considering the matter of workmen's compensation.  If this problem has not already been put before this commission for consideration it would appear to be a proper one for them to think about.</P>
      <P>Many of the illnesses and diseases which would cause a man to be deprived of a fitness certificate would not in many cases be such as would arise out of or in the course of his employment, but if a man between the ages of 55 and 60 has a bad heart it is arguable that the strain of driving a double-decker bus might have contributed something to it.  If it be necessary to amend the workmen's compensation code to bring such people within the benefit of such compensation it ought to be done.  It might be arguable from a drafting or legal point of view that it is a consideration which should not enter into this Bill, but I think it is something worthy of consideration and Deputy Corish and his colleague are to be congratulated on raising it.  We should avail of the opportunity of this Commission to consider the matter if the Minister will not include it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Though an excellent case might be made for this amendment, I feel it introduces into the Bill an inappropriate element.  It brings into the negotiations between the unions and employers the Minister for Local Government, and candidly I do not think that is an appropriate place for the Minister for Local Government. I do not think the introduction of the Minister would tend to bring about a settlement in the case of aggrieved employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of the transport company.  If a driver feels unwell, <Col N="246" /> presents himself to the company's doctor and his condition is found to be such that for him to drive would constitute a danger not only to himself and his passengers but to other road users, surely the present position is that, without any change in the law, he would cease to be allowed to drive a public service vehicle?  Now, merely because these tests will be put on a more formal basis, it is held that such a driver would be entitled to compensation and that the Minister for Local Government should be brought into the negotiations on such compensation. It does not make sense to me that we should introduce into this Bill a matter dealing with negotiations for compensation to drivers of lorries or buses who, because of some physical incapacity, are no longer able to carry on their normal occupation.</P>
    <P>The idea of the test is to try to ensure that the public will not be endangered because of the unfitness of licensed drivers.  If a driver is found to be unfit, it is only right that he should cease to drive.  I cannot see how the Minister for Local Government could help to solve the difficulty which could undoubtedly arise in regard to the fitness of drivers.  Indeed, I cannot see that it is appropriate that the Minister should be brought in as a third party to these negotiations.  I have no doubt the difficulties will be solved by negotiation between the unions and the employers.  But the Minister for Local Government will not help.  In fact, I would go as far as saying that he would only complicate the issue between the union and the employers.  It is not appropriate that the Minister should be brought into this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister pretty well from his behaviour in the House.  I know he can see further than his nose.  But it seems to me he does not want to see any further than his nose in this case.  Is the Minister serious in saying he cannot go any further in this, that he can wash his hands of it?  In this Bill the Minister proposes to introduce a test for drivers that may deem them unfit <Col N="247" /> to drive a lorry or bus.  He says his job is finished there.  We should appreciate what we are doing.  We are introducing a test which may deprive a man of his livelihood.  We are doing this only in respect of drivers of buses and lorries, men who get £8 or £9 per week.  The Minister for Health has never suggested that we have a similar test for surgeons, doctors and chemists.  Is it not possible that there is a surgeon with a shaky hand or surgeons who are not fit to carry out operations?  Do we know how many crazy chemists we have here who may give out the wrong prescription?  We do not propose to test these people.  We do not propose to test doctors to find out whether they are physically or mentally fit to engage in the practice of medicine.  But here we are legislating to ensure that drivers will be tested.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that his duty as Minister for Local Government is done so long as he says the fitness test must be carried out.  I think Deputy Ryan made an admirable suggestion when he said this matter could be referred to the Commission on Workmen's Compensation which has been sitting for the last five years.  Might I again quote the case of the man of 55 or 60 years who has been driving a lorry or bus all his life?  If he does not pass this test, he has no job.  The Minister says the matter is not one for him, that it is one for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or some other Minister. That is not good enough.  The Minister has taken a lot of power in this Bill in specific proposals and he proposes to take a lot more in the dozens of the regulations he may, make.  This amendment merely asks him to make regulations which he may consider appropriate after consultation with employers and employees to ensure that the man who is driving all his life may get some compensation.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request.</P>

I understand from the Board that the addressing system used in connection with the issue of the leaflets is in process of being replaced by a new system which provides for the use of the Dublin postal district numbers; and that the new system was not available when the envelopes were prepared. I also understand that the addressed envelopes were posted in batches which were due for delivery in the same areas of the city, and that this helped to a substantial extent to <Col N="261" /> make up for the transitional lack of the district numbers.</P>

    <P>The Minister may make regulations following consultation with representatives of the workers and employees concerned providing for the payment of compensation to any driver of a specified class whose employment is terminated as a result of his failure to pass a test for driving specified classes of vehicles, provided that the compensation referred to does not impose a charge on public funds.&mdash;(Deputy Corish).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister undertake to make regulations to that effect if such are found to be necessary? I do not know whether the Minister appreciates the seriousness of this matter.  There may be only five men who will be disemployed but it will mean that there will be five people who will find themselves without a <Col N="272" /> job.  The Minister will be instrumental in doing the damage but he says that he has no responsibility after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making laws and regulations which are for the benefit of the general public and it may be that in carrying out these laws and regulations we may find, through the medium of tests and investigations, that there are people driving who are a danger to themselves and to the public.  Surely it cannot be held, boldly and bluntly, that I am responsible for pushing these people out of employment and that I should carry the responsibility of negotiating how employment or compensation should be provided for them?  Even if four or five people lose their present employment as a result of being found not fit to drive surely the Deputy will agree that over the past year, over the past ten years, and for years before that, without tests being obligatory at all, many people have found, by visits to their own doctors or by visits to the company doctor, that they are grounded?  You do not blame the doctor in that case and ask him to pay compensation.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's approach to the matter but I do not appreciate his assertion that compensation for employment lost as a result of being found unfit should fall to be dealt with by the Minister for Local Government, that it should be paid out of the Road Fund or other public funds or that the Minister should sort things out so that this would follow.  I am not saying that there is not a problem but it is a problem which already exists.  It may be accentuated by virtue of the tests but the solution to that problem is surely not that we are to underwrite and make provisions in a Road Traffic Bill to meet circumstances which are far more appropriate to our social welfare legislation and to workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the Deputy's view that it would be proper to refer this matter to the Commission on Workmen's Compensation and I can see no reason why it should not be referred to that Commission.  I am with him in that but when he says that I can do something about it I do not <Col N="273" /> agree with him.  I agree that there may be a problem, that we should try to remedy it and, if it is a remedy to refer it to that Commission, I would be happy to subscribe to that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to follow the Minister in this case.  As far as we are concerned we agree with the main purpose of the Bill which is to protect the public in the use of the highways. In doing that other problems, which may be regarded as small problems, have thrown themselves up.  Having presented themselves, we suggest that it is the Minister's duty to bring in some protective clause in that regard.</P>
      <P>I do not think it good enough for the Minister to say he has nothing to do with providing compensation for such people affected by the Bill.  That is an unprecedented attitude to take. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said, when introducing a Transport Bill which, because of the general policy enshrined in it, inevitably caused redundancy&mdash;in the case of C.I.E., where we had branch lines closing down and a reorganisation within the company&mdash;that there should be provision in that Bill to compensate the people rendered redundant through the general policy of the House.  Here we have a measure on which there is largely the general concurrence of people on all sides of the House and I hope the Minister will appreciate our concern for the people who must fall by the wayside because of the implementation of this general policy.</P>
      <P>There should, without a doubt, be written into this Bill provision for compensation for people who will lose their employment as a result of the Bill, as a result of the fitness test.  We do not quarrel about this fitness test, because we believe that persons deemed unfit should be put off the roads in the interest of the general public.  But such persons are entitled to the consideration of this House, and I am surprised the Minister should say that, while he appreciated that point, it was not his job and that he hoped in the sweet by-and-by some other Minister would come along with a Bill to deal with that side of the question.  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> If a person loses employment through the operation of this Bill&mdash;a genuine employee who has given very good service&mdash;it is very poor consolation to him to hear that during the passage of the measure which rendered him jobless the Minister for Local Government expressed great sympathy with his type of case and promised that if in the dim and distant future one of his colleagues would introduce legislation he would be very sympathetic.  If this Bill in this way put only one man out of employment&mdash;say a C.I.E. employee or a respected employee of a private firm&mdash;the company or the firm might pay compensation.  However, that would be entirely optional when it should be made compulsory by a provision written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have in this country dispensary doctors who are 70 or 80 years of age, some of them are deaf and some blind and a number stupid, but we do not throw them out of the public service.  If we do, we pay them compensation and very handsome compensation at that.  Dispensary doctors render a vital service to the community but some of them are left doddering around for years and if we put them out we must compensate them.  On the other hand, you have a good family man with four or five children who, through no fault of his own, will be rendered unemployed by this measure; yet he will get no compensation for it. I hope the Minister will reconsider this.  He will not be creating a precedent if he writes into this Bill something to provide for the problem of these men who will lose their work as a result of the fitness test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Casey.  I, too, feel a great injustice can be done to these men who have given good service.  I think the Minister should go even further and provide in his Bill that these men will not get the hammer through no fault of their own.  Possibly the Minister is afraid there will be too many involved.  I believe it would only concern a handful. I think the Minister will not be straining himself too much by embodying these suggestions in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems there is some misconception here.  By reason of the fact that a person is already a licensed driver he will not be obliged to apply for a certificate of fitness under this Bill unless he either has committed an offence under the Bill or, under Section 28, an officer of the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that by reason of disease or disability he is unfit to drive.  I think Deputy Casey is working himself into a frenzy quite unnecessarily, because a person who is an old and trusted employee, who has given many years of service, will not be affected unless he gives grounds to an officer of the Garda for believing that he is unfit or unless he commits an offence.  If his record is perfectly clear and if he gives no reason for a Garda to suspect any physical disability he is not obliged to do the fitness test.</P>

      <P>It is the whole point. It is not a question that bears any comparison with the employees who were declared redundant by reason of Government policy, who had their source of employment taken away, although they were good workers, only because it was not in the public interest that their jobs should be maintained.  In those cases jobs had to be found for the men or they had to be compensated.  Here you have a case where a person is obliged to have a test in the public interest and is found to be incapable.  Why should the community have to compensate a person who wishes to do something which it is dangerous for him to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Casey that Deputy Booth is unhappy in regard to his contribution to this discussion.  Deputy Booth should bring the point of principle involved to its logical conclusion.  If society demands for society's protection that certain people are put out of employment society has a debt to those people.  That is the principle behind this very simple amendment.  This is not only a Bill of the Minister for Local Government; it is a Government Bill.  There is a principle of collective responsibility involved and it is not good enough for the Minister to have spent a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes today washing his hands and saying: &ldquo;Maybe it is somebody else's responsibility but it is not mine&rdquo; and then reluctantly, after further prolonged discussions, saying that it would appear to be a <Col N="277" /> matter for the commission.  He has not explicitly said he will bring the matter to the notice of the commission which is now sitting to consider the workmen's compensation code and it is most important that he should.</P>
      <P>Let us consider whether or not it is appropriate to put it into this Bill.  We have heard a great deal about not putting irrelevant matters into Bills.  That led us to the situation eight years ago whereby a Health Bill changed the law very radically in relation to the right of people to compensation in respect of injuries caused by road accidents.  Before the Health Bill of 1953 was passed if a person was injured on the roadway through the negligence of another person, he recovered all expenses, including hospital expenses and surgeons' fees, from the party guilty of the negligence. Under the Health Act, 1953, because proper provision was not made in that legislation, if a patient has a blue card or is a person entitled to a contribution from the local authority, he cannot recover against the negligent party the cost of hospitalisation. The result is that the taxpayers and ratepayers have been paying for the negligence of some people on the roadway for the past eight years because the draftsman and the purists said it would not be appropriate to deal with it when the Health Bill was being enacted. It was a matter of road legislation; road legislation was being changed by a Health Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are changing conditions of employment; whether we like it or not that is what we are doing. We are interfering in the ordinary contractual obligations that exist between employer and employee and I suggest that if the purists are to have their way and no compensatory provisions are included in this measure, at least there is some obligation on the Minister which he cannot discharge by shrugging his shoulders and saying this is somebody else's bailiwick.  We believe that where any Department of State is going to make a radical change in relation to contractual obligations between the employer and employee, negotiations should take place with other Departments.  If the Department <Col N="278" /> of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Social Welfare have not already adverted to this it is a sorry commentary on the heads of the Departments concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Casey said the Minister for Transport and Power made provision for redundancy brought about by the closing down of branch railway lines and that that was directly comparable with this matter under discussion.  Redundancy brought about by closing down a particular works, factory or branch railway line is a condition that has been created by the closing down action, but if a person is examained by a doctor and found to be unfit, how can it be said that the Minister who was responsible for his being examined brought about his unfitness?  It is a matter of finding out that he was unfit, not of creating the condition as would be the case with redundancy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan suggests we are interfering with conditions of employment and the ordinary contractual obligations entered into by employers and employees.  Under the 1933 Act there is a provision whereby a driver can be brought to court if there is reason to believe he is unfit to be a driver due to some physical, mental or other incapacity.  As a result of being so brought to court, he may be disqualified for driving and thereby lose his job as a driver, which is what is under discussion here.  In that 1933 Act there is no clause or section dealing with provision for compensation nor indeed have there come before this House any examples of damage done as a result of the operation of that section of the 1933 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the whole picture as I see it and, I think, as members of the House generally see it, the matter of being unfit for work, premature retirement, retirement through illness or injury, retirement through old age or infirmity&mdash;all these things form themselves into a pattern of social welfare. The care of these people and of all other people in various walks of life who have not got some private means or private arrangements of their own for meeting the vicissitudes of life <Col N="279" /> comes within the scope of social welfare. It has been the purpose of many measures passed in this House to give social welfare benefits to such people.</P>
    <P>The matter raised now is also one which falls within the framework of social welfare and is indeed very appropriate to be dealt with in that way.  In regard to the Commission which has been set up by the Minister for Social Welfare to deal with workmen's compensation, this is a question that has been suggested as being very appropriate to be considered by them. In answer to Deputy Ryan, if I did not say I would refer this matter to the Commission it was because I was not quite sure whether my saying so would be of any real worth or any satisfaction to the Deputies who have been speaking on this matter during the past 15 or 20 minutes. The people who spoke on this are, perhaps, aware of how appropriately it could be dealt <Col N="280" /> with by that Commission.  If they feel it can be properly dealt with by the Commission, I shall be glad to undertake to refer it to the Commission for their consideration.</P>

      <P>The Commission have been sitting for five years and have not found it possible to deal with the terms of reference given to them originally.  It would be very poor consolation for the people concerned to tell them that when the Commission are finished dealing with the problems set them five years ago, they might address themselves to the subject of this amendment.  That might be five years hence.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 31, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 40 and to insert &ldquo;may (and, in the case of an offence which would be an offence such as is specified in paragraph 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 or subparagraph (b) of paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule to this Act if it were a second or any subsequent offence within any period of three years, shall)&rdquo; in line 41 before &ldquo;by&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that this amendment and amendment No. 54 be taken together as both amendments are designed to secure that a compulsory endorsement on a licence in the case of the more serious offences which carry consequential disqualification on the commission of a second offence will be there as a record for the courts in regard to such offences.  It might also be pointed out that under Section 37 an endorsement will run for at least three years.  This will tie in with the provision in respect of subsequent or consequential disqualifications as outlined in the earlier parts of the Bill with which we have already dealt.</P>

      <P>This is purely a drafting amendment. The word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; is not necessary in the opening clause of the subsection because, as appears from the numbered paragraphs, an appeal court will not vary the endorsement order where it varies the disqualification order but will cancel the endorsement order of the lower court and make a new one. In other words, the higher court's decision will be the decision rather than a variation of what was the original decision or the decision of the lower court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) paragraph (b) contains one of these objectionable presumptions in law which lead to injustices.  I wonder if it is necessary to have a provision of that kind providing that it will be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that he did not at the time hold a driving licence having effect and licensing him to drive the vehicle.  This is done purely to convenience the State.  Is that not more or less the position? It is done to save the State having to prove that a defendant did not have a driving licence at the time.  It is dangerous to make these presumptions if it is not necessary and it certainly will lead to injustices unless the Minister accepts some of the amendments that we have put down.  I do not like to let the section pass without commenting on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one <Col N="284" /> point that I should like to clarify. Apparently the section provides that it is compulsory for a person to have a driving licence.  Now that that is so, I want the Minister to consider what persons might be entitled to have a licence in addition to being required to have one.</P>
      <P>The 1933 Act referred to driving on a public road.  That is being extended now to driving in a public place, a much wider term.  Suppose a function is held in a sportsfield, does that make the field a public place?  Suppose there is a demonstration on a private farm, does that make the farm a public place?  There are, too, many farmers who have able-bodied sons of 14, 15 and 16.  Under this Bill even a hardy chap of 16 will not be able to obtain a driving licence for a tractor.  The 14-15-year olds will likewise be prevented from helping in and around the farm because they will not get any licences.</P>
      <P>I think we shall have to have another look at this.  Many farmers' sons are quite competent to help around the farm now that farming has become so highly mechanised.  It might be necessary for these boys to drive a tractor across the road or some distance up the road to another field. Some provision will have to be put in this Bill to cope with that situation and enable farmers to go on taking advantage of mechanisation.  A combine harvester is a self-propelled vehicle.  A licence will be required in future for it.  I hope the Minister will see his way to making some provision to cover the points I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify &ldquo;public place&rdquo; with special reference to tractors and other mechanically propelled farm machinery.  Does the provision apply to the movement of machines from one farm to another, or from one field to another in the same farm?  Does it apply to ploughing championships and other functions of that nature? Does the fact that the public attend these functions mean that a licence must be held by all who take part in these championships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rooney has <Col N="285" /> referred to the position of the under-16 on the farm.  I should like the Minister to consider the case of invalid children who may need a chair to get around.  Surely they will not be prohibited from driving an invalid chair. I understand the h.p. is one-quarter. An invalid child in the country may need a chair to travel to and from school.  In the same way, a child living a distance from school may need an auto-cycle.  Again, the h.p. is one-quarter.  I do not believe such a machine would kill a chicken.  If there is to be a ban on all the under-sixteens there will have to be some exceptions to cover the cases I have cited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan raised the question of the onus of proof.  He feels the situation as outlined in the Bill is not as he would like it to be. In the past it was assumed that where a driver fails to produce a licence the onus of proof is on the defendant because the fact that he had or had not the licence would be knowledge peculiarly his own.  The principle was applied over quite a while that the onus of proof fell on the person concerned.</P>
      <P>It would be an almost impossible task for the prosecution to prove that a person did not have a licence, has not a licence or never had a licence. As I say, the onus of proof was on the driver until the position was upset by a decision of the court as a result of which the onus of proof was placed on the prosecution.  There is no great difficulty for the defendant to prove that he has or has had a licence.  He knows where to find evidence to prove the fact.  The prosecution is not in the same happy position. A driver knows whether he has a licence or not, where it was issued and, if he no longer has a licence, it is no great burden on him to get evidence to the effect that he had a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham and some other Deputy raised the question as to what is a public place for the purposes of the Bill.  Take, for instance, the grounds or the roads of the Airports <Col N="286" /> in Dublin or Shannon.  A very good example is the Phoenix Park.  These are obvious examples of what is a public place for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A question was raised as to movements of tractors, farm machines, self-propelled and otherwise.  If it is within the farm or within the private avenues, laneways or roadways of the farm, which are private, there can be no question of applying the terms of this Bill to such movements. Neither would the requirement of a licence arise, whether the driver was under 16 or over 16.  Once those machines came on to the public road, it would be a completely different matter, even if it were only for the purpose of crossing the road from one field to another.  Of course, I am sure it would not be beyond the ingenuity of a person under 16 years of age or a person who had not a licence to cross 16 or 20 feet of roadway.  I am sure they have done it and will continue to do it, no doubt keeping a look-out to see if there is a Garda in the vicinity who would be likely to pull them up.  The strict interpretation of these matters is that these machines can be driven within the confines of the farm but cannot be driven, without an offence being committed, on the public highway.  The public highway is a public place and a machine that would be on the public highway for even the short time involved in going across the road would be subject for that very short time to the ordinary law applicable in the case of any other vehicle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin suggested that special provision should be made for invalided children under 16 years of age who may have difficulty in getting to school.  He suggested that they might be given licences to use auto-cycles, scooters or some such mechanically propelled vehicle.  That suggestion appeals to one on first hearing but if we were to make special provision for handicapped or incapacitated children, what possible defence would there be against a claim that a normal, healthy child should also get the facility?  Where could the line be drawn?  What would be the minimum age limit?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The intention is not to prevent people from having licences.  The minimum age limit in regard to specified types of licences is not designed to prevent persons under that age having a licence.  To go below that age limit would create undue danger. The granting of licences to young people might cause them to be not only a danger to themselves but to other road users.  We must look at this matter from the point of view of the safety of the persons concerned and that of the general public.  It is not a matter of restricting the issue of licences for the sake of so doing.</P>
    <P>I am sure that a case could be made in support of Deputy Sherwin's plea but assuming that invalided or incapacitated children were to get licences, I cannot see how a claim on behalf of a normal, healthy child could be resisted.  If the Deputy considers the matter, he will appreciate that the matter is not as simple as would appear on first sight.  The case could be made that the granting of a licence would meet a particular case of hardship but we have to consider all the other cases that could arise for the granting of licences to young people who we consider should not be given a licence to drive any type of mechanically propelled vehicle.  We cannot very well go back, although we would go back if we felt we would be justified in doing so.  I do not think we would be justified in reducing the age limit and in making special provision for special cases.  If we were to do so we might just as well abandon the idea of a minimum age for the issue of a licence to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Minister should consider this point further.  He mentioned that it is not necessary for a person to have a driving licence in order to drive any type of motor vehicle in a private place regardless of risk.  It does not matter what age the person may be, he could drive a motor car in a private place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are still points to be considered.  The Minister mentioned the driving of a tractor by a person of <Col N="288" /> the age of 16 from one field to another on a farm and also the fact that it was quite clear that such a person would be breaking the law if he drove a tractor across the road from one field of the farm to another.  The Minister knows that labour on farms is becoming very scarce.  Wage earners are moving away from the land into other types of work and the result is that the farmer is becoming more and more dependent on his young son to help him along with the ordinary work on the farm.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that there are young mature fellows aged 14½, 15½ and 16½ years driving tractors for miles along the roads on behalf of their fathers and in connection with the work of the farm, whether it be in connection with the delivery of milk or in other circumstances. They are driving the tractors from their own farmyards to the conacre letting which may be a few miles away from the farm proper.  These tractors are being loaded with fertilisers, or perhaps with crops, and are being driven long distances.  Rather than leave the tractor lying in the yard the farmer must ask his grown-up sons who are under the licensing age of 17 years to drive them.  It is becoming a burning question on these farms.  And these are not high-speed vehicles.  They are capable of a fair speed if driven furiously but, in the ordinary way, they are not high-speed vehicles and neither is the self-propelled combine harvester.</P>
    <P>The wage-earners are going off the land at the rate of 7,000 a year.  Their places must be filled by machinery and by the grown-up sons of the farmers. There is also the case of a man who loses his licence in connection with the driving of a car, lorry or motor van.  If he does so, he also loses his licence to drive an agricultural tractor.  There again he has the right to drive it from one field to another on his land only, but he cannot drive it to a field across the road or to his conacre letting.  This person would be of an age to hold a licence but for the fact that he had lost it in connection with the driving of a high-speed vehicle.</P>
    <P>In fact, I have an example of a man who lost his licence in connection with the driving of a motor van.  He was <Col N="289" /> using a tractor to drive his milk down the road for about a mile to the place where it would be collected.  As a result he had to sell his dairy herd. He could not afford to engage extra staff and, when he could not drive along the public road and could not get the dairy people to call to his farmyard to collect the milk, he had to sell the dairy herd.  I feel that the Minister should try to meet that problem which is growing on our farms.  I want to emphasise the fact that a special licence for the driving of tractors could be issued.  That would meet the case, particularly considering the fact that a tractor is a slow-moving vehicle in the ordinary way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does hold with the eloquence of Deputy Rooney I would ask him to consider the consequences and provide for them. If these young boys are going across the public road they cannot be insured and I consider that there should be a clause put into the Section providing for the liabilities of insurance companies. This action would have to be taken in the interests of the public generally.  There have been many serious accidents due to the driving of tractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter.  I have suffered from a serious injury and had to attend clinics where there was nothing but cripples and teenagers.  There are many young people who would be quite capable of looking after an invalid chair which moves only at a low rate of speed.  Surely the Minister can have no objection to a person under 16 years of age having a licence if certified by a member of the medical profession and if the application is made before the district justice?  Surely he does not compare an able-bodied youth with an invalid?  He should consult the medical profession and get their point of view on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was speaking about this matter with my son who has a motor cycle and he told me that an ordinary motor cycle has one horse power, a mini-cycle has a half horse power and an engine attached to an ordinary cycle has a quarter-horse power.  If you ride <Col N="290" /> a bicycle with a quarter horse power and go up a hill it will stop.  If there is a good wind it will stop.  I do not see any danger in a vehicle having a small motor to enable cripples to get around if they are under 16 years of age and I think the Minister should get the point of view of the medical profession on this matter.  We cannot compare able-bodied youths with invalids who are otherwise capable of driving.  If a boy of 12 years of age has no legs but is able to control an invalid chair with his hands, surely he should be allowed to drive one?  Why should he be compelled to sit still?  He should be able to get around.  I would ask the Minister carefully to consider this question of invalids who might otherwise be incapable of looking after the vehicles they would be compelled to use.  The only vehicles now of any use to invalids are all mechanically propelled.</P>

      <P>I should like to say to Deputy Sherwin at the outset that I appreciate what he is trying to get across.  But let us take the case of a child who is severely physically incapacitated but who is still able to use his arms and hands.  He might be twelve years of age from the point of view of his stability and his mental responsibility.  We are not preventing the under-sixteen invalids from holding licences because of the suggestion that they would not be physically capable of manipulating the vehicles.  Judging from my knowledge of their capabilities, I would say there is no want of ability in this respect in the under-sixteens but it is a fact&mdash;this is a matter on which the House has had a mind over the years&mdash;that downwards from the age of sixteen, and progressively so as you go back in years, their sense and responsibility cannot be expected to be such as would meet the requirements of present day traffic requirements and traffic codes. They are just as likely to drive across a roadway where there is a stop sign as the child who is not incapacitated of the same age.  It is for those reasons that we do not propose to bring down the age limit in respect of which licences should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even with pedal cycles there is a <Col N="291" /> problem with the young because young children on pedal cycles can still achieve dangerously high speeds. Nobody, however, says we should stop young people from using pedal cycles until they have reached the age of 16. The point is that you can find a young girl or boy of fourteen, thirteen and twelve who has the mental stability, sense and responsibility far greater developed than somebody of 21 or even 31 but, in general, we must have regard to the fact that people of tender years cannnot be expected to have this sense of responsibility, the mental maturity that is required for their safety and for the safety of others of us who use the public highways. Accordingly we cannot license children to have control of mechanically propelled machines which would add considerably to the growing dangers on our roads today.</P>
    <P>This is a point that can be argued all along the line.  One could say that a child of eleven in certain cases had more stability than one of twelve, than one of ten had more than one of eleven, and so back the line.  There is a point there and the whole question is whether or not we are satisfied that the age of 16 is the point or not. Is that the point, everything considered, under which we should not go?  We have got to put a stop somewhere.</P>

      <P>A most deserving and a most unique case could arise where anybody who had the discretion would be compelled to accede to such a request because of the circumstances of the child, because of the hard luck stories attached to the child's incapacity, but it still would not prove whether or not the child, physically incapacitated as it might be, could have effective control over a mechanically propelled vehicle.  There is no way of ascertaining or ensuring that in making the exception and in giving the licence, the child's sense of responsibility is any more developed than that of a normal, healthy child running around.  That is really the <Col N="292" /> point around which this whole discussion of the subject of Deputy Sherwin's suggestion must revolve.  I cannot see the answer to it at all.</P>

      <P>This involves the same point I raised under Section 19.  I was not in the House when the Minister replied to my points on Section 19 about the production of the test certificates. I think the Minister was prepared to consider the necessity for these amendments whereby, if a person is asked to produce a test certificate, there would be a statutory obligation on a Garda officer to endorse on the certificate the fact that it had been produced and that the endorsement would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of its production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>At an earlier stage, I undertook to the Deputy that I would look into the procedure in operation at the moment and, from that, to give an indication of what the procedure is <Col N="293" /> in relation to test certificates.  I have here a sheet called Garda Síochána Form CT 34 which is used at the moment in regard to these particular matters.  If I were driving in Dublin and were stopped by a member of the Garda and had not got my driver's licence or my certificate of insurance, I nominate my home Garda station&mdash; in my case in Co. Donegal&mdash;at which I would produce the document required, within, at the moment, five days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This form is filled by the Garda who has pulled me up.  He gives on it the day and the date, the name of the person held up, the registration number and so on and the particulars of the document I failed to produce.  He signs <Col N="294" /> the form and sends it on to my home station which I nominated when pulled up.  The station sergeant at my home locality will then complete the form and return it to Dublin.  So if will be seen that there are no loopholes, that no surprise prosecution can be sprung on the person pulled up.  That is the system operated at the moment and it seems foolproof.  It does not leave any room for a situation where a person might find himself short-circuited or put on a spot unnecessarily.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
