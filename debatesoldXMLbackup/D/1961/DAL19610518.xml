      <P>Section 49 of the Bill is the section which deals with the offence of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of drink or drugs.  There is an important change in this section as against the corresponding section in the 1933 Act in so far as Section 49 of the Bill, in effect, makes a jail sentence mandatory on conviction for the offence of driving while under the influence of drink or drugs.  There is a provision in subsection (2) of the section which enables the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment or a fine but subsection (3) makes it quite clear that it is the intention of the Minister that a jail sentence should be mandatory unless the court should find that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify a fine instead of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think various Deputies will have different views as to the desirability of making a prison sentence mandatory for <Col N="613" /> this offence or for any other offence. The Bill does seek to achieve that object and the view we take of it is that in those circumstances the consequences to a person who may be convicted of this offence are obviously going to be extremely serious.  They may impose considerable hardships on himself and on those dependent on him.  For those reasons we feel that it is not entirely safe that the decision should be left entirely to one man, to the district justice hearing the complaint.  We feel that, having regard to the very grave consequences which would ensue from a conviction under this sentence, the accused person should, if he so desires, be entitled to have his case heard by a jury.  Amendment 60a is designed to have that effect.  I am seeking in the amendment that an offence under this section will be an indictable offence or that, at the option of the accused, it may be tried summarily.</P>
    <P>The amendment has two advantages. It has the advantage of providing for the safeguard to the accused to which I have referred, that a person charged with an offence of this gravity will not be convicted except by trial by a jury if he so desires.  It also has the advantage, from the Minister's point of view and from the point of view of anyone seeking to stamp out this offence, of emphasising the gravity of the offence in the eyes of the public as a whole.  If the Minister adopts the suggestion in the amendment and legislates so that this will be an indictable offence the gravity of it will be underlined in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  It is most desirable that anything that this Legislature can do to eradicate the crime of driving a motor car whilst drunk should be done.  I think we should take any steps we can in this House to ensure that this crime is lessened to the greatest extent possible but care must be taken that, in taking these steps, injustice is not done.  I apprehend that if the section as drafted at present is allowed to stand that, in some cases, injustice may result. Deputy O'Higgins has referred to the fact that the decision in what is now going to be an extremely serious <Col N="614" /> charge will be in the hands of one man, a district justice.  Considerable responsibility is borne by district justices in many instances at present but in this section, as it is drafted at the present time, whilst it is indicated in Section 2 that a prison sentence is to follow, there is a proviso which states that in special circumstances a district justice need not impose a prison sentence.</P>
      <P>There has been no effort made to define the special circumstances and I think it is quite possible that one district justice may take into account one aspect of the accused's behaviour and another district justice may take into account another aspect of that behaviour.  It is quite possible that in the course of time the meaning of these words may come to be defined by a decision of the High Court or the Supreme Court but, pending that, there is going to be confusion as to what the words actually mean and disparity throughout the country as to the application of the section.  Some district justices are more lenient than others. Some may take into account the family circumstances of the accused.  Others may decide that that is not a matter which should concern them and that they should take into account the degree of doubt in the case.  Others may feel that the degree of culpability of the accused should be a factor.  We are leaving the situation in a fairly uncertain state by leaving the section as it is drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable weight in the argument that, in view of the fact that there is likely to be a conflict in the interpretation of the section, the accused should be given the option of going to trial with a jury.  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, this amendment also has the effect of making it clear to the public at large that this is a most serious offence.  It seems to me that this amendment is desirable in order to avoid what could amount to an injustice. If, in fact, we were able to devise some fairly foolproof system by which it could objectively and scientifically be established that an accused person was guilty of this offence there would be a great deal to be said for making a prison sentence mandatory but, at the present time, we have no such system. <Col N="615" /> We have no blood test or breath test which would decide that a person is not capable of driving a car.</P>
    <P>The accused person's freedom now depends on the subjective opinion of persons who have seen him, on persons such as Guards and witnesses, and on objective tests carried out by a qualified medical practitioner.  Because of the uncertainty that exists we are imposing too heavy an onus on district justices in this matter.  I feel there will be cases where, if a man is charged with this offence in one county, he will have a good chance of getting off and, if charged in another county, a conviction will mean a sentence.  That is an undesirable situation and it could be remedied to a considerable extent by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support to the full the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Costello.  In the past, in cases in which people have been charged with drunken driving, a conviction has not ensued where, it was felt by some, it should have ensued.  The effect of making this provision mandatory will be that a district justice will be twice as slow in future about convicting at all.  Certainly that will be the position in some cases.  On the other hand, we will still be faced with what has happened in the past: justices have convicted persons of drunken driving solely on the inexpert evidence of members of the Garda.  A Garda will use in court such phrases as &ldquo;He staggered&rdquo; or &ldquo;His speech was thick&rdquo; or &ldquo;He spoke slowly&rdquo; and, in the eyes of many justices, such phrases are sufficient to convict the man, even though the medical evidence may not be against him.  Where there is trial by jury, the hearing of the charge against the accused must be gone into in detail and the accused is entitled to the benefit of any doubt. If we propose to compel the judiciary to impose a sentence of imprisonment of six months, we must also provide certain safeguards to ensure that a man is not sent to prison in respect of an offence he has not committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Costello said, the special circumstances which justices or judges <Col N="616" /> may properly take into consideration are not defined.  Some justices will have regard to the special domestic circumstances of the accused.  Others may consider the circumstances in which the accused person took the drink and may consider whether that person was a completely free agent in the consumption of that drink. Others may consider that special circumstances refer only to the manner of driving.  Others may consider that the special circumstances refer to the amount of damage done.  This is not a safe clause to put in this Bill because it is capable of so many varied interpretations.  As Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Costello have pointed out, these interpretations will depend upon the whims, the fancies and the prejudices of one particular man, if we leave the provision in the Bill in its present form.</P>
    <P>If we provide that this be an indictable offence, the accused will be entitled to trial by jury.  It may be that the Minister thinks it would be unsafe to have such a charge heard by a jury because most jurors will be motorists and might tend to lean in favour of the accused.  I believe the public conscience is sufficiently disturbed about the offence of drunken driving and the majority of motorists are now as anxious as the Minister or the Garda to stop the drunken driver careering around our roads.  By and large, juries will not lean in favour of the drunken driver.  If it is trial by jury, then 12 good men and true will have an opportunity of evaluating the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution.</P>
    <P>It is not a general criticism of the Garda to say that there have been cases in which individual members of the Garda have become involved in a row with a man who has had a few drinks.  It is not uncommon for people under the influence to become argumentative.  There have been cases &mdash;there will be cases&mdash;in which the Garda will give as good as they get. That, however, engenders a feeling of illwill and leads to prejudiced evidence on the part of the Garda in some <Col N="617" /> cases.  Such phrases as I have mentioned will lead to a position in which the mind of the justice will be prejudiced right from the beginning. We know that many justices feel prosecutions would not be brought unless the offenders were guilty and they are inclined to accept, without the critical examination to which a jury would subject it, the evidence produced by the Garda.</P>
    <P>Perhaps an illustration will serve. I am aware of a case in which the medical evidence was in favour of the accused and the Garda evidence very much against him.  The district justice was satisfied that he had to convict because the offence occurred on Christmas Eve.  Apparently that was sufficient proof that the man was drunk. I doubt if 12 members of a jury would accept that all good Christians are drunk on Christmas Eve.  It is in order to prevent a conviction in such circumstances and to ensure that the accused person is given trial by jury that I believe this amendment is worthy of support. If we do not give this right to a person charged with drunken driving, we will then be in the ludicrous position of giving trial by jury to a person who commits a common assault, maliciously damages property, or does something more heinous still, while refusing it to an ordinary citizen who in a momentary lapse may consume an excess of alcohol.  Our legal system is there to protect the individual as much as society.  If we refuse trial by jury in such a case, we will not be safeguarding the interests and liberties of the individual.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage, I expressed the hope that there would be a separate prison for those who commit driving offences.  Six months' imprisonment on a law-abiding citizen for an offence of drunken driving would not be so serious if he were incarcerated in a separate prison for driving offenders, but it is a very serious punishment when such a person is thrown in with thieves, robbers, prostitutes and all kinds of people who have a long career of sordid crime behind them.  If there were a separate prison in which people could live in a certain degree of freedom and be able <Col N="618" /> to devote their talents and themselves to more fruitful occupation than is to be found in common prisons, six months' imprisonment might not be such a very serious punishment.  It would be a serious restriction and would curtail their liberties.  We are throwing these people into a common prison, the common prisoner in which has had in most cases the right of trial by jury.  These people ought to get at least as much as is given to prisoners who are habitual criminals and known to be such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make three short points.  I believe that people who drive should not drink and that people who drink should not drive.  I do not think that is an unreasonable stipulation.  I have every sympathy with a group of men who go out to make a celebration but I regard it as a perfectly reasonable requisition that, if they do, one member of the party will go on the wagon for that night, with the assurance that on some future occasion some other member of the party will undertake that disagreeable assignment.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, we have got to make up our minds to the fact that sooner or later we will have to accept it as a general rule of conduct that those who drive should not drink and that those who drink should not drive.  The more manifest that fundamental principle is to our mind, the more we as legislators ought to be vigilant, lest in our zeal promptly to impose these standards on the society in which we live, we make the grave mistake of seriously abridging justice to which every man is entitled.  Simply because a particular irregularity of conduct shocks us particularly should involve us in no departure from the rule that the humblest and the most abandoned person in our society is entitled to full justice and is entitled to be deemed innocent until the State has proved him guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes, when we get to discussing common or garden offences, relatively trivial offences compared with the capital crime of murder, the crimes of burglary and so forth, we are liable to forget that that obligation under our system of law subsists, that a man is <Col N="619" /> deemed innocent until the State in open court has proved him guilty.  I do not think that in respect of drunken driving or any other offence against the law, we should lose sight of that fundamental principle, for, when we make a breach upon it in any regard, it is only a matter of time until the whole structure of criminal law begins to fritter away.  Our system of criminal law is the right system and preferable to the continental system.  Here, we deem a man to be innocent until the State has proved him guilty.  Some guilty persons may escape but it is the best safeguard I have yet discovered in my life to ensure that an innocent man is not condemned.</P>
    <P>In the full knowledge that I hold the strongest possible views on the man drinking and driving at the same time&mdash;no one in the House could feel more strongly about it than I do&mdash;in the full knowledge of the fact that I feel it is perfectly simple for any man to avoid coming within the ambit of these sections at all, I want to make certain submissions in regard to the Bill as at present drafted.</P>
    <P>Any provision of this House which makes it mandatory upon any court of law to send a man to jail is a bad provision.  The whole theme of our system of justice is that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have a wide discretion to impose a suitable penalty in all the circumstances of the case and in my experience, wherever you make it mandatory on a court to impose a certain specified penalty, evils begin to creep in.  I have had experience myself in connection with fishery offences.  Exasperated by the failure of courts to impose what I thought were adequate penalties on foreign trawlers, I asked Dáil Éireann to make certain penalties mandatory. Almost invariably when that happens, some case turns up and you find that the mandatory principle has broken down in justice.  The furthest the mandatory provisions of the fishery law went related to the confiscation of gear and to the size of the fine, but here, this section virtually makes it mandatory to send a man or woman to jail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> I do not care how farseeing this House is, I do not believe any law can with propriety make it mandatory to send a man or woman to jail, without leaving the court a discretion.  There is certain discretion here in subsection (3), where the court considers there are special reasons for not imposing imprisonment, but, as other Deputies have said, how those words will be interpreted is hard to tell. Some justices may take a very restricted view of that and determine that only where the person's health would be gravely injured or where there were circumstances of that kind would they be excused from the obligation to impose imprisonment.  I think that is all wrong.  You have either got to trust the court with discretion to impose the penalties prescribed within the limits of the Bill or you get into a situation which is impracticable, to begin with, and liable to wreak very material injustice in addition.</P>
    <P>Some district justices will simply cleave closely to the letter of this statute and impose imprisonment, although they feel that it is harsh and even unjust to do so, because, they may say, there is no &ldquo;special reason&rdquo;.  Other justices, faced with the duty of imposing imprisonment, will simply find the charge not proved because they feel the obligation to imprison would distort justice. Therefore, I think the discretion ought to be left in the court to determine what the appropriate penalty shall be in each individual case within the limits laid down in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is this: I suppose it is true that there are offences where a man or woman is liable to be sent to jail without the right of having the case heard by a jury but in general principle, I have the feeling that where a jail sentence is involved, a defendant is entitled to claim the right to have the case heard by a jury. There is no use in concealing from ourselves that a jail sentence can be a very different thing for different men. For a man who has been in and out of Mountjoy all his life the fact that he spends a further seven days or a month in Mountjoy does not make very much difference to him.  It can virtually ruin <Col N="621" /> a man who has held his head high in society.  The father of a family recoils in horror at the thought of coming home to his children from Mountjoy Jail. The length of his sentence in jail is a matter which is largely irrelevant.  The best elements in our community regard committal to Mountjoy Jail in itself as a shocking catastrophe which would materially affect their whole lives.  I must earnestly impress on Dáil Eireann that we must not lightly legislate in regard to a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the fact&mdash;and we have got to face it&mdash;that until a new attitude develops in this practice, there is a tendency for people who have no criminal background or criminal inclinations and no absence of public spirit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing the question of the right of a man to opt for a jury trial, if he is opposed to having his business summarily disposed of.  We should not close our eyes to the fact that situations are liable to arise in which men with no criminal disposition, in fact, men of the highest public spirit, could conceivably get into a jam in which there was a genuine difference of opinion between the authorities and himself as to whether he could fairly be described as driving a vehicle in a public place under the influence of alcoholic liquor or a drug. <Col N="622" /> He ought to have the right in those circumstances to go to a jury.  I am not saying that he must go to a jury; I am saying that if he says: &ldquo;I protest most indignantly.  There is not a shadow of truth in this allegation; I want to be tried by a jury&rdquo;, he should have that right.  I think that is a reasonable proposition.  It is one the Minister ought to be prepared to try to meet.</P>
      <P>If that is acceptable and we make, as I think we should make, the thing an indictable offence which gives the defendant the option to be tried summarily or to go before a jury at his own election, I do not think I trespass unduly if I suggest to the Minister that, in that event, we ought to go a step further and devise some acceptable test which the defendant would have the right to call for if he were apprehended by the Garda and the allegation made against him that he was driving under the influence of drink.  It may be that the question of the blood test or the breath test might be more properly raised on the section itself.  There is an amendment which deals with it but in the case I make in support of the amendment by Deputy O'Higgins, I should like it to be borne in mind that if we give the right to go to a jury, as we think the people should have, we ought to provide every reasonable facility that the most precise knowledge available through scientific tests is accessible to a man who wishes to present it to the court when his case comes up for examination and determination.</P>

      <P>If such cases can go to a jury, I think we would have to appoint a couple of dozen more judges and there would be no end to their work, having regard to the fact that nearly everyone would take advantage of the right.  At the same time, I agree in principle with what Deputy Dillon said.  It amazes me how severely the State proposes to deal with people who commit these offences, when, to a large extent, the State itself condones this offence by allowing liquor to be sold.  It actually gets a cut out of it.  The point I am trying to make is that we commit part of the offence <Col N="623" /> ourselves.  For that reason, I do not think we should be so anxious for such powers to deliver people to Mountjoy Jail without the right to be tried by a jury.  The only point is that there would be no end to litigation.</P>

      <P>I should like to have from the members who spoke so eloquently on this an indication as to whether their objections stem from the fact that there is in this section a penalty which carries a mandatory jail sentence.  If the amendment really stems from that, do those who now propose the amendment feel that this mandatory jail sentence should possibly be wiped out?  If that were the real basis of the views expressed here this morning, I would say to the House that I should like to have a further look at the whole thing on that basis. It might possibly short-circuit this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If discretion is left to the justice to impose a prison sentence, there is a right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  If there were a mandatory penalty, we would have to balance the operation of the court's system, as Deputy Sherwin has already indicated, and we would have far more jury cases if we were to <Col N="624" /> make drunken driving charges indictable offences.  In the case of a mandatory prison sentence, it is only right that there should be trial by jury.  If there is not mandatory imprisonment on conviction for drunken driving, the necessity is not so great and I believe there would not be as many cases of unfair decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to wipe out these mandatory jail sentences, I believe we would weaken the system we are hoping to adopt, and the benefits we hope that system will have in regard to the eradication as far as possible of too frequent cases of driving while drunk or while incapable as a result of drink.  I suppose what Deputy Sherwin has said is true to a degree, that if we were to give an option of referring these cases to the circuit court for trial by judge and jury, under our present system of court sittings, circuits and so on, it could well be said that we were cluttering up that system.  As the Deputy has also said, we might possibly find ourselves in the position of being obliged to appoint further judges.  I do not think that is a good argument.  If that were the only real difficulty, it would not be a good argument to say that we will not do this or that, because it might clutter up the system already in operation, or that it might mean more judges would have to be appointed at a further cost to the community.  I do not think anyone could really regard that as a legitimate argument against any course proposed to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In justification of the line of making the jail sentence mandatory for this offence, there is the escape clause which has been mentioned that, in special circumstances, the jail sentence need not necesarily be imposed.  I think it was Deputy Costello who said that these special circumstances are not defined.  I put it to the House that they are not defined for the good reason that an attempt to define the various circumstances that might arise at various times in various places, or <Col N="625" /> the circumstances which would be regarded as special, might merely confine the application of that clause, and might confine it narrowly and in such a way as to exclude what would undoubtedly be regarded as special circumstances, if there were no definition of &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we were dealing merely with this amendment and ultimately decided to wipe out the mandatory jail sentence in these cases, if we were to deal with it as it is rather than make this offence indictable, with an option to the defendant to have it heard summarily, as Deputy Dillon said, they would be dealt with summarily, unless the defendant opted for trial by jury.  I would go further and say that if we were to go in that direction, we should have them dealt with summarily and with the option to go to a jury, and that option should not only be the option of the defendant but also of the prosecution.</P>
    <P>I am putting these points of view both on the amendment, and on what I feel might be an amendment to the amendment, or as I have said, a possible wiping out of the mandatory jail sentence, in order that members of the House may have an opportunity of thinking along these lines.  In the meantime, I should like to give the matter more consideration, and if an amendment is to come before the House, possibly we could bring it before the House on the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I summarise?  The Minister has spoken on this matter and it is our obligation to try to answer him.  My first reaction, if the mandatory element of the penalty is removed, is that I do not then see the same formidable objection to summary proceedings, but if the mandatory penalty remains, I think there should be an option to go to a jury.  I see no objection to that option being in the State and in the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole principle of a mandatory penalty is a bad principle and it is a principle I should like to see go.  That, therefore, would suggest to me that what we would like best would be that the mandatory principle would go, <Col N="626" /> even if that meant summary jurisdiction, without the option of access to a jury.  There is always the right of appeal, if it is felt injustice has been done.  I am bound to add that my ideal would be that the mandatory principle would go.  Where there is a penalty of imprisonment, the defendant ought to have the right to go to the jury.</P>
    <P>I see the difficulty.  We do not want to clutter up the circuit courts.  I imagine that in a very large number of cases where there is material to go to a jury, the man knows pretty well what the facts are, and if the facts are manifest or of a character that he does not even remember what they are, a jury will pretty clearly understand what they mean.  I doubt if the cluttering up of the courts would be as great as the Minister apprehends because it is only the relatively exceptional case where there is a genuine, valid, positive clash between the defendant's recollection of the circumstances and the Garda's recollection, that recourse would be had to a jury.  We will withdraw the amendment and, in the meantime, the Minister will turn it over in his mind.  We will do the same and we can both think over amendments for Report Stage from which an agreed solution might emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude to this prison sentence has been made clear before.  Drunkenness has now become accepted as an illness and not a crime, and the correct thing to do is to put the person into some form of isolation for treatment, as suggested by Deputy Ryan.  I want to make that point clear before I appeal to the Minister to be very slow in removing the mandatory principle in the Bill.  That is one of the strong points in this Bill and is an advance on previous road traffic legislation, demanded by a general public feeling that people were not sufficiently conscious of the seriousness of driving a car while having drink taken, thus creating a danger to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we all appreciate the human factors involved, we want also to try to reduce the incidence of drunken driving.  If there is not palpable evidence that the penalty for this <Col N="627" /> offence is serious and inevitable, except in exceptional circumstances, the Bill will not have the impact on the public consciousness which the proposed inclusion of this mandatory power has already had.  While it is a pity it has to be included, human weaknesses being as they are, the Minister had no alternative.  Before he decides to remove it, I would appeal to him to think very carefully about it, because its exclusion would weaken the Bill.  I concede that the case made by the Opposition concerning trial by jury is good and that the amendment is a good one.  There must be some way of meeting the Opposition's objections on this question of summary trial and the question of the mandatory penalty.  In any event the Minister ought to be very slow to withdraw the provision in order to meet the valid objections of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I would regard a mandatory jail sentence for a first offence as too severe a penalty.

      <P>What are involved here are largely the questions of a deterrent and the public consciousness of the seriousness of the crime.  Where the previous speaker is missing the point is in looking at this matter from the personal point of view of the delinquent in the case. We all have sympathy there and I would go so far as to say that a special provision, something on the lines mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne, might very well be made. However, this is a matter of serious consequence to the public and to individual citizens and we cannot afford to take that approach generally.  A mandatory sentence in the cases we have in mind is almost imperative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, specifying the period.  One might make it short or long.  The important point to remember is that, through such delinquency, the lives of citizens may be endangered, that, through such negligence and default, another citizen may lose his life.  That is the question at issue.  Suppose somebody assaults another and the assault results in serious injury.  That will almost inevitably attract a jail sentence.  When this question is looked at from the point of view of the public, there is a strong case to be made for a mandatory sentence of imprisonment, whether it is long or short, or even a suspended sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the motives of those who moved or supported the amendment are misunderstood, I want to reiterate that we have no sympathy whatever with the drunken driver.  We believe he must be cleared off the road. However, we have the feeling that the effect of a mandatory prison sentence will be that, justices being human and seeing many decent people before them, they will refuse to convict and there will be fewer convictions for drunken driving than ever before.  I agree completely with the Minister and with Deputy de Valera that we need a deterrent.</P>
      <P>That brings me back, if I may do so without being irrelevant, to Deputy Coogan's amendment to the Bill which was to provide for another offence of impaired control, rather than of absolute incapability.  Most people convicted of the offence of drunken driving start drinking with the intention of not becoming drunk, but they go on and on and their judgment of their capability to drink becomes impaired by reason of the consumption of alcoholic liquor.  It is not milk they are drinking; they are not in a position to form a proper judgment and their sense of responsibility is somewhat impaired.  In most cases, people drink with the intention merely of being sociable or quenching their thirst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we want to do is to provide a deterrent and I believe Deputy Coogan's amendment provides the greater deterrent, because it sets out <Col N="629" /> that if the man's control is impaired, he may find himself charged with an offence.  It will not be such a serious one but at least he must decide in relation to his ability at an earlier stage. Impaired control is something which can be decided upon much earlier and much better than absolute incapability. The House appreciates that the Minister is prepared to look at Deputy Coogan's amendment and to think about the right of trial by jury.  Therefore, we can expect some appropriate amendments with deterrents and proper punishment for the degrees of irresponsibility.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 49, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section on which I was to make the case I refrained from making earlier.  Deputy Dr. Browne has an amendment down proposing a new section setting out the procedure for a blood test.  That can be discussed in detail at the appropriate time.  I want to put it to the Minister that whether we ultimately come to the conclusion, after reflection, that there should be a mandatory jail sentence with access to a jury or that the mandatory element should be removed and summary jurisdiction restored, where you are dealing with the liberty of the subject and the right to put him in jail, the closer you can get to virtual certainty in regard to the quality of the offence, the better.  It is common knowledge that some men can take two martini cocktails and drive a car without having their driving capacity impaired.  Others could not.  I imagine people who are accustomed to drinking gin acquire a tolerance which those who are not do not have.  So you could have the situation of two men, whose consumption of alcohol was identical, one acting in a way which would bring him into court for having driven a car under the influence of drink and the other, having consumed precisely the same quantity at precisely the same time and place, passing by without any comment upon his conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> What we should aim at in this legislation&mdash;I want to commend this to some of the Deputies who feel we ought to give the public a shock&mdash;instead of trying to shock the public, we should consider this.  Mark you, the public react to shocks and then settle back pretty quickly into the even tenor of their ways.  We passed the new licensing laws and every pub in Ireland closed on the dot.  They are all closing now at any hour they like again.  The whole thing has gone up in smoke.  In rural Ireland, the thing has become a complete farce.  It is the subject of general agreement between the local sergeant and the publican.  If the hour does not suit, he opens at other hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to this. The argument is made that we ought to give the public a shock.  Deputy de Valera took the view there was merit in that argument, that the mandatory principle woke the public up with the shock.  I think it would, but it would fade away.  The essential element in criminal law is certainty of detection and, as far as possible, certainty of the nature of the crime, certainty as to where the Rubicon lies, and that if you cross that Rubicon, you have broken the law.  That is objectively true, and subjective references will not affect the objective fact that if you cross that line you have broken the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you start saying a person is under the influence of drink, I think that is virtually impossible to determine. The principle we should adhere to in Dáil Éireann is that those who drive should not drink and those who drink should not drive.  Taking that as the sheet-anchor of the purpose of our legislation, we ought to try to devise a test which will determine with as close approximation to the objective truth as it is possible to attain, whether a person has consumed a quantity of alcohol which is in excess of the maximum limit consistent with safety.  Up to relatively recently, there did not appear to be any such test.  It now <Col N="631" /> appears there are tests based upon blood tests and upon breath analysis which can be expeditiously done and which are reasonably reliable.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, where a person is charged with the offence of having consumed too much alcohol before driving a car, he ought to have available to him the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Very well; I want a blood test to be made and a breath analysis to be made, on the understanding that the results will be presented in evidence in any court of law where I am arraigned.&rdquo;  Is that not what is substantially proposed in Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 61a:</P>
      <P>Before section 50 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any proceedings for an offence under section 49 of this Act the court shall have regard to any evidence which may be given of the proportion or quantity of alcohol which was contained in the blood of the accused in excess of .5% as ascertained by analysis or measurement of a specimen of blood taken from him with his consent; provided that if it is proved that the accused when so requested at any such time refused to assent to the making of such test or measurement his refusal may, unless reasonable cause therefor is shown, be treated as supporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution or as rebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defence with respect to his condition at that time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for a number of reasons.  First, because I should like to hear the opinions of the Minister and the House in greater detail than already given to us on the question of bringing in some form of chemical or more scientific test than those already available for the assessment of the amount of drink taken by a defendant in a case under Section 49.  I have restricted this amendment to the suggestion of the blood test merely in order not to confuse the issue by discussing the possibility of the usefulness of a breathaliser analysis or a urinary analysis.  I restricted it merely to a blood analysis in order that the discussion could simply be on the principle of the use of a scientific test in the determination of culpability in a case taken under Section 49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best case was made by many speakers on Section 49, namely the desirability of having some more specific what Deputy Dillon called a rule or thumb or a line over which you cross which makes you guilty of <Col N="633" /> the charge.  It is particularly necessary that we should have some more accurate test now in view of the much greater seriousness of the result of the charge, namely, the mandatory sentence. The present system of assessment is so crude as to be virtually useless.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this point before the House.  It arises to a certain extent out of the amendment put forward by Deputy Coogan.  There should be no distinction in the end result between the person who is incapable of driving and the person who, as a result of having taken alcohol, is a danger to the public.  I think we have to accept a completely new approach to drinking while driving.  There is the person who is incapable of driving as a result of drink.  That is so clearly and readily acceptable to us as something which should be stopped without any question in any way we have at our disposal that there is no need for discussion about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the House not the drunken driver nor the driver who is drunk&mdash; the words used here in the discussion of the section&mdash;but the driver whose capacity to drive has been undermined as a result of having taken drink.  I am not at the moment primarily concerned with the drunken driver, but with drinking.  There are three types of motor car driver&mdash;the person who has not taken drink at all, the person who has taken drink to the extent that it impairs his judgment but leaves him capable of driving and the person who has drink taken to the extent that he is incapable of driving.  I think attention was drawn to that distinction by Deputy Coogan's amendment.  I am very glad the Minister will re-examine that question carefully before the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt in most people's minds who have examined the question that the present clinical tests are so completely fallacious, so open to error and to misinterpretation as to be virtually useless in the case particularly of the person whose judgment is impaired, not the person who is incapable of <Col N="634" /> driving.  The person incapable of driving is so obviously so that the clinical tests are virtually useless.</P>
    <P>The tests of co-ordination, whether a person can walk along a straight line, whether a person's speech is slurred, whether the pupillary reactions are slightly slow, whether he zig-zagged along the road when driving, can vary so much in degree as to be virtually useless, particularly in the type of case where the power to drive has been diminished.  Persons are now driving cars at probably from 50 to 100 m.p.h.  Consequently, the dangers of reduced reaction or diminished powers of co-ordination or reduced powers of response to emergency are, and must be taken to be, very serious considerations in the question of the drinking driver, the person who has taken drink but who is driving a car.</P>
    <P>Emergencies now occur so rapidly, with increased traffic and increased speeds, that we must take more seriously the person who, through having taken drink, is no longer a person who can safely be trusted with a fast car, a car capable of doing 50 m.p.h. and over.  Therefore, if one is to restrict oneself to purely clinical tests with this type of dangerous driver, the person who has drink taken, the person who has diminished power or control over the car, I do not believe there are any clinical tests which are of any use whatever.</P>
    <P>The only test that that person is not quite as good a driver as he was before he took his two double whiskeys or two pints of stout, the only test that he is not as capable as he was before drinking, is the test of the emergency, that is, that he does not answer to the emergency when it comes up, the accident happens and the person is killed, wounded, maimed, or whatever it may be.  I do not think that, clinically, it is possible in most cases to say that that person's powers of response at the time of the accident were so diminished as to render him liable to this mandatory jail sentence.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for any doctor to say in that middle case that this person was responsible through having drink taken <Col N="635" /> before the accident.  One has this great diversion of opinion between the lawyers who are merely following their profession in taking the two sides but, in the medical evidence, it is most disedifying, I suppose, if one looks at it superficially, to read in the national and provincial Press of the doctors of each side taking completely contrary views on what should be a fairly simple question of deciding whether or not a person was responsible for an accident as a result of having drink taken. However, I think there probably can be <i>bona fide</i> grounds for a difference of opinion as to whether a person is responsible for an accident as a result of having drink taken and because of the fallacious nature of the clinical tests which are available to the doctor in this type of case.  Therefore I think it is absolutely essential that we should seriously consider the introduction of some kind of chemical test which may have its own defects but which, from the point of view of accuracy, is far and away superior to the grossly inaccurate and unreliable clinical tests which are available at the moment and which can vary from individual to individual.</P>
    <P>Even in a condition of absolute sobriety, the inability of an individual to walk a straight line or pick up matches off the floor, the co-ordination of hands or feet, in whatever the test may be, may vary very much in an individual also who has just had an accident, or who is suffering from shock, or apprehension of a charge or the seriousness of the prospect facing him.  All these things can affect the clinical tests so much as to make them virtually useless.</P>
    <P>There are available three tests to which I have referred.  The breathaliser entails the inhalation of the breath containing alcohol into a machine.  The effect of ethyl alcohol on an indicator in the machine changes the colour of a chemical indicator which moves a hand over a disc and indicates immediately the alcohol content of the breath. The generally-accepted standard is that where there are over 50 milligrammes present that person is no longer a safe person <Col N="636" /> to drive a car.  In Denmark, where this test is used, that person is suspended for two months.  If he does not accept suspension, a blood test is used and if he is found to have more than 150 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood he is sent to jail for varying periods.  The breathaliser is probably the most accurate of the chemical tests.  I have not included it here because probably it would require a much more complicated and costly apparatus than that required for the simpler blood test.</P>
    <P>There is then the possibility of using the blood test.  The blood test depends on the taking of blood from the person immediately after the incident and if there is between 0 and 50 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood then the person is not suffering in any way from the effect of alcohol and can safely drive a car.  If the person is found to have more than 50 milligrammes in 100 millilitres of blood and less than 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood then he is unfit to drive a car and a danger to the public.  If he has 150 milligrammes or more per 100 millilitres then he is what we call &ldquo;dead drunk&rdquo;, so drunk as to come under the Minister's clause &ldquo;incapable of driving a car.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This blood test presupposes this very important category of persons who are not incapable of driving but who are a danger to the public because of the presence of between 50 and 150 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood. This test is reliable but it has a couple of theoretical weaknesses or objections. I think they can be overcome.  One weakness is the fact that, in taking blood, the doctor uses alcohol to clean the skin and in that way the needle going through the skin could take up some alcohol and thus alter the end result.  We must and can readily avoid this by the choice of a different cleansing agent.  The second objection is the objection of the analyst's error. This is the error found in most chemical work.  Where analysts are doing a test for the first time or do very few tests, they are not quite as accurate as if they do hundreds of tests.  There is an easy way out of that which is to try to centralise the test so that one <Col N="637" /> analyst can do most of the tests thus increasing the accuracy.</P>
    <P>The other weakness, which may have worried the Minister, is the fact that there are up to 200 different ways of measuring the amount of ethyl alcohol and each one of them carries its own slight inaccuracy.  I think that difficulty could be overcome by laying down by regulation the uniform form of analysis or method by which the ethyl amount of alcohol is found.  In that way the analyst's error could be reduced to a minimum by centralising the tests and by restricting the type of test to the same test for the whole country.  With increased practice would come increased skill and restriction in error. Then the variations due to the test error would be the same and the defects of the slight error due to analyst error would be reduced to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The case for this test is overwhelming. The test has been tried out and approved by a number of committees. In Britain the Medical Research Council have set up a committee, under Professor Drew, which have made it quite clear that the tests were perfectly accurate within the slight errors I have mentioned.  A British Medical Association Committee have said that they cannot conceive of any circumstances in which it could be considered safe for a person to drive a motor vehicle on a public road with an amount of alcohol in the blood greater than 1.5 per cent, that is 150 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    <P>The London <i>Times</i> has also given its imprimatur to these tests by saying: &ldquo;Nor is there any doubt as to the efficacy of the blood-alcohol tests as a measure of fitness to drive.  Whereas the rough, if ready, clinical examination tests at present in use are notoriously unreliable, the same cannot be said of the biochemical tests.&rdquo;  These tests are used in many countries.  In Norway they have been used since 1926.  They have been used in Sweden, in Denmark and in between 40 and 50 States of the United States.  They have been used in Canada for many years. We are not breaking any new ground if we decide seriously to consider the <Col N="638" /> use of these tests.  The position now is that if we continue to rely on these very crude clinical tests, which are so crude as to make them relatively valueless, and which justify the differences of opinion which one sees in the medical evidence given before the courts so often, it is very wrong of us to ignore the fact that scientific advances have made it possible for us to leave aside these clinical tests and not to use them as a make-believe in coming to a final decision.  We can use them if we wish as a makeshift in coming to our final decision.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we cannot possibly leave aside the fact that these scientific tests are available.  It would be like treating diseases with the old remedies when we have antibiotics available.  It is just as if a person came to a doctor with a cough and the doctor examined him with a stethoscope and said: &ldquo;You are all right&rdquo;, and did not take an X-ray; or if a person experienced pain after an accident and the doctor told him he was all right but afterwards the person was found to have a fracture.  The courts would find that the doctor in those cases was guilty of malpractice because he did not have an X-ray of the person's chest to see if he had tuberculosis or an X-ray of the bone to see if it was broken.  Similarly where a doctor tries to assess the degree of culpability of a person who has drink taken but is not drunk, and relies solely on clinical tests, when there is a scientific test available, he could probably be accused of malpractice in omitting the scientific tests and denying the courts the great value which they have.</P>
    <P>I fail to see what objection there can be to the introduction of tests of this kind.  If a person has taken drink and knows that he has not taken it to excess, clearly he would agree to the test because he knows he would be proved innocent.  To that extent it would be a great help.  The amounts of drink which create the different levels in the blood could be publicised. I understand that a pint of stout or a pint of beer will leave the body just under the 50 milligramme level.  Two pints will bring it above the 50 milligramme level but under the 150 <Col N="639" /> milligramme level.  A person can take two small whiskeys or a double whiskey and still remain under the 50 milligramme level; if he takes more than that he will go above the 50 milligramme level and thereby reduce his co-ordination and reliability in driving a car.  In that way, people who want to drink could continue to drink in moderation.  It would be possible for them to know beforehand that if they drink in excess of that specific amount, they bring themselves within the penalties laid down by the House for so doing.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have every right to treat these people in the same manner as we treat the person under Section 48 who is told that if he is, to his knowledge, suffering from any disease, and continues to drive a vehicle, he will be a danger to the people and will be subject to certain penalties.  If we introduced these blood tests it would be possible to tell the individual: &ldquo;If you take so much alcohol you are quite safe; if you take so much more you come within the 50 milligramme and 150 milligramme level for which you can be penalised and if you go above the 150 milligramme level the penalty can be so much greater.&rdquo;  The individual then has the right to decide to what level he will drink, or when he will stop drinking. He is in a position to make the decision for himself and should be ready to take the consequences of any decision he takes.</P>
    <P>All around us we see countries who long ago have availed of the great advantage which follows the use of these blood tests.  They would be a great help to the court and to the judge, who would be able to say: &ldquo;That is the finding of the analyst.&rdquo; It removes from him the appalling responsibility which he has at the moment of trying to decide whether a person is culpable or not, and it would remove the rather disedifying situation in which doctors quarrel over the question of whether or not a person had picked up matches, or whether his speech was slurred.  It would also remove attempts by Gardaí in their <Col N="640" /> own way to assess the question of reduced reliability of an individual in driving a car.  It is quite clearly outside the scope of the Garda and the doctors to decide the incapable-of-driving class.  Any fool, I believe, can do that across the room.  It is the in-between case which is difficult, the person who is just as dangerous and in some cases probably more dangerous than the person who is incapable, because there is a likelihood that the person who is incapable will not attempt to drive but it is a person whose reactions are merely diminished and who continues to drive, who causes most of the accidents.</P>
    <P>We would also find we would be in a better position to assess the real truth as to the influence alcohol has in motor accidents than at present, in view of the present position of uncertainty, the humanity of the judge or justice who decides to give the benefit of the doubt to the person because of conflicting evidence&mdash;which must be conflicting because of the fallacious nature of the clinical tests.  We have figures relating to the causation of accidents through drink which I imagine have very little validity.  There are figures available from other countries which show that after 10 p.m., say, they are in the region of 60 per cent. due to drink and in the overall 24 hour period from 10 per cent. and 20 per cent.  I do not know whether these figures are reliable.  I am certain our figures are not reliable. I am inclined to think that drink is a cause of more accidents than our statistics show and that these tests would be a help and leave us without any doubt in regard to the numbers of accidents caused by alcohol, particularly fatal accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Chemical tests in the case of drunkenness have now reached the stage where after a great deal of experimental effort, they can enable us to decide the question on a factual basis.  When the matter was first broached it was largely a matter of opinion.  I think we have to admit now in the light of experience, that there is a very strong case to be made for chemical tests.  There is also a very considerable degree of certainty based on the facts as to what these tests mean. <Col N="641" /> The difficulty I see in these tests is not that they are not desirable or practicable in the present procedure, but whether, with the density of population in this country, it is feasible to organise such tests on an effectual and realistic basis.  That is the question which I, if I had to decide the matter, would put the proposers of tests.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to expand a little further on my own reaction to the question of chemical tests. I have had a little experience of the matter in the courts and have seen a picture which would largely tie-in with what Deputy Dr. Browne has said.  We have a picture in many cases, and I have here before me documents concerning a case which I would consider to be fairly typical, which is generally something like this: when a person is charged with a charge, the essentials of which are being drunk in charge of a vehicle, the charge frequently arises, in the first instance, by reason of an accident, a complaint or the accidental fact that a Guard has observed and apprehended the delinquent.</P>
      <P>When the case comes to court, we first have the immediate evidence for the prosecution to show the condition of the man as it appeared to the nontechnical witnesses, amongst whom I include the Guards.  There will be evidence that his breath smelled of drink, that he staggered or may have been a little unsteady.  He will have been brought to the Garda station and the Guards there will supplement the evidence of first apprehension and in many cases some of them will be for and some of them against the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case I have before me, I have brought in the documents because in it the Guards differed.  The man was convicted but the Guards differed. They gave extremely fair evidence.  I do not want to give particulars or names, for obvious reasons, but the conduct of the Guards was such as to give great confidence in the police and in the honesty of the sergeant and the Guards concerned.  Two of them doubted that the man was incapable. Inevitably, at some stage of the case, a doctor was called in.  Usually, a doctor is called in at an early stage <Col N="642" /> by the police and the man himself is always asked by the Garda if he wants a doctor of his own.</P>
    <P>The drawback in the medical evidence is the intrinsic weakness in the clinical tests themselves.  The doctor is at a disadvantage because he does not see the man until a significant time has elapsed and it usually results in a doubt in the minds of both doctors.  They start at a disadvantage and they start with a doubt.  That doubt usually results in the doctor called by the police saying that the man is incapable of driving and the doctor called by the accused saying that, in his opinion, he is fit to drive.  The end of the whole thing is that the court is thrown back on the general evidence.</P>
    <P>I have often asked myself whether, in these circumstances, the calling in of medical evidence is a help at all.  I have always felt that it is not fair to the doctors concerned and I have always doubted whether the medical evidence is nothing more than an excuse for the decision and whether the real case is not tried on the early evidence.  A judge will always direct a jury that it is on the general impression their common sense gives them that they are to decide the case and that they are not to give undue importance to any particular bit of evidence.  I have asked myself whether the bringing in of the doctors for these clinical tests is really a help at all.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are two further considerations.  The public want a feeling of assurance that there is some uniform standard of judgment in such cases.  They feel that if a man is charged with being drunk, there should be some kind of test of universal application.  There is always the feeling that the accused should have the benefit of the maximum amount of certainty.  If the clinical test is as doubtful as Deputy Dr. Browne says, there is a strong case for a chemical test.  I think we can go as far as saying in regard to the chemical tests that there is a degree of certainty about what they mean which is not only borne out by laboratory <Col N="643" /> experiments and tests but also by a considerable amount of experience.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt now that, whether it is a breath test or a blood test, it can be told with certainty that a person has consumed a certain amount of alcohol and has that percentage of alcohol in the blood which it liable to impair the ordinary man to a certain extent.  I think I could go modestly thus far in saying what the test means.  Everybody will admit that there would be individual variations. In other words, you could have a blood level of alcohol which in the case of one man might make him very definitely incapable of driving, while another man might get by with it.  I speak subject to correction.  I do not think that matters.  We have to approach it on the average level and the average level now is a determined, objective thing.</P>
    <P>I am not so much concerned, in the interests of public safety, as to whether the individual man was at the moment of driving in the particular case incapable to a degree of driving that car.  I am not concerned with the fact that this man could drive, notwithstanding that he has consumed as much alcohol as averagely would make him incapable of driving.  I do not think that is the point in issue.  I do not think that man should get the benefit in this case because of his exceptional constitution.</P>
    <P>The essence of the whole thing is that we know now that a motor car is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a person who is not capable of driving. It is dangerous, anyway, in the hands of the best of us.  Anyone who takes the risk of driving that motor car in circumstances we know now are dangerous to the public should take the consequences and I am prepared as a legislator here to take that view now, with the facts as we know them, with the statistical and laboratory information that we have.  For the average person, it has been statistically proved that the levels which have been mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne are dangerous.  If we take these levels, arbitrary though they may be to some <Col N="644" /> extent when applied to the individual case, these are the levels which will determine culpability or not. In all crimes, there is an arbitrary element.  We are not departing very far in this if we go so far as to say that if the test proves that the person is above the limits, he takes the consequences.  If I am driving a car, I do not need to drink and, if I drink, let me take the risk.  From the point of view of the community, it is better that the risk imposed on me should be an individual risk as to whether I have exceeded the level or am risking killing persons.</P>
    <P>The only difficulty I see in this approach is that some exceptional person who is in fact drunk will get away with it on such a test.  I know that people who would argue against the test would be thinking in terms of the unfortunate man who might just be caught because the test would work one way.  The test might work the other way.  One of the objections I would see to the test is that you might have a case that would get away merely on the test.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for these tests, but, from the practical point of view, I must ask the proposers of the amendment some questions which should be answered.  I am not able to give the answers to these questions. The first is: can we, in practice, provide for the tests sufficiently quickly to make the procedure effective? The next point we must face is that once you lay down tests&mdash;and this is where I think the lawyers will perhaps lean to the old procedures&mdash;it will tend to be and, in fact, must inevitably become, the sole arbiter of the question.  In other words, if you determine to have a chemical test and there is an arithmetical answer to the question as to whether the man is drunk or not, it is almost inevitable that that will be the sole arbiter and all other evidence will become almost superfluous, so far as that charge is concerned.</P>
    <P>Lawyers also know the difficulty when there are concomitant charges. It might be easy enough to answer if a man has driven dangerously.  The drink test will dispose only of the <Col N="645" /> drunkenness.  The dangerous element can be dealt with by witnesses on another charge.  Unfortunately, it is not so easy, in practice, to separate charges in that way and the general principle is to try to be specific for the benefit of the accused in these matters.  That is an objection.  I have already asked the question about the density of population, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Altogether, the attitude I should like to advocate is that, in regard to a specific drunkenness charge, where it comes to clinical evidence, the chemical test appears to be very much superior to any other, but there are broader issues and these are the questions which have to be answered before we could commit ourselves completely to that line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to support the principle that we should endeavour to adopt some scientific test in respect of persons who are accused of the crime of driving a car whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  I wish very briefly to repeat some of the remarks I had occasion to make yesterday on another section of this Bill concerning the manner in which persons at the present time are liable to be convicted for this offence. At the present time, an accused person is usually met at the hearing of his trial by a number of Garda witnesses who not only give an account of what they have seen but also add what their opinion is of the man's ability to drive a car.</P>
      <P>The accused will also, but not invariably, be met with a witness from the Guards, a doctor, who has examined him.  It has happened in my experience that the Garda witnesses have stated that, in their opinion, the man was incapable of driving a car by reason of the influence of intoxicating liquor and the police doctor who has examined him immediately afterwards has stated that the man was sober&mdash; not sober, that is too strong a word &mdash;was fit to drive a car.  That discrepancy arises in cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion&mdash;I have said this before&mdash;it is wrong that ordinary members of the Garda should be allowed to give their opinion as to the capability <Col N="646" /> of a man to drive a car.  It is the ordinary rule of evidence that the opinion of a witness, unless he is an expert, cannot be given.  That rule is made for a very good reason.  It is a matter for the justice, the judge, or the jury as the case may be, to make up their own minds as to the circumstances. In the case of experts, the opinion of experts can be given.  It is for that reason that the opinion of doctors&mdash;doctors are experts&mdash;is allowed as evidence in the courts.</P>
    <P>Recently it has been decided that the Garda may give their opinion.  I should like to see that changed by legislation.  There is a particular reason; the Garda very frequently, perfectly <i>bona fide</i> and acting quite honestly and fairly, as they think, are inclined to have a bias no matter how objective and unprejudiced they may try to be.  I have had experience of Garda witnesses who have seen an accused person for less than three minutes giving an opinion that the accused was literally incapable of driving a car.  It is absolutely necessary that Garda witnesses should give evidence as to what they saw&mdash;the accused person stumbling, not walking properly, thick as to speech.  In those circumstances, they should quite properly say what they saw.  If they smell alcohol off his breath, then they should say so.  If the accused speaks in a blurred or slurred fashion, that evidence is perfectly admissible.  But we should not permit a situation in which such witnesses can go to the length of saying that, judging by what they saw, they came to certain conclusions, conclusions which are purely and simply matters of opinion and are really matters for the court to decide.</P>
    <P>This argument is strengthened by what is now being done in this Bill because, under this Bill, we are making it practically mandatory on a justice to send a person who is found guilty to jail.  There are of course, the exceptions to which I have referred on the previous section.  But, in the circumstances outlined, we shall deprive a man of his liberty on evidence which, in the majority of cases, may not be entirely satisfactory.  If it is the intention to retain this almost mandatory <Col N="647" /> sentence of imprisonment we should also ensure that the evidence which will send the offender to prison is as foolproof as possible.  I think we should introduce these scientific tests in order to ensure that.</P>
    <P>There are arguments against these scientific tests but I am quite satisfied that the balance lies in favour of their introduction.  There may be practical difficulties.  If there are, let us hear them.  If there is a reason, let it be discussed.  I cannot see any insuperable practical difficulties against carrying out these tests.  But, if there is a reason, then the Minister should say so, and he should discuss it.</P>
    <P>There is another argument to the effect that these tests are not always absolutely accurate.  The other evidence on which a person accused of this crime may be convicted is certainly not always absolutely accurate. If an accused person is placed in this position he should at any rate have the right to submit to a test and facilities for the carrying out of such a test should be available.  I think there is a great deal to be said for either making this voluntary or not making it compulsory. There is a lot to be said for writing into our legislation a provision which will mean that an accused person can submit, if he so wishes, to a blood test, or any other type of scientific test available.  The results of such tests can subsequently be used in evidence against him, if he submits to them.</P>
    <P>There is another factor to be taken into account.  Deputy de Valera referred to the fact that courts will pay a great deal of regard to the conclusions arrived at on an analysis of this sort.  It must be provided, of course, that an analysis of this sort is not conclusive evidence against an accused person, and it will be open to adduce other evidence.  It may be possible to rebut what will be a very strong presumption if, in fact, a fairly high degree of alcohol is found in an accused person's bloodstream. The matter has now become so serious and so grave we should take every step to see that injustice is not done.</P>
    <P>I am as keen as any man to get rid of the drunken driver from our roads. <Col N="648" /> In Sweden they have introduced a mandatory sentence, coupled with these scientific tests, and they have had a dramatic success in reducing the incidence of accidents in which alcohol is a factor.  The experience in Sweden and elsewhere has been dramatic.  I think we could achieve the same dramatic results here, too, but we must ensure, when we are dealing with the liberty of the subject, that the system we devise will not lead to the conviction of an innocent person.  That is why I strongly urge we should bring in some scientific measurement into these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the desirability of much more publicity in relation to offences.  I suggest that the House should consider the desirability of having notices placed prominently in licensed premises, setting out the offences and the consequences attaching to any who offend.  Under the Innkeepers Liability Act, every innkeeper and hotel proprietor is obliged, if he wishes to rid himself of certain responsibilities, to put a notice in a prominent place in his hotel.  One sees that notice prominently displayed. I cannot see any reason why proprietors of licensed premises should not be legally obliged to display notices, warning those who patronise their premises of the consequences of going too far.  I believe that would have a desirable effect.  It could also be made clear by means of advertisements what the consequences of consuming a certain quantity of alcohol are.  That, I believe, would be a powerful deterrent.</P>
    <P>In view of the manner in which it is proposed to deal with this matter in this draft legislation, the matter has now become of such serious import that the House would be wrong if it did not seriously consider taking every step now available to us by reason of scientific development to ensure that injustice is not done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a peculiar thing that we are here discussing in relation to road accidents one of our biggest and most remunerative industries. It seems peculiar to me that we are faced with a situation in this countries <Col N="649" /> try where we can allow any person to drink as much as he likes.  There is no stay on that.  A man goes into a public house, bar or lounge bar and there is no objection to his drinking as much as he likes.  After consuming what liquor he wants to consume, he is then expected to use his judgment as to whether or not he should drive a car.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to try to deal with a situation where a man, incapable of thinking, is to be put to what is described as a blood test.  All of us appreciate the difficulties.  We talk about the importance of drink and the tourist trade in the general economy of the country and the benefits derived from the trade by farmers and all and sundry.  It is a peculiar position where we find that one of the biggest industries and businesses in the State is also a source of a great many of our accidents.</P>
      <P>It is a correct assumption that drink is responsible for many of the fatal and other accidents on the roads, but it is amusing that we expect the drunken man to use his judgement as to whether or not he should drive a car.  That sort of situation can be prevented only by the type of deterrent suggested in this amendment.  It is very difficult to argue with a man when one believes he is drunk.  Everybody in this House has had the experience of trying to induce a drunken man to part with the car keys so that one can drive for him. He immediately bristles and insists he is able to drive the car.  Therefore, I think that the last suggestion made by Deputy Costello is one that might prevent those who have too much drink taken from driving motor cars, that is, notices or signs in a publichouse or public drinking places showing the penalties to be inflicted on one who drives while drunk and especially on one who drives and has an acccident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me also&mdash;I know this is not possible&mdash;that in the public drinking places, we might have the test made.  I do not know whether that is possible or whether it will be possible in years to come.  It would be a very handy thing if every drinking place had a testing machine to tell a man or woman whether or not he or she was <Col N="650" /> capable of driving a car.  On this section, we have emphasised the matter of driving while drunk but there are other reasons for accidents, as the House is well aware.  One is just as incapable of driving properly when one is very annoyed or worrying or suffering under great stress or strain as when one is suffering from an overdose of drink.</P>
    <P>One commonly sees, as the last three Deputies said, the farcical exhibition in the courts at times of reputable doctors giving conflicting evidence.  There is no difficulty in this country at the present time in getting a doctor to say a man is capable of driving when by an ordinary layman, such a man would be described as being blind drunk.  Has anybody ever known a case in which a person accused of drunken driving could not get a doctor&mdash;and usually his own doctor&mdash;who will be prepared to go to the police station and certify the man capable of driving and not being drunk?</P>

      <P>The difficulty arises from what Deputy Dr. Browne says&mdash;from the uncertainty of the clinical tests and the time factor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Dr. Browne on this amendment and some things are not quite clear to me. I should like to know if Deputy Dr. Browne could give the House an indication of what amount of drink would be represented by .5 per cent. of alcohol in a person's blood&mdash;that is, a person of average health.  I should also like somebody to tell me whether two large whiskeys or two small whiskeys would represent .5 per cent. of alcohol in a person's blood and whether in another person eight whiskeys would represent .5 per cent.  I am not a medical man and I do not know whether the tests Deputy Dr. Browne speaks of could give an answer to these questions.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a very good thing if every driver who drinks had an idea of his capacity.  Personally, if I drank, I would go, therefore, through an experiment to find out what amount of liquor I could consume.  Then I would have a certificate to drink a certain amount.  If I consumed that certain amount, I would be, according to the particular test&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be.  I wonder how accurate these tests can be because it is a well-known fact that some people can get drunk on one or two whiskeys, while other people can consume ten half whiskeys or two dozen bottles of stout and still be quite capable.  I do not know how the test stands in relation to such circumstances.</P>
      <P>However, I would support the idea in principle in view of what happens in our courts when conflicting evidence is given by people who are regarded as eminent doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by what Deputy Dr. Browne said.  These tests have been used with great effect in Norway, Denmark and Canada and in parts of the United States of America.  It was said that they were used with great success in Denmark or Norway.  That is encouraging. Therefore, if it is possible to have this <Col N="652" /> test introduced into this country, I certainly would give it my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of how much drink one took is not the question at all.  The question is: does it make you incapable or were you incapable? That defeats Deputy Dr. Browne's clinical proposition, because the clinical test may show a person had only so much alcohol in his blood.  Some people can be drunk and incapable on a couple of beers and other people are like Margaret Barry, the tinker, who says she can drink rings round Brendan Behan and it has no effect on her.  Where is the margin then? It is not so much a question of how much drink is in the blood but whether the person is incapable, and nothing else.</P>
      <P>I remember when I used to drink first, I could get drunk on two glasses of wine.  Had I been charged in the courts, I would have claimed this test, because one or two glasses of wine would not have made me drunk in a clinical sense, although I would have been drunk.  If I were Margaret Barry, I would appear quite capable, but suppose some Garda insisted on a test, I would not take the test because I would be proved to be dead drunk. That is the point with regard to clinical tests.</P>
      <P>Remember doctors' evidence is of no consequence on this issue at all. The simple question is: were you found incapable?  It does not matter whether you had drunk a thimbleful or a gallon.  That is not what you are being charged with.  The Germans in Nuremberg were charged not because of what they had done but because they had lost the war.  In this case you lose if you are incapable.  Otherwise, you can drink barrels.</P>
      <P>Science and clinical tests cannot be the deciding issue in matters affecting human nature.  Human beings differ and it is ridiculous to say they do not. I was told that the man with the big head is the man with brains, but I have inspected mental institutions and I did not find that to be the case.  You cannot decide these matters by tests. It is a question of whether the person is incapable and nothing else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what Deputy Sherwin is driving at, but I cannot agree with him because surely the basis of the whole difficulty is that we cannot assess the degree of incapability? The present position of what Deputy Dr. Browne calls the clinical tests has manifestly failed to do that. I agree absolutely with what Deputy Dr. Browne has said, but I am not absolutely satisfied that the precise wording of the amendment is the best. I hope that he will get some assurance from the Minister that the matter will be reconsidered, so that the amendment can be withdrawn at this Stage and reconsidered on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>We must all agree that the setting up of a standard of .5 per cent alcohol content is to a certain extent arbitrary. At the same time, I think it is inevitable.  The worst that can happen is that someone with .5 per cent of alcohol in his blood, who has not suffered any impairment of capacity, will, in fact, be convicted of being so impaired.  The figures are clearly stated, and as Deputy Dr. Browne said, one glass of stout or one pint of stout or beer, will probably keep you inside the limit.  Possibly two pints of stout or beer will keep you within the limit, but one small whiskey will bring you very near the limit, and two whiskeys will definitely put you over the limit. We can hardly get some rule of thumb method which would be a sufficient guide to everyone.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has suggested certain difficulties which may arise in a technical sense.  Very properly, he did not pay any undue attention to those difficulties.  I cannot agree with Deputy de Valera on this point.  I believe that if we get tangled up to much in figures, we will never get anywhere.  As I have said before, I heard a very prominent European statesman give very good advice.  He said: &ldquo;Never ask an expert whether a certain course can be followed; tell him to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a course which should be followed in this case.  We know that scientific experts are sufficiently well qualified to devise suitable and <Col N="654" /> reasonable safety tests.  I do not think we in this House should start worrying about whether the cleaning of the skin with alcohol before a blood test is taken will upset the test.  We must tell the experts to find some way of carrying out tests which will be reasonably accurate.  Supposing we still have some doubts about them, surely we can raise the percentage of alcohol permitted from .5 to .6 or .8 or whatever we may decide, if we feel that is a reasonable safety precaution. We must take a definite decision in the House while the Bill is before us on whether we shall have scientific tests of how much alcohol may be in a driver's blood stream without danger to the community.</P>
    <P>This is not unlike the situation arising with regard to speed limits. There are a number of very skilled drivers who could take reasonable risks by driving at fast speeds in comparatively congested areas, but we do not say to them: &ldquo;Your skill is sufficient and you need not comply with the speed limit.&rdquo;  We say: &ldquo;Whether or not your skill is sufficient, you shall comply with whatever speed limit the Minister may lay down&rdquo;, thereby restricting the liberty of certain people unnecessarily.  We must take the jump here of restricting the liberty of people who drink, and even restricting the liberty of people who drink a considerable amount, without apparently showing any sign of impairment of their capability. That is not unfair in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope that either the Minister will accept this amendment, if he is perfectly satisfied with it, or that he will be prepared to give an undertaking that he will seriously consider either this or some other scientific test, and introduce an amendment of his own on Report Stage, or else inform Deputy Dr. Browne and the House that he does not feel able to do it himself and give someone else an opportunity of putting down a further amendment on that Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would infer from the statements made in this <Col N="655" /> House that drunken driving is a permanent crime in this country.  We are all very pleased that that is not the case, and that it is only rarely these cases crop up.  They seem to be national news and whether a person is charged with being drunk in charge in Cork or Donegal, the case is reported in the Press.  That, I believe, is as it should be, because everyone is anxious that drunken driving should cease.</P>
      <P>In this amendment, Deputy Dr. Browne seems to have given an impartial way of dealing with offenders who are brought before the courts.  We are all aware of the conflicting nature of the cases which go before the courts under this heading from time to time and of the conflicting nature of the judgments given.  Listening to Deputy Booth who has given us an idea of what Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment actually means, I do not believe in it at all.  I think it is ridiculous.  If I were to accept Deputy Booth's interpretation of what Deputy Dr. Browne said, if a person is brought to a Garda station charged with the offence of drunken driving he would only have had to consume two halves of whiskey. I was not here when Deputy Dr. Browne spoke but, from what Deputy Booth said, I gather that one half would be very near the mark and two halves would leave him well above it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows very well that the vast majority of publicans and bar assistants, if they find a person inclined to take too much drink, will refuse to supply any more drink to him.  I am a publican myself and if anyone entered my premises who was liable to require more drink than he was capable of consuming, particularly if he were driving a car, he would not get it.  I am sure the same applies in almost every town and village.  Imagine putting an obligation on a publican to put a notice in his premises that if a person is found guilty of taking two half-ones he is liable to six months' imprisonment. That is ridiculous especially in the light of Deputy Costello's interpretation of this section that it is mandatory on the justice to impose a <Col N="656" /> term of imprisonment when a person is convicted.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Booth has said very few of us are conversant with what Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment means.  Being a doctor he understands the terms he uses.  However it is ridiculous to impose an obligation on a publican to refuse service to a person who has only had two half-ones or two pints of stout as the case may be.  Furthermore it imposes a restriction on the freedom of our people.  We must also bear in mind the punishments already meted out to people convicted of drunken driving.  First of all, there is a disqualification, secondly, a fine and, thirdly, in a number of cases, imprisonment. Everyone driving a car, whether he likes to drink intoxicating liquor or not, is very watchful of keeping within the law.  It is mandatory in his own personal interest to do so.  We all agree that severe punishment should be inflicted for such drinking offences but to impose the drastic punishment of a jail sentence on persons who, when they are tested, are found to have more drink than that mentioned in the amendment which Deputy Dr. Browne seeks to insert in the Bill, is fantastic. It could happen that a person who would be well known to be able to consume four half-ones without its interfering in any way with his capacity to drive, could be brought along to the station, having consumed only that amount and, on being tested, becoming liable to imprisonment.  For these reasons I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment but I should like him to have limited the amendment to the first sentence which reads:</P>
      <P>In any proceedings for an offence under <i>Section 49</i> of this Act the court shall have regard to any evidence which may be given of the proportion or quantity of alcohol which was contained in the blood of the accused...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know Deputy Dr. Browne has produced a good deal of evidence to show the efficacy of clinical tests, or blood tests as they are more commonly called, but it is also possible to produce <Col N="657" /> a good deal of evidence to show that these blood tests are not reliable in all cases even though they are in a good many cases.  They have gone to the stage when they can be admitted as supporting evidence in favour of the State's case or in favour of the defence.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility that as time goes on other types of tests will be invented and brought in which will be of greater assistance in deciding whether a person is capable or incapable of driving a vehicle.  Therefore I should like to see some provision made in the Act to enable blood tests or clincal tests to be produced as evidence of a man's capability or otherwise to drive a vehicle.  It is particularly important that we should give the man who is accused of being incapable of driving a car every opportunity of demonstrating that the charge is false particularly since, as pointed out by Deputy Costello, Section 49 makes it mandatory on the court to impose a sentence.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer but I think that sentence could be circumvented if a sentence of imprisonment to the rising of the court were imposed.  That is another reason why we should be completely satisfied in our minds that the driver has had a fair chance of proving his innocence.  If we make the Act so rigid that the court must impose a sentence and if justices get the idea that the weight of sympathy is against the driver, they may simply circumvent that provision by imposing a nominal sentence to the rising of the court.  That would defeat the intention of this section.</P>
    <P>I share the wish of other Deputies that a man who is genuinely incapable of driving a vehicle should receive the very severest punishment.  I think I am right in saying, however, that statistics do show that the percentage of accidents that arise from drunken driving is comparatively small.  There are many other contributory factors which are dealt with in other sections of this Bill.  I give limited support to Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment and suggest it should stop after the first sentence.  There are very many other factors which have to be taken into <Col N="658" /> consideration besides clinical tests, although great progress has been made in this respect.  Account must be taken of the capacity of one driver as against another to consume alcohol, the age of a driver, even the sex of a driver. All these things enter into it and I do not see how one can lay down a rigid alcoholic blood content for all drivers.  Sufficient margin must be allowed to enable the court to judge the case on the merits of the evidence before them.</P>
    <P>We must agree that doctors do disagree in these cases, but at least they do produce the evidence to the judge and the jury.  If the judge or jury are not satisfied with that evidence or if it is too complicated to give a clear decision on it, there should be an opportunity of producing any other evidence that may exist.  I would not exclude from that evidence the question of blood and clinical tests.  I hope the Minister, if he does not accept the amendment in its present form, will find some way of revising it to suit the purpose intended by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>

      <P>We have had a very interesting academic discussion on this amendment.  Very few of us appear to agree on it.  First, very few of us appear to agree as to when a man is incapable of driving a motor car.  If we disagree as to when he is incapable of driving and doctors disagree, how can we ask a district justice to decide on the opinion of a layman, possibly a Garda recruit, on the capabilities of a driver or otherwise?</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with this amendment. There is just one thing which worries me.  It is what Deputy M.P. Murphy said.  What is the quantity of intoxicating liquor which would produce .5 per cent alcohol content in the blood?  It is something Deputy Dr. Browne may have explained.</P>

      <P>If it is, I am afraid I shall have to support Deputy Russell and suggest we should confine it to the first sentence of the amendment. Deputy de Valera explained in detail the pattern of prosecutions in the district court at the moment.  A man is accosted by a Garda, possibly a recruit, who comes to the conclusion, as a result of his observations and as a result of his sense of smell, that the man is incapable of driving and he is taken to the barracks.  He is then asked if he would like to call in a doctor and is told he may have a doctor of his own choice.  I do not care where it is in rural Ireland&mdash;it will be half an hour before a doctor is procured. Another doctor is procured by the Garda.  There may be a difference of view between the two doctors as to whether the man is capable or otherwise. Then we are thrown back, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, on the general evidence tendered by the Garda.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the facts of a case which occurred in my county recently, although I do not like quoting cases.  A man was accosted by a Garda at 7 o'clock in the evening and told he should not drive his car.  He thanked the Garda and said he would not.  He went back to his hotel, had soup and a meal and remained there until 9 o'clock.  The Garda was evidently afraid the man might drive the car later and he put another Garda to watch the car.  When this man came out at 9 o'clock, the other Garda observed him staggering and stumbling. He observed his face flushed.  He got the smell of drink&mdash;admittedly, stale drink&mdash;from him and arrested him.  Within 20 minutes, the man had his own doctor examine him and within three-quarters of an hour the Garda doctor examined him.  Both doctors agreed that the man was then sober, but on the evidence of the Garda he was fined £15 and his licence was suspended for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The snag is this.  I could lay 100 to 1 that man will succeed in his appeal, but that appeal will not be heard for about four months.  In the meantime, he is debarred from driving a car, <Col N="660" /> because our justices refuse to remove the endorsement pending the hearing of an appeal.  No matter what happens, he is going to suffer.  He is a man who can ill afford to suffer because driving a car is part of his means of livelihood. If we had a test such as Deputy Dr. Browne suggests, the evidence of those two doctors would be corroborated by the certificate of an analyst. The justice would have no option whatever but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Possibly Deputy Dr. Browne might be able to tell us how it would be possible to procure a sample within a reasonable time before the alcohol content has disappeared.  It would be a good thing if we had a test of some description.  The only one suggested is Deputy Dr. Browne's test.  Doubt has been cast by many Deputies on whether it is practicable but we should not dismiss it lightly.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine for us to have an academic discussion and disagree, but the poor unfortunate in the dock in the district court, who stands to lose his employment or means of livelihood, would be very glad to avail of any straw at which he might clutch for the purpose of proving his innocence, be it by way of test or otherwise.  As Deputy Declan Costello pointed out, supposing we have not got a test or a doctor, what have we got?  In the opinion of the Garda, he is incapable of driving as a result of the consumption of intoxicating liquor.  Is it fair to ask a district justice, who has before him no other evidence than the evidence of the Garda and the evidence of the defendant himself, who generally will be regarded as being biased, to come to a decision?  That being so, until something more advantageous is advanced, I support Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment.</P>

      <P>I mentioned last night that the service provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs affects the life of each one of us.  In no way is that fact more noticeable than by the activities of the postman. I join with other Deputies in urging reconsideration of the position of auxiliary postmen, some of whom have given as long perhaps as 50 years' service in that capacity.  Some system of superannuation should be devised for that grade particularly as it has now been found possible to provide <Col N="663" /> for a contributory pension in our social welfare code.  I cannot see why there should be any insurmountable difficulty in devising a superannuation scheme for auxiliary postmen.</P>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the tribute paid to the efficiency of our postal services and not alone to the efficiency but also to the courtesy accorded to the public.  A very large volume of business is transacted.  That is particularly so at the Christmas period when one is amazed at the efficiency and expedition with which the postal authorities handle such a large volume of traffic.  The reorganisation which is taking place and which has been carried out in the larger areas has helped very much in that respect.  There are people in areas in my constituency who are very pleased with the improvement in the delivery service, apart from the general improvement.</P>
      <P>There has been a falling-off in the number of telegrams.  The reason is understandable, to some extent.  The experience of people living in rural areas is that telegrams do not arrive as quickly as they might because, in the ordinary way, there is no provision for a delivery service.  Telegrams are not considered by people living in rural areas to be the speedy type of message which people some decades ago considered them to be.</P>
      <P>Recently I had occasion to send a telegram&mdash;rather a novelty if you like &mdash;to a small village in my constituency. The post office there has a telephone but, as I discovered later, it has not a telegraph service and therefore my telegram was delivered to the next post office, approximately three miles away. I was able to get in touch more rapidly by telephone, and did so later, with the person concerned and at that point he had not received the telegram.  There is no blame to be attached to anybody for that.  Where there is a telephone in a post office, those in charge of the telegraph service ought to consider making use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister's <Col N="664" /> references to the extension of the automatic system.  There is to be an extension in Croom.  I am curious to know the basis of selection of areas for automatic exchanges, how the priority is decided, whether it is on the basis of the volume of business, and so on.  I should also like to know when we may expect the automatic service to be extended to the other exchanges.</P>
    <P>I am interested to learn that the microwave radio link is to be used and that its extension from Limerick to Tralee will fit in with the service to West Limerick.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the centres which will benefit from this extension in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year, and Deputy Blowick referred to the point yesterday, the need for telephone kiosks in rural areas.  I was in communication with the Department in regard to the Ballyhahill and Athea areas in this matter as they both serve large rural areas.  I have been informed that the volume of traffic would not warrant the erection of the kiosks there.  Very fortunately, and very co-operatively indeed, the post offices assist the locals in any emergency.  It is not reasonable to expect that people can be knocked up at night when some emergency arises.  Nowadays livestock are very valuable and the veterinary service is much appreciated.  A farmer likes to be able to call on the veterinary surgeon if an animal becomes ill.  A telephone kiosk in a village might save a farmer a journey of may be three or four miles to a place where there is a kiosk.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to expect that the telephone in the local post office should be available at all hours every day of the week.  When the post office is closed on the half-day and at other times a person in a rural area may not readily get the use of a telephone. Therefore, even at the risk of some loss, a telephone kiosk should be provided to carry whatever private telephone traffic must now be carried by the post office.  Very often nowadays, in small rural areas where business is growing and the telephone is in such favour, existing exchanges find there is <Col N="665" /> delay because of lack of lines to central exchanges.  This is being remedied and I am sure there is a relation between the number of lines and the number of subscribers, but sometimes subscribers may not understand the difficulties.  If a spare line could be provided between the local exchange and the central exchanges, it would help appreciably to speed up business.</P>
    <P>I know there is a big demand for installation of telephones and the Department are doing their best but any speeding-up in that regard would be much appreciated, especially in rural areas where the telephone has come to be accepted as the speediest means of communication.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister referred to commemorative stamps.  Generally, the stamps are very beautiful and have maintained a very high standard.  I think we should anticipate these events and it would help greatly in publicising an event if the commemorative stamp were available before or at the commencement of the particular period.  In this Patrician year, we expect a large number of people to turn towards Ireland and we hope the issue of the Patrician stamp will not be long delayed so that it will serve to remind people abroad, getting correspondence from this country, that the Patrician year is being observed here.</P>
    <P>The Post Office savings service is most efficient.  The amount invested is a great tribute to its stability.  It is creditable to the people and to the nation that despite the fact that we sometimes deplore our seeming poverty, there is a sum of approximately £100 million, representing the savings of our people, either in the Post Office Savings Bank or the Trustee Savings Bank. Both the depositors and the Post Office are to be congratulated, the latter on being able to provide such stability as to inspire the confidence of investors.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I think the Minister and his advisers might consider, whether it is possible, in view of the large amount invested, to give a somewhat higher rate of interest.  It can be said that the people's savings must be available within three or five days <Col N="666" /> but I do not think there will be any practical difficulty in providing for the normal amount of withdrawals and, at the same time, enhancing the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>On the subject of radio programmes, I shall be very brief.  I should like the Minister, at all stages, to be answerable to the House for these programmes.  I do not think it is wise to shed authority in regard to semi-state bodies and it should be possible to have control exercised by the House.  Certainly any semi-State body should be accountable to the House for funds placed at its disposal by way of grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>In regard to programmes generally, starting with the evening programme for children, these are very interesting in that they present dramatised historical events for children in a way that conveys an appreciation of such events.  Adult programmes are varied &mdash;too much so, at times.  If you are interested, 15 minutes goes too quickly, especially where good music or sporting events are concerned.  To cut off a sporting event at the end of the allotted time because another programme is due to begin often causes annoyance to the listeners.</P>
    <P>I doubt if we make sufficient use of our bands.  We used have the Garda band and the Army bands which are rarely heard now.  The musical programmes given by the No. 1 or No. 2 Southern Command Army band were excellent and it is a pity that we should lose the opportunity of letting people appreciate the better type of music.  Quite an amount of the modern type of music comes into the country through our own programmes, certainly through sponsored programmes and from outside stations.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with the view expressed last night that the traditional music of this country is not worth having. Any nation claiming that title retains its traditional culture as we may see in Europe at present, in Spain, Italy, Holland, Poland and Scandinavia. The native music and dances of these countries are preserved.  We would be very unworthy of our own <Col N="667" /> traditions if we did not give due prominence to native culture, including music, without overdoing it.  If anybody feels aggrieved in that respect, there is the simple remedy of turning off the radio.  What has been done for native culture and its preservation is most praiseworthy and such programmes as seanachaí, traditional plays and songs are well worth keeping and recording.  When you have it rendered by choirs of the type of Cór Cois Laoi, I think Irish music is at its best in depth and feeling.  I think that we could, with advantage, hear more of it.</P>
    <P>In the final portion of his speech, the Minister referred to the surplus and deficit accounts over the five year period.  It is very heartening and praiseworthy to find that what was a deficit of approximately £368,000 in 1955-56 has become a surplus of £389,000 in 1959-60, which represents a changeover of approximately three-quarters of a million pounds.  If we are to read anything into that, it means that the business-like methods now in use in the Post Office have succeeded.  Since there now seems to be a growing surplus, I wonder would the Minister consider whether the time has come for either improving the service or lessening costs to the benefit of the people who are participants in this national business of the Post Office. In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for his courtesy at all times and for the manner in which he has attended to matters brought to his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote of £11 million is one which touches the everyday lives of the people, particularly throughout rural Ireland.  The post office in rural Ireland, in all the small towns and villages, is the centre where many transactions are carried out.  In towns and villages where there is no bank, the post office is the savings bank of the people; it is there that the old age pensions are paid out every Friday, as well as contributory pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and children's allowances.  These transactions together with the telephone exchanges and the sale of stamps of different sorts, result in a big volume of business in all the small offices <Col N="668" /> throughout rural Ireland.  As the years go by, the work of the subpostmasters and subpostmistresses is increasing and I agree with Deputies who have advocated that their pay should be commensurate with the importance and volume of the work with which they have to deal.</P>
      <P>I wish particularly to support the case made for auxiliary postmen.  It is a shame that these auxiliary postmen have not got a pension scheme.  In my county, Galway, for years we have had a superannuation scheme for county council workers to which they contribute while they are working.  I raised this matter of superannuation for auxiliary postmen by way of question in this House before.  I admit that matters have improved since 1st of January last, and, when they reach the age of 70, they will be entitled to the contributory old age pension of £2 a week, if they are single and, after next August, to £3.10 a week, if they are married.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter with some of those concerned and their principal worry is in regard to the period between the age of 65 and the age of 70.  They have to retire, even though they are only auxiliary and temporary, at the age of 65 and they have no pension until they reach the age of 70, when they will be entitled to the contributory pension.  From the moral point of view, the temptation is there to get certificates to say that they are suffering from some ailment or other in order to obtain some benefit from insurance until they qualify for the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in other Departments they have a contributory scheme to bridge that gap of five years.  If it could not be brought in for all time, perhaps the Minister might consider having a scheme to cover that five year period for these auxiliary postmen. They have to be up at a very early hour every morning, in all kinds of inclement weather.  They are most welcome when they call to the houses in rural Ireland and although sometimes they bring sad news, mostly they bring good news.  Their job is very onerous and difficult and something should be done to provide some sort <Col N="669" /> of superannuation scheme for them in respect of the five year period I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister announcing that television will be in operation before the end of the year.  I was on the delegation, headed by yourself, Sir, which visited the B.B.C.  Television Centre in Britain.  We realise the amount of good or evil that television can do for a country and it is good to know that we will have our own programmes.  As the previous speaker said, we can have our culture and outlook and our way of life televised and not have imported programmes alien to our ideals and traditions.  From the educational point of view, our own programmes will be most welcome and I trust use will be made of that field.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear the Minister announcing the improvements to be made in the telephone service.  I understand, however, that in his Department there is still a long list of applicants for installation of the telephone service and I trust that applicants in rural Ireland will get priority.  There is nothing more important than the telephone, especially in remote places.  I have seen cases in which if there had not been telephones in remote parts, human lives would have been lost, not to mention the many animals that would have been lost if farmers had not been able to telephone for a vet. Without the phone, these people would have had to go a long journey. If any priority is being given, I hope it will be given to the people in the more remote places in rural Ireland. I join with previous speakers in complimenting the Minister on his kindness and courtesy at all times and in wishing him well in the very important work he has on hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is mandatory on me at the outset to refer to our long-standing grievance in West Cork as to the inadequacy of reception from Radio Éireann.  It has been mentioned during the debate on every Estimate for the Department for the past number of years without result, irrespective of what Government were in office.  They have a standard reply <Col N="670" /> to any complaints.  To quote the Minister's opening statement, he said that, regarding poorer reception of the Athlone programmes in certain parts of the country, he had intimated the previous year that he proposed to ask the new Authority to give special attention to this problem.  He said that he had done so and that there had been discussions but that no solution had yet been arrived at.</P>
      <P>That is the position.  There is no solution to this problem.  We have not got any people in this country sufficiently qualified to find a solution to it. When we submit complaints, what happens is that some few technical people are sent along.  They call on a few complainants and say that the matter is receiving attention.  That has been done within the past few months, but once again the Minister has not found any solution.  It is evident that the Minister is codding these people in West Cork.  What good do these people do except to impose additional expenditure on the Department?  I think that is wrong, unfair and unjust and that it should cease.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if this is a question of money.  Would it cost too much to rectify the complaints?  If so, the Minister should say so, as Ministers have done in a number of other matters. The Minister should say that to solve the problem of reception in West Cork would cost so many thousands of pounds and that he feels such expenditure would not be justified; in other words, that the reception they have there is good enough for them and that they are not worthy of any better.  This attitude of the present Minister and of previous Ministers should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I to assume from the Minister's statement on this question that there is no possible means of devising any scheme to improve the reception in West Cork, that it is impossible to do so and that the most qualified people we have are incapable of finding a solution to the problem?  Surely our technical people are more qualified than that?  Surely we have people who are sufficiently qualified to provide a solution to this problem which I do not regard as a major problem, if it were tackled properly and if the officials of <Col N="671" /> the Department had the will to tackle it properly?  I am sure that any other speakers in this discussion from West Cork cannot but support the statements I have made.  We are buried alive down there and we, the three Deputies for the constituency, have received many letters of complaints from private individuals and public organisations.  The Minister must be aware of the number of representations he has received from local authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>I want again to refer to the standard reply we receive to these complaints, the reply that they are going to have an investigation and to send some people into the area.  They have been doing that for a number of years and, as a member of this assembly, I cannot but assert that it is a wanton waste of money.  It is just an excuse to the people of West Cork.  Early on, I accepted that excuse.  When I found that Radio Éireann had sent technically qualified people to West Cork to find a solution to the problem, I felt that they were doing the best they could. Now I know it is a joke and a big one.</P>
    <P>What will the position be when the television service is provided at the end of the year?  Is it to be limited to a section of the country, even though the Minister has used the term &ldquo;a nation-wide service&rdquo;?  Is it to be for all or are the areas far removed from Dublin and in the remote parts of the country to get the same type of service as we get at present from Radio Éireann?  I will confine myself to my own constituency in West Cork. Is the same position to apply there when we have the television service going?  The Minister should make clear his position on that matter when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>I have to say that so far as the type of reception in many parts of West Cork is concerned, the Department are obtaining the licence fees under false pretences.  When they are unable to remedy the problem and ensure reasonable reception, they should not take the licence fees from the holders of sets.  I believe it is unfair for the Minister to accept the licence money.  It would be impossible <Col N="672" /> to sell radio sets in West Cork, were it not for the good reception of outside programmes.  There is very little difficulty in getting Luxembourg and the English stations.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for Deputy Hilliard as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I believe he is a conscientious man who would like to be helpful but that whatever views he has expressed have been overriden by the big noises in his Department and by Radio Éireann.  I want to bring home to him forcibly that, whatever the cause, this matter should get his immediate and careful attention.  When the TV service is provided, whether at the end of this year or in 1962, it should be, as the Minister has described it, a nation-wide service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt mentioned the position of auxiliary and unestablished postmen and referred to one matter in which I am particularly interested and to which I have referred on a number of occasions in the House, namely, the provision of a pension scheme for auxiliary postmen.  Almost all public servants and all local authority employees have pension schemes.  I cannot see why a pension scheme has not been devised for auxiliary and other unestablished postmen.  Deputy Kitt suggested that the retirement age was 65.  I doubt if that is correct.  My view is that there is no retirement age and that many postmen continue to work until the age of 75, for the reason that the only alternative is to retire on the old age pension of £1. 8s. 6d. or even the contributory old age pension of £2 a week, for which they would now qualify.  County council workers, for instance, automatically qualify for the contributory old age pension, in addition to their superannuation from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour to devise a superannuation scheme for auxiliary postmen.  I appreciate that their conditions have improved recently and that the number of these men in full-time employment has increased.  I recognise that that is a very healthy situation.  The position that obtained was not a very good one, where three or four postmen were <Col N="673" /> working from a post office for three or four hours daily, at inadequate rates of pay, which meant that they had to find other employment to supplement their income.  The present system of establishing as many postmen as possible and giving them increased hours of service is much better.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the question of subpostmasters.  Subpostmasters, through their union, are agitating for certain concessions and I believe they are justified in some of the representations they have made. Their case has been referred to by a number of Deputies.  While it can be contended that a number of the smaller offices have not a very great volume of business to transact on behalf of the Department, it must be borne in mind that 800 subpostmasters earn less than £200 a year, that is, less than £4 a week, which is a very small wage for such a high percentage of the total number of subpostmasters.  The Minister should establish for these people a scheme of conciliation and arbitration. Many branches of the public service have secured such machinery and the Minister would be wise to set up such machinery for subpostmasters.</P>
    <P>It surprised me to learn that the Minister refused to receive a deputation from the subpostmasters' union because I believe the Minister is the last person in this House who could be charged with being a dictator in any sense of the word.  I would not charge him with being a dictator.  I was surprised to find that representations made by the subpostmasters' union to the Minister with a view to having consultation with him were refused.  I wonder if that decision was made by the Minister himself or is the Minister a little too easy-going.  I am not finding fault with the Minister but I believe he is a little too easy-going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in refusing to meet the union and that other influential sources may be trying to drive the Minister here and there.  That is the danger with an approachable man such as the Minister, that he may be too easy-going and may be misled so far as his public duties as Minister are concerned by people who may feel that they are superior to him, so far as qualifications are concerned.  I am asking the Minister now to retract that decision.  If any group of people in his constituency should have occasion to approach a Deputy, he could not refuse to receive them, as their representative in the House.  Even if he felt that their case was not a good one, he would at least hear them, which would be the democratic thing to do, and discuss whatever problem they had with them.  The Minister is on the same footing as any other Deputy in that respect and I am surprised that he refused a request from a representative group such as the subpostmasters' union to receive a deputation and to discuss their problems.  I would ask the Minister to review the decision and to meet these people.  That would most likely bring about an amicable arrangement, which would be the best way to deal with these problems, rather than adopt the undesirable attitude of refusing to discuss matters of common interest between the Minister and the union.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the all-night telephone service in most areas makes the work of subpostmasters more difficult and the allowance in respect of the service is very small.  In some provincial villages with a population of from 400 to 600, the extra allowance for the service is in the neighbourhood of £60 to £70 or about 25/- a week.  It is not fair to ask a subpostmaster or his assistant to remain on call after normal closing hours from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. for about 25/- a week.  I hope that the Minister and the union will be able to devise amicable arrangements that will solve the problems, to their mutual advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the provision of telephones.  I am glad to say that the demand for telephones is steadily increasing because their advantage in <Col N="675" /> rural Ireland cannot be over-estimated. I hope that in the not too distant future there will be a telephone in almost every home.  Many people in rural districts recommend the provision of public phones at cross-roads in reasonably populous centres.  We have a number of such centres in West Cork.  I appreciate it may be rather expensive to provide these kiosks at these centres but, if private lines are provided to a limited number of houses in the area, there should be no difficulty in erecting a kiosk at a suitable crossroads.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been raised in this debate is the delay which occurs in getting calls through in some areas.  In Schull, where I reside, the delay is quite long, even in the case of local calls.  One has to wait a considerable period.  I understand the same position obtains in other districts in West Cork.  I should like the Minister to address himself to that grievance. Possibly he will be able to do something to abate the nuisance caused by long waits for phone calls.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister remembers another item I raised in this House, long before he became Minister, and to which I propose to refer again today. It is the question of the provision of a telephone service for islands.  The one island in West Cork without that service is Long Island, one mile off Schull.  Last year, the Minister told us it would not be an economic proposition to provide a telephone service for this island because there are only 50 people in residence.  To my mind, that is a ridiculous argument. I am amazed that in the year 1961, any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should feel that there is no obligation on him to provide such an amenity for these 20 residents of Long Island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies welcome the fact that we are allowed to discuss everything on this Estimate. There is nothing so disconcerting to a hesitant speaker like myself as to be ruled out of order when talking about television because it is not included in the Estimate.  It is very difficult to divorce from one another the different facets for which the Department is responsible; one must speak of them as a whole.  For that reason, I welcome the decision.</P>
      <P>There are two sections in the Department which I consider require a new deal.  The first are the auxiliary postmen.  This matter has been dealt with very fully by other speakers.  I cannot understand why some superannuation scheme has not long since been drawn up for these men.  So many speakers have stressed this matter that I am sure the Minister&mdash; he appears to have an open ear to suggestions&mdash;will give it very sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>The second matter is the position of subpostmasters.  These men are facing changing conditions since the advent of telephones into rural areas. Offices which heretofore closed at 8 o'clock are now remaining open until 10 p.m., and some of the subpostmasters work right round the clock. The work is heavy and responsible.  I was told by a subpostmaster recently that he and his wife had not been able to go out together for years because one or the other had to remain on duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on the subject.  I am glad that the Minister proposes to give an extra line to Wexford.  We are, perhaps, a little off the beaten track there and that may be the reason why we have always suffered from a lack of trunk facilities.  We are an important tourist centre.  Many cross-Channel <Col N="677" /> and Continental people spend their holidays in Wexford.  They complain they are not able to get proper trunk facilities to enable them to communicate with their offices.  I hope the new line will be more satisfactory and that we will have a better service than we have had in the past.</P>
      <P>While I am on the subject, I should like to say that a trouble from which we suffered over a long period seems to have disappeared as a result of the efforts of the technicians who came down to investigate it.  One used to share one's telephone line with some kind of intermittent jazz band.  The trouble seems to have disappeared, though recently I had to listen to the jazz band for a short time.  It may have been due to a tree branch touching the wires, or something like that.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion, I asked the Minister for a call office or a post office in Monageer and he informed me then that he did not consider he would be justified in acceding to my request. In this modern competitive age, it is essential that everybody should be able to compete to the fullest extent possible. In days gone by, there was a post office in Clondaw.  The area is still pretty thickly populated, despite emigration.  In this area, between Ferns and Enniscorthy, there is neither a post office nor a call office.</P>
      <P>This area is six miles from Ferns and seven miles from Enniscorthy and is an intensive tillage area.  We produced a good deal of the wheat that the Government were so anxious should be produced in abundance.  In fact, we produced so much that they do not want us to produce as much in future. We are a tillage county and it is necessary that the farmers there should be in contact.  Apart from anything else, they will want to call a doctor or a veterinary surgeon but there is no telephone in the area whatsoever.  I think it is a matter to which the Minister should give further consideration.  I do not know if the position is similar to that in West Cork or whether the Minister's advisers have advised him against doing it.  I am now asking him to give a sympathetic ear and consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> There is a considerable reduction in trunk calls.  The Minister explained that by saying that there is a local extension of calls.  Where some calls were formerly trunk calls, they have now become local calls.  The Minister knows the difficulties.  He knows that if one is trying to phone anybody in the line of business, it is difficult to get in touch with the particular person one wants.  I raised this matter before. One might ring up from the country to get, say, a piece of machinery but the three minutes elapse before one gets the person one wants.  Experience teaches me that unless you get the person you want, you will not get the piece of machinery.  It is a waste of time.  The same thing happens in the case of a medical practitioner who tries to get on to a hospital.  Unless he can contact the person in authority, he will not get his patient into hospital or under the care of the particular person he wants.  You cannot do that in three minutes.  I submit to the Minister that he could extend the time for a trunk call from three minutes to four minutes.  It is my experience over the years as a doctor and as a Deputy and farmer that when I telephone to contact a particular person, I invariably find myself exceeding the three minutes.  That may be good business from the point of view of the Minister or from the point of view of the State.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to equate the position all over the country.  We in rural Ireland&mdash;I think every Deputy will bear me out in this&mdash;face that difficulty.  I do not think the Department will lose anything by adopting my suggestion.  These lines are not occupied all the time.  They may reduce the time available relative to serving a certain area but I am sure the telephone will be used far more and that there will be more applications for telephones.  That brings me to the question of the installation of telephones.</P>
    <P>The Minister was a little coy when talking about the rate at which telephones are being installed.  I know his difficulties and I appreciate them. Dublin is getting a rapid service.  All areas in Dublin are getting a rapid service, except two areas referred to <Col N="679" /> here&mdash;one of which is Walkinstown.  I forget the other one.  It is probably one of these new built-up areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that rural Ireland should get its fair quota of service.  At one time, the position was that the gangs that go out and work on the installation of telephones had orders to return to the depot.  That was the original plan. I wonder if that still obtains?  I wonder if that prehistoric condition no longer exists?  If telephone operators come down to work in a particular area to instal telephones, they pass by the gate of somebody who made an application for a telephone some two years back.  They carry out their work, pack up and go away again.  That leads to considerable difficulty and ill-feeling and it is a costly proceeding.  If you are to try to meet and facilitate in some way the numerous people who are looking for a telephone service, it should be worked on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>I do not know why we are not able to get telephones more quickly.  It may be that it is a question of material, much of which is probably imported. We may not have the personnel available to deal with the matter. Judging by the statistics which the Minister gave to the House, there is going to be an ever-increasing demand for telephones.  He should try with all the energy he can command to give to the people of the country a quicker service.  If he cannot do that, I suggest that he should equate the installation of telephones in rural Ireland with that in Dublin so that he will be able to come to this House next year&mdash;if he is still Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;and tell us that all areas in rural Ireland have been completed, with the exception of one or two.  I hope they will not include county Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not get a service as they should.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are a vast number of Irish exiles in Britain who are very interested to hear, through the medium of the news bulletins, the daily happenings in this country.  In the London area, there are a tremendous number of Irish people who are unable to get reception from Radio Éireann.  I do not know what the correct technical term is for what I have in mind&mdash;in German, it is <i>aussender.</i>  I do not know what the English for that is but the force at which the waves are sent out is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>Surely we must consider whether or not it is desirable to increase the strength of Radio Éireann?  I think it is particularly desirable to do so, in the light of circumstances in the world today.  There is no doubt that the economies of every country are becoming more complementary and the relations that exist through the medium of international organisations make it imperative that every country should be able to project its point of view to the furthest points possible.  It was very truly stated here that Luxembourg and other foreign stations can be heard distinctly.  There is no reason why Radio Éireann should not do something about this matter and do it fairly quickly, too.</P>

      <P>It may be a question of heavy finance&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but perhaps the Minister would clear the matter up when replying to this debate.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of television. I wonder if the Minister is wise in deciding on the 405-line standard?  I do not know if that is a hard and fast decision, and I do not know if it is possible for the Minister to avoid taking it, as so many 405-line standard sets have already been bought. There is to be a conference in May or June in Stockholm, according to the Minister's statement.  I presume that is May or June of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very likely that a line standard will be fixed.  The technique of television has improved so much that it will be possible to receive continental stations even in this country, and certainly in Britain.  By a relaying system it will be possible to receive all the different stations.  Because of that, it might be desirable for the Minister to hold his hand with regard to a definite decision as to line standard, or even to delay, if necessary, the introduction of television.</P>
      <P>People are buying television sets now and, in fact, all these sets are imported.  We are to have television on the 405-line standard.  A considerable amount of money will have been spent, and we may find subsequently that we can get only our own service, That will be detrimental to the service and detrimental to the revenue from television.  There is nothing more important than that the Department should get revenue from television. From the debate we had here, and from the facts revealed in the very excellent report of the Commission, it is evident that we will have considerable difficulty in making ourselves financially solvent with regard to television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the essentials in making ourselves solvent is that people will be interested in purchasing sets and paying the licence fee.  We have no other means really of getting revenue, unless <Col N="682" /> we get advertisements.  To get bulk advertisements which will pay us, we shall have to get outside advertisements, and to get them we must have high standard programmes here, which I very much doubt we will be able to afford.  For that reason, I would advocate caution.  I think it would be a mistake to jump into television because we have decided to have television, and the sooner we have it, the better.  We must weigh all the consequences.  If we go ahead and there is a change in line standard the Minister will have to come back and look for a big Supplementary Estimate to tide him over.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's function in television, a body has been set up which is to be responsible for television and sound broadcasting.  I very much deplore the system whereby if we have some matter we want to raise in Parliament Ministers answer questions by saying they are matters of day-to-day administration over which they have no control whatsoever.  That is a bad system, a system which should not have been allowed to grow up.  A classic example of that system is C.I.E., which has driven nearly every Deputy mad.  This new body will be the same. It will have full autonomy and we will have the same position in which the Minister will say he would like to do something, to answer the question, or to deal with the problem, but he is precluded from doing so by virtue of the Act or the constitution of the Authority.  I would ask the Minister to give consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>I find myself fully in agreement with Deputy Jones with regard to special commemorative stamps, when he said that they should be issued prior to the period of the commemoration itself. The Patrician stamp is a classic example.  Many people will be coming to Ireland who probably have never been here before, or who have not been here for years.  If the stamps were issued prior to the period of the commmemoration, their sales would be enhanced, and apart from that, it would be an advertisement of the fact that we were having a Patrician Year.  Letters from people to exiles in different parts <Col N="683" /> of the world would encourage them to come here.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have to lick 30 stamps a day.  Is there any reason why a commemorative stamp should be twice the size of an ordinary stamp? I am sure the Minister has liked stamps as often as I have and perhaps he will remember that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the fact that there is poor reception in some districts in Cork.  I am sorry that the opposite is not the case in my own part of the country, because we hear too much of West Cork on the radio.  In that connection, I should like to stress a point I mentioned when I spoke on this Estimate in other years.  Many of the programmes on Radio Éireann to which we have become accustomed over the years should be given a rest.</P>

      <P>I believe people are fed up with the same people, the same lah-di-dah week after week and the same old accents.  There is one programme in particular &mdash;I do not want to be very specific; I am sure Deputies and the Minister will be able to identify it&mdash; in which the compere in dealing with children is particularly offensive.  Some of the questions he asks the young people should never be asked.  If the Minister can identify that programme from my remarks, as I hope he can, he might draw the attention of the authorities to the widespread impression that has been created amongst the people who listen to that programme, despite <Col N="684" /> the fact that it enjoys a certain amount of popularity.  For my part, I deplore the questions put to young children in that programme, which demand an answer that will reveal details of family circumstances, which are no matter of public concern and, indeed, should not be given publicity on the radio.  That programme and others of the same ilk should be dropped for a few years or a few seasons.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the provision of telephones and expressed the hope that the rate of installation in rural Ireland would be speeded up.  I thoroughly agree with him.  I know the difficulties in providing that service in the country.  These difficulties are not experienced in Dublin, but, nevertheless, the people in the rural districts are becoming aware of the advantages of a telephone service, particularly in connection with their farming activities, calling the vet, or indeed, calling the doctor in the case of family illness. Every effort should be made to give top priority to the claims of the people in the rural districts.</P>
      <P>One small complaint I have to make is that in certain areas where there are small telephone exchanges the people in charge listen in to conversations between subscribers.  Complaints have been made to me recently about one small exchange in my area where there is a lot of eavesdropping.  People in the locality are told of the business that is carried on over the phone between subscribers and given details of the conversations.  The Minister would be well advised to circularise these small exchanges where the operators are not too busy and advise them, in their own interests, that it is expected of them that secrecy will be preserved and that details of telephone conversations will not be revealed to the general public.  If the impression goes abroad that people cannot speak to one another over the telephone under a veil of secrecy, it will undermine the confidence of the public in the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to join with Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde in his appeal for a better deal for auxiliary postmen and subpostmasters.  A superannuation <Col N="685" /> scheme for the auxiliary postmen is long over due and the Minister might well direct his attention to the preparation of such a scheme.  Many of those men have given long service.  They work just as hard as the established postmen and, until the introduction of the contributory old age pension scheme in January last, they were cast upon the waves of the world without any pension scheme unless they were entitled to the ordinary old age pension.</P>
    <P>The subpostmasters have many grievances, the biggest one of which is in regard to remuneration.  Conditions of service also come into the question with the extension of the telephone and other services.  They are expecting a new deal from the Minister, Deputy Hilliard, and I am sure he will give their just complaints favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Minister and the Department on the excellent new post offices which have been erected in the past few years.  I refer particularly to the new post office at Galway.  The appearance of that office and the amenities available at it have been the subject of very favourable comment by visitors to the city of Galway.  The same applies to post offices which have been modernised over the past few years.  One such building has been modernised in my time and it is a credit to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I welcome the statement of the Minister that work will start on the new post office building in Ballinasloe during the coming year.  This statement by the Minister is long overdue.  The Department has been criticised for some years because of the derelict condition of the site of the new post office in Ballinasloe and it is to be hoped that work will start very soon.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputies from all parts of the House in thanking the Minister for the courtesy he has extended to all of us on every occasion we had to visit him.  We are very happy to have him with us.  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said he hoped he would be here next year.  It might have been a slip of the tongue.</P>

We have made repeated representations in this regard and I understand a Committee has now been set up.  I hope they will succeed in doing something practical to provide better reception from Radio Eireann.</P>
      <P>The coming of television may be a big step forward if used to the best advantage.  It could be of great educational value to the rising generation. When I look up to the Public Gallery I see a large number of children looking down on this Assembly.  It is not possible for all the schoolchildren in the country to visit Dáil Eireann and hear the debate but with the coming of television it should be possible to arrange a programme to be shown in every school.  Some of those children in the Public Gallery today may yet grace this Assembly as representatives of the people.  Television should be used to the best advantage for educational purposes in the schools.  I would ask the Minister to make the necessary arrangements to enable children to be the first to benefit from Irish television.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I mentioned to the Minister the necessity for a public telephone at a creamery in West Cork, at Shinnock, Dunmanway.  Over 100 farmers attend this creamery every morning and it would facilitate their business if a public telephone were situated beside that creamery.  The nearest telephone to the creamery is six miles away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the passenger service between Fishguard <Col N="693" /> and Waterford was discontinued in June 1959 after consultation between British Railways and the local public bodies concerned, on the grounds that heavy losses had been incurred by the operators for a number of years previously.</P>

During the past six months we have had considerable success, particularly in relation to the Fishguard-Rosslare route, where there will be extra sailings and far more space available for cars. It is obvious it is best to made representations and to take action where success is most likely to be achieved. The Deputy also knows that, by arrangement with Waterford Corporation and other bodies, the new container service between Waterford and Fishguard was in a sense a replacement or substitution for the passenger service.  In other words, the arrangement made with British Railways was to find a new kind of traffic, and I understand it is operating very successfully.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Oil pollution of the sea is an international problem which cannot be solved by this or any other country acting alone.  The principal cause of oil pollution of the kind of which the Deputy complains is the cleaning out of the crude oil tanks of oil tankers and the disposal of oily ballast water from such tanks on the high seas.  These persistent oils may be discharged many hundreds of miles out to sea and may be carried by wind and tide to pollute the beaches of this and other countries.  The only entirely effective method of preventing oil pollution is the complete avoidance of the discharge of persistent oils into the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> The International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, which is given effect in Ireland by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956, prohibits the discharge of oil or oily mixtures within certain sea zones.  It has not been possible to secure agreement on complete prohibition of the discharge of persistent oils and many countries with substantial tanker fleets are not signatories to the present Convention.</P>
    <P>A further International Conference on Pollution of the Sea by Oil is to be held under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation in April, 1962 and it is to be hoped that more effective measures for reducing oil pollution of the sea, supported by all the principal countries operating tanker fleets, will result from this conference.  In the meantime, the provisions of the present Convention are enforced in Ireland and there is nothing further that we can do on our own.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that ships are discharging their oil in a manner contrary to the Convention. It is very difficult to ascertain; there is no international policing.  Those ships of countries which signed the Convention are in honour bound to record in their books whenever there are discharges of oil.  Again, it depends on the honourable character of the ship's captain whether he conforms with the Convention.  A number of tanker fleets going around the world have not agreed to subscribe to the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The only real way out <Col N="696" /> of the difficulty would seem to be to persuade all countries to sign the convention and to find some means by which no oil is discharged in a way that it eventually reaches the coasts.</P>

      <P>Yes, in regard to inadequate service on the 11th instant, Ascension Thursday, the day to which the Deputy refers.  On that day, in spite of the Deputy's propaganda, for some extraordinary reason a vastly greater number of persons wanted to travel by bus than travelled by rail on the same day the previous year.  C.I.E. have occasionally to face difficulties of that kind.  They must go on the basis of logs in previous years and make whatever adjustment they think necessary, having regard to the special circumstances. This year, for the above reason they grossly underestimated the traffic.  There was some delay but it was not as excessive as the Deputy has stated.</P>

      <P>A scheme of credit for the purpose of placing on the incremental salary scales for secondary school teachers in respect of certain service in underdeveloped countries on the continent of Africa was communicated to the secondary schools in January last.</P>
      <P>Similarly, it is my intention to issue shortly a scheme of credit for placing on the salary scales in respect of certain teaching service in countries on the continent of Europe in relation to the teaching of continental languages. The primary purpose of these schemes is, respectively, to assist underdeveloped countries and to improve the teaching of continental languages in this country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question raises the issue of the extension of such schemes to cover teaching service generally in Great Britain and the Six Counties.  In countries where credit is given for teaching service outside those countries, the reason for so doing is the great shortage of qualified teachers there.  I might say that even in those countries the granting of such credit does not appear to be based on any overall educational principles, but varies from local authority to local authority in accordance with the degree of intensity of the problem locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since by and large there is no serious shortage of qualified teachers, save of teachers of science, in this country, a general granting of credit for overseas service would not be warranted here. In fact, it would not add significantly to, the strength of qualified personnel here, as in effect it would merely mean the taking up of a post by a returned <Col N="705" /> graduate as against the post being filled by a young graduate coming out of the university.</P>
    <P>In the case of science, there is in all countries a very acute shortage of qualified teachers, because of the attractions of industry from the point of view of the emoluments it can offer and the facilities it can provide.  For this season the problem of attracting science graduates into the teaching profession has not yet been solved anywhere.  Accordingly, it may be taken that the granting of incremental credit to qualified teachers of science for service overseas would have no worthwhile effect on the position here. In addition, unlike the case of Continental languages, in relation to which the benefit of a period of teaching in the appropriate country is evident, it would be invidious to select science teachers for special treatment in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department, however, is at present giving active consideration to methods of solving the problem of attracting qualified science teachers into our schools.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>61a.  Before section 50 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In any proceedings for an offence under <i>section 49</i> of this Act the court shall have regard to any evidence which may be given of the proportion or quantity of alcohol which was contained in the blood of the accused in excess of .5% as ascertained by analysis or measurement of a specimen of blood taken from him with his consent; provided that if it is proved that the accused when so requested at any such time refused to assent to the making of such test or measurement his refusal may, unless reasonable cause therefor is shown, be treated as supporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution or as rebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defence with respect to <Col N="706" /> his condition at that time.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Dr. Browne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Second Reading that this matter of blood tests, breathalisers and so on has been given fairly full consideration and that for various reasons I did not propose at this time and in this measure to introduce these tests for alcoholic content of a driver's blood. This is a matter, which, even judging by the length of the discussion here today, will undoubtedly give rise to widely differing views.  This matter was not included in the White Paper &mdash;which was one of the ways in which it was possible to ascertain public reaction to various other matters newly-proposed in this Bill&mdash;and as a result of that omission, if you like to call it that, we have not had the advantage of an expression of public opinion on the matter.</P>
      <P>The second reason I feel it would be unwise to deal with it here now by way of amendment, whether by this or any other amendment, is that so far research in relation to these varying types of tests has not been conclusive. The wide variety of opinion expressed here today as to the degree of alcohol allowable in the blood lends weight to the argument, and the belief which I myself hold, that we have not reached the point where we can, with any hope of improving our general code of behaviour in this very serious matter, state categorically that any particular level of alcohol in the blood stream is the right one, one that would be safe, or, if safe, would be capable of general application. Over and above that, the question of taking a blood test is one which raises problems which would have to be considered very carefully in relation to whether or not the rights of the individual under our Constitution were being violated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have said right off that my personal view was, and indeed still is, subject to certain qualifications, that if we can find a basis for testing which will be accepted and which will be foolproof, I am all for such tests, but at the moment there is no solid or recognised evidence that these tests <Col N="707" /> are conclusive, that they are reliable or that their application would make for justice being done more readily than if we did not have them.</P>
    <P>So strongly do I believe this, and so complex do I regard this problem, that I would rather see it being dealt with not by way of an amendment to this Bill, but more or less by special amending legislation which would follow from a very detailed examination by some expert committee or commission set up with a view to delving into the various factors, technical and otherwise, and which could recommend to this House what would be in the best interests of the public.  I feel that is the manner in which we should approach this matter. Indeed, it was with some reluctance that I omitted from the White Paper, and ultimately from the Bill, provision for these tests.  I omitted it not in error but deliberately because I believe the tests are not conclusive and because I doubt if anyone can lay down the figure for the content of alcohol in the blood which would serve our best interests.</P>
    <P>I do feel that if we were to have such a committee or commission, we should have technically qualified people on it, as well as a representative of the judiciary and of the Guards, and in addition, evidence from the public and others interested should be taken.  That is the manner in which we should reach a conclusion in this matter, rather than, as I say, attempt in this Bill to deal with a problem which is very complex and which could be dangerous, if not dealt with properly.  At this stage, it would have to be dealt with in such a manner that the end would not justify the means.</P>
    <P>The amendment by Deputy Dr. Browne would give freedom to the person concerned to refuse to have this blood test carried out but his refusal would be regarded as evidence against him.  That is not freedom; that is coercion.  If we are to coerce, let us be quite straight about it and say they must have it done, but there is no point in approaching this matter by saying that if a person does not want to have it he need not, but the fact <Col N="708" /> that he refuses will go against him and will be taken into consideration in a case heard in court.  I do not think it gets away from the objection I have already envisaged, that possibly it would be unconstitutional to require people to subject themselves to these blood tests.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, under this Bill if it becomes law, there is nothing to prevent a person who is charged with being drunk, or being incapable of exercising proper control over a vehicle through drink, from getting a blood test and submitting that test as evidence in his own behalf.  Let us be quite clear about that.  I know that the immediate reaction will be that that is putting the defendant to a lot of trouble, but if people feel so strongly about it and feel that these tests would be to their advantage, I do not think the trouble would be an insurmountable obstacle.  On the other hand, if this approach by those so charged were to gather any momentum, if it were to be invoked by these people generally, we would then, in practice, be gaining some experience in our court procedure of the application of these technical and clinical tests which are advocated.</P>
    <P>It is quite true to say that the amount of intoxicating liquor envisaged as being relatively safe, according to what is intended here and what has been said by Deputy Dr. Browne, is somewhere in the region of one and a half pints of stout or a glass of whiskey.  I wonder how many people who might otherwise be inclined to support this amendment would be so enthusiastic about it if they realised that this level of intoxicating liquor is as low as a pint and a half of stout or a glass of whiskey?</P>

      <P>Very well; let us say less than a glass of whiskey.  I should like to put this point to Deputy Dr. Browne.  The amendment mentions the figure of .5 per cent.  I wonder whether that is a mistake or a printer's error. From the calculations available to me, I think it should probably be .05 per <Col N="709" /> cent.  The figure of .5 per cent will be acceptable to all because I believe it is the equivalent of 14 pints of stout. That would meet all extremes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a big mistake. Let that be as it may, what Deputy Dr. Browne has talked about and advocated indicates that the level he would support would be in the order of a pint and a half of stout and less than a glass of whiskey.  I wonder whether this idea of a stated limit is so attractive or can we envisage the habitual drinker&mdash;and I do not mean by that an alcoholic but rather the person who is used to taking intoxicating liquor over a number of years&mdash;in his normal health, in whose case the limit of a pint and a half of stout or less than a glass of whiskey would be somewhat ludicrous.</P>
      <P>If we were to move up the limit in the other direction and if we were to have some application of what we know to be the average safe capacity, if such can be ascertained, we would be likely to find that we have a motorist who is not used to taking drink and who, in consequence of fatigue or lack of food, might find himself knocked out by less than the limit proposed.  In that regard, we would be taking the risk of encouraging people to take more than they could safely take because they might feel that they were entitled to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this brings me back to the idea that I am with the thought behind the amendment, with the principle underlying it and if we can find a method whereby we can reduce the risk of error in any direction, I would support it.  If we can do that by means of these tests, I should be very glad to have such tests.  If we had the advice of an expert group representative of the various interests and the people concerned with the administration of our laws, having given the matter their full and undivided attention and taking the views of the public in every shape and form and if we <Col N="710" /> had such a recommendation put before us after careful and detailed study, we would be much wiser in our approach than entering the unknown realm of relying on inconclusive testing procedures which possibly may prove themselves adequate but, as yet, are not reliable.</P>
    <P>Another point that presents itself is that, as the months go on, experience of tests such as are indicated here is being made available elsewhere.  We hope, by keeping in touch with what goes on in these other countries, to glean from their experience information to help us to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to what we should do here.  While there may be the feeling in the minds of some of our people that we should go ahead right away and include it in this Bill, I feel that it would be wiser and safer to restrain ourselves but we should not feel that the omission of these tests from this measure means that we are discarding the idea, that we have looked into the matter and that we do not think it should be applied here. Far from it.  If we can get the evidence to show that a test, or combination of tests, can be usefully used here in the interests of road safety and of justice to everybody, I shall be very happy to see them brought in and will be one of the first to advocate that they should be put into operation.</P>
    <P>I would say seriously to the House and to Deputy Dr. Browne that I am not convinced that we have sufficient knowledge at the moment to come down on the side of this procedure.  If we were wrong in it, we would probably do harm and put further back the time when we would be able to introduce and have accepted a better form of testing.  We might only put further back the time when we could have such a procedure as is advocated here used by everybody, if we were to adopt a system which might yet prove itself faulty.  If we did that, we would lose the confidence of the public, without which the whole intention of the Bill would be lost.  We have to remember that no matter how nicely we sort out the various parts and the various sections, if we have not got public opinion behind us in this measure, <Col N="711" /> above all other measures, we will not attain the end which we all so earnestly desire, that is, greater safety on our roads and safer user of the roads by all our people.</P>
    <P>That is the view I have.  The House should consider well the overall situation before expressing a wish to proceed in the manner suggested in the amendment, worthy though its intention is and with which intention I agree, but I am afraid I cannot agree with its application at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Minister's approach to this is very valid, in my opinion.  I see the force of what he says when he begins by saying that if the public realise the limits which a .05 percentage would impose, that is, a pint and a half of stout or three-quarters of a glass of whiskey, you would want public opinion in support of this amendment. I think public opinion would be in support of it because I think public opinion is prepared to take up the position that people who drive should not drink and people who drink should not drive.  That is the only basis on which I could defend this proposal, that you would set an arbitrary limit which would impose a virtual prohibition on the consumption of alcoholic drink while in charge of a car.</P>

      <P>I see the force of the Minister's view, but I have got the feeling that instead of trying to provide shocks to the public through the rigours of the penalties we provide for being under the influence of drink, we would be much better employed laying down a sure and certain Rubicon which this Legislature says a person driving a car must not cross.  You will get people who drink two glasses of whiskey and then wrap themselves around a lamp post and then have their blood tested and will come into court and say that the blood test only <Col N="712" /> suggests two glasses of whiskey and will then discover that, quite deliberately, the Legislature has provided that if you have taken two glasses of whiskey, you should not drive a car, that the maximum alcoholic content of your blood to permit of your legally driving a car cannot exceed&mdash;I take the Minister's figure&mdash;.05 per cent. When people realise that anyone who takes two glasses of whiskey renders himself liable to imprisonment under the Road Traffic Act if involved in an accident immediately after that libation, a man will simply make up his mind, if he has been seduced by an over-hospitable friend in taking two glasses of whiskey, to hire a taxi.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Murphy met me coming out of a club in Cork with my eyes flashing, and I offered to drive him home, and he had seen me take a glass of whiskey in the bar and noticed that I was a bit more loquacious than he was in the habit of seeing me, he would be very well advised to say, &ldquo;If you do not mind, I will take a taxi and I will drop you off.&rdquo;  I would certainly say it to Deputy Murphy in reverse circumstances and I think I would be his friend as well as a friend to myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great danger in this whole business is that it is not the man who is helplessly drunk who constitutes the real danger on the road; it is the man who is perfectly convinced that he is not in the least degree inebriated but just in cracking form and able to drive better than he ever drove before <Col N="713" /> and who, in order to demonstrate that to his neighbours and to himself, proceeds to cut a figure of eight around the bollard and ends up on the bollard or under the bollard or with the bollard in him; or who, when passing what he regards as a small and insignificant car, proceeds to demonstrate to the wife that the new car can really do its paces and proceeds to pass out and ends up under a breadvan.  That is the man who is the real danger and that is the man who has consumed what most rational Deputies would say was not an excessive quantity of drink.</P>
    <P>I want to try to create&mdash;and I am quite prepared to defend this outside&mdash; what we will accept and admit to be a wholly arbitrary and ultra-conservative limit of alcohol consumption by those who drive cars.  Let us measure it by saying a glass of whiskey or a pint of stout and, if you consume more, call a taxi or get a friend to drive you and the more certain you are that you are no more affected by that glass of whiskey or pint of stout than you would be by a glass of Vartry water, the more urgently essential it is that you call a taxi.</P>
    <P>You will get a good deal of grousing about that but I do not think there is a bar in Dublin where if a man started grousing about that restriction being put upon him, you would not find one or two people to say it was damn near time somebody did it.  It has the immense value of certainty.  Once you leave this vague phrase &ldquo;under the influence of drink&rdquo;, the real menace on the road will continue to be a menace because he does not believe he is under the influence of drink.  There is no use in railing against it because he is quite honest in the belief that he is not under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>Can we not be frank about this?  Is there one amongst us who has not met a valued friend on at least one occasion who has assured us that there was not a trace of drink on him and that he was never better able to drive a car than at that moment when it was perfectly manifest to us that he was just in that condition <Col N="714" /> when he ought not to go within an ass's roar of a car?  We all must have had that experience.  I know of no other way of providing effective security against that except the adoption of the rule that those who drive should not drink and those who drink should not drive.  If that rule is accepted, I do not know how else we can effectively implement it, except by saying that if you have consumed enough alcohol to give a .05 per centage of alcoholic content in your blood, you should not drive.  That gives rise to inconvenience and so forth but it is for the public good.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister would go wrong if he proceeded on those lines.  I fully appreciate his difficulty. There is no use in enacting law if you cannot get substantial public support for it.  I believe you will get public support for it.  It has the quality of certainty; it meets what everybody is prepared to admit is an urgent problem; and it overcomes the most awkward problem in personal relations that can possibly arise, that is, the problem of a man who has taken a drop too much and will not be dissuaded from driving his car.</P>
    <P>Given this rule, you are then in a position to say to him when he protests his sobriety: &ldquo;I agree emphatically. I never saw you so sober.  You are the one man I always said could carry your drink, but, unfortunately, Blaney has passed a most unreasonable law which says that if you have consumed more than three halves of whiskey, you may not drive a car.&rdquo;  That settles it.  I urge Deputies to accept that.  In my opinion, if we in this legislation accept that basis, 50 per cent. of the driving accidents at present taking place will cease.  I know that shocks some of my colleagues but I believe that 50 per cent. of the driving accidents taking place on the roads of Ireland at present arise from persons who are not drunk but whose judgment is vitiated by an excessive consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>There is the real problem.  I suggest to the Minister that what I have outlined is the only effective way of controlling <Col N="715" /> it.  I am virtually certain that, though there will be grousing about it, undoubtedly the general consensus of opinion of reasonable men and women in this country will support such a policy, and the more it operates, the more people will come to realise that it is the sovereign remedy for a most intractable and difficult evil at the present time.</P>

      <P>I rise on a point of explanation.  When I spoke earlier to-day, I may have given the House the impression that doctors in their professional capacity did not act in accordance with the ethics of their profession in the matter of the drunken driver.  I was interrupted&mdash;I suppose, rightly so&mdash;by four legal Deputies, two on either side of the House, as it happened.  I did not seek to give the impression that a doctor would perjure himself in a court of law and swear that a man was not drunk when, in fact, he believed that he was. Neither did I want to give the impression&mdash;I may have done so unwittingly &mdash;that a doctor would give a wrong diagnosis.  All I wished to demonstrate was that in drunken driving prosecutions there invariably seems to be a conflict between the professional men on either side.  That seems peculiar to the public generally.</P>
      <P>I also wanted to convey to the House that in a case in which a man is accused of drunken driving, he might be deemed capable of driving by his own doctor who examines him two, three, or four hours after his apprehension by the Garda.  I want to correct any wrong impression I may have given about the medical profession.  I may have given the impression that they would deliberately make a wrong diagnosis or give false evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because we have been over the ground already.  As I indicated earlier, I agree completely with the principle <Col N="716" /> that, in the interests of public safety, a level should be struck more or less arbitrarily so that one could say: &ldquo;If you have taken so much alcohol, you are out; if you have not, you are all right.&rdquo;  I think that is the only approach and I agree with Deputy Dillon to that extent.  The problem is that one cannot enforce that principle, unless there is a test.  Deputy Dr. Browne proved conclusively there is only one kind of test, that is, the bio-chemical test.  Thus far, I am in complete sympathy with the views expressed by both Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>There are two questions I want answered for my own satisfaction. First, there will inevitably be a time-lag in having the test carried out because of our social and population pattern.  Alcohol is burned up in the blood and the critical matter is the time the test is carried out.  If the alleged offender is tested immediately after the accident, or immediately after his apprehension, it would be a fairly conclusive case.  If anything like half an hour, or more, elapses before the test is carried out, the results may not be relevant to either the time of the accident or the time of his apprehension.</P>
      <P>That presents a very serious problem because the question of equipment arises and the question of the proper carrying out of the test.  Tests will be no good, unless properly and reliably carried out.  That presupposes specialist medical supervision.  I cannot accept as a serious suggestion that any and every Garda should carry out a blood test.  The rights of the individual enter very fundamentally into this.  It is a matter for a medical man and would practically require hospital and laboratory facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to take the blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To take a breath test, one needs an elaborate and costly apparatus involving trained technicians. The question of location arises.  Would it be feasible to have such an apparatus with a qualified specialist available over the 24 hours in every Garda station?  People are usually brought <Col N="717" /> to the nearest Garda station after apprehension.  There are practical problems.  Apart from the time factor, there is the question of sparsely populated areas in which a Garda station and medical facilities might not be easily available.  It is not a question as to whether the man is actually capable or incapable.  It is a question of public safety and the level of alcohol. The problem is serious enough to put a certain responsibility on the individual; if he is going to drive, he may not drink a certain quantity of alcohol. We are agreed on that.  I agree most emphatically that the only rational expert evidence is the type proposed by Deputy Dr. Browne.  While agreeing, I pose the two practical difficulties relevant to the time factor and the administration and technical organisation of such a service.  If satisfactory answers are produced to these problems, I go so far as to say that I would unhesitatingly throw in my lot with the other Deputies who have supported this suggestion.  As legislators, however, we must be realists.  In legislation, we have to strike a mean. The questions I pose require answering.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that we are all anxious to wipe out the drunken driver.  Nevertheless, we must not be unreasonable in restricting the liberties of citizens.  I do not know if Deputy Dillon was adumbrating some kind of Fine Gael election manifesto when he made the unqualified statement that, in his opinion, any person driving a mechanically propelled vehicle and who has had two half glasses of whiskey or two pints, irrespective of any question of personal capacity, should be brought before the courts and&mdash;I do not think I exaggerate what the Deputy said&mdash;suffer the full penalty laid down in another section, namely, six months' imprisonment for drunken driving, even though he was perfectly sober.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will Deputy Dillon in the forthcoming election campaign go to any town in County Monaghan or to any other town and stand up publicly and <Col N="718" /> say that any people driving vehicles who consume two half glasses of whiskey should, in his opinion, be prosecuted, brought before the local justice and get whatever sentence is finally laid down in this Bill?  I think it is nonsensical for a man who has ambitions to become Leader of this country in the future to make such a suggestion.  That completely restricts the liberty of particular individuals. Deputy Dillon may not like drink; I may not like drink and some other people may not like drink; but, at the same time, there are people who believe that a few drinks on a fair morning travelling along the road are a great asset and help to them.</P>

      <P>There are a large number of other people concerned. Were Deputy Dillon to travel along with someone in his car, that person could not possibly have a drink because, whatever drinks he would have, two would be over the quantity mentioned in the amendment by Deputy Dr. Browne.

      <P>It is embodied in this section that, irrespective of what your condition is and even though you may be perfectly sober <Col N="719" /> after having consumed two half ones and your blood test is more than .05, according to Deputy Dr. Browne, with the unqualified support of Deputy Dillon, you are to be brought to court and possibly sent to prison for six months.  That is restricting the liberty of citizens and I, as an individual Deputy, could not support that view. Do Deputy Dillon and Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;they are two strange bedfellows at the present time&mdash;seek to set themselves up as Herbert Hoovers? We know that President of the United States felt that no one in that country should get a drink, good, bad or indifferent. We also know what happened.</P>
      <P>Let us be reasonable in our approach to the various sections and amendments. Take the case of any person who has two half ones.  If a member of the Garda felt in any way unfavourably disposed to such a man and took him to the Garda station, would he not be convicted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking about drivers.  I believe that is not the way to get round this question. I am perturbed, indeed, that Deputy Dillon has such little confidence in the Irish people.  The position is that the number of people who drive cars under the influence of drink is negligible.  I think it should be wiped out altogether. We all agree on that.  It is very low as it is.  At the same time, we have to be fair and realistic in our approach to this question.  Some people may think it is fairly good propaganda, in view of the general public feeling against drunken driving, that such astonishing statements should be made in support of this amendment by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us devise some reasonable and fair system.  Let us not put into the Bill such sections as that proposed by Deputy Dr. Browne.  There are other penalties in this measure.  The penalty of disqualification, the fear of a jail sentence and the difficulties of securing insurance cover after a drunk conviction are, to my mind, sufficient <Col N="720" /> deterrents against people driving cars visiting public houses and taking a drink.  For Deputy Dillon's information, I mentioned earlier that I find no West Cork&mdash;and West Cork is no different from the rest of Ireland&mdash;that any driver of a vehicle who enters a public house and is inclined to take drink in excess of what he is capable of taking is refused service by all publicans.  That is the position in West Cork and I am sure it is the position throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I again want to express my objection to this amendment.  It would be a very difficult one to implement. Finding a reasonable basis on which to determine whether a person driving a car is drunk or not is very difficult. Some can consume a reasonable quantity of drink without any harm, while others can consume only a very small quantity.  As members of a Parliament, we must be realistic in our approach to the matter.  It is very unrealistic to require that a person driving should confine himself to three-quarters of a glass of whiskey or one and a half pints of stout.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this discussion.  I think Deputy Murphy is possibly confusing the issue inadvertently.  The choice which was presented in the remarks Deputy Dillon made was not a choice between drinking and not drinking.  I think Deputy Dillon went to some pains to point out that in putting forward the particular remedy he advocated, there was no question of saying to a person: &ldquo;You cannot drink.&rdquo;  The choice presented was not one between drinking and not drinking, but between drinking and not driving, on the one hand, or driving and not drinking, on the other.  It is absolutely essential, if we are ever to overcome the problem of road accidents occasioned by persons under the influence of drink or drugs, to get acceptance, no matter how we succeed in doing it, of the principle enunciated by Deputy Dillon in relation to this amendment that a person who drinks should not drive and a person who drives should not drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion to the <Col N="721" /> Minister which would be more appropriate on Section 49.  However, I missed the opportunity of doing it there.  It is really in connection with the question of penalties.  The Minister in some of his remarks referred to the case of the alcoholic or the compulsive drinker.  I want to suggest to him, even though I may be slightly out of order, Sir, that, when he is having another look at Section 49, he might consider it worth while to include a section to enable the district justice, instead of imposing imprisonment or a fine in dealing with the case of an alcoholic or a compulsive drinker who comes before him, to order him to undergo a certain minimum period of treatment. Probably all of us will have come across these tragic cases which cannot be dealt with in any other way except by treatment.  Some of those cases have reached a stage where, in the ordinary sense of the criminal law or the quasicriminal law, there is not a degree of culpability.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a person, not an alcoholic, who wantonly, on particular occasions, takes too much to drink and takes a risk.  In the case of alcoholics, I think it would be worth while for the Minister to try to write into Section 49, a discretion to the court to order a period of treatment. That would do a lot of good.  I realise I am really out of order in making this suggestion at this stage, but I should like the Minister to consider it between now and Report Stage, when he is having a general look at Section 49 again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say briefly that I support this amendment.  We in this House, and the country in general, believe that the basic purpose of a Road Traffic Bill is to protect the citizens.  In many sections of this Bill, and in other Acts, we have introduced restrictions on the rights of individuals. When we want a stop sign on a minor road approaching a major road, we put up that stop sign with the deliberate intention of restricting the right of the individual driver to drive on to the main road without stopping.  Practically every section in the Bill is based on the belief that unless road traffic is regulated in a better way and unless <Col N="722" /> there is better control, the slaughter on the roads will not only continue, but increase.  Because of the increasing number of cars on the roads, that danger to the ordinary citizens is growing greater all the time.</P>
      <P>The problem of a person being drunk in charge of a car might not have reached the proportion it has reached, if it had been found reasonable or possible, under previous legislation, to get convictions.  There were many cases of accidents involving drivers of cars who had too much to drink, in which it was not found possible to prove beyond year or nay that they were completely incapable of driving, and they got the benefit of the doubt.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the man who takes a few drinks.  If it were a question of a citizen taking too much drink, going out, getting his car and ramming it against his own wall, wrecking his own car and himself and leaving it at that, that might be one thing.  It would involve injury or death to himself, and suffering to his family and friends, but the person involved in an accident as a result of someone taking too much to drink&mdash;and too much to drink for this purpose is any amount of drink that affects his judgment&mdash;is the man or woman, the boy or girl walking along a country road, or crossing a city thoroughfare who is struck and knocked down, in nine out of 10 cases or in 99 out of 100, or the passengers or friends of the driver in the car.  We know that a car accident nearly always involves the passengers, and particularly the passenger in the front seat or people travelling in the car with him or travelling in another car, much more frequently than the driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question now appears to me to be: will this amendment, if passed by the House, assist materially in the protection of the lives of the general public?  Will it assist in protecting the lives of those travelling in cars or other vehicles, or walking on the roads, or crossing the streets of the cities? There would be difficulties, of course, in putting the machinery into operation, but surely we should not hesitate in this House to ask the Minister to spend such money, to take such time and make such arrangements as are <Col N="723" /> necessary to put the machinery into operation, if it will save the lives of our fellow citizens or save them suffering.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the present proposal which covers only the question of those capable of driving, as against the proposal in the amendment, leaves a lot to be desired.  It has been said that people like to take a drink, but the slogan in most European countries now is quite a clear one: If you drink, don't drive; if you drive, don't drink.  There is nothing in this amendment which suggests that a person should not go and wallow in drink to his heart's desire, or that someone should not drink himself blind and stupid if he wants to do so.  That will cause discomfort to himself only and possibly ruin his health.  All the amendment suggests is that there should be protection for the citizen against people who cannot use their own judgment.</P>
    <P>We know that drink is almost sacred in this country, but what is more sacred to this House than the lives of the people, or suffering being caused to people, because someone wants to take two or three drinks, and then thinks he is a racing driver or something like that?  There were discussions on what happens in the case of <i>bona fide</i> drinking when the Intoxicating Liquor Act was under discussion. There are many roads leading to the city which are avoided on a Sunday evening by people who have any common sense, because they are used to a great extent by people who come out of public houses and then decide they can get home at quite a good rate of speed, without having regard to the convenience or safety of anyone else.  People who drink in public houses have the right to drink there.  Do we think they should be accorded the right to put the lives of their companions and the general public in jeopardy?</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone in this House can say what is a safe or reasonable amount of drink which can be taken by a person who will afterwards drive a car.  The amount of liquor that can <Col N="724" /> be taken without affecting the judgment of an individual is very small indeed.  It is the amount referred to by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dillon, somewhat less than a glass of whiskey.  If a person takes more than that amount of whiskey, whether he is a seasoned drinker or a casual drinker, his judgment is impaired and his rate of reaction is slowed down, and even his eyesight is slightly affected.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we must try to protect that individual and other people from the consequences of such impairment. If people were not being killed or injured in increasing numbers on the roads of Ireland today directly as a result of people taking too much drink, the position would not be as serious as it is.  Why is the Minister imposing a speed limit of 30 miles an hour in certain areas?  It is not because the Minister wants everybody to drive at 30 miles an hour but because he would consider that in certain areas 30.1 miles per hour is too dangerous a speed at which to drive a car.</P>

      <P>I shall not press the point further.  From experience in other countries one can gather that this type <Col N="725" /> of test has been accepted as reasonable and beneficial.  This amendment will have the effect of bringing home to those who drive cars the fact that they have a responsibility that any time they want to take the wheel of a car they must not have more than a certain quantity of drink taken.  Is it not better for a person to do as many people do at present without any law? Many responsible people, if they do go out for an evening with friends, will not drive if they have taken any drink. They will always make sure that one member of the party is somebody who does not drink, so that they will have a safe chauffeur to take them home. The driver concerned can enjoy himself in his own way but the rest of the party are happy to know they are not going out on the public road in a condition which is dangerous to everybody else.</P>
      <P>I agree with one remark made by Deputy Dillon.  We have all had experience of meeting friends or acquaintances, having a conversation and finding they had a little too much drink taken.  If you were even to suggest that they were not stone cold sober, the immediate reaction would be to challenge you and to become most abusive at the idea that they could have too much drink taken.  The same thing happens to strangers.  Statements have been made here that publicans will refuse to serve people who have too much drink taken.  I read in the papers every now and again of ugly rows in public houses.  I presume they are not engaged in by people who are stone cold sober.  Most of them are engaged in by people who are subsequently described in the courts as being under the influence of drink. In some cases they hardly know what their names are.  In many other cases you read, in extenuation of what happened, that they did not know anything about it because they had too much drink taken.  Somebody must have been serving the drink.  In any event I regard the amendment as a very useful one which should get the support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point of the amendment is based on the fact that the existing clinical tests are relatively <Col N="726" /> useless and the second point is that we are not really concerned so much to find the hopeless drunk as the person who is incapable of driving a car.  Finding the former does not need either a clinical or a scientific test.  We are concerned with the person who has taken alcohol in moderation, if you like, but to the extent that his judgment is impaired.  As a number of Deputies have pointed out, that is the really dangerous driver, the person who walks out of the public house apparently stone cold sober to whom the publican, with the best will in the world, is not in a position to say: &ldquo;That man is a danger to the public.&rdquo; He cannot do it; neither can the Garda or the doctor.  I do not completely agree with Deputy Declan Costello's suggestion that a Garda should not be allowed to give his opinion on the question of drunkenness, because I think the Garda's opinion is as good as that of anybody else in that it is just as fallible and just as useless.  I am including the doctor in that, not being critical but believing that these tests are relatively useless.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer if the question of the present blood tests had been put forward in the White Paper.  I would much sooner have the benefit of public opinion as the Minister has suggested, but that is not our fault.  We must do the best we can with the information at our disposal.  I do not consider I am in any way out of the ordinary in relation to public opinion.  My attitude would be the attitude of very many ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Larkin has said, none of us wants to stop people enjoying or amusing themselves.  None of us wants to stop people drinking if they want to drink, if they must drink, or drink to excess.  The only time we feel we should step in is when that person becomes a danger to the public.  The fact that he is being unfair to himself or to his family, and so on, is none of our business.  Where that person becomes a danger to the public, that is our business.  I hold that with the existing clinical tests, you simply cannot tell with any degree of reliability whether that person is a danger to the public&mdash;the person short of being an <Col N="727" /> incapably drunk person.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister for the many innovations and valuable proposals in the Bill, but it would be completely wrong if it went through the House and we neglected to include this most valuable instrument for the use of the police and the judiciary.</P>
    <P>As to the feasibility of a test of this kind, I proposed that test specifically because it appears to be a very simple examination to carry out.  A blood test is a very simple procedure.  It is one which every doctor can do readily. Subject to the couple of errors to which I referred earlier and which are remedial, it is as near as can be to a reliable test of the assessment of the amount of alcohol in the blood.  In passing, I want to say I may have confused Deputy Booth in his question about the use of alcohol before taking the blood and the fact that that might alter the content of alcohol in the blood.  The simple remedy is to use a different cleansing agent.  It is an error which is remediable.</P>
    <P>It would be quite easy for a standard taking set for blood to be made available to medical practitioners.  That means you would have the standard taking set for blood to be taken in a particular way in conformity with the procedure laid down.  The test will be sent in to the Public Analyst.  A specimen would be kept by the person himself, if he so wished, by the Public Analyst and the Garda.  Before the Garda can make any charge under this section, presumably they will have to call a doctor to justify it.  Therefore, there is no alteration in the present procedure.  The only thing is that instead of being asked to carry out a number of relatively asinine procedures &mdash;picking up matches from the floor, walking along a chalk line, trying to put your finger on your nose&mdash;the person would be asked to carry out a highly scientific test in order to ascertain the amount of alcohol in the blood.</P>
    <P>That is all we are doing.  We are not trying to find out whether the person is drunk or not.  We are trying to find out if that person's judgment is <Col N="728" /> impaired by the amount of alcohol in his blood.  If his judgment is impaired, he is then a danger to the public, if he drives a car.  Consequently, he must be penalised by any sanctions laid down by the House.  That is the simple issue. We have accepted the principle in the previous section of the penalisation of somebody who is a danger to the public as a result of some defect of which he is aware.  I do not see why we cannot accept the same attitude of mind towards the person who goes out and drinks and in that way makes himself liable to become a danger to the public.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some confusion about the quantities.  I am sorry if I have contributed to that confusion in any way.  If one drinks a pint of beer&mdash; I do not know what relationship that bears to a pint of stout&mdash;according to the tests in Britain, it creates the position in which the alcohol content is under 50 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millimetres of blood.  If one drinks a second pint of beer, then the level goes from 50 milligrammes to 150 milligrammes.  If one drinks more than that, it goes above 150 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millimetres of blood.  From 0 to 50 milligrammes, a person can drive quite safely.  From 50 to 150 milligrammes, a person is a danger to the public in driving.  From 150 milligrammes up, a person should not be driving a car because he is incapable of driving&mdash;virtually unable to drive.  Those are the three positions. The comparison with the pint of beer is two small whiskeys; over that, a large whiskey; then two double whiskeys, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is possible for us to tell the public: &ldquo;This is the situation.  If you go into a public house and drink this amount, you will come into a certain position in relation to the blood test. If you drink more than a pint, you are in danger of being subjected to certain sanctions, if you are involved in an accident, if you hit another car or kill someone.&rdquo;  It is possible to tell them that, so that if they drink more than that minimal amount, they know they are doing it with their eyes open.  In my view, therefore, they are creating the position for themselves <Col N="729" /> in which they are, to their own knowledge, a danger to the public.  That is the phrase used in Section 48 which we decided was sufficient to subject people to sanctions and send them to prison.  I do not see why we should not accept it in relation to this question also.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera asked about the question of the delay in taking the blood test.  I do not think there is any difficulty about the time between the sending of the blood by the Garda and its receipt by the analyst, because the alcohol content is constant.  But the question of the delay between the taking of the blood and the accident is inevitable, because one must call in a doctor and one is dependent on the speed with which he turns up.  But that is not any different from the present situation.  There is a loss of alcohol during that time, because alcohol is lost in the breath and is excreted in other ways.  Consequently, there could be less alcohol in the blood at the time of the taking of the test than there was at the time of the accident. That militates in favour of the defendant and I suppose none of us would begrudge him that slight advantage.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's main case about the reliability of the test, I must say I was lost in admiration for the remarkable plausibility with which he defended what I believe to be a very weak position.  I cannot understand how he is able to swallow the absurd and grossly inaccurate tests like walking a line and saying: &ldquo;The Leith police dismisseth us&rdquo; or whatever these tests may be, and yet he is unable to accept the scientific test which has been so widely accepted.  We are not pioneers in this; we are not breaking any new ground.  We are, as, regrettably, in so many aspects of our legislation, following a well-beaten path.  Many other countries have tried it.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to give the impression he is not anxious to act too hastily.  He would like to give these other countries more time and see how far they get before we come to a decision.  As I said, Norway has had this since 1926.  That is a very long <Col N="730" /> time.  How long more must we wait? He also suggested, with Deputy Russell, that there might be a better test round the corner.  There may be a better test round the corner.  There may be a more reliable test round the corner.  I hope there is.  Surely that is not a good enough reason for deferring the use of a test which has found favour in different countries varying very widely in outlook from the socialism of Sweden to the Americas, Canada, Denmark, Holland&mdash;all sorts of societies&mdash;and Great Britain with an ultra Tory Conservative Government who are not likely to do anything in a hurry?  They all accept this test.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a great case on that score for not accepting the test at this stage.  If a man is faced with, say, cancer, and has nothing but radium and the present treatments, it would be absurd to say to the patient: &ldquo;We think something good will turn up in a couple of months' time or a couple of years' time.  Would you mind waiting around until we get it?&rdquo;  We are concerned with drinking and driving and with the consequences.  We are concerned that people can be hurt, maimed, disabled for life, that unfortunate children are killed.  Not alone is there the incapable drunken driver but there is this new entity which the clinical test cannot begin to reach, the person who, because of the amount of drink he has taken, has his judgment impaired.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke about public opinion.  I do not know what public opinion is on this but I am not unusual in my views on it.  If the Minister is taking the severely practical, political point of view&mdash;and, in his responsible position, he must do that&mdash;he might bear in mind that only a minority drive cars.  Most of the people of the country do not have cars.  Most of his electorate are people who are the victims of the car drivers and who are the victims of the people who drive after having taken drink.  Most of these people are mothers who are very frightened that their children go to school along busy roads.</P>
    <P>I suspect there is a majority in the country&mdash;nobody can know&mdash;who would welcome the determination of the Minister, demonstrated by this hard <Col N="731" /> and fast test, this rule of thumb, this line over which they may not move. They would be glad if the Minister would show his belief in their good sense to realise they are no different from the Canadians, Americans, Swedes, Danes and British who have imposed this sort of self-discipline on themselves in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>I do not think our people are any less concerned about this question.  If they are asked to make this relatively tiny sacrifice&mdash;if you drink do not drive, if you drive do not drink or, if you drink do so in complete moderation&mdash;they will appreciate its value.  If a pint of stout is too little for them, that is a pity but they can drink as many pints as they like and not drive.  It is a small sacrifice to attain the great advantage attained in many countries, particularly Sweden, where they have had a spectacular reduction in the number of accidents, particularly where alcohol is involved.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter on which I, or I am sure the mover of the amendment, would wish to have a defined division of opinion in the records of this House.  I think it does not help towards getting an acceptance of the general measure as a whole.  For that reason, I had been hoping that what I said on this matter might be pursued to some further degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would put it to Deputy Dr. Browne that while he seems to be convinced that the tests he has in mind are conclusive&mdash;I am not medically qualified, as he is, and most members of this House are not medically qualified &mdash;my information obtained from here, there and elsewhere is that they are not conclusive.  Furthermore, while the suggested limit is one which he, in his medical knowledge and capacity, may well agree is reasonable and proper, nevertheless I am not satisfied it is the right limit.  Unfortunately, I do not <Col N="732" /> feel myself in the position of being able to say what I think is the right limit.</P>
    <P>A lack of determination and a lack of a general mind on what the limit should be is one of the big problems about applying a test, even if the form of test were acceptable and conclusive. The oft-repeated phrase &ldquo;If you drink do not drive and if you drive do not drink&rdquo;, is the ideal.  Surely, however, we would be living in the clouds if we thought that ideal were attainable. We would be super-optimistic to think so.</P>
    <P>Those of the public to-day who would clap on the back the members of this House and support that ideal and speak in its favour would very likely be the first to use their shoe on the other end of such persons if some member of their family, as a result of the ideal that any drink is not allowed to a person while driving, finished up for six months in the local jail.  It is all very well to talk about this matter. One can be carried away by an ideal and by the good one considers it would do.</P>
    <P>We have to be somewhat practical in this House and realise that the public who would carry this thing on their backs at the moment would reject it as soon as its full implications were brought home to them personally through a near friend, relative or member of the family who had been found with just that little bit more than the pint of porter that is suggested.  They would very soon lose their enthuasism for this limit which would seem so laudable to them to-day.  They would lose that enthuasism to-morrow if a father, brother or friend, having drunk 1½ pints of porter, had to spend six months in jail.</P>
