      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any steps have been taken or considered which would tend to increase the volume of trade passing between this country and countries behind the Iron Curtain; and, if so, if he considers this trade to be in the interests of the country generally, and in what respects.</P>

    <P>I would point out that the principal purpose of the recent visit to this country of the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&mdash;which was arranged about six months ago&mdash; was not for official talks but so that he and Mrs. Soames could visit the <Col N="296" /> Spring Show, the National Stud and some Irish farms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions over the past two years, I have spoken in the Dáil of the difficulties confronting us as a result of the failure of the negotiations in 1957 and 1958 for a European free trade area and the creation of two trade groupings, to neither of which we belong.  It has been our hope that <Col N="297" /> these difficulties might be solved in such a manner as would permit countries like ourselves, which could not readily accept the full obligations of either the Rome Treaty or the Stockholm Convention, to share in the benefits of freer trade in Europe.</P>
    <P>For this reason, as Deputies are aware, we took an active part in the negotiations for the reorganisation of the OEEC and in the Committee on Trade Problems.  This Committee has been unable to make significant progress. The negotiations for the reorganisation of the OEEC, however, concluded last December with the signature of a Convention establishing the OECD.  This instrument was signed by all twenty countries concerned, including Ireland, and will shortly come before the Dáil for approval.  It is intended that the OECD, when it comes into being, should be concerned with any outstanding problems to which the existence of the EEC and the EFTA gives rise for the members of the Organisation.  It seems improbable, however, that a satisfactory solution for those problems will be found within the framework of the OECD in the near future.  It is therefore realistic to assume that, if those countries which belong to neither the EEC nor the EFTA are to share in the benefits which these groupings may confer on their members, the approach must be by way of an arrangement with one or other grouping.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, having regard to the pattern of our export trade, participation in the EFTA cannot be expected to offer substantial advantages to us.  The EFTA countries comprise a total population of approximately ninety million, but Britain accounts for over half the total.  The Stockholm Convention would not confer on us any additional rights in the British market.  The other six members of the EFTA have not been important markets for us in the past and, while we must not of course neglect any market, it is doubtful whether the advantages we could hope to reap in those countries would justify acceptance of the obligations of the Stockholm Convention, particularly as <Col N="298" /> agriculture is expressly excluded from its provisions.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, our best markets on the Continent have been in the Six and it is in those continental countries that we could expect to continue to make progress if we enjoyed reasonably favourable conditions of access.  It is important to bear in mind in this connection that the Rome Treaty applies to the whole field of the economies of the member countries, including agriculture.  At the same time the vital importance for our export trade of the British market makes it necessary that we avoid any action which might adversely affect our special trading relations with that country. If we were to join the Common Market while Britain remained outside we would be obliged, under the provisions of the Rome Treaty, to apply to British exports to this country the common external tariff of the Community. It is by reason of such considerations that I stated in the Dáil on 26th April, 1960, that &ldquo;the best situation possibly for us would be association with the Common Market, if Britain were also a member of it, on a basis which satisfactorily took account of our economic circumstances.&rdquo;  This is still the Government's appreciation of the position.</P>
    <P>Until recently, the prospects of a link between Britain and the Common Market seemed slight.  There have, however, been indications during the past few months that the British Government may be contemplating the possibility of entering the Common Market on certain conditions.  It is the Government's view that, if Britain should take this step, we should consider establishing a link with the Common Market and endeavour to secure terms of membership or association which would satisfactorily take account of our economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that the economic and social consequences of whatever course may be adopted will be assessed as closely as possible in the light of the conditions likely to apply. To make a detailed assessment on the basis of acceptance of the terms of the Rome Treaty without amendment or mitigation would, however, seem unrealistic <Col N="299" /> and could be confusing. Deputies may be assured that an explanatory White Paper will be published as soon as the situation can be reasonably assessed and that the Government will afford the Dáil a full opportunity of discussing whatever decision may be proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the very lengthy nature of his own reply to these questions indicates the necessity for some fuller information for Deputies so that they may, on their own behalf, assess the situation which confronts us and whether there is any prospect of Ireland adhering to the Rome Treaty without amendment?  Would it not assist Deputies to consider any amended arrangement if they had before them the picture of what association with the terms of the Rome Treaty, as at present stated, would mean?  Secondly, could the Taoiseach tell us in regard to his reference to some form of association with the E.E.C. whether he has any information as to the fate of the proposed Greek association with the E.E.C. and especially whether it is true that a draft agreement of such an association has recently been abandoned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach's reply, stripped of the padding, not mean that this country or the Government can move neither hand nor foot in connection with entry to the Common Market until the British Government makes its own final decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government will certainly not ignore the facts of our situation.  Regarding the question asked by Deputy Dillon, while I understand the Deputy's desire to get all the information possible on this subject, he will appreciate my difficulty when he asks me to make guesses as to what is going to happen or to attempt an assessment of the consequences on various hypotheses.  If the Deputy wishes to pursue his Supplementary Question regarding the terms of the Greek association with the community perhaps he might give me notice of a question on that subject. My understanding is that an agreement has been reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that I have specifically refrained from asking him to speculate and have asked him, in such White Paper as I have suggested, what would ensue on Ireland adhering to the Rome Treaty contemporaneously with Great Britain if the terms of the Rome Treaty had been accepted without amendment without in any way indicating this Government's intention in that regard?  I suggest it would be of assistance to Deputies to get a concrete picture, at least, of what adherence to the Rome Treaty, without special conditions to suit our special circumstances, would involve.  It would at least help us to assess what special conditions might be essential for an acceptable form of association with the Rome Treaty powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has a copy of the Rome Treaty; if not, I shall arrange for him to be supplied with it.  He will appreciate that if matters develop as he appears to assume, the Government will be engaged in important negotiations and it would not be reasonable to expect us to disclose in advance all the considerations which we would have to keep in mind in the course of these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach whether, in view of the statements which have been attributed to British Ministers in the Press, he has had any unofficial indications from the British Government that Britain is likely at an early date to find some form of membership or associate-ship with the Common Market?  Secondly, will the Taoiseach say whether it is to be understood from the terms of his reply today that the Government here contemplate that it may be possible to establish an associate-ship with the Common Market as distinct from formal and full membership of that body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as statements by British Ministers are concerned, they have been very definitely to the effect that no decision has been made and, indeed, last week in the House of Commons, the British Prime Minister stated that satisfactory arrangements in respect of the interests of <Col N="301" /> British agriculture and of fellow members of the British Commonwealth and of their partners in the European Free Trade Association are a pre-condition of any close association with the E.E.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach mind answering the second portion of the question?  Does the Taoiseach contemplate that it may be possible to establish an associate-ship with the Common Market as distinct from full membership with full obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Rome Treaty provides for the possibility of membership or association.  Clearly, no decision as to which course would be best in our interest should be taken until all the facts are known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated on numerous occasions that we cannot take any step independent of the British decision.  I wonder if he has made it clear to the British Government that in fairness to our people and the considerations involved in regard to employment, we should be kept in touch with the rapidly changing developments in regard to the British decision to enter the Common Market and, if he is in constant touch with these changing developments, could the Taoiseach give us any indication, in weeks or months, as to when we are likely to get this White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not.  Naturally, we are in touch with all the Governments concerned with this matter and have been, up to the present at any rate, receiving the information we sought to enable us to understand what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider the desirability of providing here, as a White Paper or in some other form, an appraisement of the consequences in respect of industry and agricultural production if we did adhere to the Rome Treaty without amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think it would be most unwise to attempt such <Col N="302" /> an assessment on a purely hypothetical basis.  It would be confusing to our own people and detrimental to the success of any negotiations which might be initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance consider it expedient to address speeches to the public at large dealing with the contingency, members of the House are entitled to ask the Government what the contingency is?  Surely if they do not know the answer we are entitled to ask to be informed what the Rome Treaty would involve for us, without involving the Government in any way in regard to whatever policy it might adopt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may think that is so but it is not so; otherwise, I would not ask for an appraisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that if we are to find out when we are going to join the Common Market, we should keep our eyes on the British morning papers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House are well aware that 75 per cent. of our exports go to Britain and get into Britain tariff free because of the trade agreements we have with that country.  It would be foolish for us to create a situation which might bring those agreements to an end, and that tariff-free trade to an end, merely on the offchance of something that might happpen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

      <P>The completed Household Schedules are collected by the official enumerators. The duties of enumeration are performed by postmen in the Dublin Metropolitan Garda Area and by Gardaí (assisted by civilian enumerators) in other areas.</P>
      <P>At the time of the collection of the completed Household Schedules for the Census of Population, 1961, it is necessary for the official enumerators to scrutinise the forms for completeness, consistency and accuracy and to ensure that they are as correct as possible. The form for this Census is much more complex than for the last two such inquiries and the task of scrutiny by the enumerator is therefore more time-consuming.  A large number of the forms have actually to be filled in entirely by the enumerators or to be amended or completed on the spot. This causes considerable delay in the actual work of collection but it is not considered desirable to jeopardise the accuracy of the statistics by the acceptance of incomplete or incorrectly filled forms.</P>
      <P>It may be stated that by the 12th May, 1961, about 82 per cent. of the forms had been collected in the Dublin Area and up to the 6th May, 1961, over 92 per cent. had been collected in the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>The income limit for the purpose mentioned in the question was, under the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 1958, increased from £600 to £800 as recently as December, 1958, co-incident with a corresponding increase in the income limit for insurability of non-manual workers under the Social Welfare code. There has not, since that date, been a change in any of the relevant factors which would, in my view, justify a further increase at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any person insured under the Social Welfare code is entitled, <i>per se,</i> with his dependants, to the services mentioned. All manual workers employed under a contract of service are insurable under that code irrespective of income and so are eligible under the Health Acts. Further, by reason of an amendment in regard to family income made in the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 1958, employed persons with family incomes up to £1,100 a year are eligible for the service in certain circumstances, even where they are not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The position of employed workers under the Health Acts compares favourably with that of other sections of the community and if there were a case for a further revision in favour of such workers, it would not be equitable to give effect to such revision without making a corresponding revision in favour of the remaining classes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has seen the report contained in a Dublin evening paper to the effect that while the number of new cases of tuberculosis had been reducing each year up to 1958, the trend was now reversed and the incidence of the disease was on the increase; if so, whether this report is accurate; and what steps he proposes to take in order to bring the gravity of <Col N="307" /> the problem home to health authorities and the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The number of new cases of tuberculosis, respiratory and non-respiratory, dropped steadily year by year from 1952 until 1959 when the number increased by 106 from 3,899 in the previous year to 4,005.  The number in 1959, however, was still below the figure for 1957 and, of course, for the preceding years mentioned.  The fact that there was an increase had already been widely publicised.  For instance, in my address to the Annual Meeting of the National Mass-Radiography Association in February last, I cited the check to the downward trend as a warning that fuller use must be made of the facilities for preventing and diagnosing the disease which are at the disposal of the community.  This warning got considerable publicity.  More recently, health authorities have been asked to intensify their efforts to persuade the public to make greater use of the Mass Radiography Service and further publicity and propaganda will be employed as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy and the House that, while final figures for 1960 are not available, present indications are that the number of new and re-activated cases for that year is down by about 20% on the 1959 figure.  This reduction, while very welcome, does not, as Deputies will appreciate, invalidate the warning I have mentioned or diminish the need for a substantial effort to reduce still further the incidence of the disease.</P>

The statistics available do not distinguish between doctors in general practice and others.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the Deputy, however, that at the 1951 census, 2,921 persons described themselves as medical practitioners.  This figure would, of course, include, in addition to doctors in general practice, doctors engaged whole-time in the public service, e.g., in the public health service and in hospitals, particularly mental hospitals, as well as doctors in private practice solely as consultants.  It would be pointless at this stage to attempt to ascertain how many doctors were, at the time, engaged whole-time in the public service but that information is being obtained in relation to the date of the recent census and will be available by the time the results of that census are published.</P>

      <P>Representations for improved remuneration and conditions were received in my Department from the Association of Branch Managers on the 29th May, 1959.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of Branch Managers is based on a scheme in operation since the 1st January, 1954, under which each Branch Employment Office is classified in accordance with the volume of work with which it has to deal.  The classification was first reviewed in 1956 and it was arranged that there should be triennial reviews thereafter.  Such a review was in progress at the time that representations were received from the Branch Managers' Association.  In view of this, consideration of the representations was deferred pending completion of the review and the Branch Managers' Association was informed of the position. The review was completed in February, 1960, and as a result thereof a number of offices were re-classified, the great majority of them to their advantage.  I should point out that in the meanwhile the increases in salaries awarded to the Civil Service generally from the 15th December, 1959, were also applied to the remuneration of Branch Managers.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the review of the classification of Branch Employment Offices the matters raised in the representations made by the Branch Managers' Association were examined and on the 9th May, 1960, a deputation from the Association was received by my Parliamentary Secretary.

      <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations disability benefit is not payable to a person for any period for which he <Col N="311" /> receives or is entitled to receive compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts unless the weekly rate of benefit which would otherwise be payable exceeds the weekly rate of compensation, in which circumstances the difference between the two rates is payable as benefit.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the weekly rate of compensation is the maximum rate of £4 10s. 0d. a week, a lump sum payment of £100 under the Workmen's Compensation Acts would cover a period of 22 weeks and 1 day at that rate.  During this period a single person, a married person or a married person with three children could not qualify for any payment of disability benefit while incapable of work due to the accident for which he recovered compensation, because the maximum weekly rates of disability benefit in all three cases would be less than the weekly rate of compensation.</P>
      <P>If damages of £100 were obtained under a Common Law settlement instead of under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, title to disability benefit would not be affected by the award, and payment of benefit would be made at the appropriate rate.

      <P>The transaction referred to in the Question involved the importation of a parcel of thirty travelling clocks which were liable to duty at the rate of 50% <i>ad valorem.</i>  The local <Col N="320" /> Customs staff declined to admit these clocks free of duty as it was not within their discretion to do so.  Clearance of the clocks without payment of duty was approved by the Revenue Commissioners as soon as they had an opportunity of considering the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether it would not be right and proper that some official at the airport should have the necessary discretion to deal with cases such as this? Furthermore, is it not a fact that an unnecessary amount of zeal is being shown at the airport by the Minister's staff there which is causing considerable public resentment?</P>

Such property is disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the State Property Act, 1954 which do not require that public tenders should be invited.  It is, however, the general practice to invite public tenders except where the public interest would be better served by disposal otherwise.</P>

      <P>The latest representations received in the case of Derrynane Pier were in 1956 when following the receipt of a resolution from the Kerry County Council that body was asked by the Department of Agriculture to indicate the precise location of the pier in question on a map and to furnish details of the works they considered necessary.

In this way a road leading towards the strand at Rossbeigh and about a quarter of a mile in length is at present being reconstructed as a Rural Improvements Scheme, at a cost of £368, of which £331, i.e., 90% is being met by way of a grant.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Turf Development Act, 1953 any superannuation scheme for workers employed by Bord na Móna must be approved by me with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  In view of this provision Bord na Móna have <Col N="326" /> consulted my department informally on the broad basis of the superannuation scheme for manual workers before submitting the scheme to the workers. The Deputy will appreciate that this is a desirable course so as to avoid extensive amendments or rejection of the proposed scheme at a later stage.  There has been some unavoidable delay in settling a pension scheme for the manual workers because this is the first such scheme prepared since the introduction of contributory old age pensions.  The Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, under which contributory old age pensions were introduced, contains provisions enabling existing pension schemes to be modified or wound up in consequence of the enactment of the Act.  The general question of the extent to which these provisions should be applied is under consideration at present and it has been considered advisable to await the results before proceeding with the Bord na Móna scheme.  The results of the examination are expected to be available soon.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say when the terms of the Act are likely to be complied with in so far as there is an obligation on the Board to submit the proposals to the workers before submitting them to the Minister?  That procedure is apparently being dispensed with at the moment.  If it is intended to be a short cut and there was agreement, I could understand it.

As soon as that matter has been settled, the final scheme will be sent back to Bord na Móna and will, of course, be submitted to the workers for their observations.  I believe there will be less delay in the long run, if the scheme is presented to my Department and is sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  It could then go before the <Col N="327" /> workers and many of the possible objections can be ironed out.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 46, and 47 together.  The position is that last year the Government decided, as a matter of policy, to discontinue these preparatory colleges as one of the means of recruiting candidates for the national teaching profession.  At the same time it decided, also as a matter of policy, that every endeavour should be made to have secondary A schools conducted in the preparatory college buildings in the future.  These facts were made known to Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>The decisions meant negotiating with the existing conductors of the colleges so as to try to obtain their agreement to run the colleges under the altered arrangements and to settle with them the conditions on which this would be done.  Negotiations accordingly are in the process of being concluded in relation to four of the five colleges.  In the case of the fifth where on examination it was found that due to the existing facilities for post-primary education in the area there would not be scope for a further secondary school it was decided to invite tenders for the college property. This has been done.</P>
      <P>The disposal of all the property will be effected in pursuance of the provisions of the State Property Act, 1954. When the arrangements have been finalised the report provided for in Section 10 (6) of that Act will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid that might be a rash assumption on my part.  These amendments are designed to meet a situation which, as the Minister probably knows, is of quite common occurrence, that is where a person is required to produce his driving licence. My recollection is that the section is so worded that if a request is made to a driver to produce his driving licence, and subsequently he is summoned for failure to produce the driving licence, the Bill is at present so framed as to presume that the defendant in such circumstances is guilty unless he himself can show that he is innocent.  It is one of the sections under this legislation where the onus of proof is entirely on the defendant.</P>
      <P>As I say, I was not here to listen to the Minister's case on the last day on which this was under discussion. I assume the Minister has some reason for asking the Dáil to legislate in that manner, but it is quite contrary to the legislation either in connection with road traffic matters or any other matter. Deputy Ryan's amendments are designed to provide a kind of halfway house for the Minister so that he can achieve what presumably he wants to achieve and that is, less waste of time by Gardaí and others in giving evidence.  At the same time I take it he does not want to cause an injustice to an innocent defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is suggested in these amendments is that if a person produces his driving licence after a request to do so, the Garda officer to whom it is produced, in the particular station at which it is produced, will stamp the fact on the licence that it has been produced, giving the time and the name of the station, and that when that is done, it should be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that production has been made.  In other words, at that stage the onus of proof would shift again from the defendant back to the State, if the State were suggesting that the licence had not in fact been produced. I urge the Minister to consider the spirit of this amendment even if he is not prepared to accept it fully as it is <Col N="345" /> framed at the moment.  In principle, it is right that some procedure should be adopted and that we should not legislate with our eyes open to throw the onus of proof entirely on the defendant, contrary to all precedents in our legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter dealt with in these four amendments, the driving licence and the certificate of insurance, was raised on the Second Stage and at that time I undertook to look into it to ensure that its administration by the Garda authorities would be such that no undue difficulty would be caused to any person asked to present these documents at a later stage if he did not have them on his person at the time.  I have since ascertained that if a driver is stopped by a Garda and asked for his licence or his insurance certificate, neither of which he may have with him at the particular time, he may nominate a convenient Garda station and undertake to produce these documents there within a period of five days.  That is the situation at the moment.  Under the Bill, we propose to extend the period to ten days.</P>
      <P>The Garda who pulls the driver will then fill in the relevant particulars on form C.T. 34 and the completed form will be forwarded to the station named by the driver concerned.  Only when that form is returned can any further action take place.  If it is not returned, no action takes place.  If the form is returned, it will be clearly indicated on the face of it that the documents sought were produced.  If they are defective in some way, that will be stated.  Only then will the Garda who pulled the driver be in a position to take further steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the fears expressed by Deputy Ryan are without foundation.  The system operating at the moment will continue to operate in the future and, from what I have ascertained, there is just no possibility of a member of the public being either inconvenienced or put at a disadvantage. From that point of view, I do not see any need for those amendments. The fears expressed have no foundation.  Experience of the <Col N="346" /> operation of this system in the past is the best guarantee for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that if the present procedure is followed, there is nothing in the fears expressed by either Deputy Ryan or myself.  If, however, there is any breakdown in the procedure, there are real grounds for fear.  I agree that it is only if the licence, or whatever it may be, is not produced that a summons will issue.  A case could arise in which a Garda might be in a hurry or be so exceptionally busy that he might fail to complete the form.  These are the sort of human lapses that can occur and it is in the event of such a lapse that danger might arise.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 40 lays down that if a prosecution is brought for an offence under the section, it will be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that he did not produce his licence.  So far as I know, that provision does not appear in the 1933 Road Traffic Act. Under this provision, it will be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that he did not produce his licence and that he did, in fact, commit an offence.  That is something new and it is in the light of that provision that I think it is necessary to provide safeguards, irrespective of the safeguards the Minister has mentioned if the present procedure continues to operate properly, because if a Garda overlooks filling up form C.T. 34 for some reason or other, a summons will issue against the driver, even though he has in fact already produced his licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill goes through in its present form, a defendant will find himself going into court, with the court presuming that he has committed an offence until he satisfies the court to the contrary.  In order to satisfy the court, he will have to issue a witness summons and get the superintendent in the area concerned to send to court, in answer to that <i>subpoena</i>, the Garda who dealt with the matter in the first instance.  That may involve the defendant in a considerable amount of trouble and a <Col N="347" /> certain amount of expense in circumstances in which it should be sufficient for him to produce his licence showing a receipt or signature testifying to its production, and that should end the matter.</P>

      <P>A lapse to the extent of not filling in the form to which I referred would be in favour of the driver, or defendant, as the case may be.

Unless the form is completed and returned to the originating Garda Station, no action will follow from the original pulling of the driver.</P>

Until that form is filled in and sent back to Donegal, no action is taken in Donegal against the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56a:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), paragraph (a), page 37, to add to the paragraph the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided however that a person who holds or previously held a driving licence (other than a provisional driving licence) under this or any other Act within five years of the coming into operation of this section and who has not been disqualified from holding a driving licence, shall not be required to produce a certificate of competency when applying for a driving licence nor shall such certificate be required in the case of a person holding a driving licence issued in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in the spirit of the Minister's remarks on the Second Reading of the Bill.  This section provides for various regulations which the Minister may make, including regulations governing the class of persons who are required to produce a certificate of competency or fitness when <Col N="349" /> applying for a driving licence.  This has to do with driving tests which the Minister forecast would be provided for in regulations for certain categories of persons.  It was suggested in the Second Reading discussion&mdash;and, as I recollect it, I was one of those who suggested it and I certainly favour the idea&mdash;that all new drivers, people who have not previously held driving licences, should have both a road test and a test of their knowledge of the rules of the road applied to them.  However, quite a lot of unnecessary anxiety has been created in the minds of the public by this idea of a driving test.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment, it will remove a great deal of that anxiety and make the idea of a driving test more easily acceptable to a number of people.  The amendment suggests that a certificate of competency or fitness to drive will not be required: &ldquo;provided however that a person who holds or previously held a driving licence (other than a provisional driving licence) under this or any other Act within five years...&rdquo; Perhaps the wording is a bit loose but it means within five years before the coming into operation of the section. The amendment goes on: &ldquo;...and who has not been disqualified from holding a driving licence, shall not be required to produce a certificate of competency...nor shall such a certificate be required in the case of a person holding a driving licence issued in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is of some importance that the Minister, if he is not accepting this amendment, at least should make it clear that the amendment is in accordance with his views and the regulations he proposes to make.  The amendment would give recognition to the stringency of the British and Northern Ireland regulations in cases where a British or Northern Ireland person desires to take up residence here.  It is well known to the Minister and to the House that quite a stringent driving test is in force already in England and in Northern Ireland.  If a person has passed his driving test there, we should not require him to undergo another driving test here, provided he has been <Col N="350" /> issued with a British or Northern Ireland licence.  It is also of some importance in connection with tourism.  A great number of people bring their cars over here and there should be no danger of a hitch in regard to their driving licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill very good reasons were given why an amendment such as this should not be passed into law.  Those reasons are that by regulation various classes or categories of drivers may from time to time be brought within the test regulations and will be subject to those tests and it is necessary that we do not apply those tests to all and sundry from the outset or from a given date. A very good reason would be that we could not possibly hope to have the organisation trained and available to cope with every driver on the road today if they all had to have a test of competence and fitness.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly testing will be applied by stages, and while I would say to Deputy O'Higgins that though the majority of those who within the last five years have been licence holders or new licence holders, may be well down on the priority list of the groups as they will be brought under these regulations for testing, nevertheless there can be, and undoubtedly are, people within that group who may under special circumstances be brought in under some other head for testing.  Those types would be for instance people who had grown into an older age group and we would say that we would have to test this group in the next year, and add public service vehicle drivers, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition there may be types of offences or offenders whom by regulation the Minister may bring in as a category that the courts will not have dealt with or do not propose to deal with, and he may apply the tests to them so that again, within that group of those holding licences within the past five years, you could also have another number of that type which if amendment 56a were carried would in fact be excluded.  By and large, the overall situation is that people will <Col N="351" /> be brought into the testing and under regulations in relation to testing as and when we find we have the organisation to deal with those numbers.</P>
    <P>We will naturally bring in the categories that are of the greatest public importance, or that we regard in that light, and gradually add to them, so that to exclude specifically under statute any particular group would defeat the general idea in the Bill and certainly in the specific types of cases I have mentioned would preclude certain types from being brought in whom I believe it may be very necessary to bring in, and to bring in early on, in the application of these regulations.</P>
    <P>In so far as the British and Northern Ireland driving licence holders are concerned, there is no doubt whatsoever that at the moment we deal in quite a reasonable manner with those who have come in here as visitors, holiday makers and tourists.  I do not think anybody can say that anything we are doing or have been doing has in any way made difficult the driving of a car by any of our visitors from those areas. But to write into the law that we must give a licence without any reference to tests to any holder of a licence in the Six Counties or Great Britain is something which I do not think we should do.  The reason I say that is that we will be enabled to do this if we so wish, but matters like this have been dealt with in the past not only under traffic laws and regulations but under various other regulations in the country here on the basis of reciprocity.  If and when the time comes that we can get down to this matter we will be enabled to do it, but to write into the law specifically that we must do it is in the circumstances something which I feel the Deputy and the House will not press to have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the Minister has the power which it is suggested he should have in these amendments.  The purpose of the amendments is to enable the Minister when he is considering speed limits to prescribe both maximum and minimum speed limits.  It may be that under the general wording of the section that power is there, but I do not think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That power is not there, and it is not being sought, for <Col N="353" /> the reason that in our conditions here in Ireland the idea of a minimum speed limit is, to say the least of it, at this stage very inappropriate.  If we look at the maximum speed limits which we are taking power to impose, we find that we have a general maximum limit which applies to types of vehicles such as a bus and so on, no matter where it travels.  Then we have built up areas and maximum speed limits.  In the context to apply a minimum speed limit in the same areas would just not be feasible or possible or get us anywhere.  In a built up area where you have a maximum speed limit a minimum speed limit just would not really apply and could not possibly apply.  Neither in the case of a general speed limit applying to particular types of vehicles can I see the application of a minimum speed limit being wise or sensible.</P>
      <P>The idea of a minimum speed limit is one which we naturally considered in our discussions and thoughts about this matter.  Without the type of roadway that we might have seen elsewhere which we do not possess, of the autobahn type, the idea of a minimum speed limit, no matter how acceptable it might appear to be at first, does not really serve any useful purpose in this country.  I do not think we are emerging into an era or that we can foresee a time when this power to fix minimum speed limits would, in fact, he appropriate or possible to apply.  It is particularly inappropriate to our conditions here to take this power or to apply such a power because of our road network, and our general road conditions.  I cannot see road conditions in the foreseeable future in which the power to apply minimum speed limits would be of use.  If the time comes when such power would be of use, we can reconsider the matter.  Probably another measure of this nature will then be due.  In the meantime I do not think there is any point in taking such powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not press the Minister.  It is unusual to have a Minister say: &ldquo;You are offering me too much power and I do not want it.&rdquo;  This is the first occasion <Col N="354" /> I have had that experience. We find the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice taking to the air to have a look at where the hold-up in Dublin traffic is being caused.  It is undoubtedly true that very often slow-moving traffic is a greater traffic hazard than fast-moving traffic.  Very often accidents are caused by people who travel too cautiously or slowly in circumstances where a reasonable speed should be maintained having regard to the conditions, the size of the road and so on.</P>
      <P>It was with that general idea in mind we felt that within the next few years the Minister might find it necessary in relation to some roads or routes, in particular dual-carriageways, to say it is undesirable that traffic should be slowed down on these roads by a person insisting on driving over-cautiously at 10 or 15 m.p.h. and that he might think of putting on a minimum speed limit of 20 or 30 m.p.h.  If the Minister does not want this power at the moment and feels that the occasion for its use is not going to come into existence in the foreseeable future, I shall not press him on it.</P>

      <P>There is one point which I think may be overlooked.  On some of the main roads&mdash;the one that comes most readily to the mind is the road to Belfast&mdash;there are stretches where four lanes are marked.  That means that there is a danger such as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, of people driving too slowly in the lane nearest the centre of the road.  That does provide a very big traffic hazard. I would feel happier if the Minister would at least consider whether he should reserve this right to himself of controlling the minimum speed also, not on the road as a whole but to consider making regulations that where four lanes are marked on a road, traffic using the lane nearest the centre may not do so unless proceeding at 30, 40 or 45 m.p.h.  It would mean the slower traffic would be driven in to the side of the road, which would be very helpful and would reduce the danger of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I should <Col N="355" /> not press the Minister at this stage, but I should like to point out there is, possibly, more of a danger of this situation arising than appears to the Minister at present.  I would hope he would at least give it further consideration.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we are at cross purposes.  I agree entirely with both Deputies so far as the danger of slow-moving traffic is concerned.  But there is a method whereby that can be dealt with, and this is not the method. In future we will have on such roads as this&mdash;the road to Belfast, with which I am also familiar&mdash;much more than at present traffic control by the Gardaí as well as traffic laws dealing with traffic lanes.  Even at present, on roads where there is ample width for more than one lane of traffic in each direction, slow-moving traffic is compelled by law to keep as near as possible to the left.  If it did so, this problem of holding the centre of the road would not arise and many accidents would be avoided.  The frustration which causes drivers in faster moving vehicles to do foolish things would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are considering this problem of traffic lanes in the context of motorways such as have been built elsewhere. In order to have minimum speeds we must have special motorways and special legislation.  On these motorways abroad there is a special law which prohibits certain types of vehicles from using them.  No roads come on to them&mdash;they are straight through&mdash;and you can, therefore, apply sensible minimum speeds.  On our roads, however, which are open to every type of vehicle, you can see how impossible it would be to apply minimum speed limits.  We have only to think of all the vehicles that have a right to be on our roads&mdash;tractors, horse-drawn vehicles, scooters, motor cycles, bicycles, &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; cars, large buses, trucks, big cars, little cars, sport cars, fast cars and slow cars, not to mention all the various kinds of drivers.  Even a dual carriageway does not get over the problem.  These vehicles can go in one direction on <Col N="356" /> either of two traffic lanes; and if we were to prescribe minimum speed limits it would create only more trouble and danger than exist at present.</P>
    <P>Let us not confuse ourselves by comparing what we know is being done on specially-built motorways abroad with what we know exists here and which will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.  I think the House will readily see that greater safety on the roads is not to be obtained by the application of minimum speed limits which may work admirably in proper circumstances elsewhere but which are not appropriate to our situation at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 57d.</P>
      <P>To add to the section two new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Speed limits fixed under this section shall be reviewed by the Minister at least once in every three years.</P>
      <P>(6) Prior to making any regulation under this section the Minister shall cause to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a notice of his intention to make such regulation not less than thirty days prior to the laying of such regulation before either House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 45 deals with the general speed limit which is to be fixed and the right of the Minister to increase or reduce it or to restrict it to particular periods of day or night.  The general speed limit suggested by the Bill is 30 m.p.h.  In these amendments I suggest that the new speed limits fixed by the Minister should be reviewed by him <Col N="357" /> once every three years and, secondly, that prior to making any regulation under Section 45 the Minister &ldquo;shall cause to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a notice of his intention to make such regulation not less than 30 days prior to the laying of such regulation before either House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, a general speed limit of 30 m.p.h., or, indeed, whatever might ultimately be agreed in relation to a speed limit-because I should imagine there will be as many different suggestions for a general speed limit as there are Deputies in the House&mdash;will clearly be in the nature of an experiment.  The Minister himself envisages that speed limits, either general or particular, will be variable from time to time.  There is no doubt that, with the progress made regarding mechanically-propelled vehicles, their performance, speed and manoeuvrability from one year to another, it is necessary that the Minister should keep the question of speed limits constantly under review and in the first part of this amendment I seek to ensure that the Minister will have imposed on him a statutory obligation to review at least once in every three years any speed limits fixed by him under this section.  My personal view is that the Minister must keep these speed limits under constant review and that once in every three years will not be sufficient, but I think that the House and road-users should at least be fortified by the assurance being written into this Bill that there will be a statutory obligation on the Minister to conduct that review once every three years.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment, to add a sixth subsection to Section 45, is designed, as I have explained, merely to ensure that, when the Minister proposes to make these regulations regarding speed limits under this section, he will give adequate notice of his intention. The notice I suggest is 30 days; if the Minister regards that as too long or too short I shall not quarrel with him, but I think it reasonable that he should be required to give notice particularly where it is possible that the imposition of a speed limit may affect <Col N="358" /> the flow of traffic through a particular business section or area in Dublin or in towns or country villages outside Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the first part of this amendment, which is the review sought every three years, the whole idea underlying the powers sought in the Bill generally in regard to fixing speed limits by regulation is to ensure that these speed limits may be varied from time to time as changing conditions and traffic patterns demand.  The idea is that all factors tending to bring about a change in any area in relation to a speed limit will be under constant review. Making it an obligation to review these speed limits every three years would be completely contrary to the spirit of the Bill.  Suppose also we were obliged to have a review not less than once every three years; suppose there was a case for it, I wonder how one would expect to have that fulfilled? Would it be necessary to have made some change once every three years to denote that a review had taken place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the other hand, if no notice or indication that a review has taken place is given, how would the Deputy or the House be satisfied that the review had in fact taken place, assuming, as the amendment seems to imply, that the Minister in this context is not going to have regard to the powers given in this Bill to change the speed limits as circumstances dictate? The House may agree that it would be a question of having these speed limits under constant review&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see anything in this, really.  I am putting it to the Deputy that the other side of the coin is that, for this whole business to work and to make sense, constant review is necessary and if that constant review is not taking place, the obligation to review once in three years will not be the answer.  I do not think the Deputy or the House would suggest that we should write into the Bill that the Minister for Local Government should keep all these matters under constant review but, in fact, that is what will be involved if this law is to have any sense; it will have to be kept under constant review.  It is not suggested that it should be written into the law that the Minister should keep it under constant review and if that suggestion is not made, why should it be written in that a review should be carried out at least once every three years?</P>
      <P>I feel that the amendment is not really necessary and that, indeed, if it were put into the law and it did mean that a review would take place once every three years, that reluctant reviewing is not the answer to the problem nor is it the intention of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the second part of the amendment is concerned, again I find it difficult to understand why regulations in regard to speed limits should be the one and only type of regulation picked out for special mention, treatment and publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> On the other hand, in regard to changes that may take place by regulation which would add to controlled areas in the matter of speed limits or, possibly, remove speed limits, it will be of no great value to the community as a whole if there is an obligation to give 30 days' notice by publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> because, by and large, such changes would affect particular localities and in many cases, would be of <Col N="360" /> local rather than general interest. Publication in this organ would not add very much to local knowledge of such changes.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, as I have already asked, why should this particular type of regulation be picked out for the special treatment outlined in the amendment?  Another difficulty could arise.  It is rather inconceivable at the moment, but it is possible that a matter requiring very urgent attention could arise, a special case, a special place, special circumstances, and the obligation to give 30 days' notice by publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> could defeat the application of some part of the speed limit regulations which in the public interest might be demanded but which would have to be denied because of the time factor outlined here.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to what the real argument would be in favour of this part of the amendment.  Not seeing the weight of the argument, I am inclined to say to the House that I do not see its value or the purpose it would serve in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 45 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should be clear as to what we are doing in this Section.  We are now declaring a general speed limit in what the section declares to be built-up areas and we are going to make it an offence to infringe that speed limit.  I should like to say at the outset that it is very desirable that in built-up areas there should be speed limits but I do not think that the Bill as drafted goes about the task of setting up speed limits in a proper or fair way to motorists or to users of the roadway. It will be noticed that the section declares that there is to be a speed limit of 30 miles per hour on all public roads in built-up areas and the section then goes on to define that a public roads in a built-up area for the purposes of the section is to be a public road which is in a county or other borough, an urban district or a town. It does seem to me that the unfortunate motorist driving through <Col N="361" /> the country in Ireland may find himself committing an offence completely unwittingly and completely innocently in that he may be going through what he takes to be a village and may find that, in fact, it is a town.</P>
      <P>What is a town?  The Bill does not define what a town is.  I do not know whether there is incorporated in this Bill the definition of town in the Local Government code.  It may well be, but I have not been able to find it.  If it is a town, does that mean that it is a town with town commissioners?  If a person is taking a trip up to Dundalk, he will not know when travelling through Swords that he is passing through a town or, when he is passing through Balbriggan, that he is passing through an urban district.</P>
      <P>To my mind whilst it is most desirable that there should be speed limits, perhaps both in Swords and Balbriggan, and in similar towns throughout the country, the section as drafted is in effect a way of avoiding for local authorities a task which they should have, namely, the erection of signs indicating that a speed limit exists.  There is nothing in this section as I see it which requires a local authority to put up a sign indicating that a speed limit exists.  As I understand it&mdash;I am not absolutely certain on this&mdash;Balbriggan is an urban district and, accordingly, a driver going through Balbriggan may be guilty of an offence whereas when he was going through Swords he was guilty of no offence.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister should reconsider the manner in which this whole section has been drafted and whilst we should put speed limits into this Bill we should make an offence apply where the motorist had notice that such an offence will occur if he breaks a speed limit.  He will have notice when signs are erected.  It does seem to me that this is a method by which we are taking away what should be the task of the local authorities, namely, the erection of signs indicating that a speed limit exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, as I see it, there is no obligation on a local authority to <Col N="362" /> indicate that a motorist is coming to an urban district or to a town.  A person travelling in the west of Ireland may come to Swinford.  He may not know whether it is an urban district or a town.  He may come to Westport and may know it is an urban district and that he should drive at 30 miles an hour.  I think the Bill, as drafted, is unfair to the motorist who is using the roads in a perfectly lawful and proper manner.  A person may completely unwittingly commit an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>There is also the extraordinary situation that the Minister may by regulation have taken some of the roads out of the section.  A person may be going through what is, in fact, an urban district council area and may not be committing any offence because the Minister may have made a regulation. The only way in which we can see that there is some sanity in what is a desirable amendment of our road traffic code and ensure that this is properly done is to say that speed limits should exist where they are properly indicated by signs put up by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I should like also to make another suggestion.  I do not know whether there is any substance in it or not but there is considerable difficulty in the way this is drafted in ascertaining what exactly is or is not a town.  I know that under the local government code there are definitions of a town.  I do not know whether this is incorporated in this Bill.  If it is incorporated in it, I think it is a rather cumbersome method of drafting.</P>
    <P>There is also a general matter that I should like to mention in respect of this part of the Bill.  We are all presumed to know the law.  That is sometimes a pretty stiff task for the ordinary member of the public.  We are certainly not making it easier in this Bill in the way it is drafted for the ordinary person to know what the law is.  I have already indicated the motorist's difficulty in knowing whether he is travelling through an area to which a speed limit applies.  Some conscientious person who wants to read this Bill and <Col N="363" /> find out what the offences are is not going to have a simple task.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Bill, which contains Sections 44, 45, 46 and 47, there are no penalties provided and a person unacquainted with this Bill has to go through a very considerable number of sections&mdash;127&mdash;before he finds out that there is a general section, Section 102, which provides for general penalties.  When he finds that out, he will find out that in respect of an offence under Part IV there is a maximum penalty of £20 in respect of a first offence, with increasing penalties for subsequent offences.  But this conscientious person would not yet have done his task adequately because he would then have to ascertain whether there might be any disqualification of his licence in respect of an offence under Part IV of the Bill.  He would then go through the Bill again and would find in Section 27 that there is, in fact, a disqualification if he turns back to the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>It is all there for somebody who is perhaps trained in the reading of statutes.  It is all there for somebody who goes to a considerable amount of trouble to find out exactly what the penalties are under this section.  The Minister should reconsider the manner in which this Part of the Bill is drafted and on Report Stage, should bring in a new section to indicate what the penalties are for an infringement of this Part of the Bill and also indicate in this Part that there is, in fact, a disqualification order to be made in certain circumstances.  I feel that then the Bill would be much more intelligible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Costello with regard to the general provisions of the section, I do not want to repeat his arguments.  I want to ask the Minister in relation to the particular speed limit suggested in the Bill what consultations he had and with what bodies before the suggested speed limit of 30 miles an hour was arrived at.  I heard various opinions expressed. Some agree that 30 miles an hour is reasonable; others want a speed limit <Col N="364" /> as high as 40 miles an hour; while still others would like to split the difference and have it about 35 miles an hour.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister has a difficult task in deciding what is the appropriate speed limit to be imposed as a general speed limit.  I am inclined to think that a speed limit of 30 miles an hour, having regard to cars nowadays, is rather too low.  I think I am correct in saying that 30 miles an hour was the general speed limit operated in England under the Road Traffic Act of 1934.  Since 1934 not only the speed of cars and the general road holding and steering of cars but also the effectiveness of car brakes have, I think, been vastly improved. It would seem to me that a general speed limit of 30 miles an hour, which was regarded as appropriate in England in 1934, would not really have very much relevancy to the position, both as regards roads and vehicles today.  My personal view is that the Minister is plumping for too low a general speed limit.  I think it might be more desirable if he made it a general speed limit of 40 miles an hour, liable to be reduced to 30 miles an hour, or even lower as circumstances required it, either in terms of time or areas.  In other words, at particular hours or in particular areas, a lower speed limit might be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider very carefully the arguments which Deputy Costello made in regard to the desirability of letting members of the motoring public know where they stand in relation to the speed limit, whatever speed limit the Minister ultimately decides on, if he is prepared to depart from the suggested limit of 30 miles an hour.  The only place I know where a speed limit is clearly marked and operated is in the Bray district, going out from Dublin to Wicklow and Wexford.  I do not think that anyone is in any doubt.  Everyone can see that a speed limit&mdash;I think it is 25 miles an hour&mdash;is clearly indicated. I see no reason why the same system should not be operated in relation to the speed limit generally throughout the country and even in <Col N="365" /> city areas.  I do not think it would cause any great hardship.  From the point of view of the motoring public, it would be very much better than the imposition of a general speed limit in relation to urban districts or towns, as suggested in the Bill, because then, as Deputy Costello pointed out, we are putting the onus on the motorist to make up his mind as he drives along whether or not a particular area, which appears to him to be a built-up area, qualifies as a town or an urban district.</P>

      <P>Under subsection (1) as drafted, the Minister may reduce or increase the speed limit.  I certainly would be against the idea of an overall speed limit.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I support the Minister's proposal, because I think it is a good thing that he should have power to very the speed limit.  I should also like to ask, him if &ldquo;town&rdquo; is sufficiently defined.  Many people in big villages like to regard their villages as towns.  Would &ldquo;village&rdquo; be covered or described by &ldquo;town&rdquo;?  The Minister may not know the town of Ferns &mdash;there are many towns in Donegal which I do not know&mdash;but I think there should be a speed limit in that town because motorists career through it as quickly as they can.  I cannot think of a comparable place in Donegal, but I am sure the Minister <Col N="366" /> can think of a place that could be described as a village but which is as large as some towns.</P>
      <P>I am glad, too, that the Minister has power to restrict the speed limit to particular periods of the day and night. It would be daft to have motorists crawling through certain towns at 15 or 20 m.p.h. at midnight or during the early hours of the morning.  Such delays could be very upsetting.  The very fact that a speed limit is to be imposed does not necessarily mean that the number of accidents will be reduced to any appreciable extent.  There is another alternative: the power which the Garda have at the present time. A member of the Garda is entitled to pull me up, challenge me and prosecute me, if I travel at 10 m.p.h. through very narrow places, such as the main street of Wexford, if he considers that speed a danger to the public.  The Garda have always had that power.  It is a deterrent, a brake and a curb on people when they know there is a speed limit in built-up areas, and I think the sooner it is imposed the better.</P>
      <P>Everyone has had experience of the fast driver who, not deliberately, still continues to drive fast when approaching some of these moderate-sized towns. I know in my own home town of Wexford, even tourists travel pretty fast.  Coming from Rosslare Harbour, the main road into the town is pretty wide, and it takes a few seconds or a few minutes for them to realise they are in a town.  Sometimes grave damage can be done and has been done.  As I say, a speed limit will be a curb or a brake on them.  I assume &mdash;I do not know whether it is quite clear&mdash;that there will be signs to the effect that there is a speed limit, and that there will be warning signs, such as they have in Great Britain and in the Six Counties, informing people that they are approaching a built-up area and giving warning, so to speak, that there is a speed limit, so that they will be ready to obey it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Minister has taken power to increase or reduce the speed limit by regulation. On Second Reading, I applauded him for taking this power unto himself <Col N="367" /> because, in the matter of road traffic and parking, agreement is now being sought between the Department, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the local authority.  If it is not reached&mdash;and, as a matter of fact, not much has been done up to the present &mdash;it is a good thing that the Minister himself is taking this power which is a necessary curb on motorists who drive too fast.  I assume&mdash;again I do not want it written into legislation&mdash; that the Minister will consult, not so much the local interests as the local Garda, if he decides to make regulations to increase or reduce the speed limit.  I am sure he will do so, but I should like to be assured of it.</P>
    <P>I know this legislation can be put into operation, so to speak, only in stages, and it may take quite a long time to enforce many of the provisions. I should like again, in the matter of the speed limit, especially in the built-up areas, to urge on the Minister that he should have the necessary regulations made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy O'Higgins on the question of the 30 m.p.h. speed limit.  Personally, I feel it is a pity this limit was specified so clearly in subsection (1) (a) of Section 45.  I would have been happier if the subsection simply read: &ldquo;There shall be a speed limit in respect of all public roads in built-up areas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I feel that the suggested speed limit, which has been the speed limit in Great Britain since 1934, is completely unrealistic in these days.  Not only has there been a very significant improvement in the braking capacity of cars in the meantime, but there has also been a tremendous improvement in road surfacing, and in the sign-posting of roads giving warning of road junctions, narrowing of road widths, and so on.  Consequently I feel that a speed limit of 40 m.p.h. in built-up areas would be much more reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made certain experiments in this regard very recently. I was in Belfast only a few weeks ago and, going into the city in the comparatively <Col N="368" /> early hours of the morning between 7.30 and 8 o'clock, there was not any great amount of traffic on the main road.  There was, however, a mixture of traffic-private cars and heavy commercial vehicles.  At one stage, I found myself behind a heavy lorry and trailer, the speed limit for which in Northern Ireland is, I think, 20 m.p.h. I found considerable difficulty in passing that vehicle with safety and had to stay behind it for some time at 20 m.p.h.  Eventually, I came to a straight stretch of road and, everything being clear, I was able to pass it, but in order to do so safely I had to go up to the limit of 30 m.p.h.  This means that, certainly so far as passing large vehicles is concerned, there must be a margin of 10 m.p.h between the speed of the vehicle being overtaken and the overtaking vehicle.  With regard to the passing of a private car, similar experiments have shown me that about 7 to 8 m.p.h. is necessary to pass safely on any normal road.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the conviction that the strict observance of a 30 m.p.h. speed limit over all roads in built-up areas will mean that the stream of traffic will be moving at something slightly over 30 m.p.h. because anything trying to pass a vehicle at 30 m.p.h. will have to exceed the 30 m.p.h. speed limit.  This will give rise to congestion on the roads and to that very dangerous feature of modern traffic, frustration and irritation amongst drivers.  Once drivers become irritated their standards of driving deteriorate very rapidly and they begin to take chances.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire I carried out further experiments, driving through Dún Laoghaire itself at various times of the day.  In the morning, coming in to work, there is fairly heavy traffic.  It is a physical impossibility to drive at anything approaching 30 m.p.h. through Dún Laoghaire at that time.  If you can get through anywhere near like 20 m.p.h. it is the absolute maximum.  If this speed limit were enforced it would be enforced, as far as I can see, right from the city centre to some place past Dalkey without any break.  I feel this is entirely unrealistic at times when 30 m.p.h. <Col N="369" /> through Booterstown, Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, and so on, is too fast.  It is also a physical impossibility.</P>
    <P>There are times during the day when 30 m.p.h. on that Dún Laoghaire road and Merrion Road generally is absolutely safe.  At the moment, you would see, as I have seen, double-decker buses travelling at 40 m.p.h. and, I am afraid, even 45 to 50 m.p.h. on that road.  I know they are exceeding the speed limit for that type of vehicle but they are doing it with absolute safety. Visability is good and, so long as the surface is not slippery, no danger is caused to anyone.</P>
    <P>I would hope therefore that instead of having varying speed limits in varying types of built-up areas we would stick to a standard 40 m.p.h. which I believe is already being advocated by numerous authorities in some at least of the motoring organisations in Great Britain.  Where a speed of say 30 m.p.h. is dangerous in itself, it could be made the subject of a prosecution. I think it is far safer to have a speed limit which everyone accepts as a reasonable maximum rather than one which becomes a source of irritation to very many people.</P>
    <P>I would not for a moment suggest that the speed limit should be relaxed during the hours of darkness.  On the contrary, I feel a speed limit during the hours of darkness is far more important.  One of the most dangerous things to do is to drive through the city in the early hours of the morning. It is at that time that everyone believes he is the only person on the road.  I feel that a speed limit in the hours of darkness, especially when there is very little traffic on the road, is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>One has only to read the papers each morning to see how many accidents of a very serious nature take place in the very early hours. I do not believe this is primarily a matter of people driving under the influence of drink, coming away from dances and parties, half so much as that everybody believes he is the only person around.  He takes a chance and goes ahead across a crossroads without taking any precautions at all <Col N="370" /> and meets another car doing precisely the same thing, coming at right angles.</P>
    <P>While I approve of the provision that the Minister may increase or reduce speed limits from time to time, I would hope that this would be confined as much as possible.  I feel that any tendency to vary these speed limits too much will only lead to confusion. On a recent trip in Germany with other members of this House I was appalled by the number of road signs on German roads.  I think that is something that reflects the German temperament.  I think it is something they probably appreciate but I do not think it is a thing we would appreciate here.  I think they like to get precise instructions as to what they should and should not do.  This leads to a mass of road signs giving varying speed limits, information about the sharpness of the curves ahead, the gradients up and down, and so on, until a situation is caused where a driver of a vehicle almost would need a navigator as well as himself to keep up with the number of instructions on road signs.</P>
    <P>It would be far better that it should generally be realised all over the country that whenever the sign on the road indicates it, the speed limit shall be 40 m.p.h. day or night.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not misunderstand what I am saying because I am not habitually a madly fast driver.  I am very much in favour of speed limits of some kind.  I would feel very much happier if he would consider deleting 30 m.p.h. from this subsection, reserving the right to have a speed limit, and make up his mind as he goes along what it shall be.  In asking him to delete 30 m.p.h. altogether, I would strongly support Deputy O'Higgins in his advocacy of a general speed limit of 40 m.p.h.  If we do not do that, I think we will restrict the flow of traffic and will cause more accidents by causing a pile-up of traffic and a number of frustrated drivers who will eventually break loose and pass where they should not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which I think we have already discussed and, the more discussion there is of it, the more obvious and clear it becomes that there never can be a uniform opinion in this House or in any other body of people as to what exactly is the right speed limit.  I think also that specific problems may possibly be operating in the minds of the Deputies who have spoken for a limit of other than 30 m.p.h.  No matter what speed limit is chosen I think each Deputy and each person concerned about these things in any way, on thinking the matter over, could find in his own experience a road, a village or town or part of a town the application to which of this 30 m.p.h. speed limit would seem to him to be unreasonable or likely to be of little use, to be ignored, or possibly much too slow or much too fast.  I agree that that is so and that these specific exceptions can be thrown up no matter what speed limit would be mentioned here.</P>
      <P>We did not come to the House with this proposal for a 30 m.p.h. speed limit until we had considered all the submissions made to my Department by those interested, as a result of the publicity and the White-Paper.  All these have been considered, all the views expressed both in regard to a 30 m.p.h. limit, a limit over 30 m.p.h. or under it, or no speed limit at all. In addition to that we took into account experience gained elsewhere in the operating of speed limits.  Taking all these matters into consideration and applying them in a general way to the background of our road system, we brought in this suggestion of a 30 m.p.h. speed limit.  While there may be an error there, and I am not prepared to admit that there is at this stage, I think, if an error does exist and that the error is that the 30 m.p.h. limit is too slow, it is a much better approach to come with a proposal for a speed that is too slow rather than that we should go to 40 m.p.h. and find after a time that we must reduce it.  This is a better approach and I am not prepared to admit without experience of its application that the speed limit of 30 m.p.h. is too slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have difficulties in regard <Col N="372" /> to getting in and out of Dublin and across Dublin, if we could travel at 30 m.p.h. we would have nothing to grouse about in regard to the time taken to cross the length of Dublin. The trouble is not that 30 m.p.h. is too slow; it is that with the traffic at its present volume one cannot attempt to drive at 30 m.p.h. and one spends more time waiting than driving.  That is not a matter that can be remedied by saying that we should move the limit up to 40 m.p.h.  That would not change it. It is not the remedy and it is not proposed to be the remedy.  Certainly it cannot be used as an argument that you would get through built-up areas more quickly by increasing the speed limit.  Even if it were true, the number of built-up areas in this city and other cities is such, in its length and breadth, that the time it takes us to get across it&mdash;at 25, 30, 35 or 40 m.p.h., if we were free to travel at those speeds &mdash;is really of no importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello mentioned a number of things which were noticeable by their absence in regard to speed limits. He said that the penalties for infringement of these speed limits were not mentioned. They are in fact mentioned. They are in the common penalty clause in Section 102 and I do not think that the Deputy or the House would suggest that they should be written in in every instance.  He also mentioned the difficulty of interpreting what is intended by the term &ldquo;town&rdquo; or &ldquo;built-up area&rdquo;.  The definition of a town is given in the Interpretation Acts and again it is not proposed that the definitions contained in those Acts should be written into this Bill.  In general practice it is not normally done.</P>

      <P>It has been said there would be confusion in regard to the matter of defining the roads on which speed limits will apply and that people will not know when they are in a speed limit zone or out of one, and that all sorts of confusion would be created. The fact is that Part IV of this Bill, as I already indicated in my Second Reading speech, will be brought into operation when the survey of roads proposed for speed limits has been completed, the regulations made and the road signs erected.  I do not see how anybody could arrive at the conclusion that we were merely going to pass this and say that all built-up areas and towns, and so on, were to have a 30 m.p.h. speed limit and say nothing more about it and that people from experience would have to learn that such-and-such a town boundary ended at such a fence or ditch.  That is not the intention.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the laws in question will come into operation only on the conditions I have stated.  Therefore, we do not need to interpret what a town is in order that a driver may know where a speed limit zone starts and finishes.  Regulations prescribing the type of road signs required to be erected will be made by the Minister for Local Government.  As will emerge in a later section, it will be for the Garda Commissioner to require that these signs, as prescribed by Ministerial regulation, be erected by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minister that Part IV will not come into operation until regulations have been made and signs have been erected.  That would be an excellent idea if it could be carried out.  I have a doubt as to whether the Bill as drafted covers the intention to which the Minister referred.  When the Bill is passed, Part IV will be in operation. Section 44 provides that the Minister may make regulations prescribing a <Col N="375" /> speed limit.  He is under no obligation to make these regulations.  He is merely given power under Section 44.  If a matter arose involving court proceedings, the court then would look at Section 45.  Under Section 45, a speed limit is provided.  The Bill as passed will state that there shall be a speed limit of 30 m.p.h.  It says that speed limit will apply in every built-up area. It defines a built-up area as a public road in a county or other borough, urban district, or town.  It seems to me there is a doubt in relation to these two sections.  The order would appear to be wrong.  I think the doubt should be cleared up now, or certainly before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>If, after the passing of this Bill, a person were to go through Balbriggan driving at over 30 m.p.h. he could be summoned for an offence under Section 45.  There clearly is a doubt in relation to the manner in which this Part of the Bill has been drafted.  If it is intended that this Part of the Bill will not come into operation until regulations have been made, we should say that. As it is drafted, it appears to provide under Section 44 that regulations may be made but under Section 45 a speed limit is to come into force when the Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>While theoretically it might be possible to do as the Deputy suggests, many orders would be needed in order to apply a speed limit to all the roads of the country.  What might serve the Deputy's purpose and what is the intention under this Bill is to specify certain routes on which a speed limit will be applied for special occasions.  For instance, at Whit weekend we could make an order that a speed limit would be applied in built-up areas on the road, say, from Dublin to Cork or Dublin to Waterford, naming the main artery.  What the Deputy suggests would involve mentioning all the roads by their number or other identification and making a multitude of orders for a special occasion in order to cover the total road mileage of the country.  However, by applying a speed limit to special routes we can meet the Deputy's suggestion and introduce a safety factor <Col N="377" /> at some of these peak week-ends such as August Bank Holiday, Whit weekend or on other such special occasions.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with an offence that is being created by Section 48, that is, attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place when a person knows he is suffering from a disability.  I understand that in this Section it is proposed to insert the words &ldquo;attempting to drive&rdquo; thus creating a new offence. Heretofore under Section 29 of the 1939 Act which corresponds to Section 48. these words &ldquo;attempting to drive&rdquo; were not included.  The remarks I want to make in regard to these words apply perhaps with greater force in respect of the next section which deals with the more common offence of attempting to drive while drunk.</P>
      <P>There is no definition of &ldquo;attempting to drive.&rdquo;  In fact this matter has been the subject of considerable judicial review and it is a matter which in practice gives a great deal of difficulty.  It is a matter in which there is very frequently a severe conflict of testimony and one on which district justices may take different views on what constitutes attempting to drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there have been a number of interpretations of this, but I would like to suggest to the Minister that it would be desirable to insert in this Bill what the Legislature considers should amount to an attempt to drive.  This applies, I suggest, with greater force when we come to deal with the offence of attempting to drive a car while drunk because in that case a prison penalty applies.  There have been a number of cases where evidence is given by a member of the Garda or a person who is a member of the public who witnessed an alleged offence of a person entering a motor car, and very frequently conflict arises as to whether the ignition key was inserted in the car.  The conflict may arise as to whether the ignition was turned on, and different views may be held as to whether the offence is committed when the ignition key is put in the ignition <Col N="379" /> switch without the ignition being turned on.</P>
    <P>In view of the seriousness of offences, particularly in the next section to the one with which we are dealing, we should try to define what is meant by attempting to drive.  I would suggest that it should be indicated in this section that no person should be convicted of the offence of attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle unless the court is satisfied that the mechanism of the engine had been turned on or that the motor car had been moved for a certain distance, perhaps more than its own length.  I know of cases in which evidence has been given that a car moved three feet and there was quite clearly evidence that the person in charge of the car had not even the keys at that time.  Conflicts of that sort might arise and are going to continue until some clear-cut definition of attempting to drive is inserted in the Bill.  I do not think it would be a difficult matter to lay down what is meant by attempting to drive, and an attempt should be made to reach such a definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 1 of Section 48 says that &ldquo;a person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place when he is to his knowledge suffering from any disease or physical or mental disability which would be likely to cause the driving of the vehicle by him in a public place to be a source of danger to the public.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;to his knowledge&rdquo; appear to me as likely to result in quite a lot of subsequent litigation, because if an offence is alleged against a citizen under this section it appears that the prosecution will, first of all, have to determine in some way that the individual was quite well aware of his own physical or mental disability.  This appears to me to throw a great burden on the courts, because it is the type of thing which would give the legal profession a Roman holiday for many months. How does one know to one own's knowledge whether one is fit or unfit to drive a mechanically propelled <Col N="380" /> vehicle?  One may suspect, but unless one obtains a certificate from one's own or some other medical practitioner it is an assumption.</P>
      <P>Is there a danger in this section that in order to deal with the confusion that it appears to me may be created by the wording, the Minister may at a later stage bring out regulations requiring everyone who drives a mechanically propelled vehicle to produce a certificate of fitness, because the offence is not driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place which is likely to be a source of danger to the public, but driving or attempting to drive when he is to his knowledge suffering from any disease or physical or mental disability?  It appears that the problem arising from any prosecution under this will not be a prosecution for driving the vehicle, but the immediate responsibility will be to show beyond doubt that the person concerned was actually and definitely aware that he had this disability.  I am making the comment at this stage because I would like to have the Minister's views as to whether or not the form of words in this section would in fact create a situation which would be very confusing and would almost ensure never-ending litigation in an endeavour to prosecute anyone under this subsection.</P>

      <P>So far as Deputy Costello's remarks are concerned in regard to defining what attempting to drive really means, he seems to think it would be a simple matter.  I must say that I do not at all regard it as a simple matter, nor do I think it would be possible without creating a very difficult, confusing situation to define this &ldquo;attempting to drive&rdquo; which would be applied to all cases that may arise, when he himself has said to the House that the courts in their determination of matters such as this at present and in the past have had various views and not always the same view.  If the courts themselves found it so difficult in specific cases heard before them with witnesses giving evidence on oath, to find a common definition or what would appear to be a common approach to this matter of attempting to drive, that is fairly good proof, if <Col N="381" /> any were needed, that it is indeed an almost impossible task to define what attempting to drive means and to have it applied in a general way to every person and in all circumstances that may arise in any law cases in the years that lie ahead.  It is better left to the courts in the individual cases to interpret and to find for themselves in each case that may arise just what is the definition that applies in that particular set of circumstances rather than to try to generalise in a matter which is very difficult.</P>
      <P>I would say in all sincerity to Deputy Costello that if he feels he has a way in which this could be done simply or in a manner that will be an improvement on what we propose to leave at the moment I would be very glad to have it, and we could consider inserting it at a later stage in the Bill.  As I say, if he has, in thinking it over further, some form under which this could be done I would certainly give it every consideration at a later stage.</P>
      <P>In so far as Deputy Larkin's point is concerned on this matter of a person driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle when he is to his knowledge unfit or suffering from any disease or physical or mental disability which would be likely to cause the driving of the vehicle by him in a public place to be a source of danger to the public, if I understand the Deputy rightly he takes the view that the whole decision of a court must be really to find out whether the person was of the knowledge that he suffered from such physical or mental incapacity as would render him a danger to the public when driving.  That is not so. What we are saying is if a person is incapacitated and if it transpires later that he attempted to drive knowing he was in that physical or mental condition, that in itself would be an offence.  If it were a question of a mental condition, naturally that would not be a matter to be determined by the courts.  Such a person would not, I take it, be held responsible for his actions.  A court penalty would not be the answer there.  The treatment would be somewhat different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> As far as the matter raised by Deputy Larkin is concerned, I cannot see that arising at all.  Take, for example, a person who knew he was suffering severely from epilepsy.  If that person proceeded to drive or attempted to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, he would without doubt be committing an offence under Section 48.  Knowingly, he took the risk of possibly doing injury to himself and to others. It is in that context that this section is framed rather than the context of having to prove in court whether a person was fit to drive or not.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59a:</P>
      <P>Before section 49 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to impair his control of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>(2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds and the Court shall make an order disqualifying such person from holding a driving licence for a period of not less than three months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment as a result of a court case.  I am not pressing the Minister to accept it word for word. As the Bill stands, two things must be proved.  First, that the man was drunk; and, second, that he was incapable. I have seen the case of a man who was proved to be under the influence of drink but who could not be proved incapable of driving.  What I should like to get into this section is that the degree of drunkenness should determine whether a person had proper control.  I hold that you should bring out the point that the influence of drink was such that the man was incapable. <Col N="383" /> I merely put that to the Minister in the hope of stopping any loopholes in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  As Deputy Coogan pointed out, Section 49 of the Bill, which is very much the same as the provision in the 1933 Act, requires that before a person can be convicted, the court should be satisfied he was incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.  It may very well be that there is a distinction, such as Deputy Coogan has pointed out in moving his amendment, and that a person can be culpable in that he has allowed his control of the vehicle to be impaired, while, at the same time, it is not possible for the court to find he is incapable of proper control.  In other words, you may have a situation where a court is bound to say that a person has been influenced by drink or drug taking but is capable of exercising proper control, whether or not he did in fact exercise proper control on the occasion in question.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Coogan's amendment is accepted, or some Government amendment to cover it, it would be open to the court to decide that a person has taken drink or drugs to such an extent that it has impaired his capacity to exercise ordinary normal reasonable control.  It would be well worth the Minister's while to consider the points involved in this.  If he is not prepared to accept the amendment as drafted. I would ask him to consider it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal would, I think, bring about a situation in which its application by the courts would mean, in effect, that if you drink anything, you drive nothing; in other words, we would need to have prohibition, and I do not think we are going to have that.  The phraseology in the latter part of subsection (1) is &ldquo;...under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to impair his control of the vehicle.&rdquo;  I believe it is commonly held that very little liquor is required to bring about a slowing of the reflexes. If that is so&mdash;that a small amount of <Col N="384" /> liquor slows the reflexes to some degree&mdash;then, if we were to implement this amendment, the consumption of any alcohol at all or any evidence of its having been consumed could be used as proof that a person's driving ability had been impaired.  You could have a driver second to none in his handling of a car and you could have the very opposite&mdash;the driver who will never make a good driver, who is awkward and cannot do anything about it.  I certainly would much prefer to be in the vehicle with the really good driver who had a small quantity of alcohol taken rather than in the vehicle with the bad driver who had taken no alcohol.  I think that would be the choice of most people. The very good driver could still be infinitely better than the poor driver, even though the control of the very good driver was somewhat impaired. Would it be right then that this driver, who was a better driver than the fellow who had not taken a few bottles, should be prosecuted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving this merely as an extreme case.  I do not think this would be acceptable to the House in its extreme form.  It is somewhat similar to what is in the British law at the moment but even they do not use the same words.  In fact, they say: &ldquo;impair the proper control of the vehicle&rdquo;, whereas here we say &ldquo;so as to impair his control of the vehicle&rdquo;, so that no matter how good his control might be at a given time, after he had any alcohol, it could be said his control was impaired, below his best, no matter how good that best was, but he could still be more than capable in comparison with the majority of drivers.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the section as it is. I feel it is sufficiently sound to cover the matters Deputy Coogan has in mind when he suggests this amendment.  I take it the idea is that the amendment would be written in, in addition to the provisions already in the section.  These provisions are pretty solid provisions that will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Two things must be proved: that a man is drunk and that he is incapable.  I have seen a case where a man was proved to be drunk but could not be proved to be incapable. Take the man who has just had his first drink.  I suppose if I took &ldquo;a half one&rdquo;&mdash;I never touched it in my life&mdash;I would be no addition to the roads.  Still I should only have had &ldquo;a half one&rdquo; while the hardened drinker might have had half a dozen.  You must have a question of the degree of drunkenness on which you stand or fall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that there were two types of bad driver, the one bad because he was mechanically inept or incompetent for one reason or another, but sober and the bad driver who is a first-class driver but who has drink taken.  He proposes to get rid of the first type of bad driver, the one who is mechanically inept, by means of driving tests. Would it not be logical to accept an amendment of the type suggested by Deputy Coogan to get rid of the other type of bad driver ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Dr. Browne has misunderstood what I meant.  It may be he thought that I was visualising these two types of drivers and that by tests we were going to put the sober, bad driver off the road, while the other fellow could continue to drive and have a jorum at the same time.  What I am trying to ensure is that, even with the tests, the sober but poor driver who will handle the vehicle with care will still be there.  I am not saying that he will be put off the road.  He will be entitled to be there.  The other is a very good, natural driver.  There are such people who are well able to handle a machine just as there are those who, try as they may, will never become really good drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Those are the two types I was using for the purposes of comparison and I said that the really good driver who had possibly a bottle of stout taken&mdash; which would still be intoxicating liquor in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of this amendment; the bottle of stout could in fact be held to impair that person's control of the vehicle&mdash;would be my choice for my own safety if I were going a journey rather than the poor driver who will have passed the test but is still a poor driver.  I should prefer to have the naturally good driver with the bottle of stout taken than the bad driver who is sober.  I do not want it to be understood that I would prefer to have the good driver drunk than the bad driver sober.  That is not the comparison but Deputy Dr. Browne seems to think I implied that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan has made the point that a driver can be said to be drunk and, at the same time, other than incapable. The question of being drunk does not really arise; if he can be proved to be incapable, we need not worry about the other part.  This section deals with the question of his incapability, his being incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.  That is the operative part of the section and that is the one which is of significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I am quite willing to have another look at it.  Whether we take a drink or not, I am sure everybody in the House is just as concerned as I am to try to cure that situation and anything that will help to cure it by way of amendment will be welcomed by all of us.  I shall have this matter further examined to see if, in fact, the fears expressed by Deputy Coogan and which he hopes to overcome by this amendment, are really justified or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His last remark was that there will be a loophole and that drunken drivers <Col N="387" /> will still be able to get off on occasions. I think it can be said of any law no matter by whom it may be designed at some stage or other somebody who should not get off does get off.  Even if we were to write in Deputy Coogan's amendment, together with what is in the Bill, and everything that could be put in I feel the Deputy would be able to come back in five or ten years and say: &ldquo;There is one fellow who should have been caught and who got off.&rdquo; That will still arise occasionally but we should not worry unduly about something that happens on occasion. However, I shall undertake to examine the section and try to improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point of view of Deputy Coogan and I should like the Minister to look into this question of capability.  There may be thousands of people in this country today who would be too drunk to walk but who would be capable of handling the controls of a motor car. There is nothing in handling these controls at present.  Many years ago when it was difficult to handle even the gears, it might have been another story, but they are so simple now that anybody can sit there and go through the motion of operating the controls. It is not the control of the car that in fact may create the danger to the public or put the lives of innocent citizens in danger; it is a person who is quite capable of using his hands for the purpose of steering the car, changing the gears, and going through the other necessary movements, who is so completely befuddled and so careless because of drink he has taken that the car is not just a car in the same sense as it is when being driven by a bad driver, who may be all the more careful because of that and is also sober.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be a weapon of absolute destruction in the hands of somebody who can be described as being intoxicated, as being drunk, and yet you would find it very difficult to say such a person was incapable of exercising control of the car.  The mechanical operation of the controls of the ordinary motor car can be done almost in one's sleep and certainly the <Col N="388" /> experienced driver can operate the controls up to a very serious stage of drink.  That does not mean that he would be any less dangerous to the ordinary public.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy has in mind is to try to strengthen the section so as to protect the ordinary people on the road from a driver who has taken sufficient drink to impair his judgment to such an extent that he may drive up on the pavement.  He still has control of the car if he can drive up on the pavement.  He can drive into another car and can still control his own car and possibly drive away afterwards.  We read now and again of hit and run cases.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy is concerned about is to strengthen the section so as to ensure that there will be better control of these people.  In supporting the Deputy in this matter I would ask the Minister to re-examine the question of being incapable of driving a car and the exact meaning of those words for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <P>A person who has never driven a car is incapable of driving.  He does not know the gears.  He does not know how to start the car.  He learns after a while.  Like swimming, it becomes almost second nature.  That does not mean that he is fit, from the point of view of the general public, to drive a car.  There are many thousands of people who take a bottle of stout and because they are good drivers can adjust themselves to their own condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not on that point.  I am on the point that there is some difference between the question of being intoxicated and the question of being incapable.  The exact meaning of &ldquo;incapable&rdquo; for this purpose is very important from the point of view of the general public.  In Deputy <Col N="389" /> Coogan's mind&mdash;and I follow him in this&mdash;the term &ldquo;incapable&rdquo; appears to be too loose and to give almost no protection to the public whereas the term which he uses&mdash;and he is not adamant that that exact term should be used&mdash;would suggest that the question as to whether the ability of the driver is seriously impaired should be taken into account.  The Minister has undertaken to look into it and I would urge him to have regard to this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the basic weakness of this section and even of Deputy Coogan's amendment is that it eventually comes down to a matter of opinion as to whether there is a sufficient degree of incapability.  This matter was raised on Second Reading. I did not intervene at that stage.  I wanted to see, first, what the Minister's view was.  I gathered from his Second Reading speech that he felt that the scientific methods so far discovered for ascertaining degrees of incapability were not sufficiently accurate to command his support.  I am afraid that if we continue to wait for the perfect solution of this problem we shall not get anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of methods used on the Continent, for instance.  There is analysis of the breath.  I think that is known as the breathaliser.  There is <Col N="390" /> also a blood test.  I quite appreciate that, if we fix an arbitrary percentage of alcohol either in the breath or in the blood, we may be doing a certain amount of injustice to the hard drinker who is able to absorb a fairly heavy amount of alcohol without showing undue adverse results.  In the interests of the general public we should try to get some degree of certainty into this whole matter.  The courts generally are slow to convict of drunken driving unless the driver has been proved to be not only intoxicated but virtually footless because they feel that the offence is such a serious one that they must be absolutely convinced that it has been committed before recording a conviction, which must be regarded as very serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy agree that, if that is so, it is likely to be more so now when imprisonment is mandatory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would agree with Deputy O'Higgins there and I am afraid that that will have precisely the wrong effect.  I quite agree there.  The only way is to decide on one of the scientific tests which have already been tried out with at least some measure of success in other countries.</P>
      <P>There is also the danger of an unfair and unjust conviction for being drunk in charge of a car where a small amount of alcohol has been consumed and where as a result of shock the symptoms of intoxication may be displayed.  I quite appreciate that the Minister may not be absolutely satisfied with an analysis of the breath or a blood test for the percentage of alcohol.  I do not know sufficient of science to know which of these is the better or whether either of them is an accurate test but certainly in the Scandinavian countries where they have progressed very far in the effort to stamp out drunken driving they have erred in the right way, if they have erred at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in premises which sell intoxicating liquor customers may be shown a chart indicating precisely how much alcohol one may take before driving and the time lag that there should be after drinking, say, a <Col N="391" /> pint of beer before entering your car. That, I think, is all to the good even if it means that some people, who may be able to carry their drinking, will, in fact, be restrained from doing so.  I think that will be a very small injustice.</P>
    <P>It is far better to err on that side rather than on the side of allowing a person who is intoxicated to carry on driving simply because it is almost impossible to prove his degree of incapability.  I hope the Minister will consider as a matter of urgency the adoption of some scientific tests whereby incapability can be ascertained even though the determination of the percentage of alcohol in the blood may be arbitrary to a certain degree.  I hope he will do that.  If he does, it will strengthen the hand of the courts because they will know that it is simply a matter of recording the analysis.  If the analysis shows that the alcohol content was over the arbitrarily selected percentage, a conviction must result.  That will completely wipe out any chance that a person suffering from shock would be convicted for drunken driving.  It would also mean that the court will have no difficulty in deciding whether the law has been broken or not.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might meet the matter if he used the formula used in lines 29 and 30 of Section 48 to replace the lines to which Deputy Coogan has objected, that is, &ldquo;driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of drink which would be likely to cause the driving of the vehicle by him in a public place to be a source of danger to the public.&rdquo;  Why should there be a difference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that one of the difficulties in applying the section as drafted and the proposed amendment put down by Deputy Coogan is the difficulty of the district justice, or the jury, as the case may be, in arriving at a conclusion as to the degree of intoxication to which the accused had come at the time he was driving the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I should like to refer <Col N="392" /> to a practice that has developed in the courts and which recently was the subject of judicial pronouncement by the Supreme Court, namely, the practice by which members of the Garda give it as their opinion that the accused was unfit to drive by reason of the consumption of intoxicating liquor.  In nearly all cases where a person is accused of an offence under Section 30 of the existing code there will be one, two or more Gardaí who will give evidence that in their opinion the accused person was unfit to drive.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Supreme Court stated that this was a proper thing under the existing legislation for members of the Garda to do.  I should like to see that position changed or at any rate modified because I am quite satisfied it can possibly lead to injustice.  I am not suggesting for a moment that Gardaí are deliberately perjuring themselves in these prosecutions but it does not infrequently happen that Gardaí may, in fact, reach a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> conclusion that a person is unfit to drive&mdash; a conclusion which is, in fact, not warranted by the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is by no means unusual for a number of members of the Garda to give their opinion that a man is unfit to drive and for a doctor who has examined the accused person immediately afterwards or some short time afterwards to give his opinion that the man is fit to drive.  The Garda doctor has carried out tests and has arrived at what is in many cases a fair estimation of the accused person's capability.  The Gardaí who have <i>bona fide</i> given their views and their opinion have, in fact, arrived at a wrong conclusion and very frequently they arrive at a conclusion from a very short observation of the accused person.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should consider whether the law should be amended so as to provide at any rate certain modifications of the right of members of the Garda to give their opinion as to the man's capabilities.  It is a matter for the justice or the jury to decide.  It is not a matter upon which the ordinary unqualified person is to give an opinion.  Doctors, of course, are specially qualified.  When they have examined the person they are specially qualified to give an opinion but, unless <Col N="393" /> in special circumstances it can be shown that a Garda is particularly qualified either because of a long observation or because of very special training, I do not think a member of the Garda should be entitled to give his opinion.  I would ask the Minister to consider this.  It is an important branch of the law.  It is an important matter in these prosecutions which would arise either under the proposed section or in the sections which we shall be dealing with later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello raised a point in regard to the Garda being allowed to express their opinion for the prosecution in a court case related to a charge of drunken driving or attempting to drive.  He seemed to think that there is something wrong about that.  I wonder is there anything really wrong with anybody, whether a Garda or a member of the public who was actually on the spot, met the driver or saw him five or ten minutes afterwards, expressing his opinion in court? To the judge or the jury, as the case may be, the worth or weight of that opinion will, I have no doubt, be properly evaluated whether or not the Garda or ordinary member of the public was particularly qualified to give the opinion.  The more highly qualified he is, the more weight will that opinion carry to the judge or jury. On the other hand, even though there may be no particular qualification, the ract is that the Garda or member of the public in expressing his opinion will help the courts to determine whether or not the person is guilty of a particular offence.  That cannot be wiped out merely on the basis that in a court case which was decided not so long ago a doctor said one thing which did not seem to balance out what was given in evidence by the Garda.  That might be a case in which it was a considerable time before the doctor was found&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, first of all, compliment the Minister on the peaceful conditions obtaining in the country. No doubt peace and prosperity go hand in hand, and it is only natural to expect that in the prosperous era in which we are living, the people will be content and will have a greater respect for law and order.  I am sure the Minister has often visualised the day when a village policeman will be sufficient to maintain law and order and I think we are heading towards that day.  After 700 years of enslavement, it is only natural that people should resent laws of any kind, good or bad.  I would say that in the past 40 years, great progress has been made in that direction.  The progress which has been made is really astonishing, <Col N="395" /> and various Ministers for Justice must be complimented on the tactful way in which their officials and members of the Garda have handled these very difficult situations.</P>
      <P>I want now to make an appeal to the Minister.  I want to make a very special appeal for many of the Garda to whom medals have been duly awarded because of their services to the country.  I believe they should get an extension of even one year.  The distinction made as between members of the Garda who have military service medals with bar, and those who have military service medals without bar, is altogether too great, and there is no justification for it.</P>
      <P>I am in a position to say&mdash;and because he held very high rank at one time the Minister is in a better position than I to say&mdash;that the reason many of the men did not qualify for pensions was not the lack of service, not that they did not obey orders, not that they were not as good as the men who got military service awards, but perhaps that they were less fortunate. As I say, the distinction made between the two is altogether out of proportion. I am appealing now to the Minister to give these men an extension of even a year.  Not so many of them are left now, and in a couple of years, they will all be gone.  They gave good service in difficult times and, with few exceptions, we saw very little political bias on their part.  That is astounding when one considers the position when they first joined the Garda.</P>
      <P>There are many officers and men with medals without bar who have given splendid service.  Some of those officers served under me, so I ought to know.  They did not try to make a case for themselves before a Military Service Board and that is the main reason they did not get a pension. Some of them should have got a pension and I appeal to the Minister to have their cases examined again. Where he finds a <i>bona fide</i> case of service to the nation, the Garda or the officer should get an extension of the period.  In another year or two, most, if not all, of them will have gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> I have every confidence in the young men who are now coming on.  I differ from Deputy Dillon in that regard.  He seemed to get all hot and bothered at the idea of a young member of the Garda.  I do not know whether or not he was serious when he said he did not have the same complacent feeling in regard to them as he had in regard to the older men.  I hope he was not serious when he said that, because I should hate to think anyone in this country was not prepared to give to the new members of the force the same confidence as they had in the older men.  So far as I know, they are a fine body of young men.  They are young and active and no doubt, as time goes on, they will settle down and will have even greater respect for the people's rights. One thing every police force must have is a wholesome respect for the rights of the people and, in that regard, we have found them, on the whole, pretty satisfactory.  I do not know whether it was to the Garda or the Ban-Gharda Deputy Dillon was referring to, but I hope he was not serious in regard to either of them.</P>
    <P>Again, there are many young Gardaí who are contemplating marriage and in many towns they find that their prospects of getting houses are nil.  The older men came into the towns when great housing schemes were in operation. They were lucky perhaps to get houses, and many of them now intend to remain in the towns in which they are living when they retire.  The fact that they are welcome to remain in the towns is a great tribute to them.</P>
    <P>It would be too much of a tax on local authorities to provide new houses again for the young members who have joined the force in recent years. Therefore, I earnestly ask the Minister to urge on the Government the provision of a new housing scheme for the Garda.  There are other reasons, too.  It is bad for a young Garda to be under a compliment to anyone for the tenancy of a house, through subletting or otherwise, and he will always find himself to an appreciable degree under a compliment to a person who either gets a house for him or owns the house in which he is living.  On the whole, it is bad for Gardaí to be under a compliment <Col N="397" /> to anyone.  They should have their own homes independently of anyone else.</P>
    <P>While I agree that great steps have been taken in regard to new Garda barracks, much remains to be done. Some of the barracks are not fit for human habitation, even in frugal comfort. I believe there should be large barracks with married quarters to meet that difficulty to an extent, at any rate. Some of the old barracks are definitely not up to standard and yet the men must remain in them.  Many of them are really quite bad.</P>
    <P>I regret that some barracks which were in quite good condition were closed.  Their geographical position had all to do with the case.  Personally I do not think it wise to close down many barracks just yet.  I notice that where barracks are being closed down the people are not as contented or confident as when they are left open.  That is a natural reaction.  Garda give their time, apart from their heavy duties, to promote athletics and other sports.  Some Gardaí are also interested in drama and other cultural matters. It is very true then to say that they are missed when they leave an area.</P>
    <P>I suppose the closing-down of barracks is a sign of peace.  Nevertheless, I think such action is somewhat premature. I have in mind in particular mountain areas.  The Minister should not give poteen-makers a free field.  I am sorry to say we have a lot of the old bootlegger type of person in certain areas.  It is a poisonous and dangerous brew.  It is responsible for an increase in the numbers in mental homes.  It is responsible also for breaking up many family homes.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make certain that the foul crime of poteen-making will be followed up to the last. I appeal to him to be merciless with those people who participate in this nefarious practice.  No doubt they do it for the benefit of their pocket.  It represents a loss to the revenue which is infinitesimal as compared with the great danger it does to whole areas. An area may be located a long distance from a licensed premises.  We may <Col N="398" /> come across persons who are intoxicated and inebriated with this foul product called poteen.  With the price of whiskey and other spirits so high, it is only natural to expect that there would be ready customers for this brew.  We know it is on the increase. The Minister knows it is on the increase.  The Department of Justice knows it is on the increase.  The Garda know it is on the increase.  While we are doing a lot to stamp it out, I think we should do even more.  It is raising its hideous head now in places where poteen-making has hitherto been unknown. There are terrible dangers to the community in that foul practice.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if Garda barracks were occupied and occupied with more men rather than to reduce the number of men in areas where that terrible evil obtains.  I sincerely hope that more and more thought will be given to the closing-down of barracks. The people in areas where barracks have been closed down have many legitimate complaints.  A sergeant signs many documents and even a Garda signs some documents.  It can be a great inconvenience to the public in an area where a barracks is closed down. In passing, I shall make a slight reference to the Intoxicating Liquor Act.</P>

      <P>New time, summer time, will never be accepted in rural Ireland as a whole.  There are parishes here and there but I should like the Minister to bear that point in mind now.  Rural Ireland cannot be denied that amenity.  It has been denied enough.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the newly-appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.  I hope that during his term of office he will see a peaceful Ireland.  I am sure he will do his best to achieve that end.  He occupies a position to which he is fully entitled. Some remarks have been passed in this House which were most uncalled for. Some people seem to lose their heads when they talk about seniority.  If somebody is appointed because of seniority or because of ability, it is unfortunate that there is a trait in many of our people that, no matter what good foundation there may be for the appointment, they look for some wretched reason or another to decry it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section of the community who present a problem are the teddy-boys. I feel that more authority should be given to the Garda to deal with gentlemen who wreck trains and towns.  They came into the peaceful town of Clonmel.  They wrecked the town.  They wrecked some nice decent public houses in which decent customers are catered for.  Those blackguards came in and wrecked the place before the Garda could get to them.  I can tell you that when they come again they will get the devil's own <Col N="400" /> surprise.  They will not go back intact. I can assure you of that.  The young men of the town of Clonmel were prepared to help the Garda.  These gentlemen left just in time&mdash;and &ldquo;left just in time&rdquo; is right because only about half of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Garda draws his baton and strikes one of those teddy-boys who is committing an unlawful act there is probably an inquiry of some kind.  Therefore he is afraid to do that.  There should be no inquiries for scoundrels.  It was never intended that blackguards with drainpipe trousers should interfere with the people's freedom or take advantage of decent people who want to go out and enjoy themselves.  People from the city want to go out on Sundays and enjoy themselves, without being involved in a &ldquo;war&rdquo; of any kind.  I congratulate C.I.E. on what they did, but I sincerely hope that the Minister will give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Garda to deal with these gentlemen as they should be dealt with.  There is only one way to deal with them but perhaps it would not be very nice to say it here. I hope he will deal with them in a way they will not forget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene briefly to raise a few points on this Estimate.  My first point concerns the provision of free legal aid to poor prisoners.  It is a matter which I have raised before on this Estimate and I should like the Minister to look into it. At present the position is that the only way in which a poor prisoner can <Col N="401" /> obtain free legal aid is if he is subject to a charge on a capital offence.  It seems to me that we should have a system of free legal aid for poor prisoners.  I doubt if we could afford the elaborate system that exists in England for legal aid in respect of civil as well as criminal matters, but it appears to me that there are instances of injustice where a poor person who is charged with a criminal offence has not got the legal aid which he could have under a system analogous to that which operates in England.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to suggest that the justice, or the judge, or the jury trying the case, or the prosecuting counsel or the Guards or solicitor, are in any way unfair to a prisoner or an accused who appears on his own.  In fact, the contrary is frequently the case and the person who is not represented by solicitor or counsel frequently has the law leaning over backwards in his favour.  Nonetheless, prisoners who have not got professional representation because of lack of means do suffer hardship as a result of it and I would ask the Minister to consider adopting the system of wider legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer is that of law reform.  Law reform is something which although not a matter in which many people may appear to be interested, nonetheless affects the lives of many people.  I should like to see the formation of a permanent law reform committee. There are, all the time, matters arising as a result of decisions in the courts, of new aspects appearing in existing legislation, and all the time there is a necessity for reviewing present legislation and our present legal code.  A law reform committee should be established whose task it would be to examine the decisions that occur from time to time, examine the changing circumstances, and make recommendations for reform of the law.  This question of law reform is not a matter which should be left in abeyance until codified Acts can be brought in.  It is not a matter which should be left aside until the time of sometimes very hardworked officials, or Parliamentary time, is made available.  It is a matter which should be continually under review <Col N="402" /> and legislation should be constantly brought in to deal with changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The third matter to which I wish to refer is the question of the control of traffic and the accidents that arise on our roads to such an appalling degree. We have been dealing with road traffic legislation but the problem of road accidents is not by any means solely a matter for legislation; it is a matter for the enforcement of legislation, particularly by the Garda.  Part of the way in which road traffic legislation could be enforced is by means of more Guards on motor cycles.  At present the Guard on the motor cycle is quite a rare sight and certainly he is a sight which is likely to make the driver of any vehicle drive with greater caution and care.  At present expensive cars, manned by two or three Guards, are used for pattrol, whereas the motor cycle with one Guard would do the work just as efficiently and possibly more efficiently.</P>
    <P>One final matter is this: why do we treat Northern Ireland as a foreign country for the purpose of our administration of justice?  Would it not be simpler for us to decide that Northern Ireland is not outside the jurisdiction of our courts for the purpose of serving writs or civil bills and summonses on residents in Northern Ireland and also for the purpose of enforcing judgments obtained in Northern Ireland courts? This is a matter on which there could be cooperation between the two parts of the country.  It is a matter in which the administrators of justice both in Northern Ireland and here have a mutual interest.  It seems to me that it would be a fruitful field for discussion and cooperation between the authorities in the two parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Even, however, if the authorities in Northern Ireland did not wish to give us reciprocal rights with regard to the enforcement of judgments, the issuing of summonses and civil bills out of the jurisdiction, I still think we could in this part of the country decide that Northern Ireland need not be a foreign country for the purpose of serving summonses and issuing civil bills.  It would not be too difficult to devise legislation &mdash;and I know, Sir, that I am trespassing on your generosity here&mdash;to bring <Col N="403" /> about a situation in which a summons could be served in Northern Ireland without the necessity of applying to the court for liberty to serve out of the jurisdiction.  Similarly a civil bill could be served without the necessity of applying to the courts if the person was resident in Northern Ireland.  It is, as I said, a matter which could be a field for fruitful cooperation between the two parts and even if it were not forthcoming, it would be efficacious for our own legal system and for the better administration of justice generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only a few brief comments on this Estimate and to raise some matters which I raised over the past few years.  I should like to support Deputy Davern in his plea for some action by the Department of Justice in regard to houses for Gardaí.  It is true, of course, that in certain circumstances local authorities in certain areas have made available local authority houses to members of the Garda, but that has not been the practice and I do not think it would be too harsh for me to say that there are not a lot of local people who have sympathy with Gardaí generally who are seeking accommodation, in any case, the married Guards.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an admirable opportunity to do something in view of the recent Local Government legislation which established a housing trust whose function is to build houses which the local authority would not normally build in an area where there are new industries and an increase in employment.  They have also permission, I believe, to build for members of the Garda.  I know that this building cannot be done indiscriminately and I appreciate that it might not be proper to erect two or three houses in a small village solely for the Garda. I suggest, however, that in towns over a certain population a certain number of houses should be made available for these unfortunate people who, as has been described, though not by Deputy Davern, blow into a town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first two or three years they are nobody's children.  In the fourth year they become known.  They become <Col N="404" /> established socially.  Only then will they be considered for a house. Many a young married man, his wife and children, have been driven demented seeking proper accommodation for years.  They live in flats and broken down houses, accommodation quite unsuited to their occupation. When the Minister comes to wind up this debate I shall be pleased if he will tell us what steps will be taken by this new housing trust, established by the Minister for Local Government, to provide houses for members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Costello's plea for more traffic cops, or courtesy cops, in the city of Dublin.  They are much more effective than ordinary Gardaí on foot.  I committed a small offence recently and one of these traffic cops came after me and read the Riot Act. Mark you, I shall not offend again after the same fashion.  I upset the traffic.  This man told me where I had gone wrong.  I did not act deliberately or maliciously.  As far as I was concerned, he did much more good than an ordinary Garda who, because the offence appears to be trivial, does nothing about it; if he were to do anything, quite a good deal of time would be consumed in examining my taxation, licence, insurance certificate and so forth.  If there were more traffic cops people would become more traffic conscious.  Certainly my recent experience will result in a contribution, through me, towards making the general public in the city of Dublin especially a little bit more traffic conscious.  More traffic cops could be very effective.</P>
    <P>With regard to censorship of films, the Minister has indicated by way of reply to a Parliamentary Question that he appreciates the problem of suitable films for children.  He is anxious to do something, but he says there is not much more that he can do.  I believe in the sincerity with which he considered the problem but I believe also that he can do much more to guard youth against undesirable films.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking now of immoral or dirty films.  Some time ago there was mention in this House of a film entitled &ldquo;The Summer of the Seventeenth <Col N="405" /> Doll&rdquo;.  That was a film which carried in all its notices, except on the occasion to which Deputy Ryan referred here, the information that persons under 18 would not be admitted. Could not that tag be much more widely employed?  I saw that film and I do not believe it would do any harm to children because, whilst the theme was unchristian and un-Irish, the film would be entirely beyond the minds of young children.  There are other films to which young people gain access at matinées.  They are films which should not be shown to children at all.  Yet that type of film is shown every day in the week here in Dublin and in provincial towns to impressionable youngsters from 10 to 14 years of age.  It is fantastic that we should permit that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>People are afraid of their lives of the word &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;.  One would imagine we were the only country which had censorship.  They talk about the works of this great artist and that great artist, this great writer and that great writer.  We are told we are narrow-minded because we will not allow certain pictures and writings in here.  It is going altogether too far when we become so fearful of offending certain people.  The films to which I refer are all right for those who have passed adolescence.  I had occasion recently to take my children of 10 and 11 years of age to a film.  I thought the film was all right but I was certainly astonished when I actually saw it.  I took the children in good faith.  It was a film they should not have seen.</P>
    <P>Films are a legitimate part of our amusement.  They are an innocent amusement.  At the same time, it is vital that we should safeguard young children from danger.  I do not want to place entire responsibility on the Minister.  I do not expect him to do any more than he can do.  If it is possible, through the Censorship Board, to have this tag that children under 18 years of age will not be admitted then he should insist on the Censorship Board being a little bit more strict and insisting on the use of that tag much more frequently than it is used at present.  We do not really <Col N="406" /> get bad, dirty, immoral films here as far as adult censorship is concerned.</P>
    <P>My plea is directed towards ensuring that children of impressionable years will be protected.  Some may say that it is the duty of parents to safeguard their children.  Consider the tens of thousands of parents who, having endured their children the whole week, so to speak, are glad to give them 6d., 8d. or 1/- on a wet Saturday or Sunday afternoon to get them out of their sight for a couple of hours.  No one can blame parents for that.  As legislators, we have a duty, the Department of Justice has a duty, and the Censorship Board has a duty to ensure that the films these children see will not be such as to damage or incite young minds.</P>
    <P>Much the same arguments can be advanced against the cheap novels coming in here, the paperbacks.  I appreciate the Board's task but I am surprised to discover that only a few hundred of these books are censored. The Minister should explain to us how the Board operates.  As far as I can gather, the only books censored are those sent to the Board by some people who have a suspicion about the books. Last year there were something like 600 of these paperbacks censored. There are tens of thousands coming in.  Most of them should not be allowed in.  It would be a fultime task for dozens of people to censor all these books.</P>
    <P>If it is not the practice already, I suggest that if a book under the name of a particular writer finds its way into this country and is one which should be banned, all that writer's books or the publisher should be banned for a certain period.  It is impossible for the Censorship Board to read through all these books and determine whether or not they are fit for public consumption.  Let nobody misunderstand me.  I refer exclusively to these productions which are churned out in England, America, or some other place not for their story or literature but for the filth that is in them.  They are still coming into this country and either the writer or the publisher should be banned for a period or forever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> I would like the Minister to apply his mind to the problem of the treatment of boys of a certain age who commit petty offences.  Many of these boys prior to their teens get into trouble, steal from shops, do damage to public property and so on.  What happens to them is that they are prosecuted by a Garda and after a few weeks are brought before the district court.  These are not serious crimes. They are petty offences which I will not say are natural for children to commit but they hardly merit the serious trouble in which the wrongdoers are involved.  These children are very much affected by the situation which confronts them and their parents are worried and annoyed at the trouble the children have brought on them.</P>
    <P>I wonder does it do any real good, especially in respect of children between the ages of nine and 16 years, to bring them before the courts for these offences?  The offences to which I refer are regarded as petty crimes by the members of the Garda and I would suggest that the children concerned should be brought immediately before a member of the Garda of the rank of inspector or superintendent and given a warning.  To give the members of the Garda their due, there are many cases in which they do not prosecute at all, especially in cases such as I have mentioned&mdash; stealing apples, pulling at trees or breaking electric light bulbs.  No later than the other day I saw a member of the Garda reprimand a child of about eight years of age for some such misdemeanour.  That would have much more effect on a young boy than being brought to the district court three or four weeks afterwards.  The members of the Garda should have discretion to give a reprimand or a severe warning rather than have to bring children of a tender age to court.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that, I wish to make a suggestion to the Minister for Justice. Again it appears like placing on him responsibility which is not really his. As Minister for Justice he and his officials are charged with enforcing the law and that may appear to be <Col N="408" /> the be-all and end-all of their every activity in relation to such enforcement. I would suggest that lectures in civics be given frequently by members of the Garda in the various cities, towns and villages.  The boys and girls now growing up&mdash;and I suppose they are no different from what we were&mdash;are not civic-minded.  It should be sufficient to give one half-hour lecture per year to each class in the schools which would to a great extent eliminate the vandalism which is life.  Anybody looking around any provincial town will see ornamental trees or shrubs planted a short time ago broken down to the butt.  It is a great temptation to boys to take a pot-shot at electric light bulbs and cause other damage.  Such civic lectures, whether given by the Garda or by the teaching profession, would impress upon their minds that every time they damage property their parents have to pay for it through the rates.  I hope the Minister will convince his colleagues in the Government of the necessity for such lectures to ensure that our boys and girls will become more civic-minded.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters on this Estimate to which I should like to refer.  In common with other Deputies, I am glad the Minister has continued the law reform proposals initiated by the previous Government. Many of the changes made are most desirable and in many respects we in this country have lagged behind law reform generally.  I have no doubt that some of the reforms which are promised will be generally welcomed. Indeed, it is obvious that quite a considerable volume of work still remains to be done in that sphere.  There is, however, one matter which it seems to me could be considered in connection with proposals for reforms, that is, the modernisation of court procedure.  In the main, most of the procedure adopted here has been in operation for many years.  In fact, quite an amount of the procedure dates back before the beginning of the century, and, with changes that have taken place in the mode of life since then, there is a very strong case for a <Col N="409" /> more up to date approach to these problems.</P>
      <P>The changes required could, in the main, be carried out without legislation; in fact, administrative action is all that would be required.  The mere fact that the existing procedure has been in operation for many years is no reason it should continue in certain cases.  On the other hand, some of the procedures in operation could probably not be improved on.  I think the Minister in conjunction with the Attorney General, the judicature, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society might consider this matter.</P>
      <P>I mention it for this reason, that it is generally recognised that costs of litigation are extremely high.  Some of these costs are unavoidable.  Certain types of actions involve expenses that could probably not be lessened to any considerable extent, but where out of date procedure, such as the method in which actions are commenced, the filing of documents and so forth, is concerned, in these matters any reduction that could be justified, while at the same time affording all concerned a full opportunity of exercising their legal rights, would indeed be desirable.  Quite recently this matter was the subject of comment in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and some of the suggestions in that article were, I thought, certainly worth while considering.  So far as reforms are concerned, these are some of the matters which in the general consideration of reforms the Minister might bear in mind.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made in the course of this debate to the work of the Garda.  I would like to express the view that, in the main, the Garda, who do very good and satisfactory work, should concentrate on serious crime rather than on less serious offences.  I believe that in the main that is what is done by the force and that is the general line of policy laid down for all ranks.  It does seem to me, however, that there are certain matters that receive attention and indeed probably more attention than is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these is after-hours drinking. Where only technical breaches of the <Col N="410" /> law are involved, I do not think the aim should be to secure the conviction either of the publican or of the offender.  If, on the other hand, a situation developed in a particular premises or a particular district that had become or was likely to become a grave abuse, then it is obvious that the Garda should take whatever steps are necessary; but merely acting for the purpose of securing a conviction because a person is found on the premises a few minutes after closing time, which does not seem to me to be a very serious offence, is not desirable.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of parking offences.  If there were to be widespread disregard of the law, involving the blocking of traffic or hindering its free movement, it is undoubtedly a matter that requires attention, but the parking of a vehicle for a few minutes while a person transacts business adjacent to the place where the vehicle is parked does not seem to be a very grave offence and one which should be looked on in a serious light.  I do not want it to be inferred from these remarks that I condone breaches of either the parking regulations or the licensing laws, but discretion should be used in all these cases so that a proper approach is taken in enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a great deal in what has been said here, that young people are influenced to a considerable extent by films and will now be influenced by TV., and I believe that in a general desire over a period of years to approach young delinquents in a reasonable manner, we may have erred too far in that direction.  It is important, as Deputy Corish said, that they should not see films or shows that have a deleterious influence on them.  Undoubtedly people when they are young are more impressionable than when they have more experience.  Consequently, efforts should be made to see that, whether it is a film or any other form of entertainment, only those suitable for people of tender years should be shown to them.</P>
    <P>In so far as young offenders are concerned, there is a good deal to be said for the view expressed here that the re-introduction in certain cases of the birch might be justified.  It does not <Col N="411" /> mean that a decision of that sort should be regarded as cruelty, but there is a great deal in the old proverb that if you spare the rod, you may spoil the child.  Undoubtedly we live in an age in which there is less restraint, less respect for discipline, less respect for control, than formerly.  While we in this country have, I suppose, a historical antipathy to law and regulation for very good reasons, we are now responsible for administering our own laws and for securing respect for these laws as well as compliance with them. The need for such respect should be brought home to juveniles in the schools and wherever else it is possible to do so.  To that end, I believe some of the lectures which the Garda authorities have given from time to time have a most desirable effect and indeed a most useful one.  As I understand it, in certain cases classes have availed of these lectures and talks, and the beneficial results which flow from them are easily seen.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like to mention, that is, the appointment of temporary district justices. When we were in Government&mdash;and I believe the same view is held by the present Minister&mdash;it was always held to be undesirable that there should be temporary district justices.  While that was the view expressed, the practical application of it meant that some temporary district justices had to be appointed.  It seems to me that the proper approach to this question is that justices who are needed for a particular area for temporary duty should be appointed in a permanent capacity but should be movable so that they could be assigned to particular districts when the need arose.  That avoids the undesirable position in which a justice is temporary, but it also enables the Minister and the Department to assign a justice to a particular district or area for whatever period is necessary, when, because of sickness or arrears of work, an additional justice is required.  If a permanent vacancy arises, then a person who is a permanent justice but movable can be assigned to it.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that for a great <Col N="412" /> number of years, there have always been some temporary justices, it seems to me that the obvious solution is to appoint these justices permanently but to have them movable.  That will avoid the undesirable position in which, as occasionally happens, a temporary justice is not ultimately made permanent.  I suppose it is understandable, human nature being what it is, but it happens that circumstances arise in which, because of a change of Government or even a change of Minister, a justice who is temporary is not appointed to a permanent position.  I know that in the main most of the appointees have been made permanent.  It seems to me that the advantages of this proposal would outweigh any disadvantages, that it would be possible to make permanent appointments and at the same time have the justice available for whatever district he was needed in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three points to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I wonder if the Minister has recently had before him any reports about the illegal moneylending which is becoming quite rampant in several parts of this city?  We have a Moneylenders Act which imposes certain maximum rates of interest and prescribes certain rules and regulations for the practice of the business of moneylending; but it is fairly common knowledge in certain parts of this city that infringements of that Act are all too frequent.  I am referring in particular to the poorer parts of this city and the Corporation housing schemes where the dealer type of old woman&mdash;usually, if I may use a vulgar term, a &ldquo;targer&rdquo;&mdash;engages in illegal moneylending.  It is very difficult for the Garda to trace this breach of the law, but it is one in respect of which, I think, their powers should be strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual transaction is for a loan of £5.  Believe it or not, the usual rate of interest on that loan is £1 per week. The usual borrower is the wife of a workingman, perhaps in arrears with her rent, who borrows unknown to her husband.  It is because of that aspect of it that the lender is able to enforce <Col N="413" /> the ruthless terms she imposes.  The threat of telling the workman that his wife has borrowed from her is usually sufficiently effective to enforce the exorbitant rate of usury exacted.  It is a great source of evil, and in some ways it has contributed to the breaking-up of quite a few homes.  The police are aware of the problem but, to my mind, not enough has been done to arrest this development.</P>
    <P>One or two of my colleagues have adverted to the provision in the Estimate of aid for poor prisoners and have referred to the necessity for a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid. The legal system we operate here is the English one&mdash;happily for us, in my opinion, because it is a very fine system.  I believe that, perhaps because of our preoccupation with important material and economic considerations, we are less zealous in our concern for fundamental liberties and rights than the people of Britain.  It has long been the proud boast of that English legal system that all citizens are equal before the law; but 15 years ago the British Government recognised that that was a fallacy and that all citizens were no longer equal before the law. They therefore provided a system of free legal aid so that all people would be made equal before the law.</P>
    <P>The real fact of the matter is that in this country we have one law for the rich and another for the bulk of society who are not in a position to avail of their rights and privileges under the law.  Legal expenses have become exorbitantly high and, as Deputy Declan Costello pointed out, the only circumstances in which free legal aid is made available is in cases of the capital charge.  In the Dublin District Court, ejectment decrees for the possession of houses are being turned out as if out of a sausage machine.  We have the situation that unfortunate poor people are ignorant of their rights and much less are they in a position to defend their rights. In recent years we have brought through this House very fine Hire Purchase Acts restricting the rights of the lender to repossess goods out on hire purchase.  Of what use are such Acts if ignorant people are not aware of what <Col N="414" /> their rights are and are not in a position to enforce them?  From the point of view of social justice, I believe a very strong case can be made for introducing such a scheme and I would urge the Minister to give it his consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister has reported on the decline in criminal offences, particularly in Dublin city, and has also referred to the fact that he has during the past year increased the number of Gardaí in the city.  For many years prior to that, the number had declined, notwithstanding the vast increase in the population of the city and the area which Gardaí have to cover.  The Garda seem to rely to a very considerable extent on the patrol car as a means of enforcing the law.  I am not alone in my conviction that the patrol car can never be a substitute for the policeman on foot.  The psychological impact of the patrol-man's appearance in the street is considerable. It gives the law-abiding citizen a tremendous feeling of confidence in the law to see the Garda tramp by his front door, shake the gate to see if it is properly closed, flash his lamp into a porchway late at night.</P>
    <P>There are parts of Dublin where one very rarely sees a patrol man. There is a great problem in our Dublin flat schemes in relation to law enforcement.  I hope I am not being unfair or inaccurate, but I think it is true to say that the Guards will not, as a general rule or in ordinary circumstances, in the course of their patrols, enter into blocks of corporation flats just to look round to see that everything is all right.  In too many of the flat schemes, there is vandalism and rowdyism.  We must realise that these big schemes are almost communities in themselves. Neighbours constantly rush in and out of one another's homes and I think it is true that rowdyism is contagious in these places.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, as a Dublin Deputy, has had experience, as I have had, of the young husband or wife bringing up a young family and <Col N="415" /> coming to a Deputy and asking for help to get a transfer out of the block of flats in which they live because their children are subject to scandal and the example of rowdyism by others in the building.  It is like the old parable of the keg of rotten apples&mdash;one or two rowdies in a block of corporation flats can do untold harm.  If it is true, and I believe it is, that the Garda in the ordinary way will not enter these big communities, I think that should be rectified.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of parks and gardens.  Again, for some technical reason, I think, the Guards will not enter, except in exceptional circumstances. If I am wrong in that, I am sure the Minister will correct me.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the plea made by so many other speakers to the Minister that everything possible should be done to improve the conditions of the Garda.  We have heard too many examples of Gardaí living in conditions of squalor in barracks even in Dublin city.  Some of the older barracks are most uncomfortable places in which to reside.  Nowadays, we have in the Garda a splendid type of highly-educated young man and I think they regard their living conditions as equal in importance to their pay and prospects of promotion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave also referred to the need for improving the film censorship so as to prevent children from seeing undesirable films which may be suitable enough for adults.  I know the Minister is concerned about this problem and I must say that I have sympathy for him in regard to it because it must be very difficult to decide what should be done. The suggestion that films should be graded, which I think was made by Deputy Corish, can lend itself to exploitation. There are cinemas in Britain specialising in showing films marked &ldquo;For adults only.&rdquo;  They get an &ldquo;X&rdquo; certificate.  This certificate is exploited in a big way: one will even see films described as not sensational but &ldquo;sexsational&rdquo;&mdash;and a big X.  It is difficult to know what to do.  There is a great increase in the number of <Col N="416" /> horror films coming on the screens.  I suppose, with the growth of television here, there may be a trend towards the more exceptional type of film.  As a youngster aged 10 or 11, I remember seeing a rather horrific film which left me having nightmares for years afterwards. I feel there is a very strong case for restricting the showing of films to which Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave referred.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us if the Garda have any function in regard to the enforcement of the anti-litter bye-laws of Dublin Corporation.  I understand they have. If so, I am at a loss to know why those bye-laws are not being enforced. It costs Dublin Corporation more and more to endeavour to keep the city clean but they are not succeeding. There has been a slight improvement in recent months but notwithstanding that, the amount of litter scattered all over the city is really quite disgusting.</P>
    <P>At present we read of the expenditure which we are about to incur in decorating the city with flowers for the Patrician week next month and the visit of Princess Grace, but it seems to me that if we merely kept the city clean, we would be doing something worth while.  If the Garda can contribute in any way towards urging the citizens to respect their city, I think it should be done and, for my part, I would not be averse from the imposition of fines for spreading litter.  Now that Ban-Ghardaí are patrolling the city, it would seem to me to be a very proper function for them to perform, in a courteous way at first, to remind the citizen who scatters litter that he is breaking the law and then, after a few weeks or a few months, a few prosecutions might bring the litterbugs to heel.</P>
    <P>I had intended to say a word or two about the licensing laws but in view of the attitude of the Ceann Comhairle when Deputy Davern was speaking, I shall not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Deputies, would like to congratulate the Minister on his progress with law reform.  This is something which was introduced by his predecessor.  The former <Col N="417" /> Taoiseach, Deputy John A. Costello, gave it his personal consideration. I shall not single out members of the staff of the Department of Justice who have carried out considerable research in law reform but they have done a wonderful job.  I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has tackled this matter and on bringing forward legislation to the House.  I hope the Minister will not stop there.  There are some statutes on the Statute Book that we want to get rid of.  Some of the statutes which are invoked in our courts date back to Elizabethan days and should be wiped off the Statute Book. It is an insult to the Irish nation to have them there.  When we go to Croke Park on a Sunday to see an All-Ireland final or semi-final or any other intercounty game, we are breaking the law. That is not as it should be.  Steps should be taken quickly to wipe these obsolete Acts from the Statute Book and to give us all the respect we should have for the law and to ensure that all statutes of the State will be enforced in identical manner.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the appointment of judges.  In doing so, I do not wish to cast aspersions in any way on any judge of the Supreme Court or High Court or on any circuit court judge or district justice.  No matter how we may try or wish to eliminate it, we will have our judges appointed on their political affiliations.  I am not referring to the present Government; I am referring to all Governments since the institution of the State.</P>
      <P>Two things are wrong in that respect. I refer first to the superior courts from the circuit court up.  In the majority of cases, prior to their appointment, all judges have at some time or other been prosecutors for the State, with the result that they have a prosecution bias from the moment they get on the Bench.  They can never see the defence and sometimes are inclined to look on an accused or defendant as being guilty until proved innocent. That is a pity.  One can almost single out the judges who have not been appointed on account of their political affiliations by their method of summing up to a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in the appointment of district justice, there is political <Col N="418" /> patronage.  We will have it and there is not much use in decrying it here. The Minister has done it; his predecessors have done it down through the years; and I am sure his successors will do the same.  But, we could improve matters slightly.  I make this suggestion to the Minister, that before the appointment of a district justice, he should consult the Incorporated Law Society, or the Bar Council in the case of a barrister, to discover what is the professional standing of the individual.  Again, I am not referring to any particular appointment that has been made in the past.  If that suggestion is adopted, it will ensure that only justices and judges of a fairly high standing in their profession will receive these appointments. The Minister should seriously consider taking into his confidence the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council before making appointments to the Bench.</P>
    <P>On an Estimate, I may not advocate legislation but under recent legislation, a solicitor who is a district justice may become the chief district justice or President of the District Justices and he may be senior to a barrister who is a district justice in the ordinary district court area, but, despite being senior to the barrister who is a fellow district justice and who, possibly, has less experience on the Bench, the chief district justice is debarred from becoming a circuit court judge but one of the district justices inferior to him is entitled to become a circuit court judge and to be so appointed by the Minister.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look into that.  It should be possible to amend it.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like the Minister to look into is this.  Some 30 years ago an effort was made in our district courts to appoint district justices with a knowledge of Irish to Irish-speaking districts.  Apparently we have forgotten all about that and district justices are now appearing in district courts who require an interpreter when they preside in an Irish-speaking district.  I do not think that is right.  There should be a sufficient number of district justices with a <Col N="419" /> knowledge of Irish who could be assigned to Irish-speaking areas so that the old system may be revived whereby we encouraged litigants, Garda and professional men to use our language in the courts.  We make it a condition precedent to their appointment to the profession that they should have a knowledge of the Irish language.  Why stop there? Why not encourage them to continue using the Irish language?  It would be a very good thing if the Minister could see his way to assign only Irish-speaking district justices to Irish-speaking areas.</P>
    <P>I remember practising in a district court in an Irish-speaking area where entire cases were heard through the medium of Irish.  Advocates addressed the court, district justices questioned witnesses, Gardaí examined and cross-examined, solicitors examined and cross-examined, through the medium of the Irish language.  It is years now since I have seen it.  It is a tragedy. The Minister should look into the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  It is the cluttering up of business in our courts, particularly our district courts.  Under a recent decision of one of the superior courts, it is necessary for a district justice to enter personally in the Order Book his decision on a particular case and to do it at the time of coming to his decision.  That has completely slowed up business in the district court.  The district court is the only court in which that is required to be done.  The result is that a justice dealing with twenty cases of unlighted bicycles has to spend five or ten minutes writing in his order.  A district court clerk is employed for that purpose.  It is the Minister's duty to see that alternative arrangements are made whereby it will suffice if the district court clerk enters the order and the justice signs it later. It would save considerable time and would enable litigants and all others having business in the district courts to get out of the courts much earlier. Quite recently, I was present in a district court which sat at 11 a.m. and finished at 9.40 p.m. with a break of <Col N="420" /> three-quarters of an hour for lunch. That is very unfair to the district justice.  It is very unfair to litigants, to professional men and Gardaí who have to spend all the time in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We get out before closing time.  I do not mean we were sitting in those premises.  It is very unfair to a district justice that, in addition to having to give serious thought to dispensing justice to litigants, the prosecution and the defence he should be concerned with entering up the Order Book.  The district court clerk could do that.  In that way the work would be done much more quickly.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister introduced a new system of circuits for our circuit courts.  I would ask him to pay particular attention to the matter of ascertaining whether they are working out satisfactorily or otherwise.  I know that some judges are at the moment finding themselves falling into arrears of work simply because they are being inundated with litigation as a result of their being unable to devote sufficient time to each circuit town in which they sit.  I particularly refer to the new northern circuit where we have a most hard-working and industrious circuit court judge.  I do not know if he will be able to stand up to the strain having regard to the time he is expected to spend in the various towns in the circuit.  That is something of which the Minister should take particular note.  We do not want to fall back into the old position of having considerable arrears in our circuit courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies paid compliments to the Garda and I should like to join with them.  I should like, first of all, to compliment the Commissioner on the high example and standard he has set to the men under him.  I think he is a credit to the force.  He was not an ordinary recruit.  When he came in, he was comparatively advanced in years.  He came into the force from the Department of Justice.  If he had come up through the force, he could not have been more successful in his <Col N="421" /> work.  I should like to compliment him upon the manner in which he has turned out recruits.</P>
    <P>If I refer to a few points, it is not by way of general criticism.  They are the exception rather than the rule. I think more attention should be given to the teaching of the law of evidence to our Garda recruits.  On many occasions we find in our district courts that very vital evidence for the prosecution is ruled out simply because the Garda slipped in something which is not evidence.  They appear to be completely ignorant&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; is too strong a word&mdash;of the law of evidence.  They appear to have only the bare rudiments of the law of evidence.  I think some more attention should be given, not only to the recruits but to some officers in the force.  Let them be given lessons possibly by men more experienced in the law of evidence.  It would be of considerable assistance to them in later years when they go out the country or appear in our courts and find themselves opposed to trained professional men.</P>
    <P>A very bad system has grown up in recent years.  When I say &ldquo;in recent years&rdquo;, I am referring to the period over the past 20 years.  It is something which has worried me and many lawyers throughout the State.  That is prior consultation between officers of the Garda and sometimes State solicitors with district justices, circuit court and high court judges.  I think it is a deplorable thing that any justice should be put in the position that a file should be placed at his disposal before he hears the defence or before he actually hears the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>That has happened and it is a very bad thing.  I think it should go out through the Minister and the Attorney General's office that there should be no such thing as prior consultation between a district justice, a Garda superintendent or a State solicitor.  That is prejudicial to justice.  It is unfair to the defence. It is something that should be guarded against.  I am not saying for one second that district justices are influenced by seeing these files.  I am not saying that the circuit or high court judges <Col N="422" /> are influenced but it is unfair to them. Human nature is human nature and if they know in advance that a man has been previously convicted of crime, despite the fact that he is innocent until proved guilty his bad past is always at the back of their heads.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister in any way for it.  I do not say that it has crept in in his time; it has crept in over the past 20 years.  It is something of which we all have personal experience. We are all aware of it.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate the position in which we are, for reasons which are very obvious.  There are places where we cannot draw attention to it but this is one where we can.  I do not wish to say anything more about it.  It is a very bad system.  It is very bad particularly from a defence point of view.</P>
    <P>I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner on the new arm of the force, namely, the Ban-Gharda.  I think they are a credit to the Garda. They are following in the tradition of the male members of the force.  They are living up to the very high standards set by their fellow Gardaí.  Many of us have seen what corresponds to the Ban-Gharda in other countries.  I think that our lady members bear favourable comparison with them.  I understand the Ban-Gharda are being sent to Cork, later possibly to Limerick and I hope eventually to Galway, Sligo, Waterford and the other large towns throughout the State.  Other major towns throughout the State will have the benefit of being policed by these very fine specimens of womanhood, many of whom come from Donegal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made an appeal to the Minister for an increased rate of pay for the Garda and I should like to join with him.  I should like to see parity in pay between the Garda and members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. We sometimes deplore the fact that we find it necessary to have such a force in the thirty-two counties. Let me say that I have considerable experience of the R.U.C.  I do not know whether this is the appropriate place to say it but they are as fine a body of men as I ever met.  They <Col N="423" /> are the most courteous police officers that I have come across and bear favourable comparison, indeed, with cross-Channel police and our own.  I should like to see parity of pay amongst the members of the police forces, if at all possible.  I know the Minister is doing his utmost to improve the living quarters of the Garda. I hope he will be successful in having their living quarters improved and brought up to the standard which they deserve.</P>
    <P>We introduce new legislation in this House, and when it becomes law, there is sometimes a tendency on the part of the Garda to rush out to enforce it immediately.  I think that is wrong. Last year, we passed the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, and to my own knowledge, in my own county, within the first three weeks of the passing of that Act, there were nine prosecutions of publicans caught 15 minutes after closing time.  I believe that in the first case, a warning that new legislation has been introduced and will be enforced would have sufficed for the first month or so, because a second conviction is now a very serious matter. A second conviction carries an endorsement and that is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>Convictions imposed in the first month or the first three weeks&mdash;in one case I know of, within ten days of the passing of the new Act&mdash;may have very serious consequences in later years.  I know that the Minister went on the air and informed the public that the Act would be enforced, but you cannot change the character of the Irish people overnight.  We had been lackadaisical in so far as the enforcement of the licensing laws was concerned, and they were more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  Unfortunately, it takes a little more than the Minister's speech on the radio, or possibly our own speeches here, to bring home to the people in the country that the Minister and the Garda mean business.  The Garda might have been a little more lenient.  They might have endeavoured to educate the people in the new hours rather than to ensure their enforcement.  Possibly that might <Col N="424" /> have proved useful and we would not have the outcry against the licensing laws which we now have.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to film censorship. The Minister will have to give very serious consideration to that matter from now on.  While we know it is possible for the Minister to ensure that films and other shows on television will be properly censored, unfortunately he has no control whatever over the programmes shown from the six north eastern counties, or from across the water.  I think that is a matter which could be grappled with by an exchange of views between the Governments controlling Great Britain and the Six Counties and our Government.  It might be possible to set up an internation film censorship for what we might describe as the British Isles and Ireland. If that could be done, it would be a very good thing.  There is not much use in our having a very strict censorship here if, by merely twiddling a knob, we can look at a film which our censor would reject at first view.  That is something with which we will have to grapple if we are to make any use of film censorship, as I respectfully think we should.</P>
    <P>It might be possible for the Minister, through the Minister for External Affairs perhaps to give serious consideration to that matter, particularly in relation to juveniles.  We know the B.B.C. issue a warning that juveniles should not be permitted to view certain programmes.  It might be possible by consultation between the B.B.C. and Radio Eireann to arrange that certain programmes will be shown at certain hours.  That, in itself, might be of great assistance in the enforcement of our censorship.</P>
    <P>On each occasion on which I have spoken in this House on this Estimate, I have either begun or concluded by complimenting the Minister on the manner in which he has conducted his Department, and on the courtesy he has shown to the public and to Deputies.  I am sorry, indeed, that on this occasion I cannot do so and I am referring to two particular instances. With the exception of the Garda, there is no other body in this State more concerned in the appointment of peace <Col N="425" /> commissioners than the legal profession, because they are in closest contact with them.</P>
    <P>Some time last year, it was brought to my notice in my own home town that there was a shortage of peace commissioners. We had lost three peace commissioners in the then recent past. I was asked to recommend three candidates to the Minister and I selected three most respected men.  Definitely, two of them had political views which were the same as mine, but they were above reproach.  The third man was non-political and he was also above reproach.  They were three businessmen in the town of Dungloe.  I must say, if I may say so, that for my own convenience and the convenience of my colleagues in the town, I wanted those men who would be permanently available appointed.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister submitting the three names.  I received an acknowledgment but I heard nothing further until I read in the local paper, some two months after, that three other men had been appointed.  I am not saying one word against the characters of the three men who were appointed. Their politics were Fianna Fáil and the Minister was entitled to appoint them, if he wanted to do so, but he might have had the courtesy to tell me that the three applicants whose names I submitted were not acceptable to him.  If I had received such a letter, I would have been quite satisfied, but the first indication I had that the gentlemen whose names I had submitted had been turned down was when I read in the local paper that three other gentlemen, as highly respected as the men I had recommended, had been appointed.  I look upon that as discourtesy to myself.</P>
    <P>Again, late last year in the town of Ardara, a peace commissioner, a member of the Church of Ireland, died.  I was asked to recommend another member of that congregation as peace commissioner to succeed him.  I was unaware then and am still unaware of the politics of the man I recommended. I wrote a letter to the Minister and recommended this man in view of his religious persuasion, and in view of the fact that there was a small minority <Col N="426" /> of Church of Ireland people in the Ardara area.  I thought that out of courtesy to them, a member of the Church of Ireland should be appointed as peace commissioner.</P>
    <P>I received an akknowledgment from the Minister and I heard nothing further until I read in the paper that a Catholic had been appointed to succeed the member of the Church of Ireland who had died.  I think that was discourtesy to me in person.  These appointments were essential not only to the Garda but to me in my professional capacity as a solicitor.  I went to the trouble of selecting men I thought would honour and respect the trust which the Minister would repose in them by appointing them as peace commissioners, and it was disappointing that they were turned down.  I do not think such action is calculated to show the religious minorities that we respect them as we should.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, and let me conclude on it.  I remember that when a member of the Garda met a peace commissioner he accorded him the honour and respect due to a peace commissioner by saluting him.  When a member of the Garda met a Minister of State, a Deputy, a clergyman, an Army officer or a judge of the courts he saluted him.  That is something of the past.  Deputies, Ministers, peace commissioners, and others, no longer receive that sign of respect.  I am all against what is known in the British Army and all armies as &ldquo;bull&rdquo; but I am all in favour of respect.  I think it is bad that such a practice is not continued. I do not blame the Gardaí. I do not think it is part of the curriculum of their training.  I think it is a pity.  It is a sign and a mark of respect that we should not drop.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has run his Department, with the two exceptions I have mentioned.  I have found him at all times to be a most courteous Minister, a Minister who treated with respect any point of view placed before him. I hope that while he remains Minister for Justice, he will continue to conduct his Department in the same manner as at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, I thought he was speaking from the other side of the House because he congratulated the Minister so often on the work he is doing.  However, I am in perfect agreement with what he says in that regard.</P>
      <P>He must be a very innocent politician if he thinks that because he recommends certain people, no matter how respectable they may be, for appointment as peace commissioners, they should be appointed.  I am very much afraid that the very fact of his recommending them causes them to fall at the first fence.  I am sure that it is the privilege of a Government to appoint peace commissioners, judges, district justices, and so on, in accordance with the wishes of that Government. Of course, they are really political appointments.  I do not think that that should be so.  However, I cannot see any way under the present Constitution by which that can be changed.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell also referred to the appointment of Irish-speaking justices to Irish-speaking areas.  That is a matter, too, that requires consideration. If an Irish-speaking justice or solicitor or whatever he may be from Donegal or anywhere in the North came south and was appointed, say, in Kerry, he certainly would not understand the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor the English, either, perhaps.  They have a peculiar intonation up there in the North. Neither would they in Donegal understand a solicitor or some legal luminary from Kerry or anywhere in the South. The same obtains in respect of Leinster and Connaught.  Therefore, the Minister would be well advised if he has any appointments to make during the remainder of his term of office to consider that point.  It is essential that where vacancies arise in Munster, Leinster, Connaught or Ulster, legal individuals from these particular areas be appointed who will understand the dialect of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and all other Deputies in this debate praised the Garda Síochána, the old Garda and the new Garda.  Certainly, in any <Col N="428" /> country where you want law and order respected, you must respect those who enforce it.  In connection with the parking of cars in this city and even in towns down the country, I have seen difficulties arise.  A very respectable citizen may be held up because for some reason he could not get a parking place.  Perhaps his wife or some member of his family wants to go into a shop and he is just holding on for a few moments while she or some other member of the family is inside.  He cannot find a parking place.  A young Garda or even an old Garda will come up to him and give him a lecture.  A lady may be at the wheel of a car.  Her husband may be doing the shopping or looking after some other business.  In the end, the lady or gentleman at the wheel will feel a criminal because of the lecture which is delivered by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I saw an example in a certain town in south Kerry recently when I was standing by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>You should have told him who you were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think that would be right.  A professional man pulled up his car and could not find a parking place.  Motor cars were parked on either side of a pretty narrow street.  His wife was going into a shop for a few minutes.  A young Garda came along and lectured him down the banks, asked him why he should pull up there.  He was there for just a few minutes.  I overheard that.  I do not know who the Garda was but I inquired who the gentleman in the car was.  I found he was a professional man.  He felt the fact that he was pulled up and lectured by the Garda very keenly as I am sure I would or any of us would.  That sort of thing can happen when country people come up to town, driving their cars.  I know that when I first came up here driving my car, I got into very serious trouble.  However, I found that the Gardaí were very reasonable.  They would be in the city, I am sure, because they understand the difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>They recognise somebody from the far distant north when they hear the accent.  The Garda should be reasonable in that respect. Those people do not mean to offend against the law.  They cannot help it.</P>
      <P>I often thought something should be done in connection with the taking of the oath.  I do not know exactly what can be done about it.  Certainly it is responsible for wholesale perjury. Most of our people take the oath, having their case already made up in their minds.  They never realise the sin of which they are guilty by telling untruths after taking the oath.  I believe that to save them from that, it would be just as well to abolish the taking of the oath.</P>
      <P>The erection and maintenance of courthouses I think is a duty of the local authority but the responsibility should lie with the Department of Justice and not the local authority.</P>
      <P>I was never in favour of the appointment of the Ban-Gharda but I understand that, since they were appointed, they have performed a useful function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to say that something should be done about pedestrians and cyclists on the roads at night-time.  In fact, I do not know whether pedestrians are supposed to keep to the right side of the road but they are supposed I think to walk to meet oncoming traffic.  That may be all right but in the ordinary way pedestrians walk on the left hand side of the road and at night-time they are in continual danger from oncoming traffic.  They should walk one way or the other; people should be directed to keep either to the right side or to the left.  Above all, cyclists should be warned that at night-time they should have reflectors or lights to warn oncoming traffic.  Anyone driving a car at night-time knows that a pedestrian or a cyclist on the road is in danger, especially when there is an oncoming car with bright headlights and there is nothing to indicate his presence to another car following.  I <Col N="430" /> am sure many accidents occur in that way.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues I also have nothing but praise for the Minister for Justice.  Since he was appointed, he has been always most courteous to us even when we approached him to reduce fines, especially on poteen makers in Donegal or Kerry.  He has always listened to our case and if necessary has reduced fines or made representations to the Revenue Commissioners to do so.  So far as we on this side of the House are concerned, and I am sure I can speak for the whole Party, we are quite pleased with the Minister and, if returned to office, we hope that he will carry out his duties in the future as he has done in the past.  We are very grateful to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general trend of this debate has, to my mind, been quite satisfactory. I should like to preface what I intend to say by remarking that I have no objection to criticism, however severe it may be, but I do object to the type of destructive criticism indulged in by Deputy McGilligan when he initiated the discussion following my opening statement.  I have always found criticism very helpful.  On numerous occasions I have utilised the views of Deputies from all sides of the House when I wanted to induce the Government to take a particular line of action. Therefore I always welcomed discussion on any subject with which I was concerned and however my administration was criticised, so long as it was fair criticism, I welcomed it. I certainly do not, however, welcome the type of carping, cavilling criticism with which Deputy McGilligan began the debate.  I have no doubt that he led off with the hope and intention of inducing those of his colleagues who would follow him to take that lead.  I must say to their credit that, with the exception of Deputy Ryan, that line was completely ignored and most of the criticism of the Estimate was fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I stated in my opening remarks that there was a decrease in crime and an increase in the detection of crime, Deputy McGilligan appeared to suggest that such was not the case. <Col N="431" /> We have statistics to prove that the figures for the year just ended were, I think, 14 per cent. lower than the previous year, and that the detection of crime was ten per cent. higher.  That position was not brought about just by accident.  It was brought about by the detailed organisation of the Garda, by the introduction of separate and newer methods and by greater attention to detail by the members of the Garda. I can only express the hope that when this Estimate is taken again next year, whoever will be acting as Minister for Justice will be in the same position as I was this year and will be able to state that crime has diminished and the detection of crime has increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also tried to belittle the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  That was an Act which was a definite step forward in an effort to bring about better conditions in regard to the treatment of prisoners.  Quite a number of prisoners undergoing sentence were enabled to go out on parole when a bereavement occurred in their families and at the same time we were in the happy position of releasing quite a number of prisoners for the Christmas period. The enactment of that measure deserved some little credit instead of being written off, as everything contained in the Estimate was written off by Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    <P>He next dealt with that portion of my speech which treated of the achievement in the field of law reform. The promotion of the Courts of Justice Bill and the Civil Liability Bill was completely ignored by him.  The enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill he characterised as causing confusion, disappointment and agitation.  Whatever one may think about the effectiveness, or otherwise, of the licensing laws before the enactment of the latest piece of legislation, there is one thing on which we can all agree: that legislation has brought about a better and healthier condition throughout the country as compared with the situation which obtained previously in which there was practically no respect for the licensing laws.  In a situation in which one law meets with nothing <Col N="432" /> but disrespect, the danger always is that other laws will receive in time the same scant consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made complaint about the Rule-Making Committee. He said it had failed to furnish annual reports in compliance with the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act.  I am informed the Committee are not inactive.  A sub-committee is dealing with the Superior Rules Committee. Energetic preparation is being made for new rules in relation to the Supreme Court.  There is certainly progress there.</P>
    <P>There is no truth in the suggestion that there is a big wastage in the Garda Síochána because of men leaving to join foreign police forces.  On 22nd March of this year, I informed the House that up to 28th February, 1961, the number who resigned was only 37.  A very small percentage, two or three per cent, resigned to join a foreign police force.  The statement that there was a big wastage in the Garda is without foundation.</P>
    <P>I do not object to fair criticism, but I do object to the type of criticism in which groundless charges are levelled. Deputy McGilligan went out of his way to describe the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Justice as a &ldquo;job&rdquo;.  He emphasised his statement by describing the &ldquo;job&rdquo; as &ldquo;a job in the worst sense.&rdquo;  I want to make the position very clear now in relation to that particular appointment. The Taoiseach was charged with making the &ldquo;job&rdquo;.  Let me give the House the history and, as the House will see, the history of the appointment completely refutes the baseless allegation.</P>
    <P>In 1957, when we returned to office, the Taoiseach instructed us to find out what legislation was required in our respective Departments and what legislation should be enacted forthwith. Acting on that instruction, I went into the Department of Justice.  I discussed the situation with the Secretary and, having assessed the position, I gave certain instructions as to what we should deal with there and then.  One of the first pieces of legislation was that dealing with the establishment of the Courts of Justice.  The courts were actually operating under a Constitution <Col N="433" /> which was no longer operative.  It was our anxiety to ensure that the courts should be properly constituted under the Constitution of 1937.  That was the purpose of the Bill introduced here.</P>
    <P>As well as that, there were other matters requiring attention.  There was the report of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission, a voluminous report, which had to be studied by me before I could submit anything in the nature of recommendations to the Government.  That took a considerable time.  When the report was printed and circulated, it was brought before the Government and the recommendations were discussed over a period of more than 12 months.  I do not suggest that they were discussed continuously, but they were discussed over that period.  All the time I was receiving deputations in Government Buildings and here in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>Added to that, there were the ordinary domestic day-to-day administrative matters of the Department in relation to the police, to prisons, and so on.  I was concerned in a continuous task.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill was introduced here in 1959.  It was debated over a period of eight months.  All the time I was being inundated with other pieces of legislation which I was trying to produce for the Government.  As Deputy O'Donnell will appreciate&mdash;he was a Minister&mdash;when a Bill is in draft and brought before the Government for consideration, it is the duty of the Minister in charge to inform the Government on the subject and to advise them.  The Minister is responsible for helping the Government to make their decisions.  Those decisions may not be acceptable to the Minister, but he must play his part in giving all the advice he can to help the Government to come to a decision.</P>
    <P>In the course of that pressure of work, though feeling ill, I continued to pilot the Bill right up to the Christmas Recess.  I had a very bad cold and I was advised by my doctor not to attempt to continue piloting the measure.  When the House rose I was confined to bed and had the doctor <Col N="434" /> called in.  I was advised I had pneumonia.  Out of that came other complications which necessitated my going into a nursing home for a period.  When I came out, the Dáil was resuming and I attempted to take on the Committee Stage of the Bill against doctor's orders.  Deputies are fully aware that in the course of that work I had to be assisted from the House due to a weakness which overcame me as a result of the excess of work.</P>
    <P>When that occurred I went to the Taoiseach and appealed to him to give me help.  I told him that if he could not, I was prepared to resign. The Taoiseach discussed that point with me and eventually thought he could help by assigning to me the Minister for Lands who was regarded as an expert in licensing laws.  That was not of much advantage because the Minister for Lands had his own Department to look after and eventually his help was not available.  It was then I pressed the Taoiseach for a Parliamentary Secretary and told him the benefits I thought would arise from such an arrangement.  Amongst the arguments which convinced me it would be a useful appointment was that at the time the Department had something like ten pieces of legislation in an advanced state of preparation and that if I had a Parliamentary Secretary he could take business up to the Seanad while I was dealing with other business here and when the Parliamentary Secretary was finished in the Seanad he could come to the Dáil and I could go to the Seanad and that that could go on until these various pieces of legislation had been enacted.  That was how the Parliamentary Secretary came to be appointed.</P>
    <P>There was no question of a job, good bad or indifferent.  When the Taoiseach asked me had I anyone in mind for that position, I said I would be very grateful if I could have Deputy Haughey who was a colleague in the same constituency as myself and whom I knew to be a very talented young man with legal degrees.  The Taoiseach was very loath to do that but eventually I convinced him that it <Col N="435" /> would be desirable.  He had the moral courage to do something he knew would be misinterpreted by that mean type of mind that is always inclined to take the wrong view of a matter of that kind.  I hope when the time comes the Taoiseach will have the moral courage again to do what he should do and that would be to appoint him to the office of Minister if he should be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>In that regard I want to say that this Estimate will be the last I shall have the privilege of bringing before the House because it is not my intention to contest the next general election. Therefore I think when the Taoiseach stated to this House that the position of Parliamentary Secretary would be a temporary one he had that in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Taoiseach it was not my intention to go beyond the life of the present Dáil.  It is regrettable that I have to speak in this way on what is the last occasion on which I shall be taking the Estimate for my Department, but it is necessary and desirable that a situation of that kind be clarified.  I have endeavoured to make it clear to the decent-minded Deputies of this House that the statement that this was a job in the worst sense of the word, was unfair and unjustified.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies raised the question of the rent that young members of the Garda are induced to pay.  They also raised the question of accommodation. I wish to clarify the position in regard to the alteration in the pay structure of the Garda and I can best do it by reading this statement to the House, because there is an amount of grave misrepresentation taking place which is not confined to verbal expression but has been printed in the various newspapers. Therefore it is desirable to have all the facts presented to the public so that the significance of the alteration can be properly appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This alteration was not as people seem to think, a revision of the rates of pay for the various ranks of the <Col N="436" /> Force: such a revision, under which substantial pay increases were granted, took place within the last twelve months.  The alteration simply meant that a non-pensionable allowance became consolidated with pay and that as a result the allowance became pensionable.  Nor was it a change which was foisted on an unwilling Force.  It was one which has been advocated by the several Garda Representative Bodies practically since the inception of the Force.  And it was brought about through the machinery of the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration scheme, a scheme which also had been the objective of the Garda Representative Bodies for several years and which objective had been achieved only as recently as June 1959.  This scheme was set up to provide a means acceptable to Government and the Garda Síochána for the determination of claims and proposals relating to certain conditions of service of the Force.  It covers all ranks up to and including Chief Superintendent.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the Garda Síochána Vote Estimate Garda remuneration is comprised of several allowances as well as pay.  Until the recent change one such allowance, known as rent allowance, was paid to any member for whom, or, if he was married, for whose family, free quarters either were not available or were available but not suitable for occupation.  The amount of the allowance varied according to place of location and, in the case of Sergeants and Guards, the maximum rates ranged from £27 4s. 6d. to £61 17s. 6d. per annum.  This allowance was non-pensionable and, as I have already said, the Garda Representative Bodies had been making strong and frequent representations over the years to have it recognised as a pensionable emolument. As conditions of service in neighbouring police forces are so often cited for comparison purposes, I think it pertinent to mention that in Great Britain the consolidation of housing emolument with pay is still only a possibility of the future.  In fact, the Royal Commission on the Police, in its interim report published in November last, stated that they did not consider a strong case had been <Col N="437" /> made for disturbing existing arrangements and that they were not recommending consolidation.</P>
    <P>When the Garda Representative Bodies last made proposals regarding rent allowance, the matter fell to be considered under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  These proposals, which comprised a claim for revised rent allowances and a claim for pensionability of rent allowances, were decided at conciliation level.  As a result of their deliberations, the Conciliation Council, the Garda Representatives on which were one chief superintendent, one superintendent and two members of Garda rank, submitted an agreed report, the acceptance of which by the Ministers for Justice and Finance has brought about the new pay structure.  The agreed report recommended that the non-pensionable rent allowance be abolished and that instead there should be a consolidated rate of pay which would include a pensionable element in respect of the rent allowance and which would be subject to a deduction in respect of the occupation of free quarters.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the elements recommended for inclusion were £65 for sergeant and Guards, £80 for inspectors and £110 for superintendents and chief superintendents.  The amounts of the deduction recommended in respect of free quarters represents four-fifths of the additions to pay.</P>
    <P>The formula recommended and now given statutory effect is based on a simple pattern of uniformity and, in this, it follows the principles governing pay, pension and conditions of service.  It does not differentiate between members of the same rank in the matter of their outgoings on accommodation nor does it purport to assess the value of free quarters.  Clearly the Garda representatives on the council must have recognised that, having regard to varying rates of rent allowances, the different standards of official accommodation available and the differing costs of housing throughout the State, it would be practically impossible to produce a workable scheme which would give proper consideration to these factors, and that any hope of realisation of their ambitions <Col N="438" /> must lie in an arrangement in the nature of a package deal which, while conferring equal benefits in the matters of pension, would prove less beneficial to some than to others in the matters of pay and might in fact affect adversely the pay of a minor proportion of the members.</P>
    <P>This situation could arise in the case of a member in official quarters who had previously enjoyed tax-free accommodation but was now receiving an addition to pay which was subject to income-tax, the amount of which, if the member was not entitled to claim sufficient tax reliefs, could exceed by a few pounds the difference between the total amount of the addition and the amount to be deducted for the official quarters.  But in any package deal there is some rough with the smooth, and this is the &ldquo;rough&rdquo; aspect which is being highlighted in the papers while the real benefits are only touched upon.</P>
    <P>A large number will benefit substantially in pay as a result of the change.  Over 650 sergeants and Guards will receive an addition of more than £33 in the year and over 1,200 will be getting not less than £27 10s. more.  Altogether, the annual cost of the additional pay benefits flowing from the change will be around £134,000.  About another £50,000 will be needed in the 1961/62 financial year to cover the cost of the increased pensions and gratuities, and in eight years' time the annual cost under this heading will have risen to £150,000.  The consolidation of rent allowance with pay can be appreciated by illustrating its effect on a Garda member who is entitled to retire with the maximum pension and gratuity, i.e., a Garda who has 33 years' service. If there had been no change, the Garda would get an annual pension of £292 and a gratuity of £976 14s. 9d. With the change, he is now entitled to receive an annual pension of £324 11s. 9d. and a gratuity of £1,085 14s. 11d.  In the case of a Garda member whose pension conditions do not provide for a gratuity, the maximum pension, which is payable after 30 years' service, was £389 6s. 8d. under the old system and this has now been increased to £432 15s. 8d. <Col N="439" /> That goes to show the benefits which the ordinary members of the Garda are gaining as a result of the discussions which took place under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the House that the Garda authorities have, for 30 years, been advocating this change to having their claims decided not by the will of a Minister or by the Government but through the medium of a conciliation and arbitration board, and, as I say, I had the privilege and the honour of being able to induce my colleagues of the Government to grant that to the Garda.  They have already, as members of the House will know, received a rise in pay as a result of the arbitration, and as a result of conciliation, they have secured this particular benefit of their conditions.  I do not think then that they have very much to grumble about.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that, as I mentioned in the beginning, some Guards had £27 10s. and others had up to £62.  That was the way the figures ranged up and down.  Now all get the flat rate of £65, no matter where they are living, whether in rural Ireland or in a city or in the capital of the country. So when Deputies talk now about urging the Minister to do something about increasing the pay of the Garda, the Minister's reply will always have to be to insist that this is a matter now to be carried out under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  That is the position to-day, and that is the reply I have to make to all those Deputies who advocated in the course of the discussion increases in the pay or standards of accommodation of the Garda.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies also referred to the closing of Garda stations throughout the country.  I want to make the position in regard to that pretty clear.  The criticism has been made of the tendency to close a number of Garda stations or reduce the number of men attached to them.  I should like to make it clear that police efficiency is the dominant consideration in these cases.  Before any change is made, a very careful survey is carried out and regard is had to crime statistics</P>
    <P>A reduction in strength is made only in areas virtually free of serious crime. <Col N="440" /> Where changes are made, the Commissioner is satisfied in advance that the new arrangements will not impair police efficiency in any way.  Further, the new system is watched carefully and if experience should show that the change militated against efficiency I would have no hesitation in arranging for an increase in the Garda strength in a particular place.  The Minister can always keep his eye on the position when Garda stations are reduced in strength.  If the arrangement is found not to be working as efficiently as the Commissioner thought it would, the old position can be reverted to.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by a number of Deputies to Garda accommodation, which was stated to be unsatisfactory. I must admit I am not very happy about the state of accommodation in quite a number of Garda stations, and I have been taking a very strong personal interest in the question.  I must admit, too, that the progress I have made has not been as much as I would have liked.  That is another matter which has been given to the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with, and I am satisfied he is very active and is responding to the pressure I am putting on him to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to housing accommodation.  Deputy Corish suggested we should do something about bringing in Local Government. That has been done.  We actually have a scheme now, which will be very shortly in operation, in which a company will be formed under the auspices of the Department of Local Government and will build houses specially for the Garda.  In future, Garda stations to replace old stations may have accommodation, perhaps, for single men and a house on each side which will be made available to married members of the Force.</P>

      <P>That is a matter <Col N="441" /> which will be dealt with by this company. It was one of the reliefs which we felt could operate more efficiently than if the Minister himself tried to get something done.  Now we hope to have a system whereby these houses will be built by this organisation at the request of the Department of Justice. I feel pretty certain we shall get results. Of course, it will take a little time because new buildings will have to be commenced.  However, we are hoping for the best.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Lemass and a number of other Deputies talked about the desirability of extending the retiring age in the case of Gardaí who had given national service.  The present position is that chief superintendents, superintendents, inspectors, sergeants and Gardaí who hold service certificates under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1934, or who are in possession of the 1916 medal with bar, have a retiring age of 65.  I cannot meet the request of the Deputies who have been urging me to give this distinction to all members of the Garda with I.R.A. service. First, the number would be too large; and, secondly, we do not want to block promotions and vacancies which would occur in the normal way by keeping on men until they are 65.  From the physical point of view, I do not think they should be asked at that age to deal with some of the hard work often confronting Gardaí.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Lemass also felt we should have mounted police.  I do not think we could concede that request.  It might be very spectacular and it might add to our ceremonial.  The fact remains, however, that it would be a very costly innovation, and the Minister for Justice cannot get money simply to expend on ceremonials; it must be for effective work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noel Lemass also raised the matter of park rangers.  The fact that there is little or no protection within <Col N="442" /> public parks has been raised here on a number of occasions.  It is a difficult subject to deal with.  The suggestion I made to a deputation from the Corporation was that the installation of telephones in public parks would be the best method of enabling the rangers in co-operation with the Garda to deal with the kind of vandalism and rowdyism alleged to take place in these parks. We do ask the police to keep in touch with the park ranger and make it easy for him to contact the Garda.  I think the simplest solution would be that the Corporation should instal telephones at strategic points in all public parks so that the park ranger could get in contact with the Garda immediately.</P>
    <P>The only Deputy who criticised the white coats and the batons was Deputy Ryan.  Most other Deputies praised these innovations.  I am responsible for the white coats.  Like every other Deputy who drives a car, I have often had the experience on a winter's evening of suddenly seeing a policeman in his dark clothes loom up.  How these men escaped death was a marvel to me.  What I advocated was that the white coat be worn by the policemen on point duty.  I think it is an excellent innovation, in that they stand out on a dark winter evening when these men are on point duty at Butt Bridge, O'Connell Street and other places.  It may be, as Deputy Ryan said, that they have no particular drill in respect of their batons, that they simply whirl them round, wildly waving them as if they were shillelaghs.  I think he was exaggerating.  It may be true that there is some form of drill that could be introduced for those batons.  I understand that in Paris they are very effectively used and are regarded by the motorists as being an ideal method of signalling.</P>
    <P>The question of legal aid was raised by a number of Deputies.  It is a hardy annual.  I am quite sympathetic to the idea, in a general way, but I must have regard to the question of cost which would be very considerable if, as Deputy Lemass seemed to suggest, that aid should be given in civil as well as in criminal cases.  All I can say at present is that the matter is one which the law reform section of my <Col N="443" /> Department has been asked to look into.  I can make no promises.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch deprecated the leniency with which some of the courts deal with serious offences.  I must say I thoroughly agree with him.  I am amazed from time to time, in dealing with police reports in my Department, to find that the Probation of Offenders Act has been applied time after time. Only the other day, I had a case in which an individual had, I think, 47 convictions and I was astonished to find that he had got the benefit of the Probation Act on no less than seven occasions.  The Chief Justice apparently is of the one mind with both Deputy Lynch and myself because some time ago, from the Bench, he made this statement:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see why the Probation Act should have been applied more than once.  And if the framers of the Act were justified in allowing an opportunity of reform and if, as in these cases an opportunity of reform was allowed, that it was not availed of is shown by the fact that these people come before the Court again. In such cases it is farcical that the Probation Act should be applied again.</P>
    <P>I have no jurisdiction over judges or justices who apply that Act, but I sometimes feel that their reluctance to send offenders to prison or to St. Patrick's Institution may be due to the fact that they are not fully aware of the conditions under which prisoners serve their sentences.  I should like some of these judges and justices to visit the prisons, Mountjoy and St. Patrick's.  If they did, their reluctance to send there some of the boys that come before them would be lessened. They would have less hesitation in sending these boys to St. Patrick's.  I am pretty certain that if the parents of some of the boys sent to St. Patrick's were able to see, as I have seen on a number of my visits there, the splendid conditions which exist there they would be very impressed.  While conditions are magnificent the discipline is firm; there is no such thing as mollycoddling these boys: they are being taught very useful crafts&mdash;woodwork, <Col N="444" /> bootmaking, tailoring and motor mechanics and other useful trades of that kind.  In addition they have indoor and outdoor recreations and even visits from boys' football and boxing clubs outside.  There is nothing in the nature of mollycoddling.</P>
    <P>I am pretty certain that most of these boys when they come out will not return.  There is a magnificent visiting committee there taking a very keen and personal interest in all these boys and I am very glad to say that quite a number of the boys have been given employment by large firms in the city. So satisfied are the firms with the services they get from the boys that on numberous occasions they have repeated their applications for boys in the Institution and the visiting committee have great pleasure in recommending boys they regard as exceptionally good.  The number of these young fellows who have been recommitted is very small. A few have returned but they are only a minority.</P>

      <P>Deputy Richie Ryan spoke about the necessity for pounds in the south city and accused my Department of not making provision because of the expense.  The Department of Justice has no responsibility for providing pounds.  That is the responsibility of the local authorities, in the case of Dublin City, of the Corporation.  The most that the Garda can do is to recommend to me that there should be a pound in a certain place and I would make a request to the local authority if I saw fit.  My information is that the pounds that are provided at the present moment are often not fully occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan also mentioned that there had been delays in making &ldquo;negative&rdquo; searches in the Registry of Deeds.  While there was a disimprovement in the early months of the year in the time taken to deal with requests for negative searches, this was due in part to extensive sick leave of staff and also to the necessity for carrying out prolonged searches in connection with big estates.  Arrangements have now been made to increase the number of staff available for this specialised work and it is expected that the grounds for complaint in relation to delays will be removed very soon.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also criticised the appointment of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  Of course, that matter was not relevant to the debate because the Commissioner was appointed in 1952 and we are debating the Estimate for this year, not for 1952.  Therefore, I can ignore that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also talked about petitions. There is provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, for the remission, in whole or in part, of penalties imposed in the criminal courts.  Before that, clemency was exercised under the prerogative powers of mercy.  In all cases in which any remission of any <Col N="447" /> kind is made the decision is made by the Minister for Justice himself.  As far as I am concerned, whenever I get petitions from Deputies I have them exaimed very carefully.  I consult not only the Garda Officers responsible but also the district justice or the circuit court judge, as the case may be.  Usually I find that these people are fair and reasonable, and if it is possible to recommend anything in the nature of clemency they have no hesitation in doing it and I have no hesitation in operating the recommendation if that is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also made scathing comments on the traffic in Dublin. He made slighting references to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has done a very fine job of work in trying to clear up what was a terribly chaotic situation in the city of Dublin.  Traffic is moving reasonably smoothly at the present time, not perhaps as smoothly as we would like, but it is very difficult to get people who have been for a long time operating in a certain manner to operate in a completely different manner.  When all is said and done, there is a definite improvement and I have no doubt whatever that when the Road Traffic Bill begins to operate improvement will be noticeable to a much greater degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the incidents on C.I.E. Sunday excursions. I was going to say to Deputy Burke that if C.I.E. applied to the Garda Síochána for aid, no doubt that aid would be forthcoming, but I notice that they have done that without intervention on my part and with very good results. I have already seen that they dealt with incidents on an excursion to Wexford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>They took out a couple of these young blackguards at some intermediate station and left them there for the Garda Síochána to bring to trial.  Strong measures will have to be taken to deal with that type of conduct.  As Deputy Davern remarked here tonight, they went to <Col N="448" /> Clonmel recently and almost wrecked a public house.  As Deputy Davern remarked, if they had been there for another ten minutes the young men of Clonmel would have dealt with them very effectively but I am afraid it might have been in an illegal manner and therefore I could not say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones criticised the inadequacy of the capitation grant of 25/- a week paid to institutions which run detention homes for girls. It must be remembered that the capitation grant is intended only to bridge the gap between the value the girl gives to the institution in the form of laundry work and the cost of keeping her.  The grant was increased only about a year ago.  It was 15/- and is now 25/-.  Some little advance was made.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of films.  It is very difficult to deal with that question.  A number of films that are shown in England and which eventually come here would not get a certificate here in Ireland at all but they might possibly get a limited certificate.  The danger of the limited certificate is that it induces people, who might not otherwise want to do so, to see the film.  In actual fact there might not be anything in the film to which an adult would object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I read a criticism of a television show by an English writer. He said that in the course of half an hour no less than 15 people were killed.  He posed the question as to whether it is desirable in a civilised country like Great Britain to have shown in the family home the violent death of 15 people within such a short period of time.  What are the films for which we want a limited certificate? We surely do not object, I take it, to the young boys looking at a Western film.  These are the films in which, to my mind, life is made so cheap that they may give rise to crimes and vandalism in the big cities and towns. I doubt very much if the limited certificate would serve any useful purpose.  It might, indeed, induce a large number of people to go to see <Col N="449" /> that film in which they might not have any interest, otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a limited certificate, they would not be allowed into a cinema.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about that is that you have to fix an age limit.  Suppose the age limit were 18. Very few of us here would be able to say whether a young fellow of good physique was 18 years of age or 21. You would be up against that sort of difficulty.  The best thing, I think, is to rely on the good sense of the film censor who, to my mind, is doing excellent work in the censoring of films.</P>
      <P>There is an appeal against his censorship and it is remarkable that the number of successful appeals against his decisions have been extraordinarily small.  I would say that the percentage was very low, which shows his good judgment.  We can safely assume that if an appeal is allowed, it is a very close thing as to whether it should or should not be allowed.  The tendency of the censor, I think, is in the right direction.  I think we can trust him to do the right thing.</P>

      <P>There was also the questions of a ban on air guns, flick knives, slings and other things of that kind.  I am just wondering whether it would be possible to bring in legislation to deal with that type of thing.  I do not think it would be.  As long as boys are boys, they will have slings and air guns.  They will act as boys. I was surprised the other day when somebody raised the question in respect of Cork.  The suggestion was made that we should ban the flick knife because of the dangerous use made of it.  When I examined the situation in regard to Cork, where there appeared to have been a number of attacks with knives, I was surprised to find that of something like 17 attacks, only two flick knives were involved.  The majority of them, I think, involved penknives which you can hardly ban.  One involved a bread knife and there were two, I think, involving boy scout knives.</P>
      <P>I was going through a stores in the city the other day and I was surprised to see what appeared to me to be a terribly dangerous-looking boy scout knife in a scabbard.  The price was only 2/6d. or something like that.  That shows how easy it is to get these things but to bring in legislation to ban the use of these, I think, would be undesirable. Some other methods will have to be adopted, such as very severe punishment for the illegal use of flick knives.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of the appointment of P.C.s.  He fell out with me over that.  As Deputy Palmer said to him, he must be a very innocent politician if he thinks that I am going to appoint his nominees. We all know that the appointment of P.C.'s is a patronage business.  Despite that, I have on a number of occasions appointed people who were put up to me by people like the Deputy but it was after consultation with the other local Deputy.  There is no reason in the world why Deputy O'Donnell could not have consulted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An injured workman who accepts a lump sum of £485 in settlement of his claim to a weekly payment of £4 10s. 0d under the Workmen's Compensation Acts in respect of total incapacity would not become entitled to disability benefit until a period of 107 weeks and 5 days had elapsed from the date of registration of the agreement, even though he remained incapable of work during that time.  If, however, his weekly rate of disability benefit was in excess of £4 10s. 0d. he would immediately be entitled to the difference between the two amounts, as disability benefit.</P>
      <P>If the workman had obtained the sum of £485 damages at common law his title to disability benefit would not be affected and he would be entitled to be paid at the full appropriate rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards unemployment benefit the position is that to qualify for such benefit a claimant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be capable of work.  The question as to whether a claimant satisfies this and <Col N="337" /> the other statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit is a matter for determination by a statutory officer, that is, a deciding officer or an appeals officer.  A person who has received a lump sum either under the Workmen's Compensation Acts or at common law would, as soon as he fulfilled all the relevant conditions, qualify for payment of unemployment benefit irrespective of the amount of such sum or the date of the accident in respect of which it was awarded.</P>
