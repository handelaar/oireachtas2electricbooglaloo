      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I am glad the Government decided to provide time to discuss this Bill.  Yesterday the Taoiseach animadverted on our attitude with regard to another Private Bill and it would be as well to state here that, in our opinion, when a member of the House takes the trouble to prepare a Bill for consideration by the House, the minimum courtesy he is entitled to expect is that he will be facilitated in having the Bill printed and circulated to his colleagues so that a decision can be taken on the merits of his proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that it is open to the Government to restrict discussion to a short statement from both sides and that seems to me to be a procedure which normally is a mistaken procedure. <Col N="1680" /> From the point of view of good Parliamentary procedure, all Deputies should be treated on a basis of equality and receive from the House the courtesy of permission to have a Bill they want considered, printed and circulated so that people can consider it and subsequently the Government can allow it to be accepted or rejected by the votes of Deputies.  I hope the Government will reconsider their general attitude with regard to that matter and, where a reasonable proposal is submitted, that they will refrain from exercising their prerogative of opposing the First Reading and reserve the statement of their attitude for an occasion when the House will have a opportunity of seeing what the Deputy wishes the House to consider.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Bill the Government have provided time for its consideration. It is quite a simple Bill. Its main purpose is to provide a means of getting a clear picture for the people at large of the problem&mdash;if such problem exists&mdash;of the acquisition of agricultural land in this country by non-nationals.  For several years from these benches we advocated a departure from the original policy of Fianna Fáil in regard to the control of manufactures.  We urged on them that the time had come when the country required the admission of foreign capital, foreign know-how and foreign marketing methods into our economy, so that we would be given access, ready access, to foreign markets into which it was extremely difficult for a new industrial economy to break a way.  I think the Government were right in virtually abandoning their original policy of control of manufactures and not only admitting but welcoming the arrival of foreign capital or investment and the establishment of branch factories which would build up Irish production and provide their marketing organisation for its disposition in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>As that policy began to operate, a new situation began to develop.  That was that, in addition to factory sites being acquired by foreign interests, we read every day in the newspapers of large tracts of agricultural land in <Col N="1681" /> various parts of the country being acquired by foreign interests and non-nationals. In addition it is pretty well known that an operation is being conducted of a quasi-secret character whereby foreign interests acquired pre-1947 companies and under the cover of these companies began to buy agricultural land.  That development has been referred to by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement of the 19th April, column 681, of volume 182, No. 5 in which he said:</P>
    <P>The Government have had under consideration the question of acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals, and the desirability of exercising more control over these transactions.  It has been decided to include provisions in the Finance Bill to strengthen the existing 25 per cent. stamp duty legislation so as to bring within its scope certain procedures which at present enable, or may enable, non-nationals to acquire land without incurring liability to the duty.  In particular, I have in mind purchases of land by pre-1947 companies with non-national shareholders.</P>
    <P>That is evidence in itself that the Government are aware of this problem and have realised its implications.  In a recent leading article in the Government-kept newspaper, on the 23rd February, 1961, the following paragraph appeared:</P>
    <P>The Swiss authorities have had to impose rather stringent conditions on land purchase by foreigners because of the enormous influx of wealthy foreign settlers into the attractive Alpine cantons.  There land prices have been inflated and local people have come to feel that their traditions are being seriously endangered.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to that sentence &mdash;&ldquo;and local people have come to feel that their traditions are being seriously endangered.&rdquo;  It is well known that in Jersey similar restrictions have had to be imposed to prevent excessive acquisition of land there by foreigners.</P>
    <P>On the 17th February, 1961, the <Col N="1682" /> Minister for Lands is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>No situation has yet arisen which would give genuine cause for concern, but the matter was being closely watched for any unreasonable or excessive developments.  There was in operation a heavy tax designed to restrict and discourage such transactions.</P>
    <P>In a leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 14th January, 1961, the following statement appeared:</P>
    <P>The tradition of Irish hospitality is a very proud and strong one; but we must draw the line somewhere.  As the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> points out, we are the only country in Europe that allows the unrestricted purchase of land by foreigners.  It would take the strongest evidence of an alien influx to disturb our liberal attitude towards the stranger; but one must ask whether the time has not now come to call a halt to a movement that may eventually mean a social and economic upheaval of the first order.  The <i>Farmers' Journal</i> suggests a variable purchase tax of 25 to 50 per cent. depending on the farming ability of the purchaser and his willingness to live here.  It is, perhaps, too early to impose such a drastic control; but it is not too much to ask the Minister for Finance to supervise more closely the loophole provided by the pre-1947 company or, indeed, to require of our new landholders from abroad that they should make a minimal gesture by playing their full part in the rural community.  It would be the greatest pity if the Germans or any other Continental people who feel the understandable need to &ldquo;get away from it all&rdquo; were to parody the outworn slogan that &ldquo;England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity&rdquo; by acting on the basis that Ireland's economic difficulty was their opportunity.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the whole question of introducing foreign capital because I think there is very grave danger that if the impression spread about in this country that there was, associated with the introduction of that foreign capital <Col N="1683" /> for industrial purposes, a certain drive to buy up the agricultural land of this country by wealthy non-nationals a fully understandable and violent reaction might arise in this country which would be most unhealthy and undesirable.  It is to prevent such a development that we are bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>In the absence of certain knowledge in matters of this kind all sorts of rumours are liable to circulate.  A purchase of land in one particular area will give rise to rumour and that rumour spreads.  It is then confirmed by a purchase of land in another area and the thing spreads and grows until an atmosphere of panic and unrest spreads through the country.  I have the feeling that precipitate action to impose heavy taxation or restrictive legislation might well be premature.  I am glad to see that the German Ambassador, when on a recent visit to his own country, exhorted his fellow-countrymen to proceed with their industrial adventures in Ireland but warned that excessive purchases of agricultural land would certainly be misunderstood in this country and would give rise to sentiments which would do no service to the improvement of German-Irish relations.  In sounding that note of caution he was very prudent.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that we ought to be solicitous to ensure that we shall not present a chauvinist appearance of resenting the arrival of any non-nationals who intend to permanently reside here.  It would ill become our people, who have gone to reside in such great numbers in Great Britain, the U.S.A. and, indeed, all over the world, suddenly to declare that they will not extend reciprocal hospitality to people who elect to come here and make their living amongst us.  There is a very fundamental difference between that attitude and appearing to be indifferent to the wholesale purchase of agricultural land by non-nationals with the danger of there creeping back on us unobserved a new landlord system which it took us a great deal of effort and sacrifice to get rid of.</P>
    <P>One of the great dangers in which <Col N="1684" /> each generation lives is that, in proportion to the sacrifices of the generation that went before it in abating evils, the succeeding generation may lose sight altogether of the evil that has been abolished because their forefathers had done the job so well.  A great many Deputies in this House will remember that we are not now for the first time dealing with this problem of the ownership of land resting in people other than those who live and get their living on the land and what we have got to try to remember is how insidious are the problems in this regard.</P>
    <P>I think it was Mitchel Henry who came to Donegal in 1879 or the '70's. He came with the best intentions in the world.  He was a radical liberal. He wanted to demonstrate that if people ran their estates well there need be no conflict between the landlord and the tenant.  He was not very long here until he was involved in one of the most savage land wars that ever took place and the people he wanted, I believe with the best of intentions, to help and serve resented his presence and after a long and bloody battle he left this country and the land ultimately vested in the tenants who lived and got their living on it.</P>
    <P>It was earlier than that that Lord Lucan, who was the landlord of the greater part of West Mayo, believed that he could best serve the interests of his tenants by evicting all of them and after a suitable sojourn in the workhouse dividing up their farms into large holdings and re-employing them, not as tenants, but as employees on the large farms that it was his purpose to create in the belief that he could provide them with a larger monetary income by installing Scotch factors who, as he thought, would operate the land more economically. Our people resisted that and, in a long and bloody encounter, they drove Lord Lucan out of West Mayo instead of Lord Lucan driving them out.</P>
    <P>The great danger of closing Pandora's box too firmly is that those who subsequently look at it forget its <Col N="1685" /> contents and in an unwary moment will open it and let loose its contents, only to discover then that they have not the means to confine back in that box the evil spirit which they have released and which their forebears wrought so powerfully effectively to confine.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that if, in a misguided moment, non-nationals came to buy Irish land for the purpose of operating it as a commercial proposition, displacing tenant proprietors by agricultural labourers, we would very quickly drift into a situation which would give rise to the gravest social disturbance in this country.  In that social disturbance there might be involved many valuable industrial enterprises which are at present assured of public goodwill but which, if once associated in the public mind with a large-scale movement to purchase Irish agricultural land, would share the hatred of our people for any attempt to dispossess them of the land on which they depend.</P>
    <P>There are analogies for this to be found all over the world.  In the new emergent nations in many parts of the world, where colonial power has never sought to transfer ownership of the land to colonists, when the time came to introduce an emergent nation to freedom there was none of the bitter racial hatreds that existed in those ex-colonies whose colonial history had been characterised by a large-scale transfer of the people's land to colonists who were brought in.  Where colonial powers in the past had confined themselves to industrial and mercantile activity and had not interfered with people's right to their land, there was no bitter resentment left between the colonial powers and the people who were charged with the responsibility of taking over the new emergent nation but, where land problems existed, as they do exist in many parts of South America and elsewhere, they have confounded and maddened the masses of the people and have given rise to grave social unrest which has been, of course, promptly exploited by the powers of evil in the world.</P>
    <P>We have made it so much a rule of <Col N="1686" /> our life here in Ireland that no Irish person aspires to be a landlord that it is really unnecessary to take any precautions over and above the continual existence of the Land Commission to ensure that that domestic evil would not arise again.  I cannot imagine anybody born and bred in this country setting himself up as a landlord again because it is in the blood to know that our people will not have it and do not like it but it is quite possible for a well-intentioned stranger coming here, ignorant of our past history, to stumble into that very error and generate the very kind of social problems that we are concerned to avoid by a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>In all human affairs prevention is better than cure.  Probably, from the point of view of politics, it might be more dramatic to introduce a Bill proposing to prohibit absolutely the acquisition of Irish land by non-nationals but we are not concerned with politics in regard to this Bill; we are concerned to prevent the growth of an evil before it assumes dimensions which might impose upon us the necessity to take drastic action of a disturbing and positively difficult kind.  So, this Bill is designed to prevent the emergence of a land problem in Ireland.  It provides that a register should be set up in the Land Commission and that any non-national who proposes to acquire agricultural land in this country, in order to make the transfer of the land to him valid, should register the intention to make the conveyance at least seven days before the execution of the instrument of the particulars set out in Section 4 of this Bill relating to the land intended to be conveyed, transferred or leased.</P>
    <P>The only effect of his not doing so, in accordance with this proposal, is that the transfer would be void and have no effect.  His failure to do it would create a grave flaw in his title to the land.  It is unthinkable that any man would part with his money and take a title to land which could be impugned under the terms of this Bill in any future transaction relating to it.</P>
    <P>It is sought to build up in the Land Commission, therefore, a register of all transfers of land to non-nationals so <Col N="1687" /> that anybody who is concerned about this problem will have free access to full information in regard to it.  It is also sought by the terms of Section 3 (2) to ensure that if a person sets up a company or acquires a company by taking shares in it and is himself a non-national, that company shall be under the same obligation to register a transfer of land with the Land Commission for the information both of the authorities and of all other interested parties in the State.</P>
    <P>It might be necessary on the Committee Stage of this Bill to introduce a further provision that, where a pre-1947 company or any other had been established without foreign participation and acquired land, in the event of part of its equity being acquired by a non-national, that company will then have the obligation to register any acquisition of land for which it was responsible in the register stipulated for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We believe that prevention is better than cure.  It may very well be that legislation of the character in this Bill would prevent any serious problem arising and would constitute full notice to non-nationals that it was the firm intention of the Oireachtas to prevent any large-scale transfer of land to non-nationals. If we can prevent the problem, it is a very much better way to go about it than to wait for this problem to mature and then be driven to extreme and drastic legislation in an effort to cure the evil that has been allowed to arise.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility, if the present trend continues, of a very serious evil developing.  There is undoubtedly abroad in the country a considerable degree of apprehension that such an evil is developing.  It is very necessary to prevent such an evil developing and to persuade the public, if in fact no serious evil exists, that there is clear evidence that no situation exists calling for restrictive legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree that one must be extremely circumspect in placing any restriction on the free sale of land but you must not allow yourselves to be dazzled or <Col N="1688" /> misled by some of the fundamental aphorisms with which we have all grown up.  The three F's were undoubtedly a very precious war cry of the Land War.  Remember what they were: free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure.  Fair rent has ceased to be a problem.  There are no rents left because we got rid of them all.  Fixity of tenure is no longer a problem since we amended the deplorable Fianna Fáil legislation of 1932 which sought to undermine everything and which did destroy many a decent farmer by robbing him of his birthright.  Free sale meant that a farmer should have the right to get the value of his holding. We provided under the 1951 Land Act that even where the Land Commission acquired a man's holding, he was entitled to get the full value of the holding, and he has got it ever since.</P>
    <P>Free sale is a very important thing but you should not carry that fundamental right to free sale to the point of saying that we as a people would be prepared to stand idly by and see all the agricultural land sold to speculators from outside.  That would be carrying the doctrine of free sale to a point that nobody who understands its true significance would ever concede as being correct.  Free sale means that the farmers should be free to sell their holdings on the open market but it does not mean that farmers should be free to sell their land to landlords in order to re-establish a system which the whole Land War was fought to put an end to.</P>
    <P>One of our perennial difficulties in this country is to get people in this part of Ireland to be constantly conscious of the difficulties of their neighbours west of the Shannon, in Cavan, Monaghan and other areas where the holdings are small and, in very many cases, manifestly uneconomic.  One of the difficulties frequently pointed out is that if you wanted to give every farmer in Ireland a fully economic holding of 50 acreas, there probably is not enough land on this island to do it. However, there still remain among us a very large number of Irish farmers who urgently need land in order to make their holdings economic and there also exists and I hope will exist <Col N="1689" /> in greater numbers in the years that lie ahead, a number of young men who have a bit of capital, who have acquired agricultural know-how and want an opportunity to settle on the land in their own country.  It would become an intolerable abuse if there were many of these eager and willing to take up moderate holdings of land and they saw the land on which they could get their living being alienated in large tracts to non-nationals who were buying it for the purpose of commercial exploitation or for the purpose of selling it to tenants as a financial investment.</P>
    <P>None of us in this House, I think, would tolerate the alienation of the land of Ireland on a large scale from Irish ownership.  We know that, but there may be people from abroad who do not fully appreciate that situation. It is a matter of very urgent importance that no crisis should be allowed to grow out of this development of the acquisition of land by foreigners.  I believe that a Bill on the lines which we now submit will operate as an effective check on that tendency, and it will do more; it will prevent panic movements spreading throughout the country, founded on inadequate information.  I know of no other means by which accurate information of the kind necessary to inform public opinion can be made available, except through some such machinery as this Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and important to emphasise that one of the reasons this Bill is brought before the House is to ensure that public misunderstanding of the trend towards the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals will not create a public movement against the acquisition of industrial sites by foreign <i>entrepreneurs</i> coming in here on their own, or in association with the Irish associates, to establish industrial enterprises.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear and manifest that this is a situation which all Parties in the House approve and desire to promote.  We understand how easily these two things could become confused in the public mind.  It is very understandable that foreigners who are <Col N="1690" /> not familiar with our historical background might overlook the fundamental difference the Irish people see between the acquisition of industrial sites and the wholesale acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>This piece of machinery is designed to warn them.  It is designed to keep our people fully informed of the true situation, and perhaps most important, it is designed to keep the Government and the Oireachtas fully informed as to the true situation, so that if the necessity for bringing in effective restricting legislation on the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals should ever arise, we might rest assured that we would have the opportunity of acting in time, and avoiding the creation of a very serious social problem, with all the grave repercussions of legislation which might be requisite to correct it.</P>
    <P>Many people will find fault with this Bill on the ground that it does not go too far.  We firmly believe it is very much better to prevent an evil rather than to be forced into a course which might be requisite to cure it.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to prevent, at this stage, the development of an evil which would certainly call for drastic remedy.  I urge on the Government that they should accept the Bill, at least in principle, so that we will not have to return to this problem in much more difficult circumstances hereafter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to remind the House that, in drafting a Bill of this kind, the Opposition have not access to the services of the Parliamentary Draftsman.  The Opposition have not access to the various organs of administrative experience of the Department of Lands.  Therefore, the Bill in its present form expresses the general intention, and any lacuna in it can very readily be cured on Committee Stage by suitable amendment. We are not married to the letter of this Bill.  We are concerned with its spirit, and we believe that a Bill entitled Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961, will in itself be a very useful deterrent to evil.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government are prepared <Col N="1691" /> to accept the Bill.  I undertake to collaborate with them in its amendment, in so far as amendment may be necessary for drafting and administrative convenience, on Committee Stage, in the confident belief that in enacting a Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, we may prevent evil and avoid the necessity of other Draconian legislation at a later stage.  We have serious apprehensions that unless we act in that sense now, we will be confronted in three or four years' time with a most difficult situation which may give rise to endless misunderstanding and serious economic damage to the State, which we all want to avoid, and which we think can best be avoided by acting in time on the lines suggested in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why that remark was made.  In his opening speech on Second Reading of this Bill, Deputy Dillon referred to the procedure adopted yesterday on another Private Bill.  Of course the Deputy is well aware that the rules of the House are there, and that it is my duty, his duty and the duty of all Deputies to uphold them.  If they are found wanting in any way, the matter can be dealt with, I assume, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or some other body.  At all events, yesterday the matter was dealt with in accordance with the existing rules of order.  In opposing the First Reading of a Bill, there is no other possible way of dealing with it under the rules as they exist at present.</P>
      <P>Before I go into details on this Bill, I want to refer to the statement of the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech as to the intentions of the Government in dealing with this matter generally.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Government have had under consideration the question of acquisitions of agricultural land by non-nationals, and the desirability of exercising more control over these transactions.  It has been decided to include provisions in the Finance Bill to strengthen the existing 25 per cent, stamp duty legislation so as to bring within its scope certain procedures which at present enable, or may enable, non-nationals to acquire land without incurring liability to the duty.  In particular, I have in mind purchases of land by pre-1947 companies with non-national shareholders.</P>
      <P>I think any person with any experience of the law will agree that that has been the main loophole under the 1956 Finance Bill and the previous 1947 Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, it is necessary to have regard to the legitimate needs of persons who come from abroad and benefit the economy by setting up industries or otherwise investing here.  I do not propose, <Col N="1693" /> therefore, that the higher rate of duty should apply henceforward except where it is necessary for social purposes.  It will not apply at all in urban areas or to land which is to be used for industrial purposes and, where it does apply, the Minister for Lands will have power in suitable cases to authorise the granting of exemption.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance referred to the Minister for Lands in that case, I think he was in fact referring to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been in certain portions of the Press, as quoted by Deputy Dillon, concern expressed about some aliens, particularly Germans, coming to this country and acquiring land.  I am well aware of the sensitivity of this question.  Indeed, I think everybody brought up in rural Ireland, and particularly in the West, is aware of the sensitivity of this question.  I am further aware how easy it is to exploit this sensitivity in different quarters for different purposes.  I propose at a later stage to cut this matter down to size.  In so far as it does pose a problem for us at all here, I did state on numerous occasions since these Press reports appeared that the Government and I were keeping a close watch on this matter, and if it transpired there was a necessity for any remedial action or control, it would be applied.</P>
    <P>I propose to inform the House now in more detail, following the statement of the Minister for Finance, of the measures proposed to be taken by the Government in the Finance Bill, which will shortly be before the House, to deal with this matter in so far as the Government, on the information before them at present, consider it should be dealt with.  I want to give in broad outline the steps we propose to take in relation to the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals.  The Minister for Finance announced that the liability for 25 per cent stamp duty will not apply to urban property.  It is, of course, intended to continue the existing arrangements whereby it does not apply to residential holdings containing <Col N="1694" /> less than five acres or to land which is used for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>In the case of land purchased for industrial purposes, however, the Finance Bill will contain a new provision to the effect that, in the event of the failure on the part of the purchaser to put the land to industrial use within three years of its purchase, the purchase money at this stage shall attract the 25 per cent. rate of stamp duty.  I may pause here for a moment to explain that under the previous law it would appear that anybody, if he was sufficiently unscrupulous, could certify in a deed that the land concerned was going to be used for industrial purposes and thereby evade the higher rate of stamp duty.  The new provision will ensure that if the industry is not proceeded with within three years, he will be liable to the penal rate of 25 per cent. duty.</P>
    <P>Some non-nationals have hitherto succeeded in circumventing the provisions of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, by operating through pre-1947 Irish companies.  With the object of curbing these activities, it has been decided that relief from the 25 per cent. duty will in future be applicable only in the case of companies, including pre-1947 companies, which were owned <i>bona fide</i> by Irish citizens to an extent exceeding 50 per cent.  Where the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied regarding the <i>bona fides</i> of any company, they may apply the 25 per cent. stamp duty, subject to an appeal to the courts.  Therefore, in future, relief from the higher rate of duty to companies, including pre-1947 companies, will apply only where they are Irish companies.  By &ldquo;Irish companies&rdquo; I mean companies where the majority of the equity is owned by Irish citizens.  Provision will be made in the Act for certain information about these transactions to be provided by the companies concerned.  If the Revenue Commissioners have any doubts, they will be in a position to say: &ldquo;We shall not accept you are a <i>bona fide</i> Irish company&rdquo; and the onus will be then on the company to appeal to the courts to establish that it is, in fact, a <i>bona fide</i> Irish company.</P>

      <P>It means any company, In the case of agricultural land acquired by a non-national or by a company under non-national control, it will be open to the purchaser to apply for relief from the 25 per cent. duty.  It is proposed that that relief will apply as a general rule in circumstances where the completion of the sale would not hinder the land settlement programme or where the sale would be in furtherance of the national interest.  For example, relief would normally apply in cases of the purchase of an uneconomic demense, which is regarded as a &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; by Irish standards.  Similarly, an individual or company introducing a new method of agriculture to this country might properly be given encouragement in the form of relief.  This escape clause is designed for what in popular language is known as a &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo;&mdash;a very large house, possibly with more than five acres of land. It is envisaged that the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Land Commission, authorise the granting of relief from the higher rate of stamp duty in such cases.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Finance Bill will include adequate provisions for ensuring the effectiveness of any new measures by imposing severe penalties for such matters as the furnishing of false information as to the ownership of land, the constitution of companies and so on. As I said, under the previous law any type of declaration could be made. Even the provision of the Statutory Declaration Act did not, in my view, apply to such declarations.  Outside certain penal provisions in respect of duties in case of any false declarations in deeds, there will be further provisions, including imprisonment, for any such fraudulent return or any such fraudulent declaration in any such document.  From the foregoing, it will be apparent that the Government are ready to implement effective measures to control the tax evasion which is the crux of this matter.  The Bill goes no further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think tax evasion is the crux of the matter? My feeling is that it is the alienation of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I do.  I shall deal with that proposition when I finish what I have to say on this issue. I suggest that the Bill is an innocuous measure which goes no further than to require the Land Commission to set up a register of information about alien purchases.  Under the Government measure, it is proposed that the Revenue Commissioners shall keep the Land Commission informed of purchases by non-national interests. In this way, the Land Commission will be in a position to assemble essential information about such transactions. This will be achieved without the irritating and superfluous machinery proposed in this Bill.  Appropriate particulars will be made available to members of the House by way of replies to Parliamentary Question or in response to inquiries addressed to my office.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements which will be brought into operation under the Finance Bill in the near future will meet the reasonable requirements of the matter as the Government see them.  In effect, the position will be, and it will so be provided by law, that the Revenue Commissioners in all these transactions will forthwith inform the Land Commission and the Land Commission will have their register of all these cases in which non-nationals or non-national companies or concerns purchase land. These companies and these individuals, except in the cases I have explained, will be subject to the 25 per cent. stamp duly based <i>ad valorem</i> on the purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the 25 per cent. penal tax referred to were in force and were enforceable, it is, in my view, and indeed it must be in any international view, a very serious penalty on those concerned.  As far as the problem as we see it is concerned&mdash;in so far as it is a problem and so far I do not think it is and I think I shall be able to convince the House in a few moments that it is <Col N="1697" /> not&mdash;I believe this measure is quite adequate to deal with it at this time. Indeed, if this tax were enforceable under the previous legislation, I think it would be quite sufficient to deal with it.  However, there was the position that unscrupulous people could certify different things in deeds that were not the truth and thus escape the tax and there was the great loophole which was the pre-1947 company and which was used, in the main, as an instrument for the purpose of avoiding this tax.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if we make the law effective on that issue and if we put out the pre-1947 company, we shall in fact be taking sufficient steps at this time to deal with the few people we have to deal with.  Further-more, by the provision under which the Revenue Commissioners will notify the Land Commissioners, we shall know exactly what is happening without going to the trouble we have to go to now in asking the Garda and our own officials to make a check down the country.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to reiterate the position as far as the scarcity of land in this country is concerned. Deputy Dillon has referred to a recent statement by the German Ambassador abroad.  I do not know how the idea seems to have got publicity that there is plenty of land here for all.  It has been made clear by me and by the Taoiseach that that is not the position, and that we have a land congestion problem here which it is national policy to solve.</P>
    <P>However, we must have reasonable reciprocity with other people and with other States.  I think the position was fairly well stated and, in the main, it is the position, with the one exception with which I shall deal in a moment, as stated by the former Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Cosgrave, when speaking on a motion introduced here by Deputy McQuillan in 1954, as reported at Column 1818 of the Official Reports of 15th December, 1954, Volume 147.  This matter was raised by Deputy McQuillan who tabled a motion in this House exactly on all fours, and containing the suggestion <Col N="1698" /> that the repeal or amendment of the Aliens Act should be undertaken by the then Government, with what he advocated here yesterday.</P>
    <P>Speaking on that occasion, the then Minister for External Affairs said, under the reference I have given:</P>
    <P>In a few very isolated cases, I think in South America, certain legislation has been imposed against non-nationals.  But in almost every other country, in Europe, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, conditions exist almost identical with those in this country &mdash;the same treatment is afforded to non-nationals as is afforded to non-nationals here.  As far as I can see there would be no reason why we should legislate in a penal fashion, particularly in view of the fact that absolute powers of acquisition, whether concerning nationals or non-nationals lie in the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There has been no change, so far as I know, and certainly not in Western Europe, except in the one case to which Deputy Dillon referred, that is, Switzerland.  However, in Switzerland, the problem is entirely different from what it is here.  My information is that in Switzerland, in one quarter of last year, there were over 460 purchases by aliens.  Switzerland is right on the border of Germany, and with Switzerland's history of neutrality, surrounded by a troubled world, it is quite natural for people there to try to get a foothold again.  As far as can be ascertained, we had roughly 33 purchases in the whole of the year in a recent period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-three in a recent 12 months, all cases of over 100 acres.  Of these 33, quite a few that I have investigated were Germans and the land consisted of snipe grass and stuff in which the Land Commission would have absolutely no interest. In a number of other cases there were purchases by people who, if not aliens, were certainly non-nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They buy snipe grass to erect chalets in Mayo, for instance. That is welcomed by all and sundry locally.  Some of these people like to get atmosphere.  Perhaps if I go back, in connection with what I have described as snipe grass, to what I said and what my attitude was in discussing this motion in 1954 it will make clear what I mean.  In opposing the motion then &mdash;I was in Opposition at that time and what I said is reported at Column 1793 of Volume 147 of the Official Report&mdash;I said:</P>
      <P>Before I leave the aliens question, I must say that I largely agree, as far as my part of the West is concerned, with what was stated here by, I think, Deputy Brennan, on the last occasion. The type of alien we have got in the West are people who are buying old ramshackle places nobody else would purchase.  They are people who come back to the West of Ireland looking for atmosphere, looking for a place where the local flyboy can play Liszt's rhapsody on his tin whistle.  They come out and find that they have acquired a place which nobody else would buy, and then you will see advertisements in the London newspapers about a cosy nook with wonderful fishing and free shooting looking out on the broad Atlantic.  They are looking for somebody who will take off their hands the property they have acquired earlier. We like these people down there and these are not the people who create the problem that Deputy McQuillan has in mind.</P>
      <P>That was in 1954 and we still have a number of these people floating around and a number of places that I referred to in another sense as white elephants.</P>

      <P>I accept that the information may not be complete over the last twelve months, although twelve months ago a check was made, not alone by me but through every Garda barracks throughout the land.  The information should be fairly accurate in my view.  But in so far as our information is not complete it will be remedied under the provision of the new Finance Act, under which the Revenue Commissioners will be obliged by law to furnish us with every single transaction in which any alien or alien company may be concerned.</P>
      <P>Before passing from Switzerland, which is the only European country that has taken special measures in recent times in this connection, let me say their decree, so far as I understand it, only forbids aliens to acquire land there for certain purposes.  They could not purchase land near army installations or land which the Swiss authorities allege is being acquired for speculation, but the Swiss are quite careful to exempt land for industrial purposes and business firms are exempt also.  An alien is allowed to transfer property in Switzerland to another alien relative.  Everybody knows there is no comparison between the position of Switzerland, the international home of refugees and aliens, and the position here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, as drafted, Deputy Dillon said that the primary <Col N="1701" /> purpose of it was to prevent an evil, if it ever arose.  It should be quite clear that this Bill, as it stands, is not designed to prevent any evil nor indeed does it purport to give any extra powers by way of acquisition or otherwise to the Land Commission.  The sole purpose of it is to get the Land Commission to keep a register of these transactions.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that it appears to me that the sole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that a register shall be kept.  The Bill does not seek to give any wider powers or use any discrimination against aliens. The Bill provides, as I said, that any alien no matter who, is quite free to purchase land here once he serves seven days' notice on the Land Commission so that the transaction may be noted in its register.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I want it to be clear that the Bill does not purport to do anything except to provide for this register.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that there are so many ways out of this Bill that it would not, in fact, serve to establish the true facts.  It does not materially affect or strengthen the position of the Land Commission in relation to the acquisition of any lands although the title of the Bill is the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill.  It does not, in fact, provide for acquisition at all.  It is not unacceptable in so far as it seeks to put on a firm basis the compilation of information, but it is so ineffective in other ways as to create difficulties which it would be virtually impossible to surmount and which would render it quite impossible to achieve the objective the Deputy has in mind.  The effective way of compiling the type of register the Deputy has in mind will be met in the provisions of the new Finance Bill.  I accept what the Deputy said so far as drafting is concerned; <Col N="1702" /> he and his colleagues were not, perhaps, in a position to cross every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dot every &ldquo;i&rdquo;, if I may put it that way.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out a few matters in the Bill which will demonstrate to the House the utter impossibility of the House accepting any such measure. If we take Section 4 (1) (e), we have the inclusion of the word &ldquo;street&rdquo;.</P>

That applies in the case of companies.  In the case of individuals, an obligation would be imposed not alone on the purchaser but on the vendor to investigate the nationality of any and every purchaser. He would have to get his seed, breed and generation as far as nationality is concerned.  If he failed to give this seven days' notice provided for in the Bill and if the transaction proved to be void, the purchaser would be entitled in equity to his money back and the duty would be on the vendor's solicitors to investigate nationality.  The position would be that there could never be any finality, during our lifetime, at all events, to the closing of any sale.

      <P>There are other matters, which I do not want to labour but which appear to me to make this Bill completely unworkable, even for the purposes for which it was designed.  In so far as this Bill was designed to get the Land Commission to keep a register, first, as drafted, it would be ineffective, and, secondly, there will in fact be a register, after the Finance Bill comes before the House, of these transactions in the Land Commission.  Thirdly, in regard to the Bill as it is at the moment, I cannot foresee any type of amendment that could make it workable to give expression to the intention which I believe is behind the Bill.  Fourthly, the Bill does not provide for any effective step to control this problem, in so far as it is a problem at all, and whatever has been envisaged in the Bill will be more effectively dealt with by the Finance Bill, which I have explained to the House.  For all these reasons, I have to oppose this Bill, but I suggest that those who moved it, in view of the explanations I have given as to what is envisaged by the Government in the Finance Bill, should withdraw it and examine the detailed, effective proposals the Government have made to deal with this problem, in so far as it is a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in my remarks on this measure because I assume the Deputies in the Party associated with Deputy Dillon wish to speak in support of the measure.  I should like to say that I see no reason in the world why the Government should not accept this Bill.  The Bill, if it is accepted, will only show the extent of the problem of the purchase of land by non-nationals and unless the Government do not want, or are afraid, to have that extent shown up, I see no reason why the measure should be opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me also say that there is no such thing as a real check in the Bill as far <Col N="1706" /> as curbing the activities of non-nationals in the land market here is concerned.  There are no teeth in the measure as far as that end of it is concerned.  It reminds me of the position of a patient who is suffering from a serious haemorrhage.  Somebody comes along and actually measures the quantity of blood pumping from his body, instead of applying a tourniquet to save the life of the patient.  I think it is a tourniquet we need for this problem. It is not something that arose in the past five or six years; it is something that has been going on since the end of the war.  My main concern is to ensure that the pool of land which should be available for the relief of congestion is not acquired or purchased by non-nationals to the detriment of people who live on small, uneconomic holdings in the State.</P>
    <P>The Constitution clearly lays down that it is the duty of the Government to establish on the land of Ireland, in economic circumstances, as many families as it is possible to settle.  I feel that if the land which is suitable for the relief of congestion is allowed to pass into the hands of non-nationals, we are flouting the Constitution and betraying the smallholders and congests all over the country.  It is not that I have any personal objection to other races; on the contrary, I think it is a very good idea for Irish people to meet foreigners of every nationality, to mix with them, to understand their viewpoint and to examine their way of life and make comparisons.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think that at our stage of development, with so many problems in connection with the size of our holdings, we should allow the land, the agricultural land in particular, to pass out of the hands of our own people.  That would be a crime against the Irish nation and the betrayal of everything that the Irish peasant, as he was described, stood for down through the generations.  I do not care what may be said about the patriots who were in what I might describe as the higher income group, the nobility, who may have given the leadership, but without the support of the people who lived in miserable conditions down through the years, there could have <Col N="1707" /> been no change in the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem down through the generations was the land problem, the land hunger.  It would be a shocking thing if, when a native Government come in and have control of the destinies of this country, it could be said that it was during their term of office that we had a situation in which thousands and thousands of young Irishmen from congested areas had to flee the country and their places taken by non-nationals.  This problem has existed, as I said, since the end of the war, since 1945 or 1946, and evidence has been given in this House, and outside it, of the extent of the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals over the period from 1945 to 1950.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to a question asked in this House on 31st May, 1950.  At column 901, of Volume 121, I asked the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, what machinery was available whereby the acquisition of land by non-nationals &ldquo;has been and is being kept under observation and if he is satisfield that this machinery is adequate for the purpose in question.&rdquo;  To that question, he replied:</P>
    <P>As regards the period 1944-1950, the Minister for Lands obtained from the Land Commission inspectors details of cases where, to their knowledge, land was purchased by persons other than Irish citizens.  A summary of these reports is regarded as a reasonably reliable measure of such transactions for that period.  From the 1st April, 1948, a record has been kept of all cases in which the 25 per cent. stamp duty imposed by Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, has been paid, and in the future these records will be furnished regularly to the Central Statistics Office, where they will be summarised and kept under review.  In occasional cases where particulars of acreage are not available when the documents are presented for payment of the stamp duty, the required <Col N="1708" /> details will be ascertained by subsequent enquiry.</P>
    <P>The proposed record will be incomplete in so far as it will not contain particulars of cases in which purchases of land by persons other than Irish citizens are exempted from payment of the 25 percent, duty of subsection (13) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, but it will, in my judgment, be adequate for the purpose in view.</P>
    <P>There, back in 1950, the then Parliamentary Secretary was giving his view to the House that there was a big loophole in the 1947 Act, and that it was not possible for anyone to say what land was being bought because of that loophole.  To-day the Minister has again referred to the problems created by that loophole and yet there is no real effort being made, even under the proposal to be contained in the Finance Bill, to stop that loophole.  I do not agree that the 1947 loophole is the only one of importance.  I believe that individuals have been in a position to offer fantastic sums for land and that the 25 per cent. duty is not an insurmountable obstacle as far as the purchase of land is concerned.</P>
    <P>Are we going to suggest that the money brought in by a foreigner, perhaps a black marketeer, perhaps an exploiter or perhaps a reasonable individual, is more valuable than the number of families that could be installed in economic units on such a holding?  That is the first point I want to make.  The Minister has said that the loophole in the 1947 Act has been known to the Government.  But no steps have been taken to remedy the situation and all along the years some of the best land of this country has passed into the hands of non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote briefly from Volume 120 of the 17th May, 1950. I asked a question in this House about a statement made by a Land Commissioner. That Land Commissioner attended a land court in Galway early in 1950 and, in the course of his remarks to that court, he pointed out that over 100,000 acres of the finest <Col N="1709" /> land in Ireland had passed into the hands of non-nationals.  I put down a question in the House to ask the Minister for Lands if he would make a statement on the matter.  The Minister for Lands at that time was Deputy Blowick and he made a long statement which I shall not read to the House as it was irrelevant in many ways.  He pointed out that it was not the duty of the Commissioner to make pronouncements of that nature.</P>
    <P>When I questioned him as to whether he agreed with the figures given he went on to say:</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McQuillan's statement I want to say that I agree with the Commissioner but I want to emphasise that it is most improper that any sense of partiality should be shown by a member of the Land Commission Court or any court while sitting on a bench.</P>
    <P>His only criticism was that the judge should let the cat out of the bag and embarrass the Government.</P>
    <P>What was the sequel to that statement? Deputy Blowick and the then Government, and I have to confess to the fact that I was a member of a Party that supported that Government, removed that Commissioner by sealed order because he made a statement that he should not have made.  There was no denial of the fact that 100,000 acres of the finest land in Ireland had passed into the hands of non-nationals.</P>
    <P>Let us take the statement of the Minister for Lands that we have from 60,000 to 80,000 smallholders whose units have to be increased to bring them up to an economic standard. There are holdings in his constituency and in mine, in Galway, Cork, Kerry and Donegal, where people consider themselves well off if they get five acres extra when a small farm is being divided.  If we take the 100,000 acres referred to by the Commissioner, how many units could be established on that?  If we gave 40 acres to each family we would be in a position to establish 2,400 new holdings with 40 acres of good land.  I think it would be much more desirable to have a large number of families in economic <Col N="1710" /> units on the land rather than see that land in the hands of a few and utilised only for bloodstock breeding, by race horse owners and by retired colonels, deaf in both ears, and drawing large pensions from as far back as the Boer War.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give an estimate of how much land has passed into the hands of non-nationals since 1950 but I think it is fair to suggest that, despite all the publicity over the last ten years, the problem has not decreased but has gone the other way. During the past two or three years there has been plenty of publicity given to certain matters but this matter is like an iceberg; only a small portion of it is above water and the dangerous part is never seen.  That is what has been happening here with regard to the purchase of land by non-nationals.  The large purchases of really good land have taken place quietly.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going to do nothing whatever to prevent those purchases, but I see no reason why the Government should not accept it so that every person in this country would be able to see for himself the extent to which it is going on.  Then we would be able to bring in the necessary legislation on the lines I have suggested.  I have not the slightest doubt that the problem is serious, particularly in Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Longford.  In those counties the purchase of good land by non-nationals has created a serious problem.  A survey of the area within 15 miles of Mullingar would show how difficult it is to find there an Irish citizen on a holding of reasonable size. The majority of the people who have large farms in that locality are non-nationals. On certain days of the week, listening to the conversation that takes place in some of the local taverns and hostels, one would imagine one was in the Kildare Street Club.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to the idea of allowing the purchase of land by non-nationals for industrial purposes. I have no desire to hinder their activities in that regard.  I do not suggest for one moment that we should cut them off completely and not allow them to have facilities here.  In no <Col N="1711" /> circumstances would I suggest that. My main concern all along has been to ensure that the pool of land for the relief of congestion would not be allowed to dry up.  I recollect the former Taoiseach coming in here with a long face and telling us on the Estimate for Lands year after year that the pool of land for the relief of congestion had nearly dried up and that it was no use for the congest or small farmer to expect the Government to take land out of a hat as a conjurer would a rabbit, that the land was not there.  If the land is not available, how is it that a non-national can purchase land?</P>
    <P>As a side light on the mentality of a certain individual who was in this House not so long ago, I should like to mention that the wife of Sir David Kelly, former British Ambassador to Moscow, has written her memoirs.  Sir David and Lady Kelly were a very excellent couple.  They were very fond of Ireland.  On one occasion when they were here, they met the then Taoiseach and suggested to him that they would like to live in Ireland and his reply was: &ldquo;You are very welcome but, for God's sake, stay out of any area where there is congestion&rdquo;.  They wanted to buy a big farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly good advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The mentality shown by that reply showed that the man in question, any more than the Minister, as shown by his intervention, had not any idea of how to go about solving congestion and setting up economic units.  The Minister and his former leader took the view that it was only in the congested areas that it would be undesirable to purchase land. It would be impossible to solve congestion or to raise uneconomic farms to an economic standard if you had to depend on large farms in the congested areas.  It is in the midlands and other areas that we hope to see sufficient land made available to enable the Land Commission to settle families in reasonable comfort on economic units.  To suggest that a foreigner could purchase a large farm in Ireland as long as he stayed away from areas <Col N="1712" /> where it was likely that there would be agrarian trouble showed that the person who made the suggestion believed that the small farmer and the congest could hope for a solution of his problems only if a large farm in their immediate locality became available.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has on numerous occasions in the past four years in this House promised to bring in legislation to protect historical buildings and preserve scenic beauty spots and picturesque localities for the Irish people.  We have been four years looking for that legislation from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of land.  The Minister has referred to the fact that some of the land purchased in the past 12 months were snipe runs, as they have been described.  A great deal of the picturesque land I am referring to may be so described.  The Taoiseach has pointed out that he intended to bring in legislation to protect and preserve these areas so that the Irish people would have the benefit of them.  In a number of instances, portion of the coast line and land containing beautiful scenery has been purchased and the Irish people are now debarred from visiting these places. Is that fair?</P>

I went to the trouble of writing letters to the Minister for External Affairs pointing out what has happened in the case of a number of estates.  I mentioned one owned by a gentleman who is in the Diplomatic Service.  I do not think I should go any further at this stage and give names.  The public were barred by this gentleman from a big estate that he purchased.  The Irish <Col N="1713" /> people had had full right of admission and many hundreds of Irish people visited the estate every Sunday.  They can no longer do so.  The gates are barred because of the desire of this foreigner for a peaceful change from the hurly-burly of Paris, London or New York, as the Minister has described it.</P>

Not alone would they sell Killarney, they would sell their mothers, if they got a few bob out of it.  An American auctioneer was allowed to purchase some of the most beautiful parts of Kerry.  He was dined and wined in this country.  He had an interview with the Taoiseach, who was very nice to him, and with other members of the Government.  Members of the local authority in Kerry tripped over themselves to be nice to this gentleman. They traced his genealogical tree and found he had great-grandmothers who came from Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out, Sir, that this portion of County Kerry was purchased by an auctioneer who, in his own words, had no knowledge of Ireland, who saw this estate advertised in an American newspaper and thought he might be able to sell it to an American multi-millionaire to whom he had already sold a famous club in America, that this multi-millionaire was not interested in purchasing the Killarney estate and Mr. Robertson said he would have a look at the place and decided to have a go. We know what has happened since.</P>
      <P>Is it right that Irish property can be advertised all over the world on the basis on which Killarney and other places were advertised?  Is it any wonder foreigners have got the impression that all they have to do is to come here and get all the land they like? Is it any wonder that the Germans have been misled into believing that all they have to do is come to Dublin and that they will be met by groups of auctioneers tripping over one another to offer them the finest land in Ireland, the best hunting, shooting and fishing, and the most beautiful scenery and private beaches?  You cannot blame the foreigner for the false impression that has been created&mdash;or is it false?</P>
      <P>I wonder what do these people abroad think of us as a nation when they can come in and buy the best land in the country?  Would that be allowed in Germany, Switzerland or elsewhere? My belief, from the limited contacts I have had with these foreigners, is that they have contempt for us because we are not able to look after our own interests. If they are allowed to come in in any greater numbers.  Irishmen once more will be the hewers of wood and drawers of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Minister may talk about the danger to our industrial drive in limiting the power of non-nationals to purchase land.  There is a greater danger to the future of rural Ireland, a greater danger to the welfare of our smallholders and congests, in allowing this influx to continue.  The Government should accept this Bill. All it will do is give us an accurate <Col N="1715" /> picture of the problem and unless the Government are afraid to have that picture shown, there is no logical reason why they should oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to place on record my very keen disappointment at the attitude of the Government and the Minister for Lands, in particular, to this Bill.  It is a reasonable Bill on which the Leader of the Opposition deserves the congratulations of the thousands of Irish people who are alarmed at the appalling unrest that the purchase of land by aliens is causing in many parts of Ireland today.</P>
      <P>In so far as a discussion on this Bill is concerned, the Minister for Lands is not fully informed and one is inclined to wonder whether he is in close touch with his Department or whether he is in space.  Either the Land Commission are out of touch with rural Ireland and the officers of the Minister's Department are not keeping him fully informed or the Minister is not making a serious attempt to find out for himself the serious situation existing in rural Ireland as a result of the wholesale purchase of huge tracts of agricultural land by aliens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here the last report of the Land Commission which gives us a picture of their activities up to 31st March, 1959. There is not one line in that report which gives us any information as to the extent to which land is purchased by aliens.  We all know very well the Land Commission was set up as a temporary institution many years ago and the time is ripe for a general review of its work and policy.  That is why I believe the Bill is so appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sections of the Bill are designed, because of the unrest and uneasiness which prevails in regard to the purchase of land by non-nationals, to enable an assessment of the problem to be made.  It is very clear from the Minister's statement this morning that he has no authoritative <Col N="1716" /> information at his disposal.  The only information he seems to have is: <i>Duirt bean liom go nduirt bean léithe.</i> The account he has so far given us indicates that the records in the Land Commission are not up to date.  This Bill is not asking for any drastic action; it is not asking for a boycott to be established against these people; but only that full information will be available as to the acreage purchased, the valuation, the areas in which purchases have been made and whether such huge tracts of land were purchased convenient to areas in which there is congestion and in which there are many smallholders, farmers' sons, cottage tenants or others who would be well prepared, financed and equipped to work the land.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Opposition has said, no attempt should be made to confuse this issue with the purchase by aliens of land for industrial purposes. Aliens have purchased factory sites here for the expansion of industries, for the erection of recreation halls, canteens for employees, and so on.  Nobody has any objection to that.  On the contrary, in many parts of rural Ireland, anybody who gives employment is welcome.  When we are calling out for increased production for the purpose of building up our exports, we welcome anybody who will give employment and help us to produce goods which will be readily purchased on the export market.  That is something which should be encouraged and is being encouraged by Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The purchase of land for industrial expansion is a different matter from the wholesale purchase of agricultural land.  That is why the Leader of the Opposition has asked that this Bill be given favourable consideration.  It asks that particulars should be given in regard to the areas in which those lands have been purchased.  Every Deputy representing a rural constituency knows there are many smallholders who need land urgently.  We have seen many instances in the west of Ireland, from which the Minister for Lands comes, of small farmers locking up their homes and emigrating, which is in strange contrast with <Col N="1717" /> the purchase of huge tracts of the best land by aliens.  The Minister gives us an idea of the provisions of the Finance Bill which will be circulated shortly, but I cannot see what that has to do with the position which this Bill seeks to remedy.  All we ask is that a register be kept which will throw light on and give information about the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>A register will be kept under the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that register will not be as satisfactory as the type of register envisaged in this Bill.  For that reason, I feel the Minister and his advisers should reconsider the decision on this Bill, and that it should be accepted by him.  In speaking of the purchase or sale of land, we should bear in mind the cherished right which the people have&mdash;and which I hope they will always maintain&mdash;of free sale.  Free sale is an asset and a right of farmers and land owners.  It was won very dearly and they should hold on to it.  No act of this House should in any way interfere with the right of a man to sell his own property and the right of a man to sell his own farm, his own land, should not in any way be interfered with by the State.</P>
      <P>Today huge tracts of land come on the market.  It is not very many years since Most Rev. Dr. Philbin, Bishop of Clonfert, suggested that something should be devised with regard to those huge tracts of land coming on the market. He suggested that there should be a land bank, so to speak, to which those anxious to dispose of huge tracts of land, or those anxious to buy the land for the relief of congestion or otherwise, would have ready recourse. The Land Commission would be very well advised to act on that suggestion of his lordship.  That bank could be used as an agency by those who wanted to dispose of land, or those who were anxious to purchase land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Party Government were responsible for the Land Act which made it possible for the Land Commission to pay the full market <Col N="1718" /> value for land.  I believe that is the best Act ever passed by this House. I am satisfied, because of the statement made by the Minister last year, and the year before, that he asked the Land Commission to enter in the public market for land to a greater extent. When the Land Commission can pay the full market value&mdash;they have the full resources of the State behind them &mdash;it should not be possible for them to be bowled out, so to speak, by aliens who may wish to purchase land.  If the Land Commission and the State were doing their duty, the lands which are now falling into the hands of aliens would be purchased by them because under our Act, they have the right to pay the full market value.</P>
    <P>We have congestion, and if we had not congestion&mdash;I am saying this deliberately for the record&mdash;many young farmers, many of them experts in their own sphere of modern farming, many of them leading lights in the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme, who have not got their own farms or their own holdings, would be able to acquire land.  The time has come when the State should intervene to see that land is rented or leased to those people, with an option by which they could eventually become the owners.  If the circumstances of those people were the first concern and thought of the Government, it would be the duty of the Land Commission or of some agency to intervene and see that lands which are now being purchased by aliens were purchased for them.  We should bear in mind the words of Fintan Lalor: &ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland to have and to hold from God who gave it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is serious.  The Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed out that it causes unrest, uneasiness and queries in many parts of the country today.  He introduced this Bill for the purpose of avoiding more drastic measures which may have to be taken to remedy the situation in three or four years.  There is a growing disease in rural Ireland which will call for very drastic remedy in the course of the next four or five years.  We are anxious <Col N="1719" /> to see that there will be no need for any drastic remedy, bearing in mind that Irishmen have become famous in practically every country in the world and are always welcome.  We have no reason not to extend hospitality to everyone who comes here, but the position has become very serious, and is likely to be more serious in the future, for our own people who require land.  The land on which our own people could live in comfort and in decency is being swept from under their eyes by aliens.  That is what we are anxious about.</P>

      <P>May I address <Col N="1720" /> this query to the Minister?

      <P>We have been a long time waiting for information of that kind.  I want to place on record that the time has come for a general review of the whole land policy.  The position has become very serious.  It is the policy of the Fine Gael Party to review the work and the policy of the Land Commission, and this Bill is a step in that direction.  Because of the seriousness of the situation in relation to the land policy in Ireland, the Land Commission now have notice that the policy of our Party is to review that policy and the work of the Land Commission.  This is one of the first instalments in that regard.</P>

      <P>I have expressed my view that there is nothing in this Bill that is not acceptable.  For all we know, if this Bill were passed and the register compiled, it might not <Col N="1721" /> reveal an alarming state of affairs, or it might reveal a far more alarming state of affairs than this House anticipates, but it would give the true picture. I suggest the Government have a reason for refusing to accept the Bill.  Possibly if the register were set up, as envisaged in this Bill, it might be over-embarrassing for them.  That is the only reason they will not accept the Bill.  They want to avoid embarrassment on this matter.  If they were seriously interested in doing their job, they would have no hesitation in saying that this was a Bill designed to give information, that they had no hesitation in compiling that information, and that they would try as far as possible to remedy the position in relation to the purchase of land by aliens.</P>

      <P>I am proud to have put my name to this Bill.  I am one of those who asked questions recently which alarmed the country by drawing attention to the peaceful penetration of our best lands by foreigners.  This Bill is a very reasonable one.  It merely asks that a register be kept so that we will know what land is being taken by foreigners, who they are and where they come from.  I am very disappointed that the Minister does not see fit to accept it.  It is not 15 years since we had hell to pay on the annual debate on land division.  At that time, the Minister was a revolutionary in the Fianna Fáil Party.  He told us what he would do with the land of Meath, Westmeath and Kildare, if he were Minister.  The people of the West would be flooded into it and there would not be a rancher left in those counties.  But to-day the revolutionary of yesterday is a fine conservative Minister who would love to &ldquo;hob nob&rdquo; with the big and the mighty and who has forgotten the congest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In a recent statement, the German Ambassador did more than the Government and anybody else to ease the situation when he called on German nationals not to <Col N="1722" /> purchase agricultural land in Ireland but to purchase only land for industrial purposes.  That was a fine gesture.</P>
      <P>The position to-day is that any foreigner with a lot of money can purchase any large estate here he likes.  They have money to burn.  We do not know where they got it and we do not care, but they are able to offer land owners here almost double the value of their land.  Most of the large land owners are not wealthy. They are over-taxed and they are not able to keep up big houses and big estates.  They are very glad of a way out.  But, like all those men who were planted here in the past, they would sell to anybody before they would sell to an Irishman.  They would bow their heads in shame rather than give the land to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Land Commission should take over any estates coming on the market and allocate them amongst deserving Irish applicants. All the trouble we have in the world to day is land trouble.  Look at Africa, India, Cuba or anywhere else.  Is it not all agrarian trouble, with a majority being exploited by a minority?  But the day has come when the majorities have risen up and the majority will rise up here again. We do not want that to happen.  We want an Irish Government to say: &ldquo;There is no need for a revolution because we will place on the land as many Irish as we can in reasonable comfort.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is no use picking out the Americans, British, Germans, Jews &mdash; they are all the same.  The land of Ireland is sacred to every Irishman.  I believe in free sale, but it should be confined to our own people.  Ninety per cent. of our farmers are congests who have been living in miserable conditions for many years and who will continue to do so for years to come.  We are asking the Minister to ensure that any land coming on the market is made available to settle Irish people.  There is no greater safeguard against the ill winds of the world than happy home-steads on reasonably sized holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> If we could have happy families settled on 40 acres of land, that would be a foundation that even Communism could not crush.  I shall not condemn the Land Commission, because they have done much splendid work.  I see it in my own county&mdash; happy families working with their coats off; Meath men working together with men from other counties.  I know they have a hard life because the holdings they got are slightly too small.  If you could have a holding of 40 acres with a house, you would be doing something for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>An effective check is needed.  At present there is a sell-out of large holdings all over the country.  Up to a few months ago, one rarely heard of Germans buying land here.  Today they are in the position that they can buy up any estate coming on the market here, if we allow them.  But it is the duty of the Irish Government to step in and stop these purchases. We should not allow thousands of acres of our land to be sold when our own people are on the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Around those estates are men whose ancestors lived there for hundreds of years.  These men are waiting to get back what is their birthright&mdash;this land that was confiscated and taken from them hundreds of years ago.  I may be a bit narrow-minded, but I come from the land of the Pale, where I see vast wealth in the hands of a few while the majority are living in poverty.  I see men trying to rear large families on small holdings, who have to send two or three of them across the water in order to make a few shillings to prevent the homestead being closed up.  We are asking that the agricultural land of Ireland be put at the disposal of the Land Commission and divided up amongst Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was no problem in my part of the country.  In the past few months, over six estates in my constituency, amounting to thousands of acres, have been sold to Germans. But for the questions I put down here, and the headings they received in the papers, more land would have been sold.  Five or six other estates were <Col N="1724" /> ready to sell out, but now they cannot do so.  In this Bill, we are doing nothing more than ventilating a national grievance.  By it we are forcing the Government's hand to do something. If they can bring in a better Bill, more power to them.  This Bill is a modest measure, and I would have signed my name to a far more drastic Bill.  The Government are hanging on to power, but they are not doing the things the people want.  They are now completely conservative.  They want to &ldquo;hob nob&rdquo; with the big people.  It is a shame for them.</P>
    <P>I always found in many countries that that is what happens.  You are a super-revolutionary today.  Then, when you mix with the white collars, the bows and ties, and the long tails you begin to get very conservative.  As you go on in years, you get all too wise and you say: &ldquo;What were we fighting for?  They are not worth fighting for.&rdquo; They mix with the wrong type of people.  If they mixed with the mass of the people down the country who are living in a bad situation, whose houses are being closed week after week and whose families are being reared for export and nothing more, they might have a better realisation of the gravity of our situation. Those are the things which should concern this House.  If we did nothing but divide our land into suitable economic units and place as many people as possible in economic holdings we would do a splendid job.  We need not worry about markets, and so on. People would find their own level and markets.  What we want is contentment and peace among the people.</P>
    <P>I intend to speak further on this subject on the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  I am completely disappointed with the Minister&mdash;the revolutionary of yesterday, the conservative of today&mdash;shaking his head at the idea that we would dare to bring in a Bill to focus attention on the land position.  He says he will introduce a measure.  I have heard that for the past ten years and nothing has come yet.</P>
    <P>I heard about the 25 per cent. purchase tax to stop foreigners.  What are <Col N="1725" /> the facts?  People were working in Ireland to bring in the foreigners by hook or by crook and to get around the different Acts.  Those things must be stopped.  We must let people outside know that we want an industrial revival in this country, that any money they desire to spend here is welcome to be spent here for that purpose, that they will get the full protection of the State in that matter but that our agricultural land is wanted for the Irish people and Irish farmers so as to bring prosperity to them.</P>
    <P>We are proud of this Bill.  It will focus attention on the matter and make the Government realise that something must be done.  If we get nothing more than a recognition by the Government and the Land Commission of the seriousness of the position we shall have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  It is a simple, straightforward, modest Bill.  There is nothing very revolutionary about it.  It asks the Government to set up a simple register in the Land Commission so that we shall have a record of those aliens who purchase land in this country.  The Minister said twice during the debate that he will set up a register under the legislation he now contemplates.  If that be so, will he not give a guarantee that he will incorporate this Bill in his new legislation?  The Minister also said that the machinery under this Bill will be too costly.  If he sets up a register I can visualise that the machinery under the Bill embodying that register will be equally and perhaps far more costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to relieve the perturbation that exists about the acquisition of land.  There is no nation in the world that is so land conscious as the Irish nation.  No people in the world become so perturbed about land acquisition or get so touchy about it as the Irish people.  That is because of their history, because of the long and tenacious struggle by the tenant farmers of this island against the oppression of landlordism.  There is that slow penetration at the moment. Our own Bishop of Cork, His Lordship <Col N="1726" /> the Most Reverend Dr. Lucey, warned against that some time ago. I have not his exact words.  He implied that, whatever else foreigners might take, we should see to it that they do not purchase our land for agricultural purposes.  That is serious.  When our exiles go abroad very few of them do so to purchase land.  An occasional one may become a rancher in Canada if he saves enough money to provide himself with a farm there.  However, that is very rare.  Therefore, there is very great need for a Bill of this kind particularly when we have so many uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>If there is land available for purchase by foreigners let it be available for purchase by our own people and, when they have not the capital, let the Land Commission take it over and parcel it out to those who are in need or it.  We have thousands of young farmers who have not the capital to purchase farms.  I speak now for Munster.  Whatever farms are being purchased in Munster are being purchased by people who are changing their holdings or by people who have capital enough to instal one member of the family on the farm that is for sale.  However, there are many estates which the Land Commission could purchase on the open market for the relief of congests.  It must be tantalising to those who are anxious for land to find that the land that should be theirs through some means or other is being taken over by non-nationals. These things are very important.</P>
    <P>There is no great fundamental difference between what the Minister envisages and what this Bill purports to do.  If he is anxious and sincere about the legislation he has spoken of I can see no reason why he should object to this Bill, why he should accept the principle of this Bill, why he would not guarantee to incorporate in that legislation the main provision of this Bill which is to set up a register of non-nationals who purchase land here.  If there were any realism in the Government, I should certainly say they would accept that provision and incorporate it in their new Bill or accept this Bill because of its simplicity. <Col N="1727" /> It is not an extravagant measure. It does not provide for unduly costly machinery, as the Minister alleges.  I cannot understand how that can be the case in such a short, simple measure of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I want to say it is very much to be regretted that the Government have not seen their way to adopt the Bill.  It is often alleged that the Opposition are not constructive. The Government should welcome a clear indication from the Opposition that they are desirous of giving any help possible and have introduced this Bill as an instance of their willingness to assist in finding a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>It cannot be alleged that the problem does not exist.  The enactment of the proposals in this Bill would prove the extent to which these grievances exist.  They would definitely obviate any aggravation of the grievances. There can be no doubt in the mind of any Deputy about the position.  He must know in his own locality of the activities of people engaged in the sale of land.  They direct their eyes not to their neighbours, not to parts of the country where people look for the chance to move to better land. Having slaved for many years to set aside £ upon £ to see the day when they could set up a son or a daughter on land that is better than that on which they themselves slaved for so long these people face the competition of foreign investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat with others who have spoken here our willingness to welcome and to give every assistance to foreigners who desire to secure sites for industrial purposes.  I must confirm what others have said, that a word of congratulation and gratitude must be expressed to the German Minister for having so clearly put the point to his own nationals in regard to conditions in Ireland.  In our own localities, we know that auctioneers and others engaged in the business of selling land are now advertising in German papers and getting responses <Col N="1728" /> to an alarming extent.  If this thing is allowed to go on, where will it end?</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to appeal to the Minister to realise the urgency of this matter and to realise that it is a concomitant to other problems we have. We have had the report of the Commission on Emigration and they stated quite clearly that the provision of farms for young creditworthy farmers on a credit or other basis is one of the solutions they would recommend.  Now that the Land Commission and Government have admitted that this is a serious problem, one would imagine they would avail of this measure as one way of assisting in alleviating the problem.</P>
    <P>The major problem we have to contend with is to deal with these people who have been abusing the laws. Everybody must realise that, and it is indicative of the position that must exist that the Minister could not get one Deputy supporting the Government to rise and support him in the unfortunate stand he has taken in regard to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this Bill.  It is a pity some of the speakers who preceded me were not down to see the conditions that prevail in my constituency.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making this point because it is well known by the people on whose behalf I am speaking that it is foreigners who are keeping them out of or depriving them of the holdings to which they are <Col N="1729" /> entitled.  I have been sent here, not as a fully-fledged parliamentarian, but to make a case on behalf of the people amongst whom I live.  It is unfortunate that some Ministers and those who live in the cities could not live for a short time among the small people in my constituency.  If they did, they would very soon make provision to provide economic holdings for these people.  No later than last Sunday, I was speaking to a man with a family of eight who appealed to me to do something about getting him into the Rockingham estate in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I may be ruled out of order again but another important point is that a young man who makes an application for a farm of land is told: &ldquo;You have nothing in your possession; we cannot consider you at all.&rdquo;</P>

They said that if they were farmers, they would have a chance, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we are only labourers and we will never get anywhere.&rdquo; It is on behalf of these people that I am trying to make a case here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McLaughlin is perfectly right.  The whole problem of civil disturbance and civil <i>malaise</i> involves these very people for whom Deputy McLaughlin speaks.  These are young fellows who want a bit of land but who are told they are not eligible because they are landless men. But a landless man can come here from Thuringia, from the U.S. or from Britain and once he has a fat pocket book, he can buy all the land he <Col N="1730" /> wants.  One of the penalties of trying with responsibility and with forbearance to do something is that you are liable to be derided by the Minister for Lands who says: &ldquo;Why did you not provide for this in your Bill?&rdquo; I did not provide for this in the Bill because my Bill had a very limited scope and purpose but it arose out of the very matters referred to by Deputy McLaughlin.  If we were not living in a country with landless people looking for land and where there are congests looking for land, then we would have no problem at all.  If we were living in Texas where millions of acres are readily available for anybody who wants to try his hand at farming, if we were living in Oklahoma where farmers are coming and going every year, there would be no problem.  What is wrong here is that we have not sufficient agricultural land to cater for our own people who require it.</P>
      <P>I could have made a speech here that would set the House on fire, if I wanted to do that, on that very theme, but, very deliberately, I avoided that and I tried to keep the whole discussion keyed down by saying that the very circumstances Deputy McLaughlin described are liable to inflate in the minds of the public into a very large and alarming problem something that may or may not be as big as the popular mind thinks it is.  My case is that the first thing we must do, if we are to proceed with ordinary prudence, is to find out what are the true dimensions of this problem.  The only way I can envisage that being done is to set up a register in the Land Commission in which aliens purchasing Irish land will be required to register the transaction.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be rough or rude to the Minister, but it is only cod to be getting up and referring to a Bill of this kind and picking on its drafting as he did.  The purpose of any private Bill is to set out a principle and if that principle is accepted, let the people whose job it is draft the Bill so that it will be administratively effective.  He has a whole retinue of such people and they are paid to draft Bills.  I have not any such retinue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;effectively to establish a register in which aliens purchasing Irish land will be required to record the transaction for inspection by the public at large.  The machinery to do that can be devised by those who are paid to devise it.  I am not, and I am not trained to do it.  I ought not be trained to do it; I am not a civil servant; I am a politician.  I have my job to do and they have their jobs to do.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Opposition in bringing in a private Bill of this kind is to introduce a Bill enshrining a broad general principle, provided they say in the introductory remarks that, if there are any administrative adjustments required in the machinery of the Bill to give effect to the broad principle, by all means, let them be made.  We are quite prepared to accept any amendment from the Government side which is considered necessary to make the Bill administratively effective.</P>
      <P>Is there anybody in the House who disagrees with that proposition in our circumstances at present, when the common talk which is to be heard all over the country is of foreigners buying land?  And, in the circumstances most effectively described in simple language by Deputy McLaughlin, does every Deputy not agree with me that it is desirable that all of us should know to what extent foreigners are buying agricultural land in this country? It seems to me it is as plain as A, B, C, and it seems absolutely certain that if we do not do it, there will be an explosion sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has produced here the proposals of the Minister for Finance. All the proposals of the Minister for <Col N="1732" /> Finance are directed towards protecting the revenue.  My Bill has nothing to do with the revenue position at all. I have every sympathy with the Minister for Finance who, having imposed a tax of 25 per cent. on the purchase of land by aliens, must now devise whatever machinery he thinks will be effective to ensure that the revenue will be faithfully paid by those aliens who purchase land here.  But that is not my interest at all.  I do not care whether or not they pay 25 per cent.  If they are buying land to the detriment of the people for whom Deputy McLaughlin speaks, we must put our heads together and devise a means to stop them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in enacting a legislative sledge hammer to break a monkey nut.  If, on inquiry, it is established that there has not been any substantial purchase of agricultural land by aliens, or if it is established that the only purchases of lands have been purchases of what the Minister describes as &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo;, large houses with appurtenant demesnes, houses which would fall down if they were not purchased and maintained by men with independent wealth, then I think a wholly different situation arises.  I think, in regard to a great many of these old places, that it is a very good thing, if the native owner is no longer financially circumstanced to keep them up and a foreigner with wealth comes in and buys them and gives local employment and keeps the demesne in nice order and employs men to maintain it and employs other people about the house; they are very welcome provided they are law-abiding citizens and live a decent life.  I do not see why anybody should have any grudge against or an edge on them.</P>
    <P>It is because I want to emphasise that and say to the industrialists that they are as welcome as the flowers in May, it is because I want to say to the man of property who would like to buy a home here and to live amongst us in a law-abiding and decent way that he is as welcome as the flowers in May that I want to set up a register which will reveal and distinguish as between the person who is coming in here to buy agricultural land <Col N="1733" /> on a speculative basis and the man who wants to make a home here.  I want to be able to say to the former, in as friendly a way as possible, as the German ambassador himself said: &ldquo;Do not do it.  That kind of investment is not welcome.&rdquo;  If, in spite of that, the practice persisted and no remonstrance was of avail, then we should legislate here calmly and peacefully and prudently to make it impossible for aliens from any part of the world to speculate in Irish land.</P>
    <P>Some people may ask what is meant when we talk of speculating in Irish land?  The plain fact is&mdash;we may as well face it&mdash;there is a lot of hot money floating around the world at the present time.  What is it?  It is money of wealthy people who are living under the shadow of Communism or who apprehend devaluation in the countries in which their wealth is normally held. There is one commodity that never depreciates, and that is land.  The plain truth of it is that on the continent of Europe at the present time the population is so dense in Western Germany and Holland and parts of Belgium that the price of land is fantastic; compared with the price ruling here, land here appears to be selling for virtually nothing.  Now a man who wants to stack away £100,000 where he believes it will be safe and sees land in Holland making £400 or £500 an acre, and land in Germany making £200 or £300 an acre, and is informed by an Irish auctioneer that he can offer him all the land he wants to buy of the first quality at £60 or £80 or £100 an acre says to himself: &ldquo;This is good.  Get me 2,000 acres of that land, or 5,000 acres, and I will let you manage it.  Set it for me.  Even though I get only two per cent. or three per cent. on my money, it will be safe, and I will get an income out of it.&rdquo;  That is that.</P>
    <P>He sees no harm in it.  He does not understand our history or our background. He has never heard the story Deputy Joe McLaughlin told here to-day, but that story is as familiar to us as an old shoe.  We know what Deputy McLaughlin is talking about. He speaks for only four minutes and in that four minutes he makes us quite familiar with the story but he would <Col N="1734" /> take a month to tell the same story to a stranger.  We all know the story and we can fill in the blanks.  These people do not know the story.  Mark you, they are not evilly-disposed persons.  They are just stumbling into a situation they do not understand.  It is a situation we should not allow to develop.</P>
    <P>There is no useful purpose to be served by recapitulating the story all over again.  The purpose of the Bill is not to provide machinery to deter purchases of land at this time.  The purpose of the Bill is accurately to define the scope of the problem.  If, the machinery of this Bill having achieved that purpose, remedial legislation were necessary, we could undertake that legislation calmly and prudently and without acrimony or vindictiveness.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt?  When explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, I said that it is proposed the Revenue Commissioners will keep the Land Commission informed of purchases by non-national interests.  In that way the Land Commission will be in a position to assemble the essential information.  Surely that will meet the purpose the Deputy has in mind quite effectively.</P>

I want a register to which everybody&mdash; legislator, auctioneer, solicitor and interested citizen&mdash;can have access and which he can claim the right to inspect to find out what lands in his county, constituency, or neighbourhood have been acquired by aliens.  I think that would be a salutary thing from every point of view and the Minister would be better advised to say: &ldquo;We accept the principles of the Bill.  We may have certain proposals to make with regard to amending it to make it administratively more effective or easier to carry out.&rdquo;  If the Minister had said that I should have been glad to tell him that virtually any amendments he would propose would be acceptable to me for I fully appreciate the ability of the personnel of the Land Commission to improve very easily the administrative machinery suggested by me. I believe in the principle underlying <Col N="1735" /> this Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill.  If the Minister is resolute in his determination to oppose the Bill, then we propose to divide the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 13 to 15, to delete &ldquo;in conacre or for the purposes of agistment or for temporary depasturage or meadowing&rdquo;, and to insert &ldquo;for any term&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is to Section 9 and it arises out of a point raised by Deputy Sweetman.  As the section stands, it appears to cover only lettings for one year and he thought that if there were a letting for more than one year, it would not be covered.  I am informed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they have never come across a case where letting was for more than one year but we see no objection to covering lettings for more than that period and that is done by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as the Minister has stated.  I was interested to hear the Minister for Finance casually confirming that one never hears of a letting for more than one year. It is quite true that the practice has been that letting in conacre has been for an eleven months period.  I have heard that stated in the House here and I have heard the Minister for Lands and, I think, others on the Government front benches say that there is some Land Act which makes it feasible to make lettings for a longer period than eleven months.</P>
      <P>The old understanding in rural Ireland was that if you let conacre lands for more than eleven months, you gave a tenant a right and that the tenant, under some Land Act going back to the early part of this century, could apply to the Land Commission to have that land vested in him.  The Minister for Lands and other Ministers have since stated that there has been an amending Land Act which removed that provision and that there is now no objection to a conacre letting of five or even ten years.</P>
      <P>It has been argued strongly that this system of the eleven months letting ought to be abandoned altogether because it operates to injure land, inasmuch as a man who is only taking an eleven months letting will take everything he can take out of the land and then hand it back to the owner.  If he were free to take a five or ten years letting, it would be worth his while to fertilise the land properly so that he could get his own return out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Agricultural Credit Corporation have advised the Minister that they never heard of a letting for more than one year, that may have been the practice in the past, but I understand it is now the practice of the Department of Agriculture, where conacre lettings have to be made, as in the case of a widow with a young family who is not able to work the land herself but who wishes to keep it for the eldest son, that they make lettings, not for one year but for longer periods.  There appears to be a point of contradiction between one Minister and another.  I would gather from what the Minister has said that he subscribes to the proposal that these lettings should be for less than 12 months.  I think it is the policy of the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1739" /> and the Department of Lands to encourage people to make conacre lettings for longer than one year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had experiences that back up what Deputy Dillon has just said.  There is a whole race of young men, big farmers' sons and small farmers' sons, going through the country and taking land in conacre. They always endeavour, when they take a field, to get a three year letting at least.  The letting itself is only for 11 months but the agreement is there between them that they can get the land for three years.  In nearly every case, it is mutually agreed as to what manures are to be put down.  This was not the case where a man was only going to put in a grain crop.  He scratched it any way he could and did not do the best job of cleaning up when he was getting out.  It has now become common for conacre lettings to be for a much longer period than one year, and two and three years lettings are very common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the law as it is now, there is no danger in the case of a person letting his lands for three, four or five years of the tenant having the right to apply to the Land Commission to have the land vested in him. The matter arose because there were some proposals during the past three or four years to help farmers' sons to acquire holdings on easy terms.  One of the suggestions made was that they become tenants for 15 or 20 years and then become the holders.  There were various memoranda circulated at the time and I saw a good case being made for longer lettings.  It was argued that in the one year letting, the person taking the land was inclined to take all he could out of it and that if he had a five year letting, he would be inclined to treat it well.  I do not think that, although these ideas have been circulated, either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Agriculture has decided on any definite policy on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation are liberalised by this Bill to enable them to extend credit in a wider variety of circumstances than was the case here-tofore. They still have retained this limit of 50 per cent. of the value of the farmers' holdings.  I think it is a mistake to retain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they would have been wiser to leave themselves even greater leeway there.  We have to face the fact that we are either going to trust the Agricultural Credit Corporation to do their work efficiently or else throw our hat at the whole thing. Artificial restrictions of that kind create anomalous situations.  It seems to me to be a wholly absurd situation if the Agricultural Credit Corporation come across a case&mdash;and they may come across many&mdash;in which they say to themselves: &ldquo;If we were free to advance up to 75 per cent. of the value of this chap's holding, we could really get him off to a flying start but, if this arbitrary limit of 50 per cent. is put upon us, all we are going to do is launch him on a long struggle in which he will be pulling the devil by the tail all his life and will really never get cracking at all.&rdquo;  All that is involved is a matter of £2,000 or £3,000 but it may make the difference between failure and success.  In my judgment, it is absurd to put the responsibility on the Agricultural Credit Corporation of making a viable loan and yet restricting them by a 50 per cent. ceiling, if in their considered judgment a higher percentage would make a loan truly viable and provide a young farmer with a chance of really going places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our great difficulty is to get farmers effectively to avail of credit.  I know from my personal experience that if <Col N="1741" /> a farmer has a holding of land as small as 50 acres, with access to unlimited finance, he can get a comfortable living off so small a holding as that, if he has diversified production, on the one hand, or if he has very highly specialised production, on the other, but he can make a success of neither, if, at every hand's turn, he has to scrimp and save because capital is not available to him fully to exploit his project.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that if you go the length of effectively making available to him unlimited capital, you have to take precautions to ensure that he is competent (1) to use capital and (2) to carry out with maximum efficiency the day-to-day operation of the enterprise in which his capital is employed. There is no effective method of doing that in this country, except providing an adequate national agricultural advisory service.</P>
    <P>It makes me sometimes despair when I am dealing even with farmers but mainly with Deputies of this House whose lives have been mainly spent in the eastern counties of Ireland.  Their reaction is: &ldquo;What will a parish agent be doing in Athy?&rdquo; Of course, the answer is that where you are dealing with large farmers handling 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 acres of land, in the vast majority of cases, they have no need of agricultural advice at all, for the simple reason that they have ample capital to be-speak that advice for themselves if they want it, but if you transfer yourself to the real backbone of the agricultural community in this country, that is, the farm-owing small farmer who employs virtually no labour, and if you put unrestricted capital at his disposal, unless you match it with an adequate agricultural advisory service, you are really giving him a rope to hang himself.  It is absolutely insane to give to a 40, 50 or 60 acre farmer who is running the place with himself and his family access to unlimited credit without adequate technical advice, because, in seven cases out of ten, he will go bust.</P>
    <P>People argue that the existing advisory services are adequate for the <Col N="1742" /> purpose.  They are not and we all know they are not, (1) because their personnel is too strictly limited, (2) because the direction is not dynamic, and (3) because they are so far divorced from the Department of Agriculture that they cannot be fully effective.</P>
    <P>We now have splendidly trained personnel available in the country in the graduates of the schools of agriculture and from our universities and we have an excellent young agricultural research institute.  We have thousands of small farmers throughout the west, north-west and south-west of this country the output of whose land would be doubled, if they had the technical assistance to get from their land what it is capable of producing. If we could realise that aim, we would provide a decent livelihood for thousands of small farmers who are at present sinking into poverty and as a result therefore are locking their doors and clearing out of the country.</P>
    <P>It is only three weeks since I saw a young married man&mdash;I well remember the day he was married; he married a very nice girl who had a bit of money; and he was a hardworking, excellent chap&mdash;lock his door and take his wife and five children to Birmingham, for the simple reason that he could not live here.  He had got caught between the rising cost of living for a large young family and the limited output of his farm and the bad prices he had been getting for the past two years.  It is tragic and disastrous that that should be going on when it is perfectly possible for us to stop it.  I would be enthusiastic for this liberalisation of agricultural credit, if I felt it was going to be brought effectively into the hands of those who really want it.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that where a man with 1,000 acres of land comes to me and says he has not adequate capital, I find it hard to be patient.  If he has not adequate capital, why on earth does he not sell 300 acres of land and put the £25,000 or £30,000 he gets for it into adequately farming the remaining 700 acres.  Would he not have plenty?  And it is probably the wise thing for him to do instead of plunging <Col N="1743" /> into debt on which interest has to be paid.</P>
    <P>When you come to the small farmer, an entirely different situation exists and it is so familiar to us who live amongst them that it is hard adequately to expound it in this House where so many people do not apprehend what you are talking about. There is a strong, deep rooted prejudice amongst small farmers against going into debt.  The small farmers of Ireland have a horror of debt.  There is the extraordinary anomaly in rural Ireland that a man will borrow money to deposit it in the bank.  That is hard to believe but I have known such a man to borrow £15 to even up £285 he got for cattle so that he could deposit £300 in the bank.  I have known such a man to seek a neighbour to go security for him in the bank to get money out rather than touch his deposit.</P>
    <P>That may be irrational but it will take some time to educate that out of the people's minds.  It is not such an utterly foolish prejudice as at a first glance it might seem.  That is the nest egg against a rainy day.  That is the nest egg which may one day be wanted for the dowry, the nest egg which gives a man a sense of comfortable security. They have a horror of going into debt and what we call credit, to them is debt.  There is no doubt whatever they want to have it explained to them fully that credit profitably and providently employed is a good thing.</P>
    <P>In addition to that deep prejudice against going into debt, they have a deeper prejudice against new procedures and methods.  Many people are inclined to describe that as the inherent conservatism of the Irish farmer. That is all nonsense.  They live so near the edge of poverty that they cannot afford to make a mistake.  They have a deep conviction that if they carry on the way their fathers carried on, at the end of the year, they will be able to meet their bills.  If you say to them: &ldquo;Change that completely and you will be able not only to meet the bills but to increase your stock substantially,&rdquo; the reaction is: &ldquo;That is all right but <Col N="1744" /> I would like to see somebody do it. I am not going to do it.&rdquo;  They do not want to try because they do not want to be in the position that they cannot provide their wives and families with the modest amenities which their fathers and mothers provided when they were young.</P>
    <P>There is no way of breaking that vicious circle except by locating an agricultural advisory officer in practically every rural parish to help these people to change their methods and to change their approach to the use of credit as a means of expanding their production.  As I have told the House before, more than half the grass grown on my land today is preserved in the form of silage.  We happened to have an agricultural advisory officer in our district who was prepared to advocate it. When the men working on the farm were reluctant to experiment in making it, he came down and made it himself. He said he would come back the day the pit was opened to demonstrate that its contents were eminently acceptable to the livestock on the farm.  It might never have been made but the fact that he came and shared in its making and carried out his demonstration to the point of going down into the silage pit and making it with the men introduced a most beneficent revolution in the practice on that farm.  Nothing short of that will achieve our purpose.</P>
    <P>I was never more convinced of anything than I am of this&mdash;and I know as much about rural Ireland as most people in this country&mdash;we are in imminent danger of seeing a detestable social revolution in a large part of this country in which the tenant proprietors of the land will give up the struggle. I believe, if that should come to pass, the whole sheet anchor of our society will go.  I think it was the Minister for Health who recently described that as &ldquo;Mr. Dillon's pastoral Ballaghaderreen approach.&rdquo;  I understand that.  The Minister for Health was born and reared in Belfast and has lived all his life in Dublin and he knows as much about rural Ireland as a Baluba chief-tain in the Congo.  It is just ignorance. He does not know what he is talking about but those of us who do know <Col N="1745" /> about rural Ireland realise the infinite value to our whole society of that vast army of property-owning small farmers living in dignity and security on their own holding.  If they are driven off, we will have nothing left but a spurious industrial set-up which will be no substitute for our main industry which must be indissolubly associated with our principal natural resource which is the land.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point I want to press upon the Government and the people, of whom I have much higher hopes than I have of the Government, that if we are to provide credit, it must be credit which will be providently and profitably employed. To do that, we must ensure that the small farmers have ready access to that credit, and, in measuring the quantity of credit they may require and in the use they subsequently make of it, they stand in just as much need of expert technical advice as does any industrial concern that may call in industrial consultants to help it in its day-to-day problems.  The small farmers of Ireland have nowhere to look for that advice, except to the Department of Agriculture.  It is the only place they will get it effectively, consistently and of a standard which will be of real value to them.</P>
    <P>I know all the arguments about the difficulty of getting the personnel, about the difficulty of supervising it from the Department of Agriculture, but if you can associate the service with the parish, there is one very good check that can be made on the efficacy and efficiency of any agent, that is, simply to go and look at the parish for which he is responsible.  If it is not going ahead, you say: &ldquo;There is no progress here.  It may be that you do not get on with the people or that the people do not get on with you.  It may be that you cannot put over to those people what you are concerned to put over to them.  The net result is that this parish is going down instead of going up.  We will have to put you somewhere else and find somebody who can make this parish progress.&rdquo; All that will take time, trouble and unremitting zeal on the part of whoever <Col N="1746" /> is responsible in the Department of Agriculture, but it is the essential concomitant of any liberalisation of agricultural credit and the essential prerequisite of the economic survival of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised a question with regard to the limit to which the Agricultural Credit Corporation can give a loan as part of the value of a holding.  He raised that point on Second Stage also.  I had it conveyed to the Board of the Corporation for their consideration.  It is a matter for them to decide, as I said. It is within their Articles of Association. They told me they are going to change their Articles of Association to permit of loans of 66-2/3rds per cent. instead of 50 per cent.  I would certainly have no objection, if they raised it to 100 per cent.  I have asked the Department to convey Deputy Dillon's arguments on the point to them for their consideration.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, that there are certain small farmers who are very loath to burden themselves with a loan.  So far as my experience goes, the small farmers who make ends meet and struggle to make them meet, are afraid to go beyond their present capacity by borrowing more money.  The man who does not make ends meet is more inclined to look for a loan, but he is not as good a type.</P>
      <P>I also agree fully with Deputy Dillon that a loan can prove dangerous, unless the borrower has the knowledge to use the money profitably.  Of course, that knowledge would naturally be got from technical advisers, but I am afraid I cannot go any further than that.  I am not in a position to argue with the Deputy as to whether the present system of agricultural advice is the most efficient, or whether a departure from that system, as he advocates, would be preferable.  I must leave that point to be raised by the Deputy on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture where it can be discussed more profitably than it could be discussed on this Bill.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy McGilligan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy McGilligan last night and his remarks led me to believe that his one ambition was to report progress in order that he could bring forward some very important points this afternoon.  He spoke of the state of national emergency and asked why it had never been revoked.  He pointed out that the war has been over for 16 years, and said that surely something should be done.  I am not familiar with the arguments for and against this matter but I do know that during six of those 16 years, Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues were in charge of the affairs of State.</P>
      <P>It would seem to me that if Deputy McGilligan was so intense about it, he would have succeeded in convincing his own colleagues that there was a necessity to take action.  If he could not convince his own colleagues, I am quite sure the Government must have ample reason for not acceding to his request.  After all, he had the opportunity to deal with it and nothing was done.  We have come to expect from Fine Gael and, if you like, from Deputy McGilligan, in particular, negative criticism and no constructive proposals.  As I said, I thought Deputy McGilligan was trying to fill in time so that he could bring forward some very important points here this afternoon which he wanted reported on the radio and in the Press, the morning papers and so forth.  I came here this afternoon to hear the points, but apparently Deputy McGilligan had no point at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also noticed efforts from the far side of the House in recent <Col N="1748" /> times to create the impression abroad that there is discontent among the Garda Síochána, that they are dissatisfied about their pay and conditions, and that they have a very real grievance.  In his usual fashion last night, Deputy McGilligan dwelt on the matter and attempted to build up the impression that that discontent in fact exists.  I should like to know if I am right in thinking that now, for the first time, the Garda have arbitration and conciliation machinery available to them, and that all matters of pay and allowances are dealt with by that machinery.  If that is so, I should like to know what is the reason for the discontent.  The remedy of conciliation machinery, with ultimate resort to arbitration, is available to the Garda to settle all questions.  If I am not right in saying that, I hope someone will tell me what the position is, but if I am right, the House must agree with me that this campaign is absolutely dishonest and deplorable.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department of Justice on the improvements in the activities of the Garda Síochána during the past year.  Some laws which were never seriously enforced in the past are now being enforced. No matter what people think of the law, it is being enforced.  It is the same for everyone.  Surely in a democratic society, we must all approve of the principle of one law for everyone, with no special concessions for special people.</P>
    <P>I also think the addition of the Ban-Garda was very useful to the Force.  The introduction of the white batons and the white coats and so forth have done a lot to improve the appearance of the Garda and their ability to control traffic.  These new developments are certainly very welcome. We can be very proud of our police force.  They are all well-educated, intelligent, courteous and efficient men and women.  The improvements in regard to traffic control, and the fact that the general appearance of the Garda has improved, will give a very favourable impression to tourists.</P>
    <P>Last year, I requested the Minister to consider the addition of mounted <Col N="1749" /> police to the police force.  Last night our bloodstock got a tremendous boost in Italy.  With the tremendous reputation our bloodstock has all over the world &mdash;racehorses, hunters and working horses&mdash;a mounted police force would not only be a benefit to our growing export of horses but an addition to the tourist attractions of the city.  In that way it would help to further the national economy.  Mounted police have considerable advantage in dealing with traffic jams and controlling gatherings of people likely to become disorderly.  The Minister should seriously consider providing mounted police for Dublin, Cork and Limerick &mdash;the major cities, at any rate.</P>
    <P>I have a word of criticism in regard to the new traffic regulations.  We have been urged by the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to drive in traffic lanes in the city centre.  Many streets where parking was previously permitted are now restricted.  The purpose of this is to encourage traffic coming out of or into the city to drive in double lanes.  Unfortunately, you get the occasional lorry or horse and dray from Guinness's, perhaps unloading in places where waiting is either restricted or prohibited.  As a result, it is impossible to get this double lane of traffic.  I have particularly in mind Bachelor's Walk and Pearse Street.  I do not know so much about O'Connell Street.  Bachelor's Walk and Pearse Street are streets where there is a great deal of loading and unloading.</P>
    <P>The only people I can think of who suffer from this restriction are the owners of licensed premises.  In places like Pearse Street, a number of people on their way from work used to pull in and stop for a drink before going home.  They now go further out of town to have that drink.  Maybe that is a good thing.  Unless we can arrange for collections and deliveries to be made early in the morning or late in the evening, the &ldquo;no waiting&rdquo; idea is not working for the simple reason that it takes only one lorry or dray to force drivers back into a single lane. When people see one parked vehicle they will not drive in traffic lanes <Col N="1750" /> because they fear they might get caught behind the parked vehicle.  The remedy would be to restrict the hours of delivery, to prohibit deliveries being made during peak traffic periods.</P>
    <P>There is another point I brought up last year which, I think, should be considered again.  There are a number of parks owned by Dublin Corporation. These are controlled by park rangers employed by the Corporation.  These park rangers have not got the power of arrest.  In the event of somebody committing an offence in the park, the park ranger must go to the nearest telephone and call the police.  The policeman cannot enter the park unless he is invited to do so by an authorised person because these are private parks owned by the Corporation. In other words, there can be no police patrol in a park.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency we have a very fine new development in Shaw's Wood, where there are a number of football pitches, tennis courts and some very attractive walks.  It is wonderful to go there on a Sunday and see hundreds of youths playing there while their mothers and fathers enjoy the nice surroundings.  But occasionally a small number of hooligans come in and start to cause trouble, beating up, perhaps, a couple of small girls.  Unless the park ranger calls up the police, it is quite likely he will not be strong enough himself to restrain this kind of activity.  I have seen some of these gangs with bicycle chains and so forth.  There has actually been an incident of a park ranger having to go to hospital because he tried to prevent this type of conduct. If the Minister is not prepared to make arrangements to have the parks included in the normal police patrols, at least telephones should be provided at several spots to enable the police to be called quickly.  Under the present arrangement the offenders inevitably get away before the police arrive.  If the Minister has any views on this matter, I should like to hear them when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, at the request of the Lord Mayor, there was a report on vandalism and juvenile delinquency <Col N="1751" /> in Dublin.  I have the document here, but unfortunately there is no date on it.  Many of the items dealt with in this would probably come under the Departments of Education, Local Government, Social Welfare and so on, but a few would come under the Department of Justice.  One is the censorship of films and books.  We know that a lot of these very low type papers and picture comics have been done away with and that the traders and wholesalers here are rather careful about the type of literature they import for general distribution.  But one portion of this Report says:</P>
    <P>Film censorship is reasonably effective for adults but there is a case for the adoption of some form of discrimination between the films suitable for all ages and those which might be harmful to juveniles.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of argument on both sides as to whether we should have a less rigid form of censorship for adults and a grading of films on the English system, that is, &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;X&rdquo; certificate films.  I invariably question my own children when they are going out to the pictures and try to influence them as to what pictures they should see.  But when they have their few shillings in their pockets, I have no guarantee that these are the pictures they will go to.  It may also happen that you have a major feature film ideally suitable for children along with a supporting feature absolutely unsuitable for them.  I have come across that in a suburban cinema recently.  The Minister might like to set up a small committee to examine further this question of film censorship or have his officials do so.  The film censor is doing a very good job, but certain films harmful to children are, unfortunately, available to them.  I understand that the report points out that book censorship presents a more difficult problem.  The committee were assured by the Censorship of Publications Board that they are particularly concerned with publications which might scandalise the young mind and that they will do everything in their power to ensure that these publications do not circulate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> Another practice which is to be seen in Dublin quite often&mdash;I have seen it myself in my constituency&mdash;is a young child coming into a public house with a jug&mdash;the jug this child had was an aluminium jug&mdash;to have it filled with porter or stout for his father or mother, do not ask me which.  I saw that happen rather late in the night, about 10.30 p.m.  I feel that at that stage a child had no place in that public house.  It was a time when some people were slightly merry, if you like to say so, and some of the stories were certainly not suitable for the ears of children.  I drew the attention of the publican to it.  He said that the child came in every evening as his father was not well.</P>
    <P>I can understand that there is a human side to all this, but efforts must be made to prevent children from going into public houses and into betting shops.  A matter I feel very strongly about is tolerating children begging in the streets.  That might best be dealt with by the policeman on the beat who might give them a good fright rather than by any direct action of the Department.  All these things contribute to juvenile delinquency.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that the incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency was on the decline last year.  Perhaps that can be attributed again, in relation to this report, to the better economic circumstances of most of the families in the city.  As long as the young teenager is walking the streets with no employment and despairs of getting employment, he is very susceptible to suggestions which are likely to lead him into crime and trouble.  The fact that the unemployment situation is not as serious as it was some years ago contributes largely to the reduction in deliquency in recent times.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of going along to the Children's Court in Dublin Castle and making representations on behalf of children who I felt were just swayed.  There might have been only one bad fellow among the lot of them. Somebody might have said: &ldquo;Look at that packet of cigarettes: we ought to <Col N="1753" /> swipe it,&rdquo; or whatever it might be, and the lot of them might then find themselves in court.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the judge in the Children's Court which I have attended.  He is understanding.  He deals admirably with the situation and conveys to the child the seriousness of the offence.  He does not remand the child, unless he is an habitual offender and obviously needs corrective training. In that respect, I know that some excellent work has been done in St. Patrick's Institution on the North Circular Road but I should like to query the Minister on the question of prison reform.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can blame the people opposite in this instance, but there is the feeling in some circles that we are falling behind in the matter of prison reform.  Personally, I do not think this is so, but to the best of my knowledge there has been no authoritative statement to show that it is not so. When he is replying, I should like the Minister to outline what has been done and what exactly is the general thinking of the Government in regard to prison reform, in order that the public may understand the position and compare how this country is dealing with that matter in the light of action by other countries.</P>
    <P>My constituency is about 75 per cent. working-class and contains municipal housing areas.  A problem that arises there is the cost of litigation.  If a man without adequate means wants health services, there are Health Acts which enable him to get assistance from the State for specialist and institutional services.  The amount he has to pay towards these services depends largely on his income.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin Corporation housing scheme, we have a system of differential rents.  That was first proposed in the Dublin Corporation by the Labour Party and eventually it was adopted. The purpose behind the differential rents scheme is to enable the local authority to house people of small means who could not pay an economic rent.  The idea was that the State would contribute, the local authority would <Col N="1754" /> contribute and the tenant would contribute towards the cost of the house in accordance with his means.  We have that principle in housing and health.</P>
    <P>If a man has a genuine case for litigation, he may be denied justice because he is afraid of the costs involved.  I do not know how the Minister can deal with this problem.  Perhaps it can be dealt with in some way similar to the health question.  It is socially desirable to do so.  The Government should devise some ways and means whereby the working man can get justice, whether or not he has money in the bank.  A man earning £7 or £8 a week is as entitled to justice as the man earning £1,000 or £2,000 a year.  This problem will require a great deal of examination but the precedents are there in the Health Acts and in the differential rents scheme. It is highly desirable that some system of subsidisation be worked out for people of moderate or low means and we can be sure of getting the cooperation of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Another question which I raised last year relates to the two years' extension granted to superintendents and higher ranks of the Garda Síochána with Old I.R.A. service.  This extension, to the best of my knowledge, applies only to superintendents.  Last year, I requested the Minister to consider extending this facility to, shall we say, the noncommissioned officers, the inspectors and sergeants.  These men served the country just as well as their counterparts in the higher ranks.  They are in responsible posts and, subject to their passing the necessary medical tests, I see no reason why the extension should not apply.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make a note of this for special consideration and I hope this time next year, it will not be necessary to repeat what I have said.</P>
    <P>We have had a great deal of criticism, particularly from Deputies McGilligan and Ryan, about the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Justice. We had a reference to what Deputy O'Malley said on the question some years ago, to the effect that the then <Col N="1755" /> Minister for Justice was not fully employed. I agree that Deputy O'Malley at that time was quite right.  Since last night, I made a point of going to the Library and looking up the amount of legislation that has been going through the Department in the past few years and I think that never before has the same amount of legislation been framed in the Department as in the past year or two.  Never before has the Department been responsible for so much activity.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his speech in Clery's a week or two ago and I think we can all feel assured that the Government are fully aware of their responsibilities, so far as the Department of Justice is concerned.  They have certainly laid down a programme which will give us every confidence in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom find myself in agreement with the previous speaker but I agree with him when he recommended that we should have a section of mounted police in our police force. I have heard this advocated several times here and I wonder why it has not been done.  We should have a company of mounted police, at least in Dublin and Cork.  They could do excellent work in large gatherings at sports fixtures and similar functions. The time may come when the Garda uniform may be in the same position as that of the Army uniform in Rome last night where a very stirring event occurred.  It would be a magnificent position if our police force were able to go abroad and do what the Army's Captain Ringrose did.  I saw that last night and I was greatly moved by it, as I am sure were others who saw it, especially when the National Anthem was played in Rome and all those thousands of people stood up to honour this Irish horseman in the ring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass complained about children entering pubs with the family jug to bring home the family beer.  I always believed that a law against that had been passed here to the accompaniment of much lamentation, by women who used rear their children by <Col N="1756" /> carrying them around in a shawl, that they would no longer be able to bring the children in when they were going in for a pint.  I am sure the law is still there.</P>
    <P>What does tend to encourage juvenile delinquency is something beyond the control of the Minister of the Parliamentary Secretary, that is, the attitude of parents.  The children grow up and, when they have become delinquents and the Garda in the course of their duty bring them before the courts, the children are usually not even reprimanded. They have a sort of field day going down to the Children's Court, with their mammas, a day off from school.  It does not matter what damage they did or what blackguardism they have committed&mdash;they will probably be let off with no punishment.  It is up to the Department to let the justices and the people responsible for administering justice know that there should be discipline and justice and that there must be protection for the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>We had the case on Sunday last concerning an organisation for which I do not have much regard&mdash;C.I.E. C.I.E. promoted a mystery tour from Dublin to Clonmel and C.I.E. are to be commended on these promotions which are a source of pleasure for a large number of people.  They have the thrill of the mystery of where they are going, and a good time is had by all until a few blackguards come along and upset everybody.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the law is&mdash;perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could outline the position&mdash;whether C.I.E. should provide their own police.  I believe that there used to be railway police at the large stations but I read that C.I.E. were considering giving up these mystery tours.  I think the Department should consider it their duty to see that the people are not deprived of these tours and should see to it that the people and C.I.E. and C.I.E. property are protected.  The Department should communicate with C.I.E. and say that if C.I.E. are prepared to continue these tours, the Department will see that these trains have adequate protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> Two years ago, when C.I.E. were recruiting hostesses, I suggested that what was needed was to recruit railway policemen to travel on the trains and protect the people.  This type of conduct extends beyond mystery tours. It occurs on the boats coming to this country and it usually happens that&mdash; I hesitate to say a minority&mdash;just one or two people are involved out of the thousands of our people who travel. One or two blackguards can upset the whole boat or train.  Usually there is the No. 1 man, Micheál, Mick or Liam, who has had a few pints and with him one or two acolytes, who are minding him. Mick has made up his mind that he is going to fight some waiter, ticket checker or other inoffensive person and the whole train is held up while these blackguards go up and down opening doors, threatening people, using bad language, taking over the dining car&mdash; if there is one&mdash;and ensuring that no decent man, woman or child can go into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the time has come when we must give the transport company the protection to which any company is entitled.  As I said, I do not know whether it is open to the company to have their own police.  I do not know why they should be or would be compelled to have their own police, but that is not the question. The question is that we have a police force and a Department of Justice and we owe something to the 1,500 decent people who travelled down last weekend to Clonmel and whose enjoyment was considerably spoiled by these blackguards.  We should protect these people.</P>
      <P>With regard to crimes of violence, I wish to speak of one particular incident.  The matter is no longer <i>sub judice.</i> The criminal has been sentenced to four months' imprisonment for beating up an old lady, an altogether inadequate sentence, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>What happens when these blackguards beat up old ladies, with robbery as the motive?  What happens when they attack any inoffensive citizen?  They are brought into court and quite a number of people will rush forward to say what grand fellows these blackguards really are. I am constantly reading these cases. They occur all over the country.  A young blackguard is brought to court. There he apologises and the do-gooders say he should be let off; the thing will not happen again.  It is just too bad for the old man he assaulted with six stitches in his poll. The blackguard gets off with a nominal fine.  There is a dance in a village or town.  All over again, there are assaults on inoffensive citizens, on officials running the dance, even on the members of the Garda Síochána themselves.</P>
      <P>There are friends of mine, both inside and outside this House, who say that cruel sentences never lead to anything, that they do not put down crime and are no deterrent.  I would draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the Notting Hill riots and all the fun the boys with the tight pants, the long locks, the flick knives and the broken bottles were having every Friday and Saturday night in Notting Hill, cutting the faces off black men and black men cutting the faces off them.  All the do-gooers were saying: &ldquo;If you bring these men in and talk to them, they are really not bad at heart.&rdquo;  Fortunately, there happened to be a sound judge.  He gave sentences varying from four to six years.  No one has said boo to a goose in Notting Hill since.</P>
      <P>That is the line that should be followed here.  The Minister said crime is not rampant in this country. The majority of the people are law-abiding. According to the do-gooders, it is not the law-abiding who must be catered for and protected; it is the very small minority of blackguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> There is only one way in which to make this small minority law-abiding citizens, that is, by punishing them, and punishing them severely.  That is the only way in which we will stop these outrages and make it safe for our people to travel on public vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Garda are growing discouraged. They spend weeks, pounding the pavement, finding out the facts.  Eventually they bring the culprits to justice.  I have been present in court and I have known a bunch of blackguards to be allowed off.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass asked about prison reform.  It is only too obvious that he has not read the Minister's opening statement, in which he dealt with prison reform.  At column 1029 of Volume 188 of the Official Report, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate shows an increase of £19,270 over the original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate for 1960-61.  These increases are in the main borne on the subheads of Pay and Allowances, Victualling, Clothing, Bedding and Furniture, Maintenance of Buildings and Equipment and the Manufacturing Department and Farm.  On the pay side, the additional cost is principally due to increases resulting from the settlement of staff claims under conciliation and arbitration machinery and the recruitment of additional staff for the supervision of political prisoners in Mountjoy.  An improved dietary for prisoners and inmates.  Which is being introduced very shortly, is responsible for the increased victualling costs.  While the present diet is of <Col N="1760" /> good standard from the point of view of nutrition, I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat monotonous and that some variation of the dietary is desirable.  The changes which I propose to make and which should help to relieve the monotony include the substitution of flake meal for pinhead oatmeal, provision of a milk pudding or other sweet with the dinner, an increase in the tea ration and the sugar content of tea, and an additional bread and marmalade ration instead of porridge on certain mornings.</P>
    <P>This sounds excellent.  If we are ever locked out of hotels in Dublin, we can go up to Mountjoy.  If Deputy Lemass gets his way and we have more prison reform, I am sure cigars will be supplied with the dinner, as well as the milk pudding.</P>
    <P>There is a Road Traffic Bill before the House.  The only point I should like to make in connection with road traffic is that there should be proper road patrols, not only in Dublin but elsewhere.  After big sporting events, there is a kind of race home.  One would think there was a prize of £1,000 for the first car home.  The cars take corners in fives and sixes.</P>

      <P>The figures quoted <Col N="1761" /> by the Deputy are incorrect, being over-stated in respect of 1959 and in the total by 5,000.</P>
      <P>These statistics cannot be accepted as a measure of Irish emigration to Britain, nor can they be reconciled with the known facts regarding the numbers leaving school in this country in each year and the number of new social insurance cards issued here.</P>
      <P>In the three years mentioned in the question the total number who reached school-leaving age was 170,000, approximately, and during the same three years, the number of new social insurance cards issued here was 158,000.  If there is added to the difference between these totals, namely 12,000 about 18,000 in respect of the reduction in the number of persons occupied in agriculture, which now averages about 6,000 per year, it becomes clear that the British figures must contain a very large element of duplication, and that the view, which I expressed on a recent occasion that net emigration to Britain is probably nearer to half the British figures referred to, is correct.</P>

      <P>One of the statutory contribution conditions which must be satisfied in order to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension is that the claimant must have entered insurance before attaining the age of sixty.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records, the claimant to whom the Deputy refers first entered insurance under the National Health Insurance Acts in May, 1951 when he was sixty-three years of age.  In reply to an enquiry he confirmed that he was not insured before the age of sixty.  His claim accordingly had to be rejected.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any case to which the statements contained in the Deputy's question would apply.</P>
      <P>Appeals officers are statutorily appointed to decide appeals against decisions given by deciding officers. The decision of an appeals officer may be revised by an appeals officer if it appears to him that the decision was erroneous in the light of new evidence or new facts brought to his notice since the decision was given while the chief appeals officer may revise any decision of an appeals officer if it appears to him that the decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made with respect of the law or the facts.  Otherwise, the decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive except in relation to certain matters in which there is provision for an appeal to the High Court on any question of law.  In the type of case quoted, such an appeal would lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to title to disability benefit in the case of persons who accept lump sum settlements under the Workmen's Compensation Acts is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the incapacity is temporary the number of weeks in which the lump sum will become exhausted is calculated by dividing such sum by the appropriate weekly rate of compensation and,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to whether a claimant satisfies the statutory conditions, including that of being capable of work, for the receipt of unemployment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts is a matter for determination by a statutory officer, that is, a deciding officer or an appeals officer, in the light of all the circumstances in the particular case.  Generally speaking, however, it is likely that a person in receipt of workmen's compensation for partial disablement would be regarded as capable of work and, subject to satisfaction of the other statutory conditions, as qualified for payment of unemployment benefit, the rate of which would not be affected by the amount of workmen's compensation in payment.</P>

There are three ways in which this scheme can be carried out and in which we hope it will be carried out.

All three methods of approach are in the minds of every sanitary authority in the country in preparing an overall survey of their needs, together with the sources of supply and the various other technical data in order to draw up comprehensive, all-embracing schemes. Only then will it be possible and feasible to decide which type of scheme would be best and most economically applied so as to solve the difficulties of a particular area.</P>
      <P>Although it has been mooted before, there is no such idea, no such suggestion, that regional schemes are a must and that my Department is pushing regional schemes to the exclusion of all others.  They are all supplemental to one another with a view to getting the entire job done in the best, most feasible and most economical way.</P>

It is absolutely essential that there should be a full and complete survey to ascertain the circumstances in every area before the local authority proceeds to spend money on any scheme.

      <P>This question, having come from Deputy Carroll, presumably applies to what appears to be fairly long-standing practice in regard to Dublin Corporation finances, that is, that there is a carry-over from year to year which is used in the early part of the financial year, when funds are rather low and are only slowly coming in, in order that overdraft charges may be obviated.  The end product of following this line of thought at the moment would be that we would direct Dublin Corporation to liquidate their reserve which they have usefully used in this way in the past and so show a fairly substantial reduction in rates for one particular year, but adding to the rate the following year by having increased overdraft charges at high rates of interest clapped on top of the rate that normally would arise.  I would say, also, that in so far as the internal methods of operating their finances are concerned, Dublin Corporation or any other local authority, to my mind, from examination of this matter, have not transgressed any law that exists, nor do I see any need for bringing in a law which would put them out of court.  This is a matter in which they have fairly wide control and I have no reason to believe that that control should be narrowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I have already on a number of occasions made clear that I am not prepared to disclose what action I have taken in individual cases of the kind concerned.  The reasons for that I shall give in a moment, but I should like first to explain my general attitude on the question of excessive punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> My responsibility in the matter is twofold.  On the one hand it is for me to see to it that the children are not ill-treated and on the other that they receive efficient instruction.</P>
    <P>The teacher holds for the time being the place of the parent and so for the time being carries in this matter the rights of the parent.  In these circumstances it would be unreasonable for me to forbid the teacher to adopt any deterrent that might be adopted by a just and wise parent, and a just and wise parent might on occasion deem it necessary to inflict an adequate amount of corporal punishment in order to control the child and bring him up in the way he should go.</P>
    <P>Even a parent, however, has no right to inflict excessive punishment and is liable to court penalties if he causes injury to the child.  In that regard, I wish to say that I personally abhor excessive punishment of any kind, either physical or mental.  I will go further and say that I will not countenance any punishment in the schools that goes beyond the limits of adequacy.</P>
    <P>My powers to impose penalties for excessive punishment comprise with-holding of salary in part or entirely; withdrawal of recognition of status where the teacher holds a senior post; withdrawal of recognition of a teacher in a particular school or area; and, finally, withdrawal of recognition as a teacher, temporarily or permanently.</P>
    <P>Since I took up office I have used most of these powers, and used them severly.  I intend to continue so doing.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I cannot act irresponsibly.  It is for me, with all the available evidence before me, to be judge of the conduct that is befitting a teacher.  There are various types of cases which require deep consideration in this regard.  For example, there is the teacher who in a single instance loses his temper under provocation. He is to be distinguished from the teacher who has offended more than once.  Again, where the parent has had recourse to the courts and where there is an appeal pending, I must obviously await the result of the appeal before <Col N="1777" /> my function comes into operation. That function, as I have said, is to impose a suitable penalty, where such is merited, on the teacher for being guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher, and, if he persists in such conduct, it it in my power, as I have said, to withdraw recognition from him as a teacher.</P>
    <P>Finally, my reasons for not considering it proper or desirable to disclose the action taken by me in any individual case are, first, that I could not, in fairness to all concerned, disclose publicly my findings in any individual case without making public also all the information, some of which may be confidential, which enabled me to come to a decision.  Secondly, such public disclosure of information and decision could in itself constitute in particular cases a punishment in excess of that which I had concluded to be adequate. It will, I think, be appreciated in that regard that I could not make public use of findings in one case and not in another.  I should have to disclose the action taken in all cases or in none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister does not go as far as I should like him to go in forbidding corporal punishment but I welcome the improvement on previous statements by the Minister. Would he not agree that, in so far as any punishment he does decide on is intended to be a deterrent both to the teacher concerned and to other teachers, the particular punishment which he imposes must lose a lot of its power as a deterrent if people are not aware of the punishment which he is prepared to impose on a teacher in given circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30a:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this Bill was being discussed, the Minister may remember there was an amendment moved designed to delete roughly the last sentence of subsection (1) of Section 20 and the case was made that it was undesirable, in giving the Gardaí these powers of inspection of vehicles, to include an omnibus power of that description.  The discussion on that amendment was contributed to by a number of Deputies and took up quite a time.  The case was made, however, that from one point of view it was possibly better, if an omnibus power of that description were to be given, that the words used at the end of subsection (1) should remain because they at least impose on the Gardaí the onus of establishing that the action which they take in a particular case is reasonable.  The argument developed from that.  Subsection (2) sets out that &ldquo;for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section and without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred thereby, a member of the Garda Síochána may&rdquo; do a number of specific things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> It seemed on consideration of the two subsections together that the Minister was importing into subsection (2) a presupposition of reasonableness on the part of the Gardaí if they took any of those four specific actions which they are authorised to take under sub-section (2) It would be better, from the point of view of the general public and from the point of view of the relations between the authorities enforcing this Act and the motorists who are affected by it, if the onus was fairly and squarely placed on the Garda in relation to these tests to take only actions which are reasonable.  Accordingly, we would prefer to let sub-section (1) remain unaltered as the Minister desires if the Minister in his turn is prepared to delete subsection (2) with the implication it carries, that is, the implication that a Garda who acts under the powers in subsection (2) will <i>ipso facto</i> be regarded as acting reasonably.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, principally Deputy J.A. Costello, pointed out in relation to the discussion on these amendments and again on the Second Reading of the Bill that we cannot legislate in such a way as completely to avoid road accidents or what I might describe as road offences and misdemeanours, that we must try in this legislation to bring about a state of affairs where the relations between <Col N="1791" /> the Gardaí or other enforcing authority, on the one hand, and the motorist or the general public, on the other hand, will inspire such confidence and trust that there will develop a sense of individual responsibility among motorists and road users.  It is only by framing legislation in such a way that it will not appear dictatorial or take away completely the rights of road users that that kind of confidence and sense of both individual and collective responsibility on the part of road users will be maintained.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we now suggest to the Minister that if he wants to retain subsection (1) of Section 20 in its present form, he should agree to delete subsection (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Deputy that he wishes that the powers should be restricted in some degree. That appears to be the purpose of the amendment: to reduce in some degree the powers contained in this section. In fact, the deletion of subsection (2), which the Deputy suggests, could have the opposite effect.  Subsection (2) gives examples of the circumstances as now foreseen that would be regarded as unreasonable.  The saving clause is, &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of powers conferred thereby...&rdquo;  That is intended to cover the reasonable circumstances which are not foreseeable or foreseen.  I do not think the deletion suggested in the amendment would be a good thing, nor do I believe that the wiping out of these examples, which, in fact, is what they are, would benefit the public in the direction the Deputy suggests.  I do not feel it would be wise in these circumstances to accept, or to recommend the acceptance of, the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister give his views on the opinion I expressed that having regard to the way in which these two subsections of Section 20 are framed, it is intended to import into subsection (2) that if a Garda acts in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) of subsection (2), he is <i>ipso facto</i> regarded as acting reasonably.  Is the Minister <Col N="1792" /> prepared to give the assurance that, whatever the interpretation of the Bill in the courts, that is not the intention of the Government or the Legislature?</P>

      <P>No; in fact, far from it.  The words &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; are used in subsection (1). The question of reasonableness is still a matter that will be determined by the courts with regard to the examples given in subsection (2).  The giving of these examples does not relieve the authorities or the prosecutor from still having to undergo tests as to whether or not what was done was, in fact, reasonable.</P>

      <P>I wonder is the Minister confident of that?  Sub-section (1) finishes up with the words:</P>
      <P>...and, for the purpose of carrying out the inspection and examination, may...</P>
      <P>That is, the Garda may&mdash;</P>
      <P>...do all such things and make all such requirements in relation to it as are reasonably necessary.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Garda can do only what is reasonably necessary, and it is equally clear, to my mind, in relation to any act which a Garda does, that the onus is on the Garda to show that what he did was reasonably necessary, that is, so far as subsection (1) goes.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section and without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred thereby, a member of the Garda Síochána may&mdash;</P>
      <P>It then sets out four specific things a member of the Garda Síochána may do.  It seems to me that if a Garda acts in relation to any of those items dealt with in paragraphs (a) to (d) of sub-section (2), he is relieved from the onus imposed on him by subsection (1) of showing that what he did or decided to do was reasonable.  I appreciate that the Minister takes the view that the fears I am expressing are groundless, but I should like to be sure that that point has been examined, and that if it has not been examined with the Minister devoting his mind to that specific point, it will be so examined.</P>

The point I want to make, if I may give a specific example, is that, in fact, it may not be reasonable for the Garda to drive it at all.

      <P>While I am, naturally, glad to see the Minister is paying close attention to the provisions of the Constitution in relation to this matter and ensuring that justice will be administered in the courts by judges duly appointed, it is rather odd that a doubtful provision will have to be examined later&mdash;doubtful from the point of view of the Constitution&mdash; that is, the fines-on-the-spot provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the reasons the Minister has given for making this change. I have no reason for doubting that the reasons he has given are the reasons which motivated the change in wording, but I think the Minister should possibly think a little more about it. The subsection as it was drafted&mdash;and it is reflected in some later amendments <Col N="1795" /> also&mdash;had the effect, from the motorist's point of view, that before the Garda could exercise the powers set out in subsection (3), it was necessary that he should find there was something wrong with the vehicle. While the Minister may be complying with the constitutional defects he sees in making this amendment, he is also, perhaps only incidentally, arriving at the situation where he is putting the road user at very great disadvantage, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the member of the Garda Síochána.  Whereas under the Bill as introduced by the Minister, the Garda had to find some defect in the car before he could exercise these powers, now he has merely to express an opinion that there is something wrong with it.  On forming that opinion, he is now to be entitled to exercise the powers set out in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might further alter his amendment and, instead of saying it is sufficient for the Garda to be &ldquo;of opinion,&rdquo; he should use some such phrase as &ldquo;has reasonable grounds for believing,&rdquo; which, I think, would not weaken what the Minister wants to achieve by his amendment, but, at the same time, would not, so to speak, load the dice completely in favour of the Garda as against the road user.</P>

      <P>Unlike the Deputy, I cannot see the subtleties of these legal phrases.  It seems to me that if a Garda finds something to be the case, he must have been of opinion it was the case.  If I happened to be the victim in such circumstances, it would be six of one and half a dozen of another, as far as the words used were concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only my opinion. I am being guided by those who are educated in the subtleties of legal phraseology and I am leaning over to meet their views.  I think the ordinary layman would regard both phrases as being much the same.  However, I <Col N="1796" /> must come down on the side of the legal advice I have had and propose the use of the words, &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;finds.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister will agree with me that, from the point of view of the motorist, there is a clear distinction?  In the one case, the Garda must positively find there is a defect before he can exercise these powers.  Under the Minister's amendment, it is not necessary for him to find positively that there is a defect. It is only necessary for him to form the opinion that there is a defect.  He may form that opinion quite unreasonably and there may, in fact, be no defect.  Notwithstanding that, under the amendment the Minister now proposes, the Garda may go on and exercise the powers in subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I am suggesting a mid-way course to the Minister&mdash;that he should further amend his amendment by using, instead of the words &ldquo;is of opinion,&rdquo; some such phrase as &ldquo;has reasonable grounds for believing.&rdquo;  That would at least achieve the situation where, from the motorist's point of view, the Garda cannot act unreasonably.  From the Garda's point of view, it achieves the position that if he acts reasonably in forming his opinion, he can still exercise the powers the Minister is giving him under subsection (3).  I do not think it weakens the Minister's position at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>How the Garda came to form his opinion is not really the matter at issue, but, in forming his opinion, he just did not think of some defect out of the blue and say: &ldquo;now I am of opinion this defect is there.&rdquo; He must have had some cause for reaching that opinion; he cannot have reached it without some reason.  If he has come to that opinion in an unreasonable way and the courts find there is no dangerous defect, the motorist cannot be convicted.  If it is an opinion based on unreasonable grounds, the Garda's case must fall to the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the <Col N="1797" /> Minister's point of view, but there are a whole lot of implications to which the Minister is not adverting.  The question of a prosecution of the motorist by the Garda may possibly be the least important in a number of ways.  Under this subsection, we are giving power to the Garda in cases where, on the Minister's amendment, he merely forms an opinion, to instruct a person in charge of a vehicle that it is not to be driven in a public place, until the defect has been remedied. That is just one example.  The vehicle may be the sole means of livelihood of, for example, a commercial traveller, a lorry driver or some such person.</P>
      <P>Under the powers we are giving to the Garda in the section, a Garda may put that person off the road simply by giving an instruction under sub-section (3).  That will be a hardship from the point of view of the owner and user of the vehicle.  It is no satisfaction at all to him for the Minister or myself or anyone else to tell him: &ldquo;If the Garda issues a summons against you, he will not be able to make his case because he formed his opinion in an unreasonable way.&rdquo;  This man may be off the road for up to six months.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister, if he looks into this, will agree with me&mdash;I think I am right in any event&mdash;that there is no obligation on the Garda to issue a summons within six months.  I think six months is the time limit.  A Garda who suspects or forms an opinion that a vehicle is defective may instruct the owner or the user of that vehicle that it is not to be used on the public road. He may then delay and not issue a summons for three, four, five or six months.  In the meanwhile, that person, who may be a commercial traveller or a haulier, is put off the road simply by the decision or opinion of the Garda that a defect exists.  It is no satisfaction to that motorist to go into court at the end of six months and to satisfy the court that the Garda was all wrong and that no defect exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about the Garda having to form his opinion because of the circumstances which will exist, <Col N="1798" /> something he sees or something he hears, that he must have some reasonable grounds before he forms his opinion and that if he has not, he will be shot down when he goes into court. That does not really help the position at all, nor in fact do I believe the Minister is correct in that line of argument.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's amendment is accepted, I do not think anyone, the district justice or anyone else, will be entitled to ask the Garda how he formed his opinion.  All the Garda is required to do is to justify himself and that is to say: &ldquo;I did form that opinion.&rdquo;  It does not matter whether the Garda is right or wrong, reasonable or unreasonable, under the terms of the Minister's amendment, in forming that opinion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is afraid that the Bill as drafted and introduced might in-fringe the Constitution.  I realise his arguments there and his reasons for wanting to get away from the use of car fines, but it is going far too far in the opposite direction simply to allow the Garda to exercise these very drastic powers.  Let there be no mistake about it.  They can be very drastic powers.  They can be powers which would mean the difference between livelihood and no livelihood for some motorists.</P>
    <P>To allow a Garda to exercise those very drastic powers simply on the formation of an opinion which may be quite unreasonable is what is in question here.  I think it is going too far. For that reason, I again ask the Minister to have another look at his amendment and instead simply of the bald use of the expression &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;, that he should alter it to &ldquo;has reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo; or some similar phrase.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer at this stage to amendment No. 33.  I think possibly the Minister and I might agree.  Amendment No. 33 has not yet been moved but it is designed to insert in sub-section (3) before paragraphs (a) and (b) the words &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo;.  I think then that, even with the Minister's amendment being accepted, there would be some measure of protection for a motorist against a Garda who <Col N="1799" /> acts unreasonably.  A Garda might then be put in the position of having to satisfy the court that in forming his opinion, he had taken various circumstances into account and that it was reasonable for him to form that opinion.</P>
    <P>If in other words, the subsection were to read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a member of the Garda Siochána inspects and examines under this section a mechanically propelled vehicle and is, consequent upon having inspected and examined under this section a mechanically propelled vehicle, of opinion that it is, when in use, a danger to the public he may, if appropriate&rdquo;</P>
    <P>give these directions set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of subsection (3), then I think the dangers I see in the full acceptance of the Minister's amendment would at least be minimised, because the Garda would have to show it was appropriate for him, in the circumstances which existed, to give these directions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood on this.  By and large, I have, certainly, and I think most Deputies have very great admiration for the manner in which the Garda carry out their duties, and very difficult duties they frequently are, in relation to the road traffic code. However, Gardaí are human, the same as anyone else.  A Garda may lose his temper as quickly as anyone else.  It is possible to visualise a situation where, if these powers are given and a Garda challenges a motorist who possibly might be a bit overbearing or condescending to the Garda, he may get a short answer from a Garda who is a bit short-tempered.  The Garda may decide he will impose the instructions he is entitled to give under paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (3) and simply say to the motorist: &ldquo;If that is the way you talk to me, you will not drive this car again until you do (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) to it.  A Garda may act in that way.  I am not saying the general run of Gardaí or any large percentage of Gardaí will act like that, but if you have one Garda who acts like that, then it is dangerous to give unrestricted power of this sort.</P>

      <P>This question, as the Deputy has said, comes down to a point where a commercial traveller could unreasonably be instructed not to drive his car and the only course open to him would be to await the outcome of a court decision which might not be until six months later.  It is argued that he might thereby lose his livelihood until the six months had elapsed, even though he was ultimately proved to be correct and not in error in any way.  It was argued that this could be a matter of livelihood or no livelihood. It could also be said that if we did not have some such power and a defect existed which might not otherwise be remedied it could be a matter of life or death.  That is what we are directing our attention towards in all the regulations and powers we are making and taking here.  In regard to the instructions under sub-section (3) of Section 20 that the Garda may give to a motorist he may only give these instructions where he is satisfied or is of opinion that a dangerous defect exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no difference there is no reason why I should accept it.  What I want to point out is that it would appear as if the Deputy is envisaging a situation where there will be widespread application of this law and where we will have Gardaí running around unreasonably holding people up, inspecting their cars, giving them instructions, making them drive here and there and do this and do that and not do the other thing.  If there is any fear in my mind, it is that these extra duties, which are being imposed on the Gardaí added to their already onerous and widespread duties, may <Col N="1801" /> not be undertaken sufficiently often. Anybody who realises the varied matters that the Gardaí must deal with, knowing some Gardaí personally as we all do, could reasonably accept what I suggest, that the danger is that there will not be enough of this type of operation rather than too much of it, when the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>Let us take the commercial traveller or any other person depending for a living on running a car.  Say that car is stopped and the Garda says he is of opinion that a dangerous defect exists.  The driver is absolutely of the opinion that no such defect exists.  The Garda instructs him that, as a result of the Garda's opinion, the vehicle is not to be driven in a public place until the defect is remedied.  The first thing a normal, sensible person would do would be to go to the local garage or the nearest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He can drive it whereever he likes regardless of the Garda's instruction, if he does not agree with the Garda.  Even though he may have reason to agree with the Garda he is still not obliged to do as the Garda tells him and it is only the court that will ultimately determine whether he was right or wrong in doing what the Garda instructed.  If the Garda was unreasonable in finding a serious deface where none existed, and as a result of that unreasonable opinion he instructed that the vehicle be not moved from where it is until the defect is remedied, it would be a very timid owner or driver who would not at least insist on taking the car to where it could be examined to bolster up his own belief that there was nothing wrong &mdash;either to the nearest garage or to have it examined by a qualified mechanic he himself consults.  If no defect is in fact found, that owner would be a timid person if he did not personally drive the car and ignore the warning on which he was originally pulled up.  Furthermore, under an amendment which will be discussed later, the court will ultimately decide <Col N="1802" /> the case and if it is found that no defect, in fact, existed, when the Garda alleged there was such a defect, then there has been no crime as there has been no defect, and there can be no sentence and, in the interval, the driver will not be at a loss of livelihood through not being able to drive the car.  He will have driven the car during those intervening weeks or months. For that reason, I put it to the Deputy that the fear he expresses of a widespread and unreasonable application of this provision in the Bill will not have the effects he mentioned.  In fact, his fears are completely groundless and need not worry him or anybody else.</P>
      <P>On the amendment put down by the Deputy and other Deputies adding the words &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo; after &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 52 of subsection (3) of Section 20, the fact is that the words &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo; do not add anything to the sense of what is already there. Where the Garda, having inspected and examined a mechanically propelled vehicle, is of opinion that a defect exists he &ldquo;may&rdquo; instruct.  Why say &ldquo;he may if appropriate instruct?&rdquo; Adding the words &ldquo;if appropriate,&rdquo; to my mind does not make any sense nor add anything to the sense of the subsection.  Whatever it might do to confuse the issue, it does nothing to clarify it.  The words there at present are, I think, quite clear.  They direct what the Garda may do under given circumstances and to say he may do it &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo; does not add anything and certainly does not seem necessary.</P>

      <P>When dealing with the Minister I am in the difficulty that he brings in an amendment and says that, as far as he is personally concerned, he does not think there is any difference between his Bill as drafted and the amendment he is moving.  When I do see a distinction I point it out to the Minister and suggest an alternative and then the Minister beats me when he says: &ldquo;I do not see any difference between this phrasing and the alternative you are giving me, but in any event I am not going to accept anything you will give because <Col N="1803" /> I do not think there is any difference.&rdquo; Then I point out that he might safeguard the point of view of the motorist by accepting amendment No. 33 which would provide that only in appropriate cases may the Gardaí carry out these powers and the Minister again says: &ldquo;What does that mean? I do not see any difference between the section with `if appropriate' in it and the section without those words.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall.  I have explained it already and I shall do it again.  Let us take this bit by bit. The Minister, in the Bill he introduced, had a provision that if a Garda examining a vehicle found a defect in it he was then entitled under subsection (3) paragraphs (a) and (b) to give certain instructions including the instruction to the owner or user that he was not to drive it any more until the defect was remedied.  That was the simple situation.  The Garda was required positively to find a defect in the vehicle before he could give that instruction.  The Minister wants to change that and the reason he gives&mdash; and I accept it as quite <i>bona fide</i>; I am not challenging it in any way&mdash;is that he is faced with the possibility that if he leaves the word &ldquo;finds&rdquo; in the section, it might be unconstitutional because it might amount to the Garda exercising a judicial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asks the House, therefore, to accept the amendment and instead of the word &ldquo;finds&rdquo; the words &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; will go into the Bill.  I pointed out to the Minister&mdash;I believe it is so&mdash;that there is a very substantial difference between the two, though the Minister thinks there is none.  In the one case, the Garda was required positively to find a defect and the onus of showing that such defect existed was on the Garda.  He had to find the defect before he could give these directions. Now he has only to be of opinion that there is a defect and, if he is of opinion, he can give the directions, including the direction that the vehicle <Col N="1804" /> is not to be driven any further.  I have suggested that that is not reasonable because the Garda is not even required to show in court that he acted reasonably in forming that opinion and it is sufficient for the court, on the Minister's amendment, for the Garda to say he did come to that opinion, and it does not matter a hang how he came to it.</P>
    <P>I believe if, instead of using the words &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;, the Minister altered that and required the Garda to have reasonable grounds for believing a defect existed, the situation would be brought into being in which what the Minister wants to achieve is in no way weakened, provided that the Garda is in a position to show that he had reasonable grounds for believing there was a defect.  It does not matter whether or not there is a defect.  If the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing, he is entitled to exercise the powers given to him under the section.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want to accept that.  Why, I do not now.  He admits himself that he does not think there is any great difference.  I believe there is.  I suggested then that if he would add to subsection (3) before paragraphs (a) and (b) the words &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo;, that might meet the situation I envisaged. The Minister asks what difference would the words &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo; make.  I think they make this difference. If the words &ldquo;if appropriate&rdquo; are inserted, the onus is placed on the Garda of showing that the case was one in which it was appropriate for him to give a direction, maybe even a drastic direction, that the car was not to be driven any further.  The onus is on the Garda to show that, in the circumstances, it was appropriate to give that direction.  That is the difference it would make if these words were inserted.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter.  I think he is going altogether too far in trying to amend what is already a very drastic section to make it even more drastic still. The Minister is quite right when he says that the danger may be that these powers will not be used often enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> I quite agree with him.  I think it would be a pity if they were used infrequently from the point of view of road safety and trying to further the cause of road safety.  It would be a pity if, when these powers are given to the Garda, they do not use them and use them fairly frequently.  I do not want to see that happening.  I do not want to see the Minister and the Dáil going to the trouble of enacting this legislation, giving the Garda these powers, and having them shelved.  That is not desirable at all.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, one has to look at this from both points of view.  It is necessary for us to legislate, and legislate as best we can, in the interests of road safety.  It is also necessary for us to determine that there must be some measure of justice for all users of the road, be they motorists, pedestrians or cyclists.  We cannot have a situation coming into being where the dice is loaded all the time against the person charged with any road traffic offence.  What I am trying to do is to achieve a situation in which there will be justice done from both points of view, from the point of view of the Garda authorities, on the one hand, and the person charged with a traffic offence on the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that, if a Garda imposes unreasonably the requirement that a vehicle is not to be driven further until a defect is remedied, the motorist may in effect completely ignore that and say to the Garda: &ldquo;I will meet you in court and we will argue it out there.&rdquo;  If the motorist is proved right in court, that is an end of it.  I suppose that is correct. It is not everyone, however, who likes to go into court.  Most people would prefer to keep out of court, if they can. I am willing to wager that if this power was used 100 times, you would get only one out of 100 motorists who would defy the Garda and decide to test the matter out in court.</P>
    <P>Under another amendment which the Minister is introducing and to which he referred himself, if the motorist takes a chance on it, believing that he is right and the Garda is <Col N="1806" /> wrong, and goes into court, then if the court finds he is wrong, he is faced with a possible sentence of imprisonment for a period of three months and a fine of £50.  It is not every motorist who will risk that, even though he believes he is right.  In saying that a motorist may ignore the request of the Garda and continue driving the car, I do not think the Minister is correct in maintaining that is an answer to the problem.  He may do it at his own peril.  A number of things may go wrong when he goes into court.  He may be an extremely bad witness.  He may be disbelieved.</P>

      <P>The insertion of these three words at the end of Section 3 will not in any way relieve the motorist of any of the consequences of his being stopped by a Garda in the particular circumstances.  The words are superfluous and therefore unnecessary.  It says that the Garda may do these things and may give these directions subject to what has gone before, and what has gone before is that he has to inspect and examine and be then of opinion that a defect exists.  If it is appropriate that he should give an instruction, then obviously he must give that instruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34a:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (5) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where a member of the Garda Síochána proposes to exercise any of the powers contained in any of the foregoing subsections the person in charge of the vehicle or the owner may require that any inspections, tests, or examinations shall be carried out by a member of the Garda Síochána who is a public service vehicle inspector and in the presence of a mechanic, engineer or other qualified persons nominated by such person or owner who shall be afforded an opportunity of observing such inspection, tests and examinations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment on behalf of Deputy J. A. Costello.  I would ask the Minister to study the amendment carefully.  The Minister will note that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used&mdash;&ldquo;the owner may require.&rdquo;  It is but right that only a qualified person, such as an inspector of public service vehicles, or otherwise, should carry out this test and at the carrying out of this test, it is but right that an independent expert should be present, such as a mechanic or some other person nominated by the owner of the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may digress for a minute, in an ordinary running down action, if a person is injured and the third party wishes to have him medically examined, <Col N="1808" /> he will get permission to do that only in the presence of an expert nominated by the injured party.  There is a very good reason for it.  A certain aspect of his illness might be overlooked.  In this case a certain aspect of the mechanical breakdown may be overlooked or certain mechanical aspects of the vehicle may be overlooked. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask that if the Garda insist on an inspection, that inspection should be carried out by an expert in the presence of an expert, the selected nominee of the owner or driver of the vehicle.  I am sure that, on reading the amendment, the Minister will agree with me it is a reasonable one and I ask him to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, I shall say that I understand there are in the country twenty-nine public service vehicle inspectors.  Six of them are in Dublin and three are in Cork.  The application of this amendment, if it became law, would undoubtedly bring about a situation wherein the whole section we are discussing would become entirely unworkable for the Garda.  Secondly, there is no guarantee that public service vehicle inspectors as such will remain and that they will be there for all time as we now know them.  First, we may not have them in the future and, secondly, in view of the way the numbers are dispersed, the position would become known to all and sundry who were &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; by the Garda and the further they were from a chance of being examined by a public service vehicle inspector in regard to likely defects the more quickly they would opt for and ask for such an examination, which in fact it would not be practicable to give.  For those reasons, I am inclined to say to the House that the amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  One can understand the practical difficulties the Minister has mentioned, the fact that there are only twenty-nine public service vehicle inspectors in the country, six of whom are located in Dublin, three in Cork <Col N="1809" /> and the other twenty distributed throughout the country.  I have not got a copy of the amendment before me and I do not know whether it specifies these particular officers the Minister has mentioned, but there should be some such safeguard.  As it it, the section gives power to any member of the Garda to hold up any sort of a vehicle, or indeed a pedal cyclist, to insist on an inspection and then to direct, if he thinks fit, that a certain line of action be taken by the driver of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister are the ordinary members of the Garda competent or equipped to carry out any sort of inspection of a motor car, lorry or even a pedal cycle?  As far as I know, no such training is given to them during their training period in the Depot.  Therefore, if it is not these public service vehicle inspectors, it should be some special branch of the Garda, some members specially equipped, who will be given these powers and who will be the only members with such powers.</P>
      <P>The safeguards the Minister mentioned in this big section are not quite enough.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say: &ldquo;Right! If a member of the Garda tells him that the steering is defective, or the brakes are defective, he can go to a garage and get the garage man to adjudicate.  If the garage man tells him the steering or the brakes are all right, he can ignore the Guard.&rdquo;  That is little consolation to the motorist.  What does the Guard do after that?  Does the Guard have to be satisfied that the defect was corrected or take the word of a competent mechanic that in fact there was no defect in the brakes or steering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Guards are equipped to do a particular job, equipped to be able to determine whether or not the law is being broken, the specified law, the law that is given in detail, the law which in most cases they have learned in some detail.  What do they know about the mechanical end of a car? How many members of the Garda are entitled to tell a driver of 20, 25 or <Col N="1810" /> 30 years driving experience whether or not his steering is right?  What constitutes a major defect?  I do not know whether the Minister believes that that power should be given to every member of the Garda.  If there was a scheme to train, say, every second or third man in the Garda, that would be all right.</P>
    <P>As I said on the last occasion we discussed this Bill, I can well appreciate the sort of reception some members of the Garda would get from experienced drivers.  You are only going to provoke trouble if you permit a situation in which any member of the Garda can challenge a driver of 20, 25 or 30 years experience and tell him he must go to the nearest garage.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment, he should undertake between now and Report Stage to introduce an amendment which will give power to certain members of the Garda to carry out certain inspections on motor cars, lorries and pedal cycles. He should not give it to every member because every one of them, to say the least of it, is certainly not equipped to carry out an inspection of a motor car or lorry and certainly is not in a position to determine, as against the experience of an experienced mechanic or driver, whether a car is roadworthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also appreciate the Minister's difficulty in the matter in view of the fact that he has such a limited number of small public service vehicle inspectors at his disposal.  I can see his difficulty in giving this amendment the thought and merit which are its due in view of his handicap.  I understand that, at the moment, the great majority of the Gardaí passing through the Depot have some experience and are taught some of the skills necessary for the care and maintenance of motor cars.  It should be possible that, at least in every district, there would be a member of the Garda who would have a certificate from his superior officer that he was a skilled person to examine a vehicle in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties with regard to older Gardaí is that when they were in the Depot motor cars were not as <Col N="1811" /> common as they are now.  In fact, some of the older men find it difficult to operate the ordinary push bicycle. Things have changed from that state of affairs.  I am informed that in the next four or five years every member of the original force will have disappeared and that we shall have a complete new set of Gardaí.  Even the Minister for Justice has now given instructions that no Garda over the age of 45 years will be employed to drive a State car.  It is presumed that all new Gardaí will have some experience of motors.</P>

      <P>These new recruits are now receiving some instruction on car maintenance and in the manipulation of motor cars.  While some of them may not be as apt as others, surely those who show efficiency could be issued with a certificate and at least one expert could be allocated to each Garda sub-district.  If there was a dispute with the owner or driver of a vehicle, that particular individual could be called in to inspect and examine the vehicle and the owner would have the right to nominate a mechanic or motor expert to be present at that examination.  Later on, in the event of a court prosecution, the manner in which such an examination was carried out could be a matter for cross-examination and the defending <Col N="1812" /> lawyer would only know about that if an expert was present when the examination was taking place.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would undertake to substitute a Garda expert for the P.S.V. inspector it would meet the amendment.  In fact, he may decide to abolish the P.S.V. inspectors altogether. If the Minister would substitute a Garda skilled in the mechanics of motoring for the inspector and, at the same time, put in a clause to enable the driver or owner of the vehicle to have present at the examination his own mechanic or expert it would meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am not very much impressed with the first part of the amendment but I am with the second part.  As I understand the position, the Garda concerned would only have to identify a major defect in a vehicle.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the inspection of a vehicle by any member of the Garda who is not qualified might lead to trouble.  It might lead to a vehicle being put off the road unjustly or it might lead to a prosecution which was not justified.  I wonder could we split the amendment or withdraw it and try again on Report Stage to cover the second part which provides for an examination by a qualified person nominated by the owner or driver? Otherwise a private individual could be unfairly prejudiced.  If the second part of the amendment could be covered I do not think there is any great need for the first part.  I do not know whether the Minister would be prepared to comment on that matter or whether Deputy O'Higgins would be prepared to comment on it.  If we could make sure that the examination was carried out in the presence of a qualified person it would be a great protection against unjust or irresponsible reports by Gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty in providing fully qualified inspectors but that would only be necessary if full certificates of road-worthiness were going to be given.  If it is a question of a major defect, a Garda should be able to stop a vehicle and have it directed to a place where it would be <Col N="1813" /> checked.  I do not feel that the Garda on his own should have the right to put a vehicle off the road or initiate a prosecution unless he is more qualified than the ordinary Garda can possibly be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate also the Minister's difficulty in trying to implement the full proposals in Deputy Costello's amendment.  I think it is a fair answer to make that he has not got the men capable of doing this job but, as Deputy Booth points out, the amendment is, in effect, in two parts.  It is designed, first, to have a properly qualified person on behalf of the Garda to examine the vehicle and, secondly, to ensure from the point of view of the owner or driver that he will be represented by some qualified person at the examination.  This amendment would be of particular importance in relation to paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of this section, that is, in relation to the authority which a Garda has under that subsection to require a car or vehicle to be brought for subsequent examination, apart from the spot check done on the road.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands at the moment it is simply stated bluntly in the subsection that a Garda may give that order.  There is nothing to protect the rights or interests of the owner or user of the car.  There is no provision which says that he is even entitled to be present at the examination no matter by whom it is conducted.  It does seem to me that it is of very considerable importance from the point of view of ordinary justice, if there is going to be a prosecution following such an examination, that the person being prosecuted should have had the opportunity of being present, if he wants to be present and, secondly, of having some properly qualified person present to see the examination on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I think the amendment as drafted would be the ideal provision to make with regard to these powers which are being given, if the Minister says to the Dáil that it is impossible to implement it because there are not sufficient qualified people to do it, I would be prepared to accept that but <Col N="1814" /> it applies only to portion of the amendment.  I would urge on the Minister that he should insert provisions in the Bill which will cover the second part of the amendment, that is, the aspects of the amendment about which Deputy Booth spoke.  If the Minister does that, he will be meeting the situation reasonably and will be bridging what seems to me to be a definite defect in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment in the name of Deputy Costello is moved in the belief that a little learning is a dangerous thing and in the conviction that the less knowledge a man has the more intolerant he becomes of critics. If the Garda force is so understaffed with mechanical experts it is all the more reason why the amendment should be accepted.  A member of the Garda Síochána who spends a year in the Depot learning the multitudionous duties of a Garda may have some portion of that time allotted for a certain amount of instruction in mechanically propelled vehicles but that little knowledge may make him the greatest tyrant imaginable.  It is on that account that we on this side of the House felt that the motorist ought to be protected.</P>
      <P>There are in the State at the moment well over 250,000 mechanically propelled vehicles.  That being so, it is about time that the State took very definite action to increase the number of Gardaí who would be in a position to test mechanically propelled vehicles and to give expert opinions as to their condition.  We will have to increase the number of men who know more about mechanically propelled vehicles than is learnt during a couple of hours' training in the Depot.  Many members of the Garda have got little or no training in mechanically propelled vehicles.  On that account, while acceptance of the amendment may impose a considerable burden on the Garda and on the State in general, we believe that where there are over 250,000 mechanically propelled vehicles in the country and when it is likely that before an amending Bill can be passed the number will be 500,000, there should be far more members of the Garda in a position to test mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> That is why I think what Deputy O'Donnell has said merits serious consideration, that even though we are not going to have any more inspectors, at least we should have in each sub-district some man who could test mechanically propelled vehicles with more competence than the ordinary member of the Garda on the beat has.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the amendment, which seeks to confer on a motorist the right to have his own mechanic present at an examination, apart from the reasons already offered, there is another very important reason.  In the course of a detailed inspection of a mechanically propelled vehicle which may entail some stripping down it is quite possible that even with the best of goodwill some damage may be caused to the vehicle. It is only if a member of the public has his own engineer or mechanic present that he will be made aware that some of the damage, at least, was caused in the course of the inspection.</P>
    <P>It is an amendment which deserves serious consideration.  It should not be dismissed out of hand because of the burden it will impose on the State. Under the Bill, I believe quite rightly, a serious burden will be imposed on all motorists and owners of mechanically propelled vehicles.  That being so, the State ought to shoulder the burden of having more competent vehicle inspectors in each sub-district.  The State should also allow the motorist to have his own mechanic or engineer present at an examination, if he wants to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have been somewhat misunderstood.  While I used the two very obvious arguments of the small number of P.S.V. inspectors throughout the country and the manner of their dispersal throughout the country&mdash;six in Dublin, three in Cork and the rest scattered throughout the land&mdash;I am sorry if the House took that to be the only argument that could be thought of against this amendment.  I gave these as the obvious ones, at the outset.  I indicated that by writing into this Bill mention <Col N="1816" /> of P.S.V. inspectors, we would, in fact, be tying ourselves to something which is not static and need not necessarily remain.  In other words, there may not be P.S.V. inspectors as such in future. To regard them as being in existence for all time or for the next 25 or 30 years would be rather straining the situation.</P>
      <P>Over and above that, let us consider the situation for a moment.  If, for instance, a Garda, no matter how unqualified from a mechanical point of view, observes a mechanically propelled vehicle&mdash;a car, truck, motorcycle or what you will&mdash;careering madly through any town, street or village, wobbling about, perhaps almost knocking down somebody, apparently incapable of being pulled up, surely it would be unreasonable at that stage to say that only a person who was qualified mechanically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting point.  The Garda then pulls up the driver.  He is not medically qualified, as one might expect he would be required to be if this line of argument were used, to determine on the spot and, if necessary, arrest the driver in the belief that he was under the influence of drink or drugs.  Apparently, objection is taken to his asking the driver to let him have a look over the machine, to find out by depressing the brake pedal and by twisting the steering wheel, whether or not it has any defect.  At that stage, even though it was in the middle of the night, on a country road, miles away from mechanics, garages or P.S.V. inspector centres, what would be the position if this amendment were carried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Garda be expected to stand by the machine until the following morning until somebody came along to find where he was lost? Would it be expected that he should hare off through the country, leaving the motorist on the side of the road, expecting him to be there when he returned having rooted out of bed a <Col N="1817" /> qualified mechanic and a P.S.V. inspector from some place miles away, and all that in order to allow the defendant&mdash;as he would later turn out to be&mdash;an opportunity, as the Deputies have put it to the House of getting fair treatment and justice?  Is that to be the position, despite the fact that by depressing the brake pedal it would be quite obvious there was not a screed of brake on the machine and, by twisting the steering wheel, that it did not work until you had turned it <Col N="1818" /> twice around and that then it began to take up?  There is no Garda on the beat today who is so lacking in knowledge and intelligence that he would not know at that stage, in relation to those two points, that the machine should not be further used in the interest of public safety.</P>
