      <P>The only available information on the first part of the Deputy's question relates to the number of new social welfare insurance cards issued in each insurance year. The average number of new insurance cards issued to males in the period January, 1956 to January, 1961, covering five insurance years, was 27,938 per annum, while the average number of new cards issued to females in the period July 1955 to July 1960 covering five insurance years, was 26,668 per annum.  Thus the average total number of new cards issued to all persons, disregarding the non-coincidence of the insurance years for males and females, was 54,606.</P>
      <P>No estimate is available of the number of persons who emigrate annually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Central Bank will take steps to expedite the publication of their reports in view of the fact that the public must now wait three months before they have an opportunity to obtain important information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the increasing public concern at the reluctance of his Department and the Central Bank to furnish to the Dáil, on request, important information concerning the financial affairs of the State, including the value of Exchequer Bills and Bills of Exchange rediscounted for the year ended 31st March, 1961; and why such practice has been allowed to develop at a time when the national interest demands a wider understanding of financial affairs and up-to-date information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the reports of the Central Bank have been published as soon as is possible after the end of each financial year.</P>
      <P>There has been no reluctance on the part of my Department to furnish information to the Dáil on matters for which I am responsible as Minister for Finance.  I am responsible for the issue of Exchequer Bills but not for any rediscounting of such bills by the Central Bank or any other bank, financial institution or individual.  As I said on a previous occasion, it is more appropriate that informative material about the discharge of its discretionary functions should be published by the Central Bank itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is Yes.</P>
      <P>I am advised that all the coal seams in the Connaught Coalfield are contained in the Millstone Grit formation which occurs on the high ground of the mountains surrounding Lough Allen.  In the diamond drilling programme which is at present in progress, the borehole sites have been selected in places where coal seams have not already been proved by deep drilling or by adequate shaft sinking or mining.</P>
      <P>The Arigna River has cut its course through the Yoredale Shale series which lies below the level of the coal-bearing beds of the Millstone Grit formation.  The Yoredale Shale strata are barren of coal seams.  Underlying the Yoredale Shale strata, occurs the carboniferous limestone formation which is also devoid of coal seams both in the Connaught Coalfield district and elsewhere in this country.</P>
      <P>I am advised, therefore, that deep diamond drilling for coal in Yoredale Shale and Carboniferous Limestone of the Lough Allen district would be fruitless and boring for coal under the Arigna River could not be justified on geological grounds.</P>

    <P>10.  Payment of the Grant in respect of any pupil may be withheld if, in the opinion of the Minister, the pupil (a) is unable to profit fully by the instruction in the class in which he is enrolled, or (b) has not reached a sufficient standard of education for admission to a secondary school class.</P>
    <P>11.  Grant shall not be payable in respect of the same pupil for more than four years as a recognised junior pupil, or for more than two years as a recognised senior pupil.  It may, however, be paid for a third year in respect of a recognised senior pupil who, not having obtained a Pass with Honours at the Leaving Certificate Examination at the end of his second year, obtains a Pass with Honours at the examination at the end of his third year.</P>
    <P>12.  When a recognised pupil has been transferred from one secondary school to another during the school year, the Grant in respect of that pupil may be divided between the two schools in such proportion as the Minister may think fit, or the Minister may direct that the whole or any portion of the Grant be paid to one of the schools, or he may refuse to pay any grant in respect of that pupil.</P>
    <P>13 (a) The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in consideration of the high standard of efficiency of the instruction in a school in any year, increase the Capitation Grant payable to the school in respect of that year by a sum not exceeding one-tenth of such grant.</P>
    <P>(b)  This increase in grant shall not be payable until the high standard of efficiency has been maintained for three successive years.</P>
    <P>14.  The Capitation Grant in the case of any school may, after due notice, be reduced in respect of any year in which adequate provision is not made for carrying out the Minister's regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> 15.  (a)  The Grant for any school year may, after due notice, be reduced or withheld in respect of a class in which the instruction did not reach a satisfactory standard or the number of pupils was too large for efficient instruction by one teacher.</P>
    <P>(b)  In case of continued inefficiency of the instruction in a school for two successive years, the Minister may withhold further grant from the school or may withdraw recognition from the school.</P>
    <P>16.  In the case of a school (or class or classes) in which the standard of oral Irish is not satisfactory, the grant for such school (or class or classes) may be reduced or withheld altogether.</P>
    <P>17.  The decision of the Minister on questions concerning the efficiency of the instruction in a school for the purpose of these rules will be based mainly on the Inspectors' reports, but the results obtained by the pupils of the school at the Certificate Examinations will also be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the Deputy who put down this amendment would seem to be to include, for instance, pedal cycles, by excluding the words &ldquo;mechanically propelled&rdquo; as they appear at line 48 of subsection (1) of this section.  While there is no intention that the vehicles which would come under the definition of pedal cycles should be ignored in the general law that we would enact here, at the same time to take these words out would complicate matters to this degree.  At the outset, it would put the defective cycle in the same category as a dangerously defective mechanically propelled vehicle or motor vehicle.  The situation then is that, while these nonmechanically propelled vehicles are not included in this section, they can and will be included under Section 11 and the common penalties of up to £20 maximum fine will apply to them. I do not recommend to the House their being brought in under Section 54.  I think they cannot be regarded as being in the same category as a dangerously defective mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can see the Minister's point on part of this, surely there should be some provision somewhere to ensure that a person cannot, for example, ride a bicycle without a screed of a brake on it?  He is certainly just as liable as anybody else to cause a serious accident.  If it is not in Section 54, where exactly is it?</P>

      <P>Under Section 11, paragraph (a) refers to the construction of vehicles; paragraph (b) refers to vehicle equipment and paragraph (c) refers to the use and misuse of vehicles.  Surely that does not enable the Minister to cope with a defective bicycle in the same way as Section 54 enables him to cope with a defective motor car?  Surely the bicycle in relation to Section 11 is in a different position?  If the Minister's analogy were complete, why should there be any necessity for Section 54 at all?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would approach the matter from this point of view?  Does it weaken his Bill in any way to take the words &ldquo;mechanically propelled&rdquo; out of Section 54?  This seems to me to be the position.  If you leave in the words &ldquo;mechanically propelled&rdquo; in Section <Col N="1036" /> 54, you are definitely imposing a quite definite limitation on the operation of the section, whereas if you take them out they still cover mechanically propelled vehicles but they will also cover other vehicles which may from time to time require to be dealt with under the provisions of Section 54.  I would suggest to the Minister that the amendment is certainly designed to strengthen the provisions of the Bill. It certainly does not weaken them.  If the Minister would approach it from that point of view, he might find it very desirable to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my mind is concerned on this, it is six of one and half a dozen of the other whether it is in or not in this amendment, as the Deputy describes it.  I do not think it is necessary.  We can cover it fully and adequately under Section 11.  On the other hand, if the Deputies feel they want it, I do not object.  I have a completely open mind on the matter. If we can have power in Section 11 and exercise it, to put it in is unnecessary. In addition, it will also create the situation&mdash;although this is not an argument&mdash;where we will have to amend the Second Schedule and subsection (2) of the Section.  Certain other consequential changes will have to be made as to penalties.  Since we can deal with the matter under Section 11, I am inclined to leave it as it stands.  If the House wishes to bring it in, I am not terribly strong-minded about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point about the matter.  If the words &ldquo;mechanically propelled&rdquo; are taken out of the subsection, then the driver, the user of any vehicle will be guilty of an offence under subsection (2) but only the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle can be guilty of an offence under Section 11.  Why should the owner of a defective horse-drawn vehicle be put in a better position than the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle if the drivers are equally guilty?  I think this matter would need some further examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that under Section 11 he can deal with the position of a cyclist who rides machines which are dangerous.  I would represent to the Minister that there ought not to be any analogy between the position of a person riding a bicycle and a person driving a mechanically propelled vehicle for this reason. Generally speaking, the cyclist is the greater danger to himself or herself, whereas the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle is a danger to the public at large.  Cyclists may be and frequently are held up to be a source of danger and sometimes a source of inconvenience but their danger is dangerous to themselves.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison whatever between a bicycle with defective brakes and a motor vehicle with defective brakes.  A strong case can be made, where an offence is committed and the question of punishment arises, for a wide distinction between the owner of a bicycle, who may have it on the hire purchase merely to get to and from work, and the owner of a motor vehicle.</P>

To enforce such an order in respect of a cyclist or horse-drawn vehicle would be rather difficult.  For that reason, the powers the Minister has in the earlier section might be the better way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>I think it is worth the Minister's while to emphasise that a new offence is being created by virtue of this section.  It is the offence of dangerous parking.  Everyone will <Col N="1038" /> agree it is wise that this section should appear in the Bill, and the Minister should endeavour to give the greatest possible publicity to the fact that when this Bill has been passed, it will be an offence, carrying fairly heavy penalties and, in certain circumstances, disqualification, to park a vehicle dangerously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one point. This is a very long Bill, and if I have missed it, I am very sorry, but I should like to know what is dangerous parking. Is it described anywhere in the Bill?  Take parking in relation to a white line in the middle of a road. That is done by members of the community in the city of Dublin, including members of the Garda Síochána, especially in Donnybrook.  I understand a white line runs outside the barracks in Donnybrook and it is impossible for the Garda to park their cars outside without breaking it.  If there is to be an offence for dangerous driving, there should be some description of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been accustomed to prosecutions for dangerous parking.  I do not think any offence arises at all, unless obstruction can be proved.  Deputy Sheldon talked about the white line.  In itself, the white line at the moment has no legal force whatever.  He asked a very pertinent question.  What is dangerous parking and what is parking at all?  Is it merely stopping, or is there any definition of parking as distinct from stopping to let down a load?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very clear.  The mere fact that you bring a vehicle to a stop and hold it there for even 15 seconds means you are keeping it stationary.  Under this Bill, the onus of proving who parked the vehicle is thrown on the owner.  As a result of a High Court decision some time ago, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove who actually parked the vehicle.  It was not sufficient to prove who came out and drove it off.  We should have a more definite definition of parking. <Col N="1039" /> It should be related to causing obstruction.</P>
      <P>The Minister has issued a directive to local authorities informing them that on our roadways, we should provide for lay-bys for parking purposes.  I do not agree with that.  These lay-bys may be very useful where there are long stretches of roads, as in Great Britain and America, but here, there is ample room in our towns and villages for the parking of vehicles.  It will take away from the business of towns and villages if we create expensive lay-bys to hold five or six vehicles.  If the Minister is referring to parking such as that, I would prefer to see some unused space in our towns and villages being availed of for parking purposes in preference to lay-bys on country roads such as they have on the long distance routes from London to Edinburgh and Glasgow. It would be a very bad principle if that is the type of parking the Minister visualises in the section, and I think it is one we should reconsider.</P>

      <P>What I should like to see in this section is a provision similar to that in Section 53.  What must be cut out as far as possible, whether by means of lay-bys or traffic legislation, is the leaving of vehicles parked unlighted on main roads. There have been very many fatal accidents as a result of people parking vehicles in that manner.  If we had provisions such as those in Section 53, we could lay down regulations and laws which would provide punishments in accordance with the seriousness of the offence.  In many housing schemes in Dublin, particularly the old ones, no garages were provided at all.  If the Minister and any of his officials care to drive around the suburbs of Dublin at night, they will find many unlighted cars parked on the public road and quite often right beside corners in what could be called dangerous positions; but there is nowhere else for these people to park their cars.  The two types of offence are quite different: the large unlighted vehicle on what might be called fast highways and the other unlighted vehicles in suburban areas.  I <Col N="1040" /> should like the Minister to look at it from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word to what has been said.  I appreciate the difficulty of being adequately explicit in a Bill of this kind.  On the other hand, I think uncertainty as to the meaning of the law is a deplorable thing.  The Minister has sought to define dangerous parking in subsection (1) of Section 55:</P>
      <P>A person shall not park in a public place a vehicle in such a position or in such condition or in such circumstances as to be likely to cause danger to other persons using the place.</P>
      <P>I should be prepared to accept that definition, if the Minister saw fit to go on with it, and add to the section specified circumstances which would be declared by statute to come within the meaning of subsection (1).</P>
      <P>I introduced a Bill here earlier in the year and it was rejected on the ground that this Bill was coming forward. That Bill was designed to make it a statutory offence to park a large lorry on a public highway without adequate illumination.  Since the Dáil decided not to consider the Bill I submitted, I think another man has been killed by driving smack into the back of one of these lorries.  If we had passed that Bill dealing with that specific problem at the time I suggested it, that man might have been alive today, because anybody owning a fleet of these lorries would have known he could not put them on the road again without providing adequate illumination as prescribed by the Minister by regulation or by this House by specific legislative provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great evil of parking when you are driving in the country is the large lorry parked during the night without adequate rear illumination.  I think it should be referred to specifically, but there are other perils with which those of us who drive are only too familiar. These include the man who parks his car on a country road just around the corner.  It is very hard to define that and I think probably the Minister is right in saying he cannot define that <Col N="1041" /> more explicitly than he has attempted to do in subsection (1).  I understand there is a regulation in the city of Dublin&mdash;whether it is Dublin Metropolitan Police regulation or a corporation regulation I do not know &mdash;which prohibits parking within so many yards of a corner of the street, and I think the Garda are at present enforcing that regulation.  That is a reasonable regulation, but, mark you, in that case steps have been taken by bye-laws to define a parking offence. If you park within a certain number of yards of the corner of a street, that is an offence and there is no arguing as to whether it was safe or unsafe to do so.</P>
    <P>I think it is eminently desirable, in connection with this legislation, so far as it is possible, for us to define offences with certainty.  We are only too conscious in respect of many matters to which this Bill will apply that a degree of certainty is inaccessible to us but there will be certainties.  For instance, I greatly shocked Deputy Murphy by saying I would be in favour of legislation that would say: &ldquo;If you drive, you must not drink and if you drink, you must not drive.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not vote for that.  He was absent when the division was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not agree entirely with the specific amendment that was put down and I did not want to vote for that but I want to reaffirm, in case Deputy Murphy thinks I wish to mend my hand on that, that I should like to arrive at certainty in regard to the matter I have just mentioned, parking dangerously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the hardship Deputy Murphy mentions that when you come to a rigid definition, it means that you possibly exclude certain things over and above the minimum necessary for absolute safety.  I think there is many a street corner where there is no serious danger in parking within so many yards of the corner and yet there are so many street corners where it is dangerous to do so that I think it is right and fair to say: &ldquo;You may not park within so many yards of any <Col N="1042" /> corner because now you know if you do that anywhere, there will be no argument as to whether it was safe or unsafe to do it because it is an offence&mdash;so, do it nowhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think you ought to say that if you park a lorry without illumination on a road, there is no use in arguing that it is an unfrequented road or that there is any other kind of justification. The answer is that it is an offence&mdash;nobody must do it&mdash;and even if, in very special circumstances, you could argue that it was safe to do it, we have made it a statutory offence so that nobody will do it anywhere and anybody who does it anywhere will be under no illusion that he is breaking the law.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I think the Minister is in the difficulty that it is very hard to define every instance of dangerous parking and that he has to rely on some case of definition such as is contained in subsection (1) but I do not think he should stop there, because subsection (1) is going to leave a wide area of uncertainty in regard to certain matters which I believe we are all agreed should be stopped.  I suggest that between now and Report Stage a limited number of specific cases of dangerous parking should be defined and added to that general section.</P>
    <P>The situation then would be that there would be certain statutory parking offences clearly defined and, in addition, it would be open to the Garda to charge a man with having parked a vehicle in a way which did not come within any of the statutory definitions of dangerous parking but which was likely to cause danger to other persons using the place.  In these border-line cases, the defendant would be free to appear before the district justice and to argue that it was not dangerous.  I believe that if the Minister did consider that, he would come as near to defining dangerous parking as it is practicable to do in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>This subsection (1) is vaguely worded and I should like to know the Minister's definition of &ldquo;a public place,&rdquo; as set out in this section. The section, as it stands, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> (1)  A person shall not park in a public place a vehicle in such a position or in such condition or in such circumstances as to be likely to cause danger to other persons using the place.</P>

      <P>We all agree that vehicles parked on the side of a public road should be well lighted, but what I have in mind are towns and villages where it is the usual custom to park unlighted vehicles overnight.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, some of these people have no alternative, no accommodation, and cannot be expected to leave lights on their vehicles overnight.  Does a small village come within the definition of &ldquo;a public place?&rdquo;  The Minister should answer that and we must bear in mind that so far as parking vehicles unlighted at night in public streets is concerned, few, if any, accidents have been caused by such custom because everyone travelling through built-up areas at night is aware of this likelihood and consequently drives carefully.  I should like to have the Minister's view on what is the definition of &ldquo;a public place&rdquo; in so far as it relates to subsection (1) of Section 55.  Will it be in order, if this section is passed, to continue this old-established custom of parking vehicles on the side of the streets in towns and villages as heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Dillon.  It is too much a matter of opinion in subsection (1) and it does require that certain specific offences should be named in the section.  The Minister should have a look at it between now and the Report Stage.  Deputy Murphy has a point in regard to built-up areas, particularly areas where there is street lighting.  It is obvious that it is not as dangerous to have an unlighted vehicle parked at night in such places as it is on the country roads.  There is no doubt that there is this appalling danger of unlighted lorries parked on <Col N="1044" /> highways causing accidents.  It is not only on fast highways accidents occur either and I should not like it to be inferred that this arises only where traffic is assumed to be travelling at high speed.  It can occur on any road and it can occur from more than a parked lorry.  It can occur from a parked car, if the road is a narrow one. Admittedly on a wide road a parked car is probably not a serious danger.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon said, I do not think we can just leave it on the assumption that the fellow who parked the car thought it was all right.  We should make it an offence except in a built-up area.  No matter what &ldquo;public place&rdquo; may be, I should make an exception where there is street lighting in built-up areas because there is the difficulty that there are areas where there are no other places to park in villages and towns which were built before cars became a problem.  In the built-up area, the danger obviously is not so great.  I should not like to see it made an offence equally with the offence of parking on an unlighted road, be it highway or by-way.</P>
      <P>With regard to prohibiting parking on all corners, the obvious difficulty arises as to what is a corner.  That is reasonably simple in a city or town where streets intersect at reasonably sharp angles but it raises a nice point as to what is a corner and what is a bend along a road.  The solution is to give white lines legal force and to see that any corner where danger may arise has a white line and prohibit parking where there is a white line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were enforced a great deal of danger could be obviated.  We have got white lines but the odd thing is that they have not got legal force.  They have got legal force in Northern Ireland and the people seem to respect them or not respect them in both places.  The number of motorists who ignore white lines, which are there for their own safety, is terrifying and shows a degree of carelessness which in some cases is bound to lead to disastrous results. I do not see much point in having white lines unless they are given legal <Col N="1045" /> force.  In this regard it would be a very useful way of marking roads not only on bends but on roads that are too narrow to cater for parking.  Put a white line there and prevent parking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the definition or lack of definition of parking.  The definition section does define parking but that in itself is inadequate.  A &ldquo;public place&rdquo; as has been stated, has also been defined.  What some of us have missed in this debate is the penalty people may incur if they park incorrectly. That is a very good reason why there should be a better definition of parking.  There are about six or seven types of parking.  The first might not be dangerous but the sixth might be very very dangerous and might lead to a loss of life.  If I park my car some five feet from a corner in the City of Dublin, there is not much chance that anybody will be hurt.</P>
      <P>Again, under the definition of parking if I park my car, or if a lorry is parked on a fast public highway on a slight bend it certainly could be dangerous.  But according to this section if I double-park for the purpose of delivering a parcel or to make an enquiry in the City of Dublin I may find myself liable to a fine of £20 and I may be put in jail.  If I do it a second time, I am liable to a fine not exceeding £50 and I may be, as the section puts it, at the discretion of the courts, liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.  Therefore we do not distinguish between what is regarded as very dangerous parking and what is regarded as careless parking.</P>
      <P>I do not see why we cannot subdivide parking into two sections.  Parking can come under five, six or perhaps seven different types of heading and we should lay down in this section, or in another section, what the different types of parking are and the different fines and terms of imprisonment that may be imposed.  With some of the district justices whom we have we may, for a simple parking offence, receive a £50 fine and be thrown into jail for a couple of months.  Some of our justices would do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies who have spoken have without exception referred, in some way or other, to the fact that this is dealing with a specific offence.  That is just the whole point. This section is a special new section to deal with a specific problem.  The lack of definition has been criticised and seems to stick out in the discussion but we should realise that Section 55 and the creation of this special offence is superimposed on the bye-laws which may be made under Part VIII of this Bill.  These bye-laws will deal with the normal parking problems such as were instanced by Deputy Corish, the normal parking problems in towns or cities.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, the stopping of vehicles on rural roads outside towns and cities will also be dealt with by regulation under Part VIII.  Over and above that, Section 55 deals with this rather special problem which is difficult to define of the dangerous parking about which we have heard so much, which we all deplore and which we realise in several ways has caused many deaths and which will, if it goes on as it has in the past, cause a considerable number more. Dangerous parking or parking in circumstances likely to cause danger, is a matter which because of the difficulty of its definition, and because of the fact that the normal parking problem will be dealt with by regulation under another part of the Bill, and dealt with separately so far as penalties are concerned should be dealt with in the courts.  We felt that the proper place for this matter to be defined in each individual case is in the courts when the circumstances and all the facts have been put in evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any attempt to legislate in a definitive way would, I think, defeat entirely the whole purpose of the section, which is all-embracing, so that no escape clause can be invoked and if there is parking in dangerous places which is liable to cause loss of life, it just cannot be got away with. That is the real significance of the section.  It is a special section superimposed on the normal parking regulations made under the other parts <Col N="1047" /> of the Bill, and superimposed on the requirements of the regulations as to the lighting and stopping of vehicles on rural roads and in special circumstances which, as I say, will come to be decided by the courts.  The penalties are to be heavy and are intended to wipe out this very dangerous parking practice which has grown up throughout the country. Because of those heavy penalties and the consequences that may follow successful prosecutions and convictions under Section 55, I feel the circumstances of the individual cases should be brought before the court when a conviction is being sought.</P>
    <P>The lack of definition&mdash;definition is difficult and, in fact, impossible without weakening the section or leaving loopholes&mdash;does not weaken the section or what follows from it.  I want the House to be quite clear on that.  If I felt for a moment that anything that is said in or omitted from the section would weaken what is the intention of the House or my intention, I would take steps to remedy that position.  I am most definitely and very strongly of the opinion that this dangerous parking must cease.  The penalties must be such that people will have consideration for other road users.  It is for that reason that this special section is in the Bill superimposed, as it is, on the general ordinary parking and lighting regulations which will be made under Part VIII of the Bill.  There is no question whatsoever that there is any weakening of the section.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Corish has said, that in some odd cases the district justice may give what may appear to be an unusual decision, nevertheless, if it is against the defendant and if he and his legal advisers are strongly of the opinion that he has had a raw deal, the case will not rest on the verdict of that district justice.  I would not even go so far as to agree that such a case will arise and be dealt with in such a manner by a district justice in any part of the country.  If it should happen, it is open to the defendant to appeal to another judge in another court.  That may be a hardship, but, on the other hand, the parking of <Col N="1048" /> vehicles in such a manner as is likely to constitute danger to other road users is a very serious matter and it is one with which we must deal strenuously.  Possibly, in trying to deal with it strenuously and trying to make an impression on the public about this matter, it may well be that some of us in using the roads and improperly parking may have to bear the brunt of the law.  If we do, it is a necessary part of the cleaning up of this dangerous situation which has developed and one which must stop if we are to regard ourselves as civilised.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell took exception to a circular issued recently by my Department dealing with lay-bys.  I want to make the position quite clear to the House.  Deputy O'Donnell seemed to imply that the encouragement of parking by the provision of lay-bys is a retrograde step and one which will do a disservice to our towns and villages, the implication being that, if there were no lay-bys and we enforced no parking, everyone would be shushed into the town to park.  What would be the purpose of shushing them into the towns if they did not want to go there?  Secondly, not all of the parking which causes danger and obstruction on the rural roads is the type of parking that would be done in cities, towns, or villages.  This House is not so innocent as to think that.</P>
    <P>We realise that, if we are to impose these laws on the road using public, if we are to insist that vehicles, whether large or small, shall not be left parked on the public highway in circumstances likely to constitute a danger, we must in fairness try to provide some form of parking facilities in so far as that is within our power.  Lay-bys are one of the answers to that problem.  The second is that the shoulders of the roads, that is, the off roads or the ditches, should be rolled into hard spaces or, alternatively, as has been suggested, actual lay-bys should be provided in specific places.</P>
    <P>The circular merely notifies local authorities that this Bill, when passed, will enable Road Fund moneys to be used for rolling hard shoulders on the roadsides and providing lay-bys.  The cost of such works can be brought in <Col N="1049" /> as a charge on the Road Fund.  That is what the circular conveys to local authorities.  I do not think Deputy O'Donnell's view on the matter is at all sound.  I believe members of the House generally will appreciate that this circular and the provision in it is only what we should give to local authorities if we ask them to provide facilities for parking vehicles off the actual roadway. Otherwise, we would have penalties inflicted in cases in which there were no facilities available to park a vehicle off the road and the vehicle would have to remain parked in a dangerous place.  If it was through no fault of the driver&mdash;possibly there might be a breakdown or he might have a flat&mdash;and there was no hard shoulder, how could we expect him to drive the broken down vehicle or the vehicle with a flat tyre.  It would be far better to provide hard shoulders or lay-bys in as many places as possible to facilitate people who must stop and park for whatever cause.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition mentioned the fact that a private Bill was introduced by his Party some time ago and that that Bill was not gone ahead with because the measure we are now discussing was on the stocks. He said that it was a pity.  I wonder did he really consider what he said in full measure.  He said if it had been accepted at that time, at least one death would not have occurred.  That is an unfair implication.  It would be just as sensible for me to say that, had this Road Traffic Bill been brought in five years ago, one hundred and one deaths would not have occurred.</P>

      <P>Dublin is a city.  Surely there should be some difference.  The Minister cannot hold that O'Connell Street is equivalent to a small county road to which the public have access, and the definition in the Bill is the only definition given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If danger is created, whether it be in a relatively unimportant county road or in the middle of the City of Dublin, by parking a vehicle in certain circumstances an offence will be committed.  If a danger is created likely to constitute a menace, it does not matter two hoots whether the offence occurs in the heart of the country or in the middle of the city, it is still a danger and must be dealt with as such; the full rigours of the law must apply.  I do not suggest that O'Connell Street and a small country road are the same in every respect but, as far as the commission of this type of offence is concerned, carrying with it certain consequences, the, offence must be dealt with in a similar manner <Col N="1051" /> irrespective of whether it occurs in Dublin city or in the middle of the country.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy accepts that he will see that, while we define all public places in the same definition, it does not follow that the use of these places must be similar in all respects.  All I am saying is that if an offence in regard to a danger is created under this section, whether it be on a comparatively unfrequented country road or in the middle of Dublin city, an offence is committed by the settingup of that danger and, in that regard, the offences are identical.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, I agree with the Minister in relation to this section, but there is some validity in the point made by Deputy Corish and the validity is borne out, I think, by some of the Minister's remarks.  As I understand the Minister, and as I understand the Bill, Section 55 is a new section specifically creating a new offence of dangerous parking.  An ordinary parking offence which may be regarded as a minor offence will still continue to be dealt with as such offences have been dealt with up to the present under by-laws or regulations made by the Commissioner of the Garda.  That is an adequate answer, but some of the fears expressed here by Deputy Corish raise an important point.  The fact is that different district justices approach the same offence in different ways. There are some district justices who will impose the maximum penalties while others will take a more lenient view.  Deputy Corish was exercised in regard to the case in which a prosecution may be brought under Section 55 and, notwithstanding the fact that it appears to be a minor breach only, the defendant will get a jail sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger I see is that we are now creating a situation in which the Garda must, first of all, make up their minds whether they are to bring a prosecution for dangerous parking under Section 55 or a prosecution for breach of traffic by-laws under Section 90. Assume they decide to bring a prosecution under Section 55 rather than <Col N="1052" /> under Section 90 for a breach of by-laws, the defendant is then in the position that, if he is convicted, he will face the penalties laid down in Section 55.  The district justice is in the position that, if he convicts, he must convict the defendant under Section 55, and under no other section.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be worthwhile examining this section again with a view to allowing a district justice a certain discreation in the case of a prosecution brought under Section 55.  I think he should have a discretion.</P>
    <P>If he feels a prosecution should not have been brought under Section 55 because the parking offence was not of a sufficiently serious and dangerous nature as to warrant the penalties which can be imposed under that section, but there was nevertheless a degree of bad parking almost amounting to dangerous parking, he should have a discretion in such circumstances to convict for the lesser offence&mdash;for, as Deputy Corish suggested, the offence of careless parking.  I realise the Minister cannot be expected to make up his mind on that at the moment but I join with Deputy Corish in urging that the point is worthy of further consideration between now and the Report Stage, and I ask the Minister to give it that further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expecting the Minister to throw some light on what he has in mind so far as parking in public streets is concerned.  As I interpret this section, it spells the death knell to street parking at night all over the country.  That is a big step for this House to take.  I think it is an unwarranted step.  The Minister dealt with the undesirability of parking on rural roads.  Everyone agrees with him in that.  There is no difference of opinion inside this House so far as the parking at night of unlighted vehicles in rural areas is concerned. The point I have in mind&mdash;it is one on which I hoped the Minister would throw some light&mdash;is in a different category.  Is it to become an offence now in every town and village in the country to park a car without lights at night time?  We all know that the <Col N="1053" /> general custom is to park cars at night and there is no offence committed.</P>
      <P>The Garda and others have made no complaints.  Will we have the position now, if this section is passed as it stands, that a Garda in one village may implement the section, as it stands, and prosecute any man for parking his car overnight without a light while in the next village a different position may obtain?  The Garda in the next village may overlook the offence completely, on the basis that it is a longstanding custom.</P>
      <P>We must look at the adverse effect that this will have on business in rural towns and villages.  If a person were to come to a rural town or village in the winter months to transact business which may take him a few hours, does it mean that he must have his car lighted in a village where public lighting is available, if he wants to avoid conflict with Section 55?  Must he leave his lights on while he is transacting business?  If a resident in the area who has no alternative parking for his car, parks it in the street, must he keep the lights on?</P>
      <P>How is it that the Minister avoided that question?  His remarks centred around what happens on rural roads. As I mentioned earlier&mdash;the Minister dealt with this matter to some extent&mdash; all the roads are grouped as public places in the definition in Section 3. The section makes no distinction between O'Connell Street, Dublin, and the smallest country road, where circumstances are entirely different. Neither does the section make any distinction between O'Connell Street, Dublin and Schull.  At the present time in villages in West Cork and other parts of the country, there are cars parked on either side of the street.  They are not a public nuisance. Fortunately, we have not heard of accidents arising out of the parking of unlighted vehicles on public streets in towns and villages because, as I have already mentioned, people are careful. They expect, when driving through a built-up area, to meet cars parked on either side of the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this section wipe out that longstanding <Col N="1054" /> tradition?  I want a clear-cut answer from the Minister.  He is the person responsible in this house to give such an answer.  Is it his intention and the intention of the Department to make that an offence, irrespective of the circumstances, irrespective of the width of the street?  If I return to Schull to-night and park my car on the side of the street, if this Bill were law would I be guilty of an offence and would the Minister instruct the Garda Commissioner to send Gardaí to all these car owners and bring them before the courts, a thing that has never happened before?  I should like the Minister to address himself to that question.</P>

      <P>That was not in any way avoiding answering the Deputy's question.  The Deputy is unduly perturbed about this matter in the sense that he is taking too narrow a view of what seems to be the intention of the sections in the Bill.  He has put the question, will this Bill if it becomes law bring about a situation wherein no car can be parked on any street in any village, town or city henceforth without an offence being committed?  The answer to that overall concept is that that is not so but let me add that if danger is being created, whether it is by tradition or otherwise, that tradition will be removed if this law can do it and if we get it enforced.  If a car is being parked at the moment and is a danger to other road users&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way. The Deputy may, in fact, not disagree with me then.  I am merely saying that while I make the general answer to the general question on an extreme situation as seen by Deputy Murphy, at the same time, I do not want it to be understood that all traditional types of parking, dangerous and otherwise, will be allowed to continue.  I am saying here and now that, whether they are traditional parking methods or otherwise, if they are a danger and if a parking method is brought about, even traditionally, in circumstances which will be a danger, that parking and that type of parking must stop.</P>
      <P>It does not follow that every car in every street in every town, village and city must be taken off the street.  If the street is wide, if no danger is being created, if all these things are satisfied, it is quite obvious that Section 55 in particular would not apply at all.  It may well be that in between you may have the less dangerous case where it may be required that the car should have some light on it, not in all cases either, if the street is adequately lighted, if the car is clearly visible, if there is adequate width, if it is not an obstruction, if it is not causing danger.  In that event I can see that commonsense will prevail and there is no question of that type of parking being prohibited or of any person being taken to court as a result of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, when taking cases to court, Gardaí like to bring only cases in which they are likely to succeed.  Gardaí are not the half wits that some people seem to think they are, that they will run people into court knowing that they have not a hope of getting a conviction. They do not do that.  In fact, some Gardaí go in the opposite direction and do not bring enough cases to court, only watertight cases that will get a conviction.  If there is any error on that part of the Gardaí, it is that they do not take cases to court unless they are fairly sure of a conviction rather than the danger the Deputy seems to envisage that a Garda can take anybody to court.</P>
      <P>I suppose a man who was mad enough could take any one of us going out of the gate to-night, trump up a charge and take us to Court but it would be as much as his job would be worth when he got to court and found he had no case.  The same applies here.  We have to take it in the concept that commonsense will prevail in 99.9 per cent. of cases arising under this measure just as commonsense must prevail in all the other laws that we have enacted.</P>
      <P>If we cannot approach the matter in that way, if we are looking for the unique district justice who is going to do the queer thing and the wrong thing and ally him to the Garda who would prosecute where no case exists, if we are then to work back and base the laws that we pass in this House on that type of concept, where everything must be defined to the last letter of the law, with the last &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted and the last &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed we could not pass any laws that would make sense.  If we cannot trust the courts or the Garda or enforcement force, there is no point in making laws at all because they would not be administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have good reason by experience to expect by and large, in the vast majority of cases, between the courts and the Guards, a commonsense and <Col N="1057" /> down to earth approach to these matters.  It is in that way that we must approach this matter.</P>
    <P>In so far as public street parking is concerned, the passing of this enactment will not be the death knell of public streets.  I hope that it will remove the danger of the death knell for a number of street users whose lives in the present chaotic situation are liable to be cut short by the unthinking, the inconsiderate, the stupid and the ignorant road user who has no consideration for himself or anybody else. These people have to be brought to realise that there are other people on this earth who have as much right to be on it and to remain on it.  It is towards that type of mind that we must direct these measures and these penalties.  We do not want to see a man going to jail because he has parked his car but we do want to prevent people from parking in a manner that is likely to cause danger or death.  We have to prevent that if we can by whatever means at our disposal.  Here, we are trying to provide the means.  Those are the results to which we want to attain and those results are worth trying to attain.  In attaining them, the House may be well satisfied that indiscriminate, nonsensical application of any of the enactments or any of the sections or subsections of this Bill will not be allowed and that, in fact, the Bill will do what it is intended it should do.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned that.  While I fully agree that, because of the dangers of bad parking, which is getting worse and worse, we must put a stop to it, I am not terribly clear in regard to contributory negligence.  Suppose I park my car on a reasonably straight road and it is dry; after I have left my car there heavy rain occurs and the road surface becomes greasy.  A vehicle coming from the same direction in which I came finds difficulty in passing my car and I have created a danger.  Have I am defence?  I parked the car and it caused danger.  I know it should be open to me to argue that the other road user if he had used reasonable care, would not have got into trouble and there was contributory negligence.  However, I am not terribly sure whether or not contributory negligence is allowed for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of the other driver.  There is also a danger to the driver on the road from the person who overtakes.  The overtaker is guilty of anything that happens because he created the emergency.  I know this to my cost.  I had it all read to me and that is why I am very sure of it.  In spite of the fact that an oncoming driver behaves in an unreasonable way the person who overtakes is still guilty. I am wondering if the same type of argument could be applied here, that the person who parks is the guilty person because he created the emergency and any contributory negligence created afterwards would not have arisen were it not for his original fault.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards contributory negligence and the question of the change in road conditions, that might have arisen from the time a car was parked, such as rain, ice or snow, those undoubtedly would be matters that would be taken into consideration by the courts.  As regards contributory negligence, if the vehicle <Col N="1059" /> which was stationary was improperly parked to the degree that a Section 55 prosecution would succeed, the fact that another driver struck the obstruction could not of itself be regarded as creating an offence.  On the other hand, if there was an offence arising out of the behaviour of the driver or out of the ineffectiveness of his brakes, even though the vehicle struck was an obstruction which should not have been there, that does not put the person who struck the obstruction in the clear.  He would get a knock as well. You can only sympathise with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>Before Section 56, but in Part V to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All mechanically propelled vehicles of two tons unladen weight and over, used for the carriage of goods, shall be manned by a crew of not less than two persons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The intention behind the amendment is to compel employers who are engaged in the transport of goods in certain types of vehicles to act in a similar manner to good employers throughout the country in the interests of pedestrians and other road users. That is the first reason the amendment is put forward.  Secondly, it is to ensure that the maximum safety will be secured by the additional manning of certain types of vehicles most likely to be travelling long distances, particularly at night time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By having an additional man engaged on a lorry, there is another pair of eyes at all times available to the driver to detect stationary lorries that may be ahead on either side of the road or any other obstacle.  It also helps in manoeuvring from side roads on to main roads.  The backing out of the heavy lorry often causes sudden danger to other traffic on a main road.  It also obviates the greatest of all dangers, a lorry broken down immediately behind a sharp bend.  With a second man helping the driver it is possible to give warnings <Col N="1060" /> before and behind the lorry of the existing danger due to some mechanical failure which might prevent a heavy lorry being moved off the road out of the way of oncoming traffic from either side.</P>
    <P>There is also the human factor involved. The company of the helper would be welcome to the driver on long journeys.  He would be available to talk to the driver, to keep him from dozing off which it is quite easy to do in a heavy lorry jogging along at a normal speed with a heavy load.  The practice which we are suggesting should be compulsory is carried out by all good employers.  If adopted generally it would tend to greater road safety throughout the country.  One disadvantage which the good employers such as C.I.E. and other such companies must suffer in taking these precautions in order to keep down accidents is that unscrupulous employers will endeavour to man their lorries as cheaply as possible so as to compete at cut rates with the good employers I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without any comment on Deputy Kyne's reasons for proposing this amendment, I would like to say that its introduction would be importing into the road traffic legislation a provision regarding working conditions which is not a necessary part of that legislation at all.  Any aspect of working conditions which are not, in themselves, clearly related to the safety factor from a road safety point of view is not really relevant to this measure.  I do not intend to argue or dispute, to agree or disagree with the Deputy's views in so far as he has spoken.  By a provision such as that proposed, I feel we are embarking on a matter affecting working conditions which is not relevant to the general intention of this Road Traffic Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have misunderstood the Minister.  When framing this amendment I realised the Minister could put forward that type of reply. I confined the advantages of a second man on a lorry to the safety factor rather than to the working conditions. I might very well say that if a driver has no helper on a lorry he has to do excessive labour in loading and discharging that lorry at the terminal <Col N="1061" /> points.  The fact that he has to do that makes him more tired and less cautious.</P>
      <P>I did not dwell on that aspect but purely on the safety factor.  Consider a large lorry, which is the normal type of lorry, travelling the roads for any distance. If it has a mechanical defect then, as happens in Germany the driver may have to place 30 yards ahead of the lorry and 30 yards behind it some kind of signal such as a red flag or disc indicating a breakdown or a puncture. You would need two people there.  I understood that at one period, in the case of a lorry with a trailer, the law required that a separate person be on the trailer to apply the braking system in road traffic.  This is not a means devised by the trade unions to secure additional employment.  I wonder why reputable firms such as C.I.E. consider it necessary to carry out this action if it is not in the interests of the safety of the general public?</P>
      <P>As a motorist, the Minister must have personal experience of the danger of lorries manoeuvring or attempting to manoeuvre on main roads without the aid of a helper.  It is a grave and serious danger where a driver of a large lorry has to take upon himself all the responsibility of seeing the oncoming traffic when backing out or manoeuvring his lorry on to a main road or even deciding to cross a main road into a byroad.  I feel there is a case to be made and that the Minister should have the matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said about the two-ton truck almost equally applies in so far as safety measures are concerned to trucks not two-tons in weight.  There is no reason why it might not be said you should not drive an ordinary car without a helper.  We could get to that situation. It is possible that there is something in the argument that two heads or two pairs of eyes are better than one. On the other hand, I am afraid that that would be going just a little too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy instanced the typical case, and made a very good point, of the difficulties of a single operative reversing on to a road from another road or byway or laneway, and so on. <Col N="1062" /> First, he should not have to back on to a road.  If, through some unusual circumstances, he has got to do so, I do not see why that in itself should be regarded as a sufficient reason to oblige every truck in the country to carry two operatives rather than one, where one suffices.</P>
    <P>Where a second operative or helper on a truck is required in the interests of road safety, we have power in Section 11 so to determine by regulation.  The safety factor is of importance.  Where a second person is required in order that safety be assured then we have power under the regulations in Section 11 so to dictate by regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 74a:</P>
      <P>74a.  Before section 56, but in Part V, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who while driving a mechanically propelled vehicle fails to keep such vehicle as near as practicable to the left hand side of the roadway shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to bring into this Bill an offence which exists at the moment and which is being committed by the thousand, day in and day out, throughout the length and breadth of this country.  Most people ignore the necessity to keep to the left-hand side of the road.  One of the results is that we are wasting literally millions of pounds in this country, year in and year out, building broad highways.  We may as well leave them all with a maximum width of 20 feet so as to allow our motorists, as they do at the moment, to keep to the middle of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seldom drive at more than 30 or, at the most, 35 m.p.h. in Dublin City.  I venture to say I reach my destination sooner than 99 per cent. of the people who move along the same road.  I can say this in the privilege of this House and not be prosecuted for it as might be the case if I were to say so elsewhere. <Col N="1063" /> I do so by moving on the inside lane, by passing the stationary and moving vehicles on the right hand side. It may be said that that is an admission of dangerous driving on my part.  I do not believe it is.  I believe it is a statement of sensible driving.  If there is any element of dangerous driving involved, it is on the part of those who are so far out on the roadway as to permit a motorist to pass them on the left-hand side.  That is possible in this city.  It is possible on the crowded highways of the city because we are not enforcing the law which requires people to keep to the left.  The only time it is invoked is when an accident happens and the question is asked in courts whether the car was keeping to its left-hand side.</P>
    <P>The notion is abroad that so long as you are as much as one inch on your own side of the channel of the road you are driving safely.  You are not doing any such thing.  You are driving without consideration for other road users.  You are driving dangerously to yourself.  You are driving reasonably safe drivers into a dangerous position if they want to move even a slight bit faster than you want to drive yourself.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say the amendment is not necessary.  The same may be said about it as about his provision on dangerous parking.  There is only one way of bringing the importance of left-hand side driving home to all users of the road and that is to put it into an Act of the Oireachtas and not leave it to a regulation which may be almost impossible to locate.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I asked I think the Minister for Justice if any calculations had been made of the cost of traffic delays in Dublin City.  He told me it had not been done.  I was told it was felt that energies would be better directed towards making the traffic move than calculating the cost of the delays.  It is necessary to enlighten public opinion on the necessity for putting an end to the atrocious waste of time in our larger cities and towns because of the fact that people will not use the highways properly.  I believe that the daily cost of traffic delays in Dublin is not less than <Col N="1064" /> £5,000 per day.  That means an annual cost of about £1,500,000 because of stupid, unnecessary traffic delays and hold-ups in Dublin as people will not keep to the left hand side of the road.</P>
    <P>I am regarded abroad as a most severe critic of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.  My criticism of him is not in regard to his labours but his appointment.  I have every sympathy for him.  I believe he is driving himself to an early grave in an effort to keep the people of this country to the left hand side of the road and traffic in traffic lanes.  I do not think it is necessary to go up in a helicopter to discover the waste of road space in Dublin.  On any of our major roads it is possible to carry at least four moving lanes of traffic at one time&mdash;two moving in each direction.  That is quite possible. That is hardly ever done.  The result is delays in regard to people going to and from work and delays by people about their work.  I would say &mdash;and I am putting it at a conservative estimate&mdash;that 40,000 people in Dublin waste at least a quarter of an hour on the roads.  They are delayed so much between going to and from their work and going about their work.  That is a very conservative figure.  I have kept it deliberately conservative.  The daily cost of that in wages alone and in pricing manhours is £2,500.  On top of that, there is the waste in petrol and oil.  There is the wear and tear of vehicles, the capital replacement which is necessitated by that wear and tear and all the inefficiency and over-staffing and over-capitalisation which take place because we are not sensibly using the road space available to us.</P>
    <P>As things stand at present, there is a presumption that you do not have to look to your left-hand side of the road at all to see what is going on or whether or not another car is going to come up.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been advocating that people should travel in traffic lanes.  He is, in fact, advocating under the law as it is at present that people should commit an illegality.  It is an atrocious state of affairs that we have allowed the law to get into such a condition <Col N="1065" /> because we cannot sensibly use the roads upon which we are spending money to make them wider.  There is no use putting down a roadway of 30 to 40 feet unless it will carry two lanes of traffic.  I think it is necessary to write this section into the Bill.  The people need to be taught that they must keep to the left-hand side of the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister on previous occasions mentioned his familiarity with the Belfast road, particularly as it leaves Dublin city and approaches Dublin Airport. Day in, day out, there is atrociously dangerous driving committed by people with pre-war cars of 8 h.p. travelling in the centre of the road.  At the beginning of the four-lane carriageway there is a notice which, were it in Irish, might mean more to many people.  I think the notice is a request that traffic should keep to the vergeside lane.  Most people do not know what the verge is. That is an actual fact but certainly the conduct of people is such as to suggest that they are not aware of their obligation to keep to the left hand side of the road.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to notice that in recent months even the local authority have given up the ghost at this particular point, a most important artery. At one time the four lanes of traffic were clearly marked but the thing has been so ignored that it is no longer so marked.  I think that is an atrocious state of affairs.  It is because of the necessity to bring home the vital importance of making room for others on the road that I think it is necessary to write this section into the Bill.  This section should be enforced not only when accidents happen&mdash;I believe that is the only time it is enforced at the present time&mdash;but whenever cars are so far away from the lefthand side of the road that it is possible for a car to move between them and the kerb.</P>
    <P>Apart from the width of the road, we are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds year after year upon improving the surface of our roads not only the centre but right to the kerb. What is the point of doing that if we are only reserving that for parking and pedal cyclists?  We ought to encourage people to use all sections of the surface <Col N="1066" /> of the road.  Last year, Deputy Sweetman on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, pointed out that it was a waste of money not to use every square inch of the road surface.  If traffic keeps to the centre of the road, there will be extra wear and tear there.  The side of the road is not used at all and consequently it does not suffer the same wear and tear.  The cost of all this is difficult to estimate. I believe that the matter has become so serious already that we must create this offence in the Bill so that people will become aware of their obligations. There are no clear cut statutory obligations.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying that you already have it in regulations or that the Minister or the Commissioner can make the necessary regulations.  Regulations are made to be applied by civil servants. They are not made to be read or understood by the general public because they seldom see them and even more seldom would they take the trouble of buying them.  If the matter is put into this Act, the idea will be enforced and we shall ensure that the confusion and delays we have at the moment will be removed to some extent.  If the rate of increase in motor vehicles continues over the next five or ten years, as it has expanded over the last five or ten years, then we shall leave our houses and get to work at the time when we should be returning home in the evening.  It is necessary from the economic point of view, if for no other reason, to bring about a situation in which everybody uses every available inch of the road space.  That can only be done by creating an awareness of the obligation to keep to the left-hand side of the road.</P>

      <P>I do not see why this item should be singled out for a separate section.  Section 88 gives adequate powers to the Minister in relation to what Deputy Ryan is seeking. We are agreed on all sides, I think, that better use of the road space available is most desirable. The difficulty in Dublin city in particular is that we have a tremendous population of cyclists.  According to present regulations, cyclists must not travel more <Col N="1067" /> than two abreast, but if that were rigidly enforced, many of them would be unable to get home for their midday meal.</P>
      <P>I travel the same route as Deputy Ryan.  At many of the traffic lights and other stopping places, there is room only for a single line of traffic. This is brought about by the parking of vehicles on the main arteries into the city which causes the cyclists to move out on the left-hand side.  I pointed out on an earlier section that deliveries should be made during specified hours.  Similar regulations should be made in the suburbs to prevent cars from parking in such a way as to prevent a double line of traffic from forming.  More is involved than the question of keeping to the left.  It is a question of other regulations arising.  I believe it could be dealt with much better under Section 88, which gives the Minister full power to make regulations in all these matters.</P>
      <P>Because of cyclists and motorists turning left coming out on to a main road, over the years a certain nervousness has been created amongst many drivers.  The result is that when they are approaching any junction or bend, they think it better to keep out in the middle of the road in case someone pops out.  This is a perfectly natural reaction.  Along with regulations, there is also the question of road marking. I understand there is a contribution towards road marking from the Road Fund.  At the City Hall, for instance, the traffic lanes are very clearly marked for those who wish to turn left, go straight or turn right.  Roads should be marked to show a lane for bicycles and two lanes in each direction for other traffic.  If it is possible to have only three lanes, along with a lane for cyclists, a system I have seen used in Belgium and Holland could be applied.  At certain hours, the traffic travelling in a particular direction has the right over traffic going the other way to use the centre lane.  All these things have to be taken into consideration, and, as I say, it would be much better to have them dealt with under Section 88 rather than incorporate this in a separate section.</P>

      <P>It is true this matter can be dealt with under Section 88. It is envisaged that under Section 88 it will be dealt with by general bye-law. The existing bye-laws, as Deputy Ryan mentioned, cover the matter.  In the various <i>Rules of the Road</i> booklets issued over the years, quite explicit instructions were given; but for all the good they have been, they might as well never have been printed.  I agree entirely with Deputy Ryan's condemnation of the present abuse of our road space.  I do not condemn it on the same grounds as the Deputy, mainly, the loss to the national economy and individual road users. What I am concerned about is the frustration caused to following drivers by these people who think there is no one but themselves on the road. Following drivers become so frustrated that they themselves drive dangerously in order to get around the &ldquo;crawler.&rdquo; That is the biggest objection I have, though I do admit the cumulative loss over the years must be of significant proportions.</P>
      <P>Looking at this matter from the point of view of road safety, I am more concerned about the frustration of the following driver, who cannot get by on a road where there is adequate space if only the &ldquo;crawler&rdquo; in front would pull in to the left.  I only wish this situation could be remedied by the writing in of an amendment of the section.  It would be an extremely long and involved section, much longer than the amendment proposed by Deputy Ryan.  I do not think that long section would justify its drafting, even if it were possible to cover every eventuality one can visualise arising.  You just cannot say &ldquo;Keep to the left&rdquo; and leave it at that.  You must legislate for all sorts of contingencies.  You must legislate for turning to the right, or for traffic lanes where they are indicated. That is why I believe it is inadvisable to insert as an amendment a general directive that traffic must keep as near as is practicable to the left-hand side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter cannot be covered by the general regulations, unless there is full co-operation of road users and an absolute insistence on the regulations by the Garda.  Road users must realise <Col N="1069" /> that it is in the interests of the safety of all that these regulations are being laid down.  In regard to those who waver, we must rely on strict supervision by the Garda.  Main roads such as the North Road, the Naas Road and the Navan Road are surely places made for the motor cycle police, of whom, we are told, there will be many more in the future.  I hope there will be many more, that we shall see them operating on these roads and insisting that the bye-laws concerning the utilisation of road space are complied with and that infringements of them will be dealt with by the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think the intention of the amendment would be more adequately covered by regulation rather than writing it into the Bill.  The suggestion made by the Deputy&mdash;that by putting it into the Bill, we give it special significance and will be much more likely to succeed in having it observed&mdash;I am afraid would not in itself justify the difficulty in drafting a section so long and so unwieldy that it would be difficult for the general road-user to understand and, indeed even then, no matter with what care it might have been drafted, there would very likely still remain matters that had been overlooked or had newly-arisen and were not visible when the drafting was being done.  All in all, I feel it would be better taken in under Section 88 by these general bye-laws and, above all, that we should seek from the Garda absolutely scrupulous attention in the carrying-out of the law in this matter.  I have already received such assurances.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1070" /> SECTION 57.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 57 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the section which corresponds to Section 57 of the existing Act.  It is a section which provides that in the case of an uninsured vehicle, a district court may impose a fine on the convicted person and that the fine shall be paid to any person who has suffered injury as a result of the negligent driving of the uninsured driver.  I am not asking the Minister to alter this section in any way, but there are certain aspects of it which I think it might be well to look at again.  Similar provisions to the provisions in this section are contained in the 1933 Act and I should like to hear from the Minister the approximate number of occasions on which use was made of Section 57 of the existing Act by imposing a fine for the benefit of a party injured by careless driving?</P>
      <P>Secondly, I ask the Minister to look again at the question of the payment of a fine in these circumstances being regarded as a good defence.  I read that as meaning an absolute defence to a subsequent civil action for damages.  It occurs to me that you may very easily have a situation where, at the time of the district court prosecution, it appears to the court and to the party who has been injured and who is either present or represented in court, that damages by means of a fine imposed on the defendant would be adequate, but perhaps after the passage of time, there may be a sequel, some consequences which make the amount paid in damages by means of this fine quite inadequate.  Under the section as it stands, such a person, no matter what damages he suffers, is completely precluded from bringing a further action for damages, once the fine is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister would regard it as necessary to examine that section a little further.  I think there are dangers of the sort I am referring to.  I know that the Minister may say there is no obligation at all on the injured party to be represented in court and to consent to his damages being met by a fine of this description.  That <Col N="1071" /> is quite true: the injured party may ignore the district court prosecution and bring his own action for damages; but we are talking of the case of an uninsured driver and it may well be that the penalties laid down in the section will be much more of an inducement to the defendant to pay the fine and avoid the consequences of not paying it.  From that point of view, it may be that the injured party would feel it worthwhile to proceed under this section.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is the case where a person, for one reason or other, has decided to exercise his rights under Section 57, subsection (1) (b), I think, and ultimately finds that the amount of the damages he gets by means of a fine imposed on the defendant comes nowhere near compensating him for the damage he has suffered, possibly because of some injury or its gravity only becoming apparent at a later date.  I feel it is leaving things a little too loose to say that even in those circumstances that person will have no further remedy or right to take an action for damages. I know that the section has been there in effect for a great number of years and possibly it has worked sufficiently well, but I should like the Minister to have another look at it.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has said, the section, which is practically the same as the section in the 1933 Act, has been in operation for a considerable time.  As regards the cases coming under that particular provision, I am afraid I cannot give the number and I am not too sure that I should be able to find out, but what I do understand is that the type of case that is taken, and has been taken, under this section is of a relatively minor nature and more likely to relate to damage to vehicles or property rather than to personal injury which might give rise to complications, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, where the injury sustained was not so obvious at the time as might later emerge and where deterioration of physical condition might arise unexpectedly but directly attributable to <Col N="1072" /> the original injury for which settlement had been made.</P>
      <P>So far as that aspect of the matter is concerned, I shall do as Deputy O'Higgins has asked and have a further look at it in the light of the queries raised and on Report Stage, or earlier, if so required by the Deputy, I can give the results of that examination which may help the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 76:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  An approved guarantee issued by a vehicle insurer shall, for the purposes of sections 25, 26 and 27 of the Insurance Act, 1936, be regarded as if it were a policy issued by the insurer in the course of carrying on mechanically propelled vehicle insurance business within the meaning of section 3 of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These amendments are really to remedy a minor omission in the draft Bill.  The 1933 Act required vehicle insurers, vehicle guarantors and exempted persons to make deposits of £15,000 with the High Court to cover their liability in respect of vehicles owned by them or under policies or guarantees issued by them.  The Act provided for the meeting of claims by injured persons ultimately from these deposits.  The provisions regarding insurers' deposits were subsequently incorporated in the Insurance Act, 1936, and the Bill now deals only with deposits by guarantors and exempted persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1936 Act made insurers' deposits available to meet claims by injured persons but only in respect of policies. <Col N="1073" /> These policies issued by vehicle insurers are covered under the 1936 Act, and approved guarantees issued by vehicle guarantors and certificates of exemption issued by exempted persons and the guarantors are covered by the Bill but no provision was made for guarantees or certificates of exemption issued by insurers.  Amendment No. 76 rectifies this omission in so far as guarantees are concerned by providing, in effect, that deposits under the 1936 Act would be available to meet claims in respect of guarantees issued by insurers.  Amendment No. 77 deals with issues by insurers.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 53, before paragraph (c) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  where varying rates of premiums are charged by insurers according to the classification of the use of vehicles, the statement mentioned in <i>paragraph</i> (b)  of this subsection shall contain the total amount of claims paid by the insurer in respect of each specific class of motor vehicle insurance and such further information as the Minister may require.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am agreeable to the three amendments in my name being taken together as they are all aimed at achieving the same end which I think can also be achieved by the amendment in Deputy Ryan's name.  Under present circumstances there is for insurance companies what could be described as an escape clause.  I referred to this on the Second Stage in a different way to that which I am now going to refer to it, but I think I shall be able to illustrate the point a little better.  I shall take the example of a textile mill with which I am familiar in which they have a designer employed.  This mill is situated near Dublin or alternatively the designer lives in Dublin and has occasion to travel back and forward from time to time.  The commercial representative of this company may be informed by a friend of his, say in Cork, that a certain buyer in Dublin is interested in a certain product of the mill which he represents and he telephones to try and make sure that the business is secured for the mill he represents.  The managing director comes to the designer and says: &ldquo;Jack, you are going to town.  Take a sample and call in and see so-and-so.&rdquo; The designer would normally be insured under Class I but because of the fact that he took the sample into his <Col N="1075" /> car for the purpose of soliciting business for the mill by which he is employed he will then be required to get a special insurance under Class III for that journey.</P>
    <P>Likewise a similar situation arises for the agent, who, let us say for the sake of argument, has an office in Wicklow Street.  If he goes into his office in the morning in an empty car, collects his samples and does his commercial travelling on foot and then deposits his samples in his office before he drives his car home, he can insure under Class I.  If, however, for any reason he is detained and carries those samples home with him and back into town in the morning the insurance company will insist that he is not insured unless he pays the 50 per cent levy for that journey.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter on Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce and I have also inquired from the Fair Trade Commission. They informed me that they were set up to deal with the supply and distribution of goods and I asked them how can there be any supply or distribution of goods if somebody does not sell them in the first instance.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken the line that this is a matter for the internal workings of an insurance company. When pressed further by way of Parliamentary Question regarding an inquiry that was held some years ago, he pointed out that anything said to him in regard to this matter was merely by way of formal comment and that the Prices Advisory Body at that time had not got as one of their terms of reference the question of dealing with this type of problem.  We have here, four amendments which ask the Minister for Local Government to put the onus on the insurance company of, first of all, justifying that this 50 per cent. levy is warranted.  Secondly, they are aimed at ensuring that people who take out insurance will not find themselves caught out through these different classifications of insurance.</P>
    <P>For my part, working for myself, I insure under Class II.  On occasion, I go down the country to seek business. <Col N="1076" /> I ring the insurance company and say I want my insurance extended to Class III for one week.  For the few trips I make, it is cheaper to do it that way. If, for any reason, I have left some samples in my car, if I forget to take them out before driving into the office on the Monday morning following a week's commercial travelling, and if I have an accident, the insurance company can contend that those samples are evidence that I was, in fact, a commercial traveller at the time.</P>
    <P>Around Easter the Irish Commercial Travellers' Association, representing all the various commercial travellers' associations, sent a memorandum to Deputies.  As some time has elapsed since that circular was sent out, there are some facts which could perhaps bear repetition.  When this 50 per cent. levy was imposed some 30 years ago or so, it was done in a very haphazard manner.  As this circular pointed out, it applied to commercial travellers, actors, actresses and Jews.  Probably it was felt at the time that these people travel a greater mileage than others.</P>
    <P>At that time, cars were certainly not as mechanically perfect as they are now.  They were not fitted with hydraulic breaking systems and so forth, nor were the roads surfaced with tarmacadam.  I am sure many front bench members of the House remember travelling to meetings over bumpy roads 30 or 40 years ago.  Since then, for some reason, actors, actresses and Jews have been found not to be liable for this excess tariff.  I contend that if a person had a bad driving record, and if he is continuously making claims, the insurance companies would be perfectly justified in putting an extra levy on him, rather than spreading the levy over all insured persons.</P>
    <P>What we are asking is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be left in a position to judge for himself whether or not an unfair and unconstitutional advantage is being taken of one section of the people.  One body of commercial travellers compiled statistics covering a period of five years. The net result showed that a group of 671 members paid £83,875 in premiums, and the insurance companies <Col N="1077" /> paid £13,268 in claims, showing a profit of £70,000 odd for the insurance companies.  That is the only official survey which has been carried out by any group of Irish commercial travellers. If another organisation representing the commercial travellers were to do the same, I am quite convinced they would get similar results.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that from time to time one sees that so-and-so, &ldquo;a commercial traveller,&rdquo; is involved in an accident.  I think that 90 out of 100 times that happens at a weekend and not while he is engaged in his job as a commercial traveller.  A commercial traveller must have a car, and he must make sure it is in good mechanical condition to get him from place to place.  He knows quite well that if, through no fault of his own, he meets with an accident that puts his car out of commission, he will lose much of his earnings and commission because he will be unable to do his week's work without a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  A commercial traveller travels over roads with which he is extremely familiar and he knows all the dangerous points.  Many Deputies travel a greater mileage than the majority of commercial travellers, on their way up and down to attend to their duties in Dublin, and there is no special levy imposed on, shall we say, far distant Deputies.</P>
    <P>I take it we are discussing the four amendments together.  They are all aimed at achieving the one end, which is that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce asks for returns from the insurance companies, he should get the returns of the premiums paid, and the claims paid, under each of the separate classes.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to define exactly a &ldquo;commercial traveller.&rdquo;  What function does a man perform to be a &ldquo;commercial traveller&rdquo;?  The insurance companies have decided that if he uses a mechanically-propelled vehicle to carry samples for the purpose of soliciting business, he is a commercial traveller.  I do not know whether this levy applies also to what are known as van salesmen.  I know there is a distinction.  In the case of Dublin <Col N="1078" /> Corporation, a van salesman is a member of the working classes and a commercial traveller is not.</P>
    <P>All these problems arise, in spite of the fact that attached to the associations are some 4,000 commercial travellers.  We are quite satisfied that the total number of commercial travellers is 6,000.  If a group of 6,000 people who help to keep our hotels open during the winter months and contribute to the national economy in one way or another are being penalised by insurance premiums they must pay as a result of an Act of the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas should protect their interests and ensure that they get a square deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to support Deputy Lemass's view on this matter, with particular reference to amendment No. 78a, in the name of Deputy Ryan.  I recommend to the Minister that that amendment should be accepted.  It proposes in Section 74 to add the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>(c)  A company or syndicate shall not charge persons engaged in particular occupations a premium in excess of the basic premium rate charged by them unless it be proven to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that persons engaged in such occupations have a claims rate in excess of the average claims rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lemass has pointed out, this whole problem is particularly concerned with the treatment of commercial travellers by insurance companies, and the splitting up of insurance cover into various categories.  The figures which Deputy Lemass has given&mdash;I have not got the memorandum with me unfortunately, but I remember I was impressed by it when I read it&mdash;show that on a survey made by one of the bodies representing commercial travellers, there seemed to be no justification whatever for any excess premium rate in the case of that particular group.  It is right, I think, that the Minister should have an opportunity, as he would if the amendment in the name <Col N="1079" /> of Deputy Lemass and also that in the name of Deputy Ryan were accepted, of having certain information which would enable him to decide whether or not these groups were being properly treated in the matter of insurance.</P>
    <P>We should remember that to a great extent insurance companies play a very big part where motorists are concerned because, if they refuse insurance and insurance is compulsory, as we shall make it compulsory under this Bill and as it has been compulsory under the 1933 Act, the motorist cannot drive.  If cover is refused by the insurance company the motorist is off the road.  That may not be of vital importance to people who do not require their cars to earn a livelihood, but it is of vital importance to certain sections, notably commercial travellers, who depend largely for their livelihood on the use of cars. If they can be priced out of insurance because of the high rates demanded, without adequate justification, then a problem exists and it is one into which the Minister should examine.  So long as insurance is compulsory the companies control the situation to a great extent where motorists are concerned.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it might not be worth the Minister's while in relation to the sections dealing with insurance to consider having some kind of official arbitrator appointed under this Bill empowered to adjudicate in cases where motorists have not been able to obtain cover except at what they regard as a prohibitive rate of premium. If there were some official attached to the Minister's Department, or to the Department of Industry and Commerce, before whom cases could be made, that might improve the position.  It would, too, allow the respective Minister to have some kind of check on insurance companies.</P>
    <P>We are giving insurance companies very definite authority where motoring is concerned when we make insurance compulsory for the motorist before he can bring a car on to a public place or drive a car in a public place.  So long as insurance companies are put in a special and peculiar position by the <Col N="1080" /> Legislature, I think Deputy Lemass is right in his argument for a certain degree of control, at least to the extent of getting the type of information he wants through his amendment brought before the Minister, and there is a foundation for the obtaining of that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I might agree with a number of the observations made by both speakers because of my own personal experience, at the same time this is not a matter which comes within the province of the Minister for Local Government.  I do not think it should be brought within his province since the relationship is one really between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the insurance companies.  I believe that position should continue in the future rather than that we should introduce any ties as between the Department of Local Government and insurance companies.</P>
      <P>Commercial travellers, in particular, seem to think they are being salted as against other sections.  If it is true that some 4,000 paid insurance to the tune of over £80,000 last year and claims amounted to only £13,000, surely as a group it ought to be possible for them to organise and create their own fund, carrying their own insurance instead of going through the recognised tariff companies.  It may be that, knowing each other so well, there are reasons why they would not like to take that on.  If the overall profit is anything in the region of the sum outlined by Deputy Lemass here it would appear to me to be a very good business proposition. Within the 4,000 members I am sure there are many astute businessmen. I am surprised that some kind of scheme has not emanated from them, a scheme designed to reduce their tariff very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter.  It is an aspect which, in fairness, one must take into consideration. It is one which may well justify the additional burden.  Commercial travellers because of the nature of their calling would, if related to road mileage, show probably one of the highest average road mileage rates per driver per year as compared with <Col N="1081" /> any other group of road users.  On that basis alone it might be argued that a certain justification may exist for the premium imposed.  I am not aware of the basis on which insurance companies arrive at the various tariffs.  If all the things asked for in these amendments were conceded, then it is the Minister for Local Government who would be running the insurance business, striking the rates, prescribing the conditions, and one would not really need the insurance companies at all.  Their business would be done for them.</P>
    <P>I think it would be wrong to put the Minister for Local Government <i>vis-a-vis</i> insurance companies in the position in which it is sought to put him in these amendments.  Those who tabled the amendments probably are convinced that there is a good deal of merit in them.  It is the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has the association with these companies and knowledge of the insurance structure as a whole.  Irrespective of how I may feel, that is the only answer I can give. It is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce and it should not be made any part of the functions of the Department of Local Government. It would be both undesirable and impossible to have that Department associated in any way with the insurance companies.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, as in every other profession, many commercial travellers are not in any association. In fact, the association to which I referred, which has 671 members, is the largest.  I belong to an association that is set up entirely as a benevolent association.  I have not come here looking for benevolence.  It is prescribed in the Bill, page 53, lines 11 and 12, that the returns to the insurance companies &ldquo;shall be in such form as shall from time to time be directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&rdquo;. I agree entirely with what the Minister for Local Government says, that this is primarily a function for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I understand that the combined Irish commercial travellers' associations are hoping to have a deputation to see him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The difficulty is this: the Minister will have the power to seek these returns in whatever form he sees fit. The purpose of the amendment was to draw that up a little bit tighter.  It may be possible that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will agree with the arguments that have been put forward in this House but in the meantime, perhaps, the best way to deal with this situation would be if the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce would agree to set up a special committee to go into the entire facts of this case and then the Bill as it stands would be quite satisfactory and we could withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to tell us something about this Motor Insurers' Bureau mentioned in Section 78.  I understand that membership of that Bureau carries with it certain obligations, the chief of which is that if a dispute arises between an insured person and the particular company that is a member of that Bureau the other companies will not on any account intervene.  In other words, if a motorist has an accident or for some reason or other finds himself in difficulties, such as having his licence suspended, he must deal with his own insurance company and it is not open to him to get coverage from any other company because of the obligation imposed by the Bureau on its members not to interfere with the business of other companies.

This Motor Insurers' Bureau is there, not to control or to lay down conditions for insurance companies who must be members, or any such thing.  All the insurance tariff companies or the motor insurance people form this Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.  It is there as a safeguard where there arises a personal injury claim for which no cover is available and nobody is there to meet the compensation.  They are there merely as an extraordinary insurance for the unique case of personal injury where no insurance exists and where the person who is to blame for the personal injury is not of substance &mdash;a man of straw&mdash;and where some compensation may be got for the injured party out of this Bureau.  The Deputy has something else in mind, which is not this particular body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the superannuation provisions <Col N="1086" /> which apply to members of the judiciary and to certain court officers so that, in return for a reduction in the amount of pension, a death gratuity after five years' service or a lump sum on retirement will be payable.  The new arrangements will apply to persons appointed after the enactment of this Bill, and persons at present serving will, subject to certain conditions have the option of accepting the new arrangements or retaining their present superannuation rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision which will enable both serving officeholders and future appointees to surrender at the time of retirement subject to certain conditions, portion of the pension payable in order to secure a pension for a wife or for one nominated dependant.</P>
    <P>The present proposals have been formulated in response to representations from the persons concerned that some financial provision should be made for the dependants of a person who dies in office and also for a dependant of a person who dies while on pension.  In the formulation of the proposals an essential consideration, so far as the Government was concerned, was that they should not actuarially increase the burden on the Exchequer. The arrangements contained in the Bill fulfil that requirement and are the most favourable to the persons concerned which can be put forward on that basis.  In brief, the Bill reduces maximum pension by one-fourth, that is, from two-thirds of salary to one-half of salary, and in return for that reduction provides for the payment of a death gratuity of one year's salary after five years' service or a lump sum on retirement equivalent to one and a half times the reduced annual pension.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill relating to the allocation of part of pension on retirement provide that the pension payable to a wife or a dependant will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of his own pension which an office-holder surrenders.  Accordingly this feature of the Bill does not involve any additional charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>What I have said is, I think, sufficient to explain the general principles <Col N="1087" /> of the Bill so far as the present Stage is concerned.  Any further explanation that may be needed in relation to the contents of the various sections of the Bill can be left over for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In recent years the provision of financial assistance to cover cases of premature death has tended to become a feature of superannuation schemes, and it is a source of gratification to me to be in a position to propose the provision of these arrangements for members of the judiciary, the Master of the High Court, Taxing Masters and County Registrars, without increasing the burden which the provision of pensions and other superannuation benefits imposes on State funds.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for acceptance by this House, and would ask that the various Stages be taken as soon as convenient, so that the benefits contained in the measure may be made available at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is bringing the provisions for superannuation for the judiciary into line with the more modern provisions relative to the civil service and similar avocations.  As the Minister has stated, the Bill does not increase in any way the actual amount that would be required from the taxpayers. It also, at the same time, recognises the sanctity of contracts that have already been made.  Anyone who is already there under contract can hold on to his original contract if he prefers or, if he wishes to come in under the new scheme, he has the option of so doing.  If he does, as I understand the provisions of the Bill, his actual pension which was payable under the 1924 Act will be reduced by one-fourth to enable him to get the additional benefits provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The provision in relation to judges being able, if they so desire, to allocate half of their pensions to their wives&mdash; widows in the event of the wives surviving&mdash;is of course merely an extension to the judiciary of the provisions I was able to introduce in this House for civil servants as a whole. The principle was laid down there and it is right and proper that the Minister should extend it in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I should like the Minister to answer one question.  I do not know whether he would be able to answer it to-day but, if not, I shall be quite happy with an answer on the Committee Stage.  The Bill provides that in the case of the death of a person who has held office the personal representative is paid a gratuity of an amount equal to the amount of yearly salary at the date of death.  I should like some clarification as to whether that gratuity is, first of all, liable to rank as an asset for estate duty purposes and, secondly, if it is not, whether it is liable for income tax in the hands of the recipient in the year in which it is received.  It has always been known as a gratuity but the fact that it is known by that name would not necessarily mean that it would be outside either estate duty or income tax law.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the age provisions for retirement of the members of the judiciary and having regard to the fact that they are appointed so much later in life than the ordinary person going into the Civil Service or some analogous occuption, I wonder if the Minister has given any consideration to the necessity to provide some type of appeal from the opinion of the one doctor? There is here a rather different case from that of the ordinary civil servant who goes in at 19 or 20 or some such age.  Here, older people are involved. As I understand the Bill, the Minister is the sole person to decide whether a person is of sound health in accordance with the regulations that are to be made.  Because of the special age considerations in relation to the judiciary, I think perhaps there would be a case to provide here, as there might not be in other instances, that there would be some type of medical appeal.</P>
    <P>The difficulty medically that would arise in these cases, having regard to age, is very real.  The opinion, perhaps, of one doctor might be radically different from that of another.  I think there might perhaps, in this case, be an argument to be adduced that there should be some type of appeal to a medical board as apart from the individual opinion of the Minister&mdash;an opinion, I presume, which will be given on the basis of one doctor alone.  Whether it <Col N="1089" /> will be the doctor for the Civil Service, I do not know.  However, I do think that, in view of the age position, there is a case to be considered in that respect.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned in general, we accept it on this side of the House as bringing the judiciary into line with the more modern provisions in relation to superannuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Sweetman in welcoming the Bill.  I think it was in 1959 that a Bill was introduced in this House increasing the salaries of judges.  If I recollect correctly, Deputy McGilligan, speaking on the Second Reading, advocated a scheme for our judges such as the present Bill introduces.  It is a pity the Minister did not see fit at that time to include it in the Bill then before the House; it would have saved this additional legislation.  As Deputy Sweetman has pointed out, we are merely bringing the judges into line with civil servants and the servants of local authorities in this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it comes within the ambit of the Bill but I want to speak on the retirement of district justices.  Judges who are in good health continue to act until 70 years of age.  After reaching 65 years of age, a district justice must produce to the Minister each year a medical certificate of what, for want of a better word, I shall describe as fitness.  It is rather a humiliating position for a district justice that he must go to a medical practitioner in this connection. The only medical practitioner who will know of his condition is the man in the district in which he resides. The district justice must go to him and seek a certificate as to his fitness and he must continue to do that for a period of five years from the time he reaches 65.  The Minister should now take steps either compulsorily to retire district justices at 65 or, alternatively, to give them the same terms of appointment as circuit court judges and high court judges and appoint them until 70 and do away with the humiliating position to which I have referred.  Deputy Sweetman has raised a number of points with which no doubt the Minister will deal later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate that the judiciary is a very important section of the community and that, in view of their position in life, they should be dealt with in a very liberal manner.  I think everyone here will agree that the rates of remuneration and the conditions of employment of this section of the community are well up to standard so far as the general income of our people is concerned.</P>
      <P>This Bill, according to the Minister, will not impose any additional burdens on the Exchequer.  It seeks mainly to pass along portion of a pension that would be payable to a member of the judiciary to some dependants.  We have a definition of &ldquo;dependants.&rdquo;  Subsection (1) (a) provides:</P>
      <P>In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;dependant&rdquo; means, in relation to a person, a member of the family of such person, who, at the time when such person notifies the Minister of his wish to make a surrender under this section, is wholly or in part dependent on the earnings of such person;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;member of the family&rdquo; means father, mother, step-father, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, grand-daughter, step-son, step-daughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, son-in-law or daughter-in-law.</P>
      <P>That is a very wide subsection.</P>
      <P>If we wish to give the right to this section of the community to designate from that wide group which I have read out a person who is dependent on them for the purpose of passing along some bounty from the State, I think we are establishing a bad precedent.  I doubt if we in this country are in a position to give to a judge the right of giving to his step-daughter, aunt, son-in-law or daughter-in-law a gratuity or pension until they attain a particular age.  I doubt if that is a good precedent. If that section of the community is entitled under an Act of Parliament to do so it may be only natural for other sections to seek similar rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with the pensions and gratuities payable to this section of our <Col N="1091" /> community who, as I have said, are paid at a very high standard, we have other sections who cannot qualify for any pension and who are contributing as much in their own way to the welfare of this State as the section in question in this Bill.  If you are a member of an influential group, as all these people are, and as are several more outside the particular body with which we are dealing now, and if you can exert pressure on the right people at the right time you will get away with anything.  I know very well that all these measures are brought in as a result of pressure exerted on influential members of the Government and influential Party supporters.  It is difficult for the main Opposition Party, Fine Gael, to oppose this measure.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to be told that this Bill imposes no additional burden on the taxpayer.  I am very doubtful about that statement.  If we pass along the State's bounty to grand-daughters and grandsons I think it is a bad precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>So they do.  The Minister must bear in mind that we have a big body of people in this State: self-employed persons, whether farmers, shopkeepers or any other section of self-employed people.  These people have difficulty in getting a pension for themselves.  There is no possibility of getting it for the grand-daughter-in-law or the grandson-in-law.  They must conform to certain tests of a rigid nature. If such a person's income is deemed to be more than £2 Os. 6d. weekly, he will not qualify for any pension at all.  Before we provide pension schemes which can be passed along to the grand-daughter-in-law or the grandson-in-law of judges, we should address ourselves to the position of the people I have mentioned, the people who have to work hard every day for small rates of pay in comparison with the section of the community with whom we are dealing now.  If they have more than £2 a week, the State can provide nothing for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not as well organised as the section we are dealing with now. <Col N="1092" /> They are not able to bring pressure to bear on the Minister or other members of the Government to establish in this Parliament preferential treatment for them.  I appreciate the high position judges hold.  They are entitled to the respect of all but I think they are treated well enough at the present time. Passing to a wide variety of people portions of their pensions is not a good type of legislation to implement.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which, I think, could be mentioned on this measure, having regard to the fact that it deals with judges and their conditions of employment.  We have coming to the courts judges, officers attached to the court and counsels wearing wigs and gowns.  I referred to this matter already.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Revenue Commissioners, the position is that there will be some payments under Section 2, subsections (3) and (4) and Section 4, subsections (3) and (4) which will be regarded as assets of the deceased and will be chargeable with duty as such.  When a pensioner surrenders a part of his pension to <Col N="1094" /> provide a pension in favour of his widow or dependant, the pension of the latter will be dutiable.</P>
      <P>The medical examination will not be carried out by a Civil Service doctor. The doctor will be a doctor nominated by the Minister for Finance, who is the Minister mentioned in the Bill.  In the event of a judge being found not to be up to the medical standard required, if, for instance, his health at the moment was bad, provision will be made for a re-examination so that if he were found at a particular precise moment not up to the standard the doctor looked for and the doctor is satisfied that it is a temporary illness, he will be entitled to defer a decision to a later date.  In actual fact, there is a safeguard in that particular regard.</P>

      <P>No.  I would say that the Minister will appoint a doctor as in the Civil Service Bill.  They are not initially Civil Service doctors.  They will be general practitioners outside.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised raised the question of retiring ages.  That has nothing to do with this Bill at all&mdash;the matter does not arise.  The Bill has been brought in at the request of the judiciary.  They are satisfied that the scheme in this Bill, by which they will pay out of their own earnings, will meet their requirements.  They are satisfied that in the circumstances it is the best the State can do at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to impress on Deputies that the judge has the right to opt.  He does not have to accept this scheme at all.  He is already entitled to a State pension.  If he is satisfied he can provide out of that pension for his widow, he need not in any circumstances opt for this scheme.  Deputy Murphy referred to the dependants the judge could name.  The Deputy will have to realise that the judge can name only one of those persons.  He can opt to put in his wife, his mother, his father, his sister, his brother or anyone else, but he can put in only one.  Whichever person he puts in, that is the person who will be allotted the pension in the event of his death.  It does not <Col N="1095" /> mean any more than that.  What I want to impress on Deputy Murphy, and any other Deputy who may have been misled by what Deputy Murphy said, is that this is something for which the judges themselves are paying.  If they wish to do so, they have a right to allot whatever portion of their pension they wish to any dependant they name.  It does not mean any more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last week I was about to refer to the lack of physical training in the schools.  In July, 1929, Mr. Farrell, Chairman of the National Coaching Society, gave as his opinion that this country was greatly lacking in physical training, especially physical <Col N="1097" /> training for schoolchildren.  He expressed the view that, looking at people going along the street, it was quite obvious that their lack of proper poise and balance was due to their not having received physical training in their youth.  I noticed an advertisement in Saturday's <i>Irish Press</i> which stated: &ldquo;A physical training course for men teachers in national schools will be held at St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, Dublin, from July 17th to 28th.  Application forms, available from the Department of Education, must be returned by June 30th.&rdquo;  I do not know whether this is an innovation or not.  So far, no policy statement has been made by the Minister that physical training is to be part of the curriculum for schoolchildren.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any sum in the Estimate for any specialised training or for the engaging of any specialists for this purpose.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us about this training course?  Is it for the benefit of the teachers or is it intended that the knowledge gained will be applied to the children by the teachers?  Assuming that it is an innovation and that the Minister is thinking of physical training in the schools, I should like him to know that, apart from any physical training teachers may receive, there is need for expert and specialised advice. Physical training can be compared with training on the barrack square.  We know that N.C.O.s are quite efficient but they know nothing of the art of war.  They speak their training parrot-like. When it comes down to the art of the thing, they know little or nothing. Likewise, a physical training instructor may be able to tell a group of boys to put their arms forward and to put them down to their sides again, but there is a lot more to it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all children had to undergo an examination by an expert, one out of every ten would be considered a physical defective.  You cannot put a physical defective through the training applicable to a normally healthy youth. A physically defective child must receive specialised treatment.  An ordinary trainer could not apply such knowledge because he has not got it. Knowledge of this sort cannot be <Col N="1098" /> learned on a short course.  A movement of the body affects certain muscles, as I know from a study of anatomy, and another movement of the body has a contrary effect.  If you use the right side of your body, it may cultivate certain muscles on that side, but it will also cultivate muscles on the other side. Therefore, this study of the effects of each physical act requires specialised knowledge.  A trainer who has done a short course will not be qualified to give instruction and, in fact, his instruction could be dangerous.</P>
    <P>For instance, if a child had a slight curvature, what would the ordinary physical trainer know about treating that?  He could cause paralysis.  Supposing a child were developed on one side and not on the other, what would the instructor know about that?  A man in ordinary industrial employment in many cases uses only his right arm and naturally it becomes highly developed, while the left is not similarly developed.  That is why boxers in training often have their right hands tied to their sides and are made to punch a bag with their left hands so that they will be equally developed on both sides.</P>
    <P>It is said that no chain is stronger than its weakest link and therefore a man is only as strong as his muscles. When you use a muscle, it brings into play other muscles which may be weak and you can only do as much as the weak muscle will stand.  The point I am making is that there are children who are physically defective and it is necessary that all children, before being subjected to physical training, should get a check-over by an expert and that those found to be defective should be put into a special class to get special advice.  It is not enough to have some physical trainer who has done a short course of instruction.  The Minister should have a specialist attached to the Department to advise him at all times.</P>
    <P>I know what I am talking about.  I studied anatomy and muscles and I happen to have made many visits to homes for crippled children.  I had reason to visit such institutions because I was partly crippled myself at one time.  I hope that what I read in the newspapers on Saturday means a new <Col N="1099" /> departure but I would ask the Minister to go a little further.  One of the evening newspapers quoted a coach at Santry who said this was only a beginning. That is all it is.  The Minister should have a specialist available to give advice to these instructors and in regard to the need for special classes in the case of children with physical defects.</P>
    <P>Something should be done, apart from physical training, about swimming. It is terrible that children should fall into ponds and such places and be drowned while adults can do nothing about it.  I read in an English newspaper yesterday of two brothers who fell into a quarry; two adults who came to the scene could not help because they could not swim.  They feared they would be drowned.  That is a pitiful state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Malley who mentioned that we could house visitors in some schools in summer.  We have swimming pools which are not much used in winter, and similarly, they would provide an opportunity for holding classes for children in winter if the water were heated.  With local authorities, the emphasis is on building swimming pools and this should be developed.  Children should be taught to swim and should get physical training and those with physical defects should get special training.</P>
    <P>Schools should be encouraged to compete in sports and games.  The average child does not know his own potentialities; only when he wins a race does he know that he is good. Only in competitions can children learn their own capabilities and other people discover their talents.  Spotters will go around and encourage the more successful children to enter various athletic teams; that will advance the whole athletic programme and perhaps give us a better chance in the Olympic Games.  We had very little success this year even though we were only a very small country against the world.  The representatives of this country were the product of a few, a handful, of voluntary clubs and associations but, if our school children got a chance of training and an outlet, <Col N="1100" /> our representatives in future would be the product of many organisations.</P>
    <P>This has another importance.  As we know, people often fail in something because they are not &ldquo;in form&rdquo;. That applies to a child also.  If a child is not &ldquo;in form&rdquo; in school he will not come out on top in his school subjects because he will be unable to concentrate.  It is a well-known fact that the reason for the failure of some famous men in history is that they suffered from ill-health at some stage of their career.  Napoleon lost the battle of Leipzig and, incidentally, his future career, as a result of illness. These considerations apply even to school children.  They may suffer through poor breathing which makes them unable to concentrate.  Their bodies must be in good condition and nothing is as good as exercise.  Many people suffer from stomach trouble which exercise could cure.  If children are in good physical shape they will do better at their lessons.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said about the need for expert advice.  Physical training can harm certain children while it can do no harm to normal children.  It is notable that children with physical defects become worse as they grow older just like an old, falling house.  The incline continues in the one direction.  I would go so far as to say that half the cripples in this country are cripples because of some physical defect that was not corrected in their youth.  An ordinary trainer cannot help these children.  It needs a good surgeon to sum up such a case and know the right answer.</P>
    <P>About a year ago I asked the Minister how many schools did not supply school meals and the answer I got was about seven.  I understand it depends on the school manager whether or not meals are supplied.  If the manager applies, the local authority will supply the meals and, if he does not, there will be no school meals.  This should not rest with the school manager.  Some managers are a bit snobbish and do not like it to be said that the children need school meals.  Some of the children may not but some may.  It should be mandatory on the manager to apply for the meals if there is a demand and <Col N="1101" /> it should be left to the children to say whether they want them.  Those who apply for them should get them.  I object to this idea of any individual deciding whether meals will or will not be provided.  On one occasion when a manager was questioned he said: &ldquo;I do not want the job of cleaning up the school.&rdquo;  That is no excuse.  Whatever mess bread or cakes might make there is nothing messy about a bottle of milk. I would ask the Minister to consider the question of managers having the sole right of deciding whether children should receive bottles of milk.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to raise is that I think the Minister should consider the question of raising the school leaving age.  It is a question which is often discussed.  I know that the difficulty is that there is not sufficient accommodation but it is a fact that children are leaving school at 14 and they are not sufficiently educated. While there is a considerable outlet in employment for girls, there is practically no outlet that I know of for boys. If the Minister considers this matter, I would suggest that the age could be raised gradually, that is, that he could raise the age for the boys first.  It would give them a chance in life so that they would have a fair knowledge of Irish and English.  The question of raising the school leaving age for boys to 15 should be considered.</P>

In óráid an Aire&mdash;leathanach 6&mdash;deineann sé tagairt don rud seo nuair deireann sé: &ldquo;... tá socair agam athrú do dhéanamh ins na rialacha a bhaineann le cáilíochta Gaeilge le haghaidh múinteoirí náisiúnta,&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Tá ar intinn go mbeadh caighdeán an-ard sa triail sin, caighdeán nach sroisfí, de ghnáth, ach ag an gcainteoir ó dhúchas nó ag an té go raibh tréimhsí caite sa Ghaeltacht aige.&rdquo;  B'fhéidir ga ndéanfaidh an Aire tagairt don rud seo agus é ag freagairt.  Agus an n-innseódh sé dúinn an bhfuil rud cosúil leis ar intinn aige do mheán-scoileanna ós rud é go bhfuil béal-thriall ann anois don i gcóir na mac-léinn?</P>
    <P>In this debate each year at about this time we get a rash of criticism in regard to the educational system.  The educational system is concerned with the four sections, if you like, which go to make up those engaged in education, whether on the receiving end, the administrative end or those who are giving instruction&mdash;the children, the teachers, the administrative staff, the programmes laid down and school buildings and equipment.  Equally we have the four stages, primary, secondary, vocational and university. The figures which the Minister has produced in his statement show that the number of children in all sections have increased.  That is a healthy sign. It is a healthy sign when we find that in the primary schools at the moment there are over 500,000 children and that the ratio of teachers to pupils has been reduced somewhat although it has not been reduced sufficiently, as the Minister admits in his statement. We hope that that ratio can be reduced further to the benefit of the children receiving instruction.</P>
    <P>There is no comment from anybody in regard to the administrative side because the administration of education has its own peculiar form and it is outside the scope of any debate. With regard to the building programme, I notice in the Minister's statement the large number of children <Col N="1103" /> catered for.  I hope he will not overlook the fact that the number of schools is important.  A single large school may cater for 1,000 pupils but what is needed is a programme which has been laid down of 100 schools a year.  The small two-teacher school is very important so far as primary education is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister has been able to deal with this question of maintenance.  It is not generally appreciated with regard to the maintenance of primary schools that the local manager is in the position of holding this baby.  It is regarded as being his job to provide for the maintenance of the school.  I am glad, therefore, that the Minister has come to his assistance because I am afraid that the manager had nothing but what he got from the local community by way of voluntary contribution.  It is very praiseworthy that school buildings should be maintained in a sound condition.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate in his reply how often the allowances he referred to will be given.  Will they be by way of annual grant and will they be applicable to certain stated purposes?</P>
    <P>The four stages of education should sustain one another.  Naturally, we would all hope that education would be a continuing progress and that, from the primary stage, the pupils would move to the secondary or vocational, and later to the university stage.  That, of course, is not feasible for all because of lack of opportunity by reason of financial considerations or the areas in which the children live.  A further hindrance to this lack of continuity is that there is not a sufficient link between the teaching services available. When the teaching staffs at the various stages of education can compare unfavourably their conditions, remuneration and otherwise, it is not very healthy and does not lead to harmony between them.  Very often, it is a hindrance to obtaining the best results. Therefore, I think it is advisable, when considering these matters, that nothing should be done that would in any way unnecessarily disparage any section of the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> Sometimes people attempt to measure educational progress, or the amount of work done educationally, on a financial basis.  There is no method which can measure the influence of teachers on those who come into contact with them.  It is essentially a relationship of the mind and consequently there is no measure in the ordinary way that can be applied to it.  Indeed, there can be no reward in the ordinary way in monetary terms.  Incalculable harm can be done, if those imparting education feel dissatisfied with their conditions, or become unmindful of their vocation to teach.</P>
    <P>Teaching is not a job, as it has been referred to at times; it is a vocation.  We can be justifiably proud that that vocation has never been looked on from the mere money point of view. The teaching profession has given something to the country which cannot in any sense be measured in terms of material benefit conferred.  Reference has been made to that fact already and tributes have been paid to the teachers. In this country where we profess to be Christian, a Christian education requires a dedicated teacher.  Anyone who knows the type of work which has to be done in all the stages of education will appreciate how much tact and patience are absolutely necessary on the part of those engaged in teaching to get from the material at their disposal the type of result they set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>There is need also for something in the nature of guidance for children.  In some primary schools, because of the size of the classes and because some teachers have two, three or four classes to deal with, they have not the opportunity to give that guidance.  Indeed, some teachers might not have the up-to-date information which would be of benefit to the adolescents in their charge.  There is a necessity for such guidance at all levels, from primary to university.  Even at university level, students have difficulty in deciding what type of career to pursue.  In secondary schools, even at the end of their last term, students often cannot make up their minds as to what walk of life they wish to follow.  While education can fit people generally for a career in life, we should give more <Col N="1105" /> specialised advice on what bent a child should follow which seems to suit him.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that there should be a link between the secondary and vocational schools.  When a child finishes in the primary school, he goes to the vocational school, if one is available, or to a secondary school. We never hear of a child going from a secondary school to a vocational school.  I believe in the age in which we live, and the age which is opening up before us, there is a necessity for secondary school students to proceed to a technical education.  By so doing, they will equip themselves with a sound educational basis and become first-class technicians.  We would not find ourselves depending so often on foreign instruction for our technicians, if people, on finishing their secondary education, availed of the technical educational facilities available.</P>
    <P>It is not so long since the E.S.B. advertised for a couple of trainee surveyors. Leaving Certificate standard was specified in the advertisement. From inquiries I made, I believe the Board had something like roughly 600 applications for the two posts.  A selection had to be made from many students who had secured numerous Honours in the Leaving Certificate examination and who were seeking employment with the Board.  We are living in an industrial and technical age, with the advent of the Common Market and so on, and we could, with advantage, siphon off quite a number of Leaving Certificate holders to the highest training in our technical schools.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I made mention previously of technological colleges. We might with advantage do something about technological training. That type of education is available in Dublin but it is not available in the country generally.  Its availability would help a great deal in the industrial progress we hope to make in the future.  Technical instruction is not readily available to all.  At the moment pupils have to travel seven, eight or ten miles to vocational schools. I know it is not feasible to provide such schools in any and every centre but the building programme could be <Col N="1106" /> accelerated.  Where the committee have considered the matter and decided to build a school, the programme should be speeded up.  If we are to take our place in the sun, we cannot afford to wait too long.  If we allow the opportunity to pass, those willing to establish industries may decide against doing so because of a dearth of trained personnel and in the long run, it will be the economy of the country which will lose.</P>
    <P>Secondary education is not available to all who should benefit from it.  In some constituencies, lay people are providing secondary schools, thereby giving children the opportunity of this type of education.  Children from these schools are able to obtain good posts in the Civil Service and elsewhere.  The important point is that they have not been compelled to emigrate.  I believe that the people who found these schools should be given some assistance in respect of building by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay referred to languages.  Now that we are on the threshold of the Common Market, more and more continental languages will need to be studied, particularly those which are regarded as commercial languages.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Malley's suggestion as to the use of schools as an adjunct to the activities of Bord Fáilte.  We have one example of that in Kylemore.  The only difficulty is that most schools use the holiday period for carrying out renovation, etc. but if the suggestion does not interfere, I think it is worthy of support.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned last year that he intended to increase the number of scholarships available for post-primary education.  He also said he intended to increase the number of university scholarships.  Now that education is becoming more appreciated, it is important that these scholarships should be increased in number.</P>
    <P>With regard to music, the position is at the moment that, if a scholarship is obtained in Galway through the medium of Irish, then the scholarship must be taken at Galway University. <Col N="1107" /> Galway University has no music faculty and therefore it is not possible for a student to avail of such a scholarship.  I think such students should be permitted to take out a degree in music in Cork University. It does seem unfair that a brilliant student who wishes to take a degree in music should be prohibited from doing so.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy O'Malley in relation to the claims of Limerick for a university.  However, this is something Limerick will place before the Commission when the time comes. Deputy O'Malley referred to the Faculty of Agriculture and said we were starved for graduates.  As a result of inquiries, I have discovered that of 80 graduates last year in Agricultural Science, only 35 found employment at home.  The remainder were exported.</P>
    <P>There are 500,000 children in our primary schools.  That fact speaks for itself.  The Minister gave a figure of some 26,000-odd receiving technical education.  The universities run somewhere in the region of 20,000.  The majority of our people receive a primary education and they should be ensured of the best.  There are, of course, many factors involved.  There is the question of healthy children, proper surroundings adequate equipment, trained staff.  Anybody who has anything to do with schools knows that not every child is a normal child and a good deal of leeway needs to be made up in providing education for mentally and physically handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The schools which are being provided are conducive to the type of work which should be done in them. There may be minor faults but we shall have an opportunity of discussing these on the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  With regard to equipment, in the girls' schools and in the infant schools, the staff are still expected to provide the necessary materials and equipment.  I appeal to the Minister to take some steps to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done something in regard to the sizes of classes.  I hope <Col N="1108" /> he will continue his efforts to reduce the ratio between teacher and pupils. I welcome the improvements made in that regard.</P>
    <P>The school staffs have been referred to.  I do not wish to dwell on it but there is no doubt that at the present time the primary schools staffs are not satisfied.  They are very far from it. They are a very dissatisfied staff at the present time.  Having said that&mdash;I am sure the Minister appreciates the reason for it&mdash;I do not wish to dwell further on it at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister's figures in this statement are hopeful.  The real question in Irish education is the environment in which we seek to progress.  If the environment is what it should be, then everything else will be all right.  The progress towards that ideal environment for all grades of education is not as satisfactory as everybody would wish it to be.  The Minister infers that in his opening statement when he says that more money is needed to provide a satisfactory type of education.</P>
    <P>Cooperation is needed in education more than anywhere else.  Cooperation is necessary between the various people engaged in education, between the various systems of education, be tween the parents, the teachers and the pupils.  It was refreshing to hear the point of view expressed by Deputy Lindsay, one which normally, I am sure any teacher would not attempt to put forward for the simple reason that it might be inferred that he was saying it just to suit his own line.  It has to be realised that modern conditions affect both the work and the discipline of schools.</P>
    <P>Criticism of education is all right if that criticism is helpful, fair and realistic, but it is not always so. There are sometimes those who belittle the type of education available in this country.  There are sometimes those who criticise for the sake of criticism and actually prostitute the cause they profess to serve, the interests of education as a whole and of the child in particular.  There is not much use in criticising in general when one ought to be specific.  There is nobody who will deny that there may be occasions when criticism is <Col N="1109" /> necessary but to generalise and to attempt to give the impression that all is not well and that the type of education available here is of a lower order than elsewhere is something which needs serious reconsideration by those who make such allegations.</P>
    <P>There are people who say quite frequently and blatantly that children in this country are illiterate, that they cannot compete with their counterparts across the water or anywhere else.  As one who has had some experience of children from across the water, both from visiting their country and having some of them here during the war years, I can say quite freely that the Irish child at any stage is as well equipped educationally as any child who ever came from across the water.  Irish boys and girls who have gone to other countries have been well able to hold their own.</P>
    <P>People speak sometimes of the beauty of a building being enhanced by each storey which is built. Primarily, its lasting beauty must depend on the foundation.  So, too, in education.  The worth and beauty of education depend upon the foundation the children get.  The type of foundation our children have got, are continuing to get and will get, in the primary schools is sound, good, beautiful and spiritual.  The little school, the school at the back of the hill, to which the tiny tots go and where some of our boys and girls finish their education is providing the same type of foundation as it ever provided, which proved in the past to be a sound type of education, the foundation on which the youth of the country have succeeded in going on to secondary, technical and university education, and as a result of which they have been, when they have gone abroad, a credit to themselves, to the educational system which produced them and to the parents who gave them their opportunity in life.  The teachers in all grades recognise that they are privileged in that matter, that they are privileged to take part in that education of youth.  It is their vocation.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has read Padraig Pearse's <i>The Murder Machine</i> and <Col N="1110" /> knows the type of castigation which he used against the outside influence on education, the control which was foreign to us at that time, the materialistic treatment and conception, could not but be struck at present by the changes that have been wrought now that we have the direction of affairs in our own hands.  The Minister today is in the position, as Ministers have been since the foundation of the State, of trying to gather up the various ends of education so as to bring them together to give us a system which will avoid the ills of the past and will keep us from the pitfalls in the future.  That is the role of the Minister for Education.  He must create a proper type of environment in which the various facets of education can be set.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like again to refer as I did previously, to the treasures which we have in our National Gallery and National Museum, to which reference is made in the Reports of the Public Accounts Committee from time to time.  We ought to do something about providing more room so that these treasures may be properly housed and located and more readily seen by the people. There is no reason in the world why the young people living in remote places should not have the opportunity of seeing these treasures which speak the past to the present.  I made an appeal on a former occasion that some of these collections might be taken about and exhibited in various places where there are civic museums.  It would do much to help our people to realise the rich heritage we have in the National Museum and the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>I hope that before the Minister concludes the debate he will give us his estimate of how Irish education stands at present.  There are a great many people giving estimates of education. There are a great many people who pass condemnation on Irish education at present.  It would be refreshing if the Minister, with the facilities he has at his disposal, being able to draw on the information available in his Department concerning all spheres of education, told the Irish people from this House how Irish education <Col N="1111" /> stands.  Is it really as bad as some people would have us believe or is Irish education really progressing, as I believe it is, perhaps not making enormous strides, but soundly based, soundly proceeding, not perhaps fulfilling all the dreams of everybody for every child of the nation but providing for all at least that amount which we ought at all times to be ready to give to a rising generation on which the future of any country always depends?</P>

      <P>It is the custom, certainly in the city, if there is a change of route, for example, if a roadway is closed, to give public notice of a change.  If there is a change <Col N="1112" /> in the bus routes or stopping points, they normally do give notice and possibly under the C.I.E. Acts, it is obligatory on them to do so.  I would like the Minister to ensure that where the public are affected by any change in a bus route or stopping place, due notice will be given of the change.  It may very well be that that is already covered under the C.I.E. Acts.  If it is not, I should like the Minister to ensure under this Bill that such notice will be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure is that the operators of the service are notified by the Commissioner as to the removal of a stopping place, the placing of a stop or a suggestion in regard to it.  They, in turn, inform the public, their customers, as to where the stops will be, and that is the way it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that that is the way it is done; in fact, due publicity always is given. However, I would like to see a legal onus on either the Commissioner or the operating concern to give that notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one little difficulty about that, regardless of whether the notices should be given by the Commissioner or the bus company. Changes of stopping places could be an emergency measure.  Some emergency may occur in which it is necessary to re-route buses and steps may have to be taken immediately.  To outline and specify that adequate and suitable notice shall be given in a particular <Col N="1113" /> way could raise complications. In normal circumstances, bus operators, in the interests of serving their customers, inform them of changes.  If the customers do not know the route the bus is taking or where it is going to stop, it could not be said they were fufilling the purpose of giving a service to the public at all.  Commonsense dictates that they will take every possible step to inform the public of the changes required by the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to direct the Minister's attention to subsection (5) of Section 86 which reads:</P>
      <P>Where a person uses a mechanically propelled vehicle other than an omnibus in contravention of a bye-law under this section, he and, if he is not the registered owner of the vehicle, such owner shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>It is imposing too much of a liability to make the registered owner of the vehicle guilty of an offence of which he may be entirely innocent and of which he may have no knowledge whatever.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at subsection (5).  I suggest he should delete the words referring to the registered owner and leave the position that the only person who would be guilty of an offence is the person who used the vehicle in contravention of a bye-law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of contravention that comes to mind immediately in this matter and with which we wish to deal specifically is the parking or leaving of a vehicle in a particular place.  The difficulty encountered up to the present and over the years has been to nail who used the vehicle last, who put it there, who left it there. That has been a weakness which, in <Col N="1114" /> other respects, we are trying to remedy in Section 90 by bringing in the registered owner as liable for the offence whether or not he was the person who actually used the vehicle and had control of the vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence.  I suggest we might possibly discuss that item on Section 90, if the House so wishes, or together with that section.</P>

      <P>I should like to stress this point a little more.  I feel that from <Col N="1115" /> the prosecution point of view it is obviously nicer to be able to name somebody for an offence that has been committed.  It is fundamentally unjust that a person who cannot be held liable in equity will be held liable in law.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with the police in trying to make quite sure that an offence is punished but I cannot get any satisfaction out of knowing that somebody is being wrongly punished with our full knowledge and consent; that is what is comes to.  It is far better that the offence should go unpunished rather than that the wrong person should get a punishment he did not deserve.</P>

      <P>I think that what Deputy Booth said is quite right. As often as not, you will have the case where the registered owner of the car is an entirely innocent party.  If I give the Minister a loan of my car when he asks me for it, because he is stuck or something like that, and he then parks dangerously, or does something like that with my car, it would be grossly unjust that I should be guilty of an offence which is committed by the Minister and which was not committed by me.  The only offence I could be said to have committed is possibly an error of judgment in being too kindhearted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is fair to deal with car owners in that way.  I agree fully with Deputy Booth that it is better on <Col N="1116" /> occasion that the guilty person should get away with it scot free rather than that we should punish innocent people merely for the sake of punishing somebody.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is aware that our parking laws are completely and absolutely unenforceable as the law now stands.  As Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has said, if, for some reason or another, I seek and get his car and park it dangerously or wrongly, it certainly would be a gross error of judgment on his part if I turned out to be the type of person who would let him take the rap when I was responsible for using his car which he gave me to help me in my difficulty.</P>

      <P>The only defence the Minister is allowing to the hire purchase company in the case mentioned by Deputy Russell is to show that the use of the car was unauthorised. Clearly, the use of the car will not be unauthorised, if a person goes into a hire-purchase or self-drive company to get a car for a day, a week, a month or whatever the period may be.  Quite clearly, the use of the car will be authorised but the misuse of the car will not be authorised.  The expression here is to show that the use was unauthorised.  I think it is putting the self-drive companies in an impossible position.  They will be amenable for any offence committed under this section by the driver of the car.  It will be a great hardship on ordinary individuals, quite apart from hire-purchase companies, if they are caught in this way when they themselves are quite innocent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is arguing is clearly bad in principle.  It is the duty of owners of cars&mdash;I am dealing with the question of self-drive companies, companies that deal in self-drive cars&mdash;to make the cars available to the client or customer who comes looking for these vehicles.  That is their business.  It is their means of livelihood to make the cars available.  It seems to me to be bad in principle that the Legislature here should adopt the position of saying: &ldquo;Very well; we are going to legislate in such a way that if there is any parking offence committed by any of your cars, you will be responsible for it.&rdquo;  Is that not tantamount to saying that they have to go out of business, unless they are prepared to accept responsibility for every offence with one of their cars, whether they know anything about it or not?</P>
      <P>That is definitely a very bad principle to establish.  I do not think it is just or fair.  What the Minister is seeking to achieve is that the users of cars will obey the road traffic code and will park their cars&mdash;he has used the example of parking&mdash;properly.  That is what he is seeking to achieve.  In fact, he is to some extent giving them an indemnity because he is saying to them, through this Bill: &ldquo;Quite apart from what you do or do not do in the parking of the cars, an innocent person, an owner of a car, will be guilty before the courts because of this legislation.&rdquo;</P>

We should not go through this complicated process of getting at the matter by prosecuting somebody.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon made one suggestion which was an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that certain results of that might be that people in the self-drive business were liable to be put out of business.  Deputy Sheldon suggests that if this liability is to be left at the door of the self-driver operators or owners, it will mean they will have to charge a higher rate to the drivers and that the innocent driver will suffer with the guilty.  If we want to enforce our parking laws, we want to enforce them for the common good.  If there is a way whereby the driver of a hired car or the owner can indemnify himself and, at the same time, enable us by law to get rid of unauthorised and dangerous parking, it would be much preferable to show it to us rather than to say that the charges to hirers of cars will go up or that somebody will go out of business.  That will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to be the height of folly to legislate here for parking offences and make the law such that the driver of a hired car was, in fact, excluded from it, which is the reverse of what I am trying to do.  If I were to drop this provision in regard to these self-drive cars, then we would be giving these people who have no sense of responsibility in the sense that they do not own the car a licence to park <Col N="1120" /> as and when they liked.  I do not think anybody intends that should be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, but Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Sheldon have, by their own statements, indicated that the drive-hire car owner would have to take certain action.  Apparently, there is action open to them to take which will safeguard this situation but if we leave it out, there will be no action which we can take.  I should be glad if somebody could suggest a solution to the problem.  It is a serious problem, if this loophole is to be left in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving out the question of cost, is there not a question of justice involved?  What the Minister is saying is that if he cannot prosecute the guilty party, he will prosecute somebody else, who in this case happens to be the owner who is completely innocent of the offence.  I do not think it is a defence for the Minister to say: &ldquo;If you do not like it that way, why do you not think out something else?&rdquo; In those circumstances, I should prefer to see it struck out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to do that and that is why I am asking the House to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not debar me getting up and saying it is an unjust section.  I think the Minister recognises that fact.  One of his defences is that you have got to prosecute somebody and there is an onus on the people who hire out cars to be responsible.  But even allowing for that suggestion, I do not think it is going to get over the fundamental issue which is that this subsection, as it stands, constitutes a grave injustice.  It is up to the Minister to find some way of circumventing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Russell, but I think this is equally important, on the question of principle and justice, for the ordinary private car owner as it is from the point of view of the operators of a <Col N="1121" /> self-drive company.  The principle is wrong and bad.  The Minister's reply to Deputy Sheldon and myself was that he could do nothing about it&mdash; that the authorities can do nothing about stopping bad or dangerous parking&mdash;but that the self-drive companies can do something about it. What could they do about it?  What they could do, according to the Minister, following the suggestions made, was either close down and not operate services or else increase their charges to their customers.</P>
      <P>If they increase their charges to their customers, the people who are going to suffer as the result of this legislation are not merely the reckless fly-by-nights who come over, get a car for a night or a couple of days, go away and are not amenable to the jurisdiction of our courts, but every person from now onwards who gets a car on a self-drive contract.  The Minister seems to think that is an improvement of the law and that that is doing something worthwhile towards enforcing the parking regulations.  I disagree with him entirely.  What he is doing, if he follows that line, is that he is, to some extent at any rate, indemnifying the reckless driver who parks his car badly or dangerously.</P>
      <P>If this legislation goes through in its present form quite clearly&mdash;and no one is going to blame him for it&mdash;a Garda will not be interested in finding out who parked the car badly.  He does not need to find that out.  Under this legislation all he has to do is to go to the motor registration office and find out who is the registered owner. Then he has his defendant, and that defendant must be convicted.  The only defence open to him is that the use of the car was unauthorised, and in 99 out of 100 cases of the kind I have in mind&mdash;and I think the Minister has in mind also&mdash;the use of the car is not going to be unauthorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would be doing simple justice if he agreed that if the registered owner were not in a position to show that the misuse of the car, in the case of dangerous or bad parking or other offence, was without the consent or knowledge of the registered owner, <Col N="1122" /> then the registered owner should not be guilty of an offence.  That would be a different situation.  While it might not help the Minister in enforcing parking regulations, it would be simple justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, in effect, &ldquo;This is the best suggestion I can make.&rdquo;  He says that if any Deputy can make any better suggestion he is prepared to consider it and, possibly, to adopt it. Deputy Sheldon has suggested that it would be an improvement&mdash;I do not think he claimed it would be perfect&mdash; if instead of having this liability attached willy-nilly to the registered owner, the Minister were to attach it to the person who drove the car away after it was parked, and if the Minister had it deemed that the person who took the car away was the person who had parked it.  That might be an improvement.  I do not think by any means it would be perfect.</P>
    <P>The real answer is this.  The Minister has no responsibility for the Garda and it is the job of the Garda to carry out the regulations or the law regarding parking as laid down.  I do not think the Minister should interfere with that.  I do not think it is his concern to make their job any harder, but equally I do not think he should cause injustice merely for the sake of making their job easier.  It is their job to detect the parking offence, ascertain the offender and bring him to justice. The Minister is now relieving them of that duty and it is a duty anyone who joins the Garda should be prepared to undertake.  Instead of allowing the Garda to do that job and encouraging them to get on with it, the Minister is saying to them: &ldquo;You need not bother who committed the offence.  Once the offence is committed, go for the registered owner, prosecute him and you are all right under this section.&rdquo;  I think that is bad law, unjust and wrong in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express agreement with Deputy O'Higgins as far as this section goes. This section deals only with the offence committed when somebody parks at a bus stop.  Whatever may arise when we discuss Section 90 and the general <Col N="1123" /> question of parking, surely here it ought to be reasonably easy for the Garda in a good number of cases to spot who parked the car at a bus stop? It is not like finding a car parked at some unauthorised place.  It should not be very difficult for the Garda to detect that and get the proper person. Parking at a bus stop is not like parking at some unauthorised place and being found there later.  The minute you stop at a bus stop, you have committed the offence.  There is no question of the length of time.  It is purely a question of stopping at a place reserved for another purpose.  This is not a question of coming along and finding a car parked at an unauthorised place, having to wait for someone to turn up, and not being able to prove that the one who turned up was the one who parked.  If this section were amended by deleting &ldquo;registered owner,&rdquo; the Garda, in Dublin at any rate, could very quickly prosecute sufficient people who stopped their cars at bus stops to put an end to that kind of thing and clear that part of the road without bringing in the registered owners at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go further than that.  I feel there is a chance here of really helping the Minister to some extent.  If the use of the car is unauthorised by the owner, obviously the owner knows who is the authorised user of it.  If the Garda are unable to find out who actually parked the car, the registered owner could well be put under the obligation to disclose to the Garda who the user was at a specific time.  I do not think that should cause any undue difficulty.  If the owner of a car authorises somebody to drive it away, he usually has a pretty fair idea of what time he had it and what time he got the car back.  We might be able to help the Minister to that extent by suggesting to him that if the registered owner were obliged to give full information to the Garda as to who was authorised to use the car between certain hours, that should give them all the information they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be a certain danger of the baby being passed from hand to hand and everybody saying: &ldquo;It was <Col N="1124" /> not I who parked it there; I left it to someone else,&rdquo; and the registered owner would get out in view of the fact that the driver at that stage was altogether unauthorised.  I do not know if there is any statutory obligation on the owner at the moment to disclose to the Garda who was using a car on a certain date if the driver himself or herself was not driving it.  I think the problem might be met, as I have suggested, and that, certainly, would be as far as I would be prepared to go. Any other way of implicating the registered owner who is not the driver and is not even in the car at the time would be grossly unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This latest suggestion by Deputy Booth is one that might give us some elbow-room to meet the varying points of view.  It would be too much to think that we could get entirely out of this dilemma that apparently has now arisen or that anybody should be able to say that such-and-such a formula or amended formula would be the answer.  Deputy Booth's suggestion, certainly on the surface, gives some hope of doing a little both ways.  In so far as owners of vehicles are concerned, they can also be considered and, since Deputies have such strong views about the matter, I should be glad of their assistance and their further consideration of the matter and I should like them to convey to me the result of that further consideration between now and the next Stage of the Bill with a view to having it thoroughly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that we should not appear to be making the job of the Garda easy, that we should not go out of our way to do so and at the same time create injustice.  The advice tendered to my Department by the Garda, who have been and are responsible for the operation of the parking laws, is that under the present law we might as well have none. Anyone who looks around the city or elsewhere realises that is only too true: it like a jungle as regards parking. It is not a question of going out of our way to make the job of the Garda easy but of trying to find a solution to the present situation.  If we leave the law as it is and has been up <Col N="1125" /> to the present, it will mean that there will not be any parking laws as such. This is not an attempt to help the Garda to convict more people or make their job easier but an attempt to solve a difficulty without causing injustice to anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with those sentiments but I suggest that by giving the person who is not the owner of the car virtually <i>carte blanche</i> to park wherever he likes you are practically absolving him from all responsibility. The first person you want to get is the person who has parked a car at a bus stop.  I think that is the primary desire, to get the offender first, and failing that, to get some means by which he will be tracked down if he has left the car there and gone away.</P>

      <P>This section also deals generally with bye-laws which the Commissioner may make including bye-laws to regulate and control the leading of animals.  Does the Minister feel it necessary to be more specific regarding that?  Most of us have had experience of animals being allowed more or less without control on the roads and causing <Col N="1127" /> damage.  I am not at all clear as to the position regarding the legal liability for damage caused by animals allowed to stray or wander on the roads.  I should like to feel that under this section there is some way of bringing home the responsibility to the person responsible for allowing the animals on the road without proper care or control if the animals cause damage to person or property.</P>

      <P>I think this has been mentioned before.  The question of animals on the roadway and the damage they may cause is a matter for civil action.  If I am not mistaken, there is a committee dealing with this matter of civil liability at the moment and possibly this will be dealt with there in a broader sense.  To attempt to bring it in here would have far reaching effects, effects which we would not be capable of dealing with adequately in a measure which is mainly directed towards road traffic law.  For that reason, I would say to the House that it is a matter to be dealt with more appropriately by the committee, and probably better so, if the changes are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put to me that there is something rather unjustifiable about giving power to charge a parking fee on a public road.  It is obviously justifiable to have a parking fee payable where a public car park is provided off the public road, but for the motorist who is already paying heavily for his share of the road through his road tax, it does seem less than fair that he should be charged extra for stopping.  I hope therefore that the Minister will divest himself of the power to charge a fee for parking on the public road and restrict himself to the right to make a charge where public car parks are provided off the public road.</P>
      <P>Another matter arises in reference to subsection (9) where we have again the same trouble in regard to the registered owner being liable.  I presume the Minister will reconsider that matter also, as in the previous case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) says that the Commissioner may, by bye-laws under subsection (1), specify the fees to be charged by licensed parking attendants in respect of attended parking places.  Would it also be desirable to specify the actual fees chargeable on a sign or notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I may say, is a power which is carried on from the Act of 1933.  So far as an indication of what the fees might be, as laid down by the Commissioner, there is no reason why those may not be published and displayed in such a way that the public will be aware of them. So far as Deputy Booth's comment is concerned, regarding the charge for parking on a public roadway, that again is a power which, in principle, has been in existence since 1933.  The power now sought has particular relation to possible experiments in the use of parking meters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the point may be made that if a car going along the road is not charged a specific fee, it should not be charged a specific fee if it stops on a particular part of that road, I do not think it is a very useful argument in this case, because we have had the power in the past to charge and to allow charges to be made and we are <Col N="1130" /> not imposing some new charge on the motoring public to which they were not liable in the past.  Therefore, we could not be said to be worsening their position.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if parking meters are to contribute towards ease of parking and possibly in some cases the relief of congestion by properly controlled parking, surely then the benefits in both of those directions will be to the motorist because to a very large degree it is the motorists who suffer to a great extent if there is indiscriminate parking for unduly lengthy periods. If it works, all this will be of greater assistance to the motorist than to any other member of the community. Therefore, even if you can make the argument: why charge a motorist when his car is stationary on a particular street, if you do not charge him as he goes along a whole stretch of roadway, I feel that while it is a nice argument, the other one is better, that we are doing it by way of experimenting to help the motorist to park more readily and under some control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the Minister's argument, I understand that anyone's right to use a road is to use it as a thoroughfare, not to sit down or remain in one place.  The ordinary common law right is to use it as a thoroughfare and charging people for that right does not seem to be quite in accord with that principle.</P>
      <P>I hope I am not the only one who does not understand the reference in subsection (4) to &lsquo;disc&rsquo;.  Does the Minister visualise flying saucers or who would want to park discs anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the point about what licensed parking attendants may charge.  I should like the Minister to consider including in subsection (c) a provision whereby the Commissioner may require these charges to be displayed. The Minister has said there is nothing to stop them being displayed, but if we had adopted that attitude with regard to the other provisions of the <Col N="1131" /> Bill, we would have been at sixes and sevens long before now.  Would the Minister consider putting in such a provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That power would lie under Section 94.  I think the Deputy would like an undertaking that that power will be used to ensure the display of these charges if they are authorised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would prefer that they should know them rather than be done in the eye without having that knowledge.  If the charges are to be made and authorised, I am inclined to think a notice to that effect should be displayed.  I think what the Deputy has in mind is to stem the manner in which charges which are not really authorised seem to be the order of the day in parking places in the city of Dublin at the moment.  As I said, my sympathy is with the Deputy, that we should, if possible, have these charges displayed.  The power to do that is in Section 95. While I would not say offhand that these signs and charges will be displayed, I am certainly thinking in that direction and my sympathies lie in that direction.</P>

I want to mention the fact that car parking attendants in the city at the moment are very alarmed that some attempt might be made to take away their livelihood.  I hope that in <Col N="1132" /> licensing car parking attendants, the Minister will see that those who have been on the job, and have done a good job, will not be interfered with, and will be given priority when it comes to the issue of licences.  Attempts may be made by certain groups to collar these jobs.  It would be most unfair if the present attendants who have done a good job could not continue in that capacity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I like the Minister's amendment. It raises a question similar to one we were discussing earlier.  Subsection (10) of Section 95 provides:</P>
      <P>A person other than a road authority shall not provide a traffic sign visible from a public road without the consent of the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Subsection (11) provides:</P>
      <P>The occupier or (in the case of unoccupied land) the owner of land on which a traffic sign is provided in contravention of subsection (10) of this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>That is a blunt statement that the occupier, or the owner if the land is unoccupied, shall be guilty of an offence if a sign appears without the consent of the Commissioner.  There is no provision to meet the case where, without the authority of the occupier or owner, some other person erects a sign in contravention of subsection (10).  According to subsection (11), the owner or occupier will be guilty.  The Minister in his amendment carries that a step further.  He says:</P>
      <P>In subsection (11), to add at the end of the subsection &ldquo;and in any prosecution for an offence under this section and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the traffic sign shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, to have been provided by a person other than a road authority without the consent of the Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the defendant's point of view, it will be presumed that the sign is <Col N="1136" /> erected without the consent of the Commissioner.  The prosecution will not even be required to prove that and we are not leaving it open to the defendant to provide as a defence that the sign was erected without his knowledge or consent.</P>

      <P>The argument is very hypothetical.  While, hypothetically, the points may be good, I do not see any real sense in them.  We have to presume, first of all, that somebody for some reason or another&mdash;for the first time, or as a habit&mdash;is moving around the country, erecting signs on other people's lands at some cost and trouble and before the owner becomes aware of the position, the Garda are hot on his heels, and so lacking in commonsense that they immediately take a prosecution.  In the unlikely sequence of events adumbrated by the Deputy, the owner would find himself in court without a defence.  I do not believe that the sequence could possibly continue and that the district justice would give him the hammer regardless. We have to have a most extraordinary sequence of extraordinary events to bring about this extraordinary situation.  Candidly, I do not believe in this extraordinary trend of events.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister need feel they are so extraordinary at all.  We are dealing with the Minister's amendment. Later in this section, the same provision is made in relation to signs other than road signs.  If there is erected on a person's land a sign which makes a road sign less visible or which may cause confusion to a motorist or other user of the road, the same provision is made.  If it is erected on a person's land, the owner or the occupier of the land is guilty of an offence, whether he did it or not, and we are declaring by law that he is guilty of an offence, even though he might be entirely innocent.</P>
      <P>I do not think it will cause any breach in the Minister's Bill if, at the end of his amendment No. 88 and if again in subsection (15), he adds the words: &ldquo;unless such owner or occupier shows that the sign was erected without his consent or authority.&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to consider adding those words or words to that effect, both in his amendment and in subsection (15).</P>

      <P>Deputy Russell is right in so far as &ldquo;traffic sign&rdquo; as defined in this section can include the type of sign he has described.  Is that not correct? Therefore, it follows that any sign which indicates a filling station 400 yards ahead or that such and such a hotel is a half a mile away may be erected only with the permission of the Garda Commissioner and of the local authority, and that sort of thing.</P>

He says he would advise any person who contemplates erecting such a sign to consult the local Garda.  That is a most peculiar statement by the Minister.  It is for the Minister to make quite clear in this House, when the question has been posed, whether or not these signs advertising hotels or filling stations, so many hundred yards away, are prohibited under the section.  We should have the Minister's viewpoint on it.</P>

      <P>My only complaint so far as the regulation of signs under this section is concerned is that I should like to see the Minister going a little further in subsection (14).  The Minister provides in subsection (14):</P>
      <P>A person shall not provide any such sign, device, notice or light as is not a traffic sign if, on provision thereof, it is visible from a public road and&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> (a)  it is capable of being confused with a traffic sign,</P>
    <P>I agree with that.</P>
    <P>(b) it makes a traffic sign provided in accordance with this section less visible to road users,</P>
    <P>I agree with that.</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(c) it obstructs the view of public road users so as to render the road dangerous to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  I should like to see the Minister putting in a subclause (d) to govern the kind of eye-catching signs one frequently sees and which are a source of distraction to drivers. Certainly, I would have no complaint at all if the Minister also took power in subsection (14) to prevent the erection of signs such as are likely, or reasonably likely, to distract the attention of the driver from his driving while on the road.  My only concern, and the Minister has met me on it, is to ensure that innocent people will not find themselves caught, through our inadvertence in the legislature, when it is not intended that they should be caught and I am quite satisfied with the assurance the Minister has given on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I point out one matter?  I am surprised that Deputy O'Higgins has not already mentioned it because it would be a matter for a practising lawyer.  In this amendment of the Minister's, again, I presume from the point of view of efficiency and tidiness, the accused is presumed guilty until he can prove himself innocent, which is a principle I always greatly resent.  That will go into subsection (11) but then, if we go on to subsection (18), we find the complete reverse is the case.  If you are prosecuted for failing to comply with a traffic sign, the traffic sign is presumed to have been authorised and it is up to you to prove that it was not. That is very much a case of &ldquo;Heads, I win; tails, you lose&rdquo;.  It means that if you are prosecuted for having a sign erected, you are guilty until you <Col N="1142" /> can prove the contrary, whereas if you are prosecuted for failure to comply with a notice, the presumption is that the notice was legal.</P>
      <P>That does not seem to be a consistent way of legislating. I can see much more reason in supporting subsection (18) than that clause in subsection (11). I do not believe it is ever justifiable to say a defendant shall be deemed to be guilty unless he proves the contrary.</P>

      <P>The appointment of traffic wardens is a function of the local authority.  If we go back to Section 90 we find that the Commissioner is fully responsible for the appointment of car park attendants who also have certain functions with regard to traffic. Why has the local authority the function in one case and the Commissioner in the other?

      <P>In regard to traffic wardens, it was the local authorities and other public committees or local committees that first sought to have these wardens appointed and given some sort of status.  In addition to that, it is my belief that local authorities have contributed towards the cost of equipping these people; certainly some cost fell upon them.  With regard to the other people with whom we dealt earlier on, the parking attendants, it would appear that these people will not be a charge on the local authority; neither will they have been sponsored or requested by the local authorities.  There is that distinction in the origin or the possible origin of the two categories, traffic warden and parking attendant. They originated in a different way.

      <P>This is the section which deals with the removal of a car which is abandoned or left badly parked, and so on.  Subsection (2) provides:</P>
      <P>Where a vehicle is removed pursuant to this section, such charge in respect of the removal as may be specified by the Minister for Justice by regulations shall be paid to the Commissioner by the owner of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Again, in subsection (3) we read:</P>
      <P>Where a vehicle is stored pursuant to this section, such charge in respect of the storage as may be appropriate in accordance with a scale specified by the Minister for Justice by regulations shall be paid to the Commissioner by the owner of the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider in both of these subsections providing that the charge will be a charge to cover expenses reasonably incurred and that there should be some words of limitation to prevent the charge being imposed as a penalty.

It was that thought which prompted this section in the manner in which it appears now.  Nevertheless, if it is felt that it is too weak in that respect I shall give it further consideration and, if need be, amendment.  This section was introduced lest there might be the inclination to impose, possibly without much thought about the matter, a fixed charge which would be a penalty plus cost.</P>

      <P>The question arises of liability for any damage that might occur to the vehicle in the course of removal or any damage which might take place during the period of storage. I take it there will be some indemnification whereby the Commissioner of the Garda will not be liable for any alleged damage during that operation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be desirable to provide that there would be no liability for such damage.  It is possible that the vehicle might have to be removed and stored in the local pound, yard or garage as the case may be.  It might be there for several weeks. In the course of storage, damage may be caused.  It may deteriorate very considerably. Would there be any question that the owner could have an action against the Commissioner of the Garda for any such damage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at it from the other side of the picture, the absence of any indemnity clause in this regard is in itself an insurance to the owner of the car that it is likely to be carefully handled by those removing it lest <Col N="1148" /> any damage might occur for which he would claim damages thereafter or for which he could not, if there was an indemnity clause.  I can have a look at that also.  There are two sides; this is another aspect of the matter.  The absence of an indemnity clause may effectively be somewhat of an insurance that the car will be treated with proper respect and due attention during its removal and period of storage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 91:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) A person shall not do any act (whether of commission or omission) which causes or is likely to cause traffic through any public place to be obstructed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 92 reads as follows:</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a person is charged with an offence under this section, it shall be a good defence to the charge for him to show that there was lawful authority for the act complained of or that it was due to unavoidable accident.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two are interrelated and can be taken together.  These two amendments are designed to improve the draft Bill by making it clear that there <Col N="1149" /> is no onus of proof on the prosecution to show that an act of obstruction arose in the exercise of lawful authority or due to unavoidable accident.  I believe there is a need for this type of precaution and that it is generally accepted that such need exists.

      <P>A doubt has arisen as to the situation in which a driver is required to report an accident.  As the Bill stands, a driver need not report an accident if somebody involved in the accident is present and does not demand the driver's name and address or other particulars.  This exception, where the accident need not be reported, does not apply where the person who is present is incapable&mdash;in other words, if he is injured to such a degree that he is no longer capable of demanding anything from the driver in question.</P>
      <P>It has been put to me that while a person might not be unconscious and might appear to be capable of looking after his own interests, it could well be that a broken limb or some other injury could bring about such a state of shock and confusion that the person, in spite of appearances, might not, in fact, be capable of properly looking after his own interest.  It is to meet this point that the amendment has been put down.</P>

The Garda have experience of cases where such a driver will put his vehicle out of sight until blood stains and other marks are removed, body repairs carried out and broken lamps replaced&mdash;anything that might identify him with the accident. The new subsection (2) proposed in amendment No. 98 would require the owner of such a vehicle to disclose its whereabouts.  His refusal to do so would be made an offence under <Col N="1156" /> amendment No. 99.  Under the new subsection (5) proposed in amendment No. 102, the Garda would be entitled to apply for a warrant to enter premises and search for such a vehicle in cases where the owner's co-operation was not forthcoming or not fully forthcoming. In other words, the three amendments are designed to cope with this problem of the hit-and-run driver. It is a rather baffling one, and I believe that what is sought by the amendments is not unreasonable.  I think the general belief is that whatever we can do about this matter within reason, we should attempt.  These three amendments are a reasonable attempt to help detect the hit-and-run driver.</P>

It seems it might be better to provide in Section 109 that the obligation of stopping when required to do so by a member of the Garda should apply only in the case of a Garda in uniform.  The Minister is probably aware that anyone travelling nowadays on the roads is frequently flagged down for lifts and if we do not specify that the member of the Garda is to be in uniform, a person will not know whether he is committing an offence or not if he chooses to ignore the person who signals him to stop.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 107:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 82, line 50, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the section, the Minister takes power to permit the driving of certain vehicles over a period of 5½ hours and this amendment seeks to reduce the period to 4½ hours.  Amendment No. 108 is also designed to reduce the total number of driving hours in a period of 24 hours from 11 to 9.  Amendment No. 109 seeks to extend the rest period for drivers of certain classes of vehicles from a half-hour to one hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> I suppose the number of hours a driver may be permitted to drive and the rest period he may have are matters of opinion.  The opinion of the Minister seems to differ from that of many Deputies.  As far as I am aware, the provisions the Minister has embodied in this section are similar to those embodied in the 1933 Act 28 years ago.  Surely the Minister must realise that these hours need to be changed?  It may be pointless to put the question to the Minister: would he like to have to drive for 5½ hours continuously?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would surprise the Deputy to learn what I have driven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be surprised if he did and I am sure there are not many in the House who have driven large lorries for 5½ hours.  We consider that 5½ hours is an excessive period to expect a driver of a big bus or a heavy lorry to drive.</P>
      <P>The second amendment is designed to reduce the overall driving time in any 24-hours period from eleven to nine hours.  Surely it is unreasonable that the drivers I have mentioned should be required to drive up to 11 hours in 24.  I do not know what prompted the Minister to reintroduce this section embodied in the 1933 Act. In that period, driving was not as difficult as now: traffic has increased five, or six times, and possibly ten times, since 1933.  The hazards and risks are greater.  It may be true that roads have improved, that bends are not as bad, that road surfaces are better, but despite that it seems to me a tremendous operation for any man to drive in these modern conditions for a period of 11 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the subsections proposes that the driver may get a rest of half-an-hour. Our amendment is designed to increase that period to one hour.  I do not know what is in the mind of the Minister when he suggests that a driver who may be compelled by his <Col N="1161" /> employer to drive continuously for five and a half hours should then be content with half an hour's rest.  Unlike the Minister or Deputy Lynch I have never driven a heavy lorry or a bus but I hate to contemplate my physical condition after driving say from Cork to Dublin, then getting a half hour's rest during which I am expected to have my lunch, and then get back into the cab of the lorry or bus and drive back to Cork or a similar distance which would take me five and a half hours.  It is unreasonable that the Minister should expect a driver to be subjected to these conditions.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary course of events if these amendments suggested new sections the Minister might be entitled to say that it was for the men's trade unions to negotiate on this matter but here the Minister takes power to determine what the maximum driving hours should be, what the overall driving hours should be in one day and what the rest period should be. We suggest in these three amendments that in the first case a driver should not be required to drive for any longer than four and a half hours continuously or nine hours in a period of 24 hours and that for the rest period he should be allowed one hour rather than a half an hour as proposed by the Minister in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish speaks as if these hours, which are merely continued on from what was in the 1933 Act, will require that workers and drivers must do these hours and must only have the rest that is mentioned here.  These hours are the hours beyond which they may not be required and it is from that angle that I think it is only fair to approach this matter.  These are the hours beyond which they may not be required to work and drive.  It is all very well to say, and there is a certain amount of force in it, that what was suggested and incorporated in the 1933 Act would be very much out of date today. I agree entirely with that but not altogether for the reasons stated by Deputy Corish.  Over the years since 1933 there has been little if any exception taken to the hours as outlined as the maximum hours in that Act, which <Col N="1162" /> is still current.  It is very easy to say that things have become more difficult on the roads today.</P>
      <P>I would disagree very much with Deputy Corish in so far as the physical strain, and indeed the mental strain, is concerned.  In 1933 when a driver set out on a long journey it was a very short journey if it did not become an adventure as to whether he ever reached his destination or as to whether he ever got back with the same machine.  The vehicles in some respects were not very trustworthy especially in regard to their braking systems.  The comfort of the drivers today is, I am glad to see in the more recent models of trucks, now being thought about but it certainly was not until quite recently and I never saw anybody kicking up a row about that aspect, which surprised me.  By and large, these are not conditions imposed on the workers: they are conditions and hours beyond which they may not be imposed upon. Another vast difference today is&mdash;and I do not say this as a cute argument or as an effort to put something over on Deputy Corish, but in all sincerity &mdash;that the effectiveness of the unions and their widespread application mean they are better placed to look after in a full and comprehensive way the conditions of employment of the workers than they were.  I say that in all sincerity and not as a smart answer to Deputy Corish's plea in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking it all round, to seek to bring in more restricted maxima in so far as these hours are concerned would be a more apparent benefit than a real benefit.  Candidly I do not see what real value would be gained if we were to bring these hours in in the manner suggested by these amendments. Conditions are very different today from what they were in those years and the hours, which are maximum hours, are not at all unreasonable considering the improvement in the roads, the improvement in the machines and the more enlightened approach of our employers as a whole as well as the more effective representation of organised labour to look after the interests of their workers.  All those together are more <Col N="1163" /> effective than anything in this Bill or the old Bill, or anything likely to come in a new Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's remarks that this section has been lifted out of a former Act and the amendments, in the Minister's mind, are not necessary in spite of the fact that conditions have changed drastically since the 1933 Act came into operation.  I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied on health and efficiency grounds that a man can drive a heavy vehicle for 11 hours within 24 hours with short breaks.  In view of the fact that this legislation is brought in to improve safety conditions in the country, to embody in the Act a condition based on the 1933 Act is likely to lead to a recurrence of dangerous conditions on our roads, particularly at night and in winter time if a driver is put to the limit that he may be under this section.</P>
      <P>When the section was originally brought in&mdash;I am open to contradiction on this&mdash;I do not think there was anything in the nature of a 44 or 48 hour week so far as drivers were concerned. It was possible then to knock 66, 68, 70 or even 80 hours out of a man, if you got away with it.  Why then should we leave in, in new legislation which is getting rid of prohibitions on the workers, a section which will enable a driver to be exploited to that extent and &ldquo;exploited&rdquo; is the word I use?  The target nowadays, whether in public relations or amongst labour personnel, is to shorten the working week and even in a country which a number of people in this House are afraid to mention the working week is to be reduced to 35 hours in the near future in many fields.  Here we have this Christian country making a provision that a man may be subjected to driving a heavy vehicle for up to 11 hours within a 24 hour period.  The Minister should have no objection whatever to accepting Deputy Corish's amendments and particularly the one in regard to the 11-hour period. Deputy Corish and the Labour Party were quite right to put them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1164" />
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that one of the reasons he did not get complaints from people driving heavy lorries for long hours is that a man with the job of driving a heavy lorry over a long distance and for long hours has what is called a good job from the point of view of pay.  Many of those men are in their forties and they would not like to complain even through their unions. I know some of them.  I have had experience of driving long distances in heavy vehicles when the roads were very bad.  Of course I was younger then and it is all right for people in their twenties.</P>
      <P>The Bill is mainly concerned with safety on the roads.  That ideal will not be attained if men have to drive heavy vehicles over very long hours.  If a standard rule with regard to hours were set down, it would save a great deal of recrimination between employers and drivers.  That standard should be less than the 11 hours set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the roads are better, lorries are better, and so on and so on, but the men are expected to drive much longer distances. That is a great strain on them. They drive at greater speed and on much more crowded roads.  Therefore, they are creating a greater hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point that this does not necessarily mean that drivers will have to drive for 5½ hours, or 11 hours in the 24 hours.  Obviously, their unions would see they did not exceed what they regard as the maximal period.  I think it is fair to say that what were regarded as maximal periods of driving in 1933 should at least be looked at again from the point of view of existing conditions as against the conditions of the roads 28 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it will probably be many years before we enact another Road Traffic Bill.  The Minister is legislating not only for what is happening today but for what is likely to be happening in 25 or 30 years' time, having regard to the rapid expansion of road traffic in other countries, and despite expansion here, we still lag behind other countries in that regard. <Col N="1165" /> If we cannot go the whole way, the Minister might make an adjustment in these figures, bearing in mind all the present circumstances and the possible future circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to regard this section lightly.  It would be much better not to put a section in the Bill at all limiting the number of hours a driver may drive a heavy vehicle.  He is laying down here that a driver may not drive for more than 11 hours.  He may not drive continuously for more than 5½ hours and after a 5½ hours journey, he must get a half-hour break.</P>
      <P>The conflict between the Minister and me is that I do not believe those hours are the correct hours.  I believe the driver should be required to drive less during the day, less on a continuous journey and have more rest periods.  The Minister's arguments with regard to the state of the roads and the conditions for driving 28 years ago compared with the present day conditions is flimsy.  He would nearly have us believe a journey from, say, Wicklow to Dublin 28 years ago, in 1933, was a sort of romantic escapade, a journey during which the driver did not know what to expect, that it was a sort of gamble whether or not he would get from Wicklow to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider certain people I am sure he knows of whom I know of, who must, in the corn season, get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to load their lorries, travel a distance of perhaps 100 miles to Dublin, deliver their corn there, get into their lorry, go back 100 miles, come to Dublin again with a second load and then go back home again. That is the type of person I want to protect in this legislation.  The Minister says he is protecting them by providing that they must not work for than 11 hours, but they can do a double journey within 11 hours and in doing it, they are a danger to the public.  It is a very good thing to say to a labour representative that their trade unions will look after them!</P>

    <P>We do not profess to absolute perfection in the trade union movement. <Col N="1166" /> It is true to say that this country, in the city in particular and in the country in general, is one of the best organised in Europe, so far as trade unions are concerned, but there are people who are not embraced by the trade union movement and despite all the efforts of the movement, will not be embraced by it, such as casual workers living far away from towns and cities.  They are being exploited by merchants in the country today.  They have to drive 80, 90 or 100 miles to and from Dublin twice per day.  The Minister says they can work for 11 hours in the day and not break the law.  On the second journey back from the city, the driver is a pretty tired and groggy man.  He can have an accident through no fault of his own but because he is tired and sleepy in his cab.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to continue that situation on the roads of Ireland where there is ten times more driving than there was in 1933.  It was not as dangerous in 1933, although they had the solid tyres and bad roads and did not have the speed.  There were not the same risks or hazards as there are on the roads today.  No matter how well the lorries have improved or how much the surface of the roads has improved, there are still fast sports cars and other vehicles on the roads. The driver must be aware of these conditions.  He must be conscious and look out for them.  How can he do that when he is driving for the eleventh hour in the day?</P>
    <P>I am making these arguments because the Minister is laying down certain rules and conditions.  He says there are limits beyond which you cannot drive, and that 11 hours is the maximum which the driver can be required to drive during a day.  Certain of the drivers who are organised can be discounted but there are men who are casual drivers today and labourers tomorrow.  They are the people who have to be protected and they are the people against whom the public must be protected because, not deliberately but by reason of these conditions, they may cause accidents.  The present Taoiseach was in charge of the Road Traffic Bill of 1933 and when the <Col N="1167" /> Labour Party asked him at that time to extend the break from half an hour to one hour, he said he would consider it, that it was a good point.  Here we are, 30 years after, and the matter is still being considered.  It is still being considered whether a driver of a heavy lorry should get more than half an hour's rest in the day.  Deputy McQuillan pointed out that conditions of employment have changed, changed so radically that a worker who worked a 54-, a 50- or a 48-hour week in 1933 now works a 40-hour week.  If there is an improvement for workers generally, surely the Minister could have provided in his Bill for a reduction in the hours worked by drivers of heavy lorries.</P>
    <P>The particular hours suggested may not suit the Minister.  There has been a suggestion of a two-hour reduction in the over-all driving.  We suggest an increase of half an hour in the break period and that a driver shall not be compelled to drive for more than four and a half hours.  The Minister may not agree with these reductions.  Surely he does not still contend that the hours acceptable to Dáil Eireann in 1933 should now be acceptable to Dáil Eireann in 1961.  I appeal to the Minister to consider these three amendments in an effort to improve the lot of drivers who may not be protected by trade unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, I think, inclined to pay too much attention to the isolated effect of this section.  We are told that 1933 is a far cry from 1961.  We are told, not without a certain amount of truth, that conditions today are vastly different and that the strain of driving is more severe than it was in 1933 when these hours were laid down.  It is worthy of note that the hours we are discussing here are the hours laid down in the 1960 British Act.  If the argument of congestion on the roads and added mental strain in driving in heavy traffic carries weight, surely it should carry weight in Britain to a greater degree than it does here. I am not using that as an argument, but these hours are the absolute limit we think should be allowed.  They are not the hours drivers must work.  I suppose <Col N="1168" /> we will always have with us some few employers who will exploit their drivers and workers if they can get away with it; but, while these people are with us, nothing I might say on this Bill will prevent them acting in that manner, and Deputy Corish knows that very well.  This section will not prevent the unscrupulous employer putting the screw on his worker.  Usually the workman is afraid that, if he objects, he will lose his job, and he cannot afford to lose his job.  Something written into this Bill will not prevent that odd isolated case.</P>
      <P>The hours stipulated here are the limits beyond which no worker may be required to go.  The possibility is that, by agreement, employers and workers will suit themselves where hours are concerned.  I know drivers who drive 11 hours on one day and do no driving at all the following day. The people employing these are private employers, not very strong financially. They have to treat their drivers well because if they overwork them to the point where they may wreck the vehicle and cause damage, then it is the employers who lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And then they will sack the unfortunate drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Isolated cases in which unscrupulous employers push their drivers beyond the limit of endurance, to the detriment of their business and the endangering of the lives of others, are not a proper foundation on which to base a general case for further restricting the freedom of the employers and the workers to make arrangements between themselves to suit both workers and employers, without putting an undue strain on any particular driver.  If we were providing that drivers must work the 11 hours six days out of the seven and work not less than 5½ at a stretch, I would be absolutely with Deputy Corish, but that is not what is provided here.  We are laying down the outside limit beyond which no driver may be required to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put it in another way.  Consider the position of drivers on long-distance haulage.  They might resent bitterly being compelled to stop by the <Col N="1169" /> roadside for an hour.  Stopping for half an hour for a snack is much more to their liking.  We are not saying here that drivers must do this or must do that.  We are saying they may not be required to drive for longer than a specified period and that they must have a break of at least half an hour at the end of that period.  That is an entirely different matter.  Arrangements are usually made between the employers and the workers&mdash;sometimes by agreement with the trade unions&mdash;and a good driver is not so easy to come by.  The employer who gets a good driver is very careful in his treatment of him because he is anxious to retain his services.  Others will be looking for good drivers and, if he does not look after them, others will.  I do not think the fears expressed by Deputy Corish are well founded.  If there is still in this country a boss man who has so cowed his employees that they are afraid to complain, nothing written into this Bill will remedy that position.  I do not think we should base our case on that type of employer as against the type of general employer we have in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite easy to clarify the point made by Deputy Corish.  With regard to the figure used in 1933, that was the time of the Model T and the split rims and the punctures on the roads.  The legislation was based on the length of time it would take to make the single journey from, perhaps, Letterkenny to Dublin for one of these very charitable traders for whom the Minister shows such regard.  It was accepted that the journey would take 11 hours and that, in all conscience, it was unfair to suggest that a driver who had driven over 200 miles from Letterkenny to Dublin with a heavy load should be expected to about turn after a half-hour or an hour's grace and undertake the return journey.</P>
      <P>Even in Ireland we are moving, although not quite as fast as in other countries, and we have discovered that it is now possible for one of these gentlemen in Letterkenny to send a driver to Dublin to collect a heavy load and to make the double journey within eleven hours.  That is the reason the eleven hours has been retained.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given no justification whatever for retaining the figure of eleven hours incorporated in the 1933 Act.  It is sad to hear a Minister at this stage saying that good drivers are perhaps, scarce and that it is up to the employer, if he has a good driver, to be nice to him or some other merchant will take him away from him.  That is no argument at all when we are dealing with legislation in connection with the welfare of members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that this provision is incorporated in the 1960 <Col N="1171" /> British Act.  To be fair to him, he went on to say that that had no bearing on its introduction here.  If it had not, I do not know why he was so anxious to mention it.  The fact that the British decided on such a measure surprises me and I should like a little more information with regard to the safeguards provided in the British legislation in which such a provision as this was incorporated, as the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>When I was about 11 or 12 years of age, the journey from Athlone to Dubline took about four hours.  There were a number of breaks to fix the occasional puncture.  A good deal of bad language was used on those occasions by the driver with regard to the condition of the roads and the frequency of punctures.  It was a leisurely journey, if you like, pleasant in many way.  The condition of the roads and the leisureliness of the pace at that time are not comparable with present day conditions.  Nowadays, it is a matter of arriving at one's destination in the shortest possible space of time. The stage has been reached when few people are prepared to stop to help a neighbour in trouble on the road.  I know, of course, it has no bearing on the matter of the hours involved in Section 114 but it is clear that in 1933 the journey to the city of Dublin from Kerry or Cork or the tip of Donegal could be done inside 11 hours and the House was progressive enough at that time to say that that was the limit and that a driver would not be allowed to make the return journey.  The measure was progressive in 1933, but, in 1961, the reintroduction of that type of legislation is putting the clock back, to say the least of it.  I suggest that the Minister, at this 11th hour, should accept the proposal of Deputy Corish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point made by the Minister is that there is no compulsion in this, that the section does not intend that a man should be compelled to work up to 11 hours.  We all agree that the Minister's main function in this Bill is to try to prevent road <Col N="1172" /> accidents and death but in this section the Minister's attitude is that if a driver of a heavy vehicle drives for a period less than 11 hours, he is deemed not to be a danger to the public&mdash;not absolutely&mdash;he may be if he drives only for half an hour.  From many points of view, if a man drives for over 11 hours, the Minister and the Government think he is a danger to the public.  That is laudable.  The Minister's intention in the Bill is to try to protect the lives of the road-using public but he ought to analyse this matter of the 11 hours.</P>
      <P>The Minister did have occasion to say that in cases where a man may be required to drive 11 hours in a day, that would not happen for very many days or, at any rate, for very many weeks.  I want to assure the Minister that in the season for, say, the distribution of lime and fertiliser and delivery of corn, men are required to drive for very long periods over a period of practically two months.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, by inference, if you like, that the man who drives for, say, 2½ hours to Dublin, who waits there for his lorry to be unloaded, say, an hour, and gets into the lorry again and drives back for another 2 hours or 2½ hours, who is hanging around there while the lorry is being loaded and, although he may not be required to do so, helps with the loading of the lorry, which may take another hour or an hour and a half, and who is required to undertake the 2½ hour journey to Dublin again, there to be hanging around or doing odd jobs on his car for another hour, who gets into the cab and goes back on the two and a half hour journey, is pretty safe so long as he is driving only for 11 hours.  The Minister must also consider the time in between.  Even apart from the time in between, a man who is driving for 11 hours in a period of 24 hours and who does that for weeks must be a danger to himself and to the public.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31st May, 1961.</P>
