    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether because of the Government's failure to seek membership of the E.E.C. and its absence from present negotiations concerning the pattern of British trade in the E.E.C. the British food market may be reserved by quota or other arrangement to some other country to the detriment of this country; and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 6 and 7 together, all of which appear to be based on a misconception of the provisions of the Rome Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Common Market established by the Rome Treaty embraces all sectors of the economy and extends to agricultural as well as industrial products.</P>
      <P>The Treaty, when fully effective, provides for complete freedom of trade between the members of the European Economic Community in respect of industrial products.  There is thus no possibility of an acceding member receiving special advantages as regards outlets for industrial products within the Community, and, consequently, neither Britain nor any other acceding country could expect to secure such advantages in return for concessions in the matter of agricultural trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards agriculture, the Treaty provides for the establishment of a common agricultural policy among the <Col N="1485" /> member States.  While the broad principles of this policy have been agreed, the method of their implementation has not yet been settled. It is to be assumed, however, that, if Britain (and this would, of course, apply to Ireland also) accedes to the Rome Treaty, it will be on the basis of accepting the common agricultural policy as finally elaborated.  This could be expected to lead ultimately to a uniform price and market situation in the new member States as well as in the enlarged Community as a whole. It is necessary to have it understood that developments in this field are still so hypothetical that it is not possible at this stage to speak in terms of concrete arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether any European nation may apply for membership of the European Economic Community; whether Ireland is in any way restricted from making such application at once; and if the final decision to be made by the Government concerning Irish membership of the E.E.C. depends on the success or failure of present negotiations by Britain seeking membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether there are any circumstances in which Ireland would seek membership of the E.E.C., independent of British membership of that Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Under Article 237 of the Rome Treaty, &ldquo;any European State may apply to become a member of the Community&rdquo;.  The Council, consisting of representatives of the Member Governments, pronounces on each application by means of a unanimous vote after obtaining the opinion of the Commission; and the conditions of membership and the amendments to the Treaty necessitated thereby would be the subject of an agreement between the Member States and the applicant State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> Formally, there is nothing whatever to prevent this country applying independently for membership of the Community.  As I explained, however, in the statement I made to the House on this subject on the 16th May, there are very good reasons of an economic nature against our entering the European Economic Community while Britain remains outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply to those two questions and the previous three, in view of his own statement that the widest possible discussion would be welcomed by him and the Government on the difficulties and problems appertaining to our entry to the Common Market, would he not agree that it is necessary for him at this stage to put into a White Paper all the raw material to enable this House to debate the matter at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at present possible to do that usefully.  I have already informed the House that I will make arrangements to give them information which will enable Deputies fully to understand the position when definite information is available to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will agree it is desirable at this stage that the House should get an opportunity of discussing especially the question of agricultural policy in view of the fact that some of his Ministers, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Lands and other Ministers, over the past fortnight have embarked on a campaign of speeches throughout the country to enlighten the public in regard to the position. Surely this House should have an opportunity to discuss all aspects of this problem before Ministers proceed to give their own version?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the European Economic Community is concerned, there is as yet no agricultural policy to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach appears to be as uncertain on many aspects of this question as <Col N="1487" /> other members of the House.  Would he not agree that in order to try to get rid of this uncertainty and in order to obtain some facts about it enabling us to consider the whole matter, the best approach would be to open negotiations for admission? Then we would be in possession of the facts which would enable us to decide whether we should join or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the type of information which he gave to the Junior Chamber <Col N="1488" /> of Commerce in Killarney over the weekend and to other associations would be better given to the members of the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave no information to the members of the Junior Chamber of Commerce that has not been given to the Dáil or that is not available to everybody in published documents, including the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach ever made a speech on this subject in the Dáil as fully as he made it, say, to the Junior Chamber of Commerce.  I do not take any exception to his doing that.  He did not give full information; he speculated. It was understandable speculation to some extent.  I think, therefore, a debate on this matter would be very desirable at this stage.  Nobody wants to embarrass the Taoiseach or the Government in this delicate matter. However, I think we should have a debate in this House on the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Government's view, there is at present no proposition to be put to the Dáil for debate.  If any Deputies think there is such a proposition that can usefully be debated here, I shall be glad to consider it when it is submitted.</P>

      <P>An engineering survey of the Ballyline River has not been made by the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office, and such information as is available to them indicates that the work would be outside the scope of the minor schemes undertaken by that office.  The river has been noted for consideration in the arterial drainage programme, but I am unable to say at present when it can be reached.</P>

I propose, therefore, to give the Deputy particulars of the schemes sanctioned in Co. Kerry in 1960/61, and as the reply is in the form of a tabular statement I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it included in the Official Report.</P>

The Insurance Acts provide that an Assurance Company which contravenes or fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Acts shall be guilty of an offence.  There is, however, a time limit for the prosecution of offences.  Proceedings for an offence may not be commenced more than six years after its commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a house taken over from a rural housing authority by the urban authority whose area has been extended, the powers of the Urban Authority to increase the rents are similar to those possessed by the rural of any increase in rents or the extent housing authority from whom the houses are transferred.  The question <Col N="1501" /> of any such increase remains, as previously, a matter for the housing authority owning the houses.</P>
      <P>A cottage can be transferred to the urban authority with the agreement of both local authorities at any time after 12 months from the date of the boundary extension.  When a cottage is so transferred the purchase provisions of the Labourers Act, 1936, or of any purchase scheme made thereunder cease to have effect.  Any proposal for the sale subsequently of the transferred cottage would then come within the provisions of Section 11 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether his attention has been drawn to a statement that Civil Servants from Dublin are attending court cases in the Six Counties for the purpose of giving evidence regarding the amount of I.R.A. pensions being paid to I.R.A. veterans residing in the Six Counties, against whom prosecutions are being brought because they did not disclose the nature of these pensions to the Six County authorities when making claims for benefit; whether the statement is correct and, if so, whether he will have this reprehensible practice discontinued forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the letter referred to by the Deputy.  Since 1957 there were four cases in which officers of my Department attended at courts in the Six Counties to give evidence regarding the payment of military service pensions and/or special allowances to persons residing in that area who were prosecuted by the National Assistance Board for failure to disclose these sources of income when applying for National Assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the necessity for the attendance of officers of my Department at these courts and the circumstances which gave rise to their attendance. While I do not propose that in future officers will not attend these courts in <Col N="1505" /> such cases, I hope that the necessity for the attendance will not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the Minister gave permission for these civil servants to give evidence and he still thinks it is a bad practice and should be discontinued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it fair that any official from the State should go and give evidence in a court in Northern Ireland when it is known that people who were in the I.R.A. will be victimised?  There are a number of people in the Six Counties who have never disclosed that they were in the I.R.A. and I would ask the Minister to issue an instruction that these people should not have to give evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Financial Statement of 8th May, 1957, a re-examination of the activities of the Land Commission was carried out during the ensuing twelve months.  For the numerous aspects of activity reexamined and the results, I would refer the Deputy to my predecessor's statement to the House when he introduced the Estimate for Lands (Vote 46) on 3rd July, 1958.  The introduction of legislation did not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware of the grave flooding and erosion position on the Gaskell Estate, Ballycotton, County Cork, where owing to flooding, farmers are unable to sow their crops and in many cases sea water has rotted the seed; and if his engineers will examine the position with a view to having steps taken to alleviate the distress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous question on 28th October, 1959.  Full investigation disclosed that the alleviation of this flooding and coast erosion is not the responsibility of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This periodic flooding, as I understand it, does not fall within the provisions of the law, as lands <Col N="1508" /> exempted from annuities as permanently inundated or flooded land.  I understand the flooding is caused by an outlet channel which flows through privately owned land.  The question of clearing the channel is a matter between the tenants concerned and the owner of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware this is due to the negligence of the Land Commission, when purchasing this estate, in relation to sluice gates between the tenants and the sea?  This area is still held as the property of the landlords.  The sluice gates are neglected and they are causing the flooding.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof and out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to make further provision in relation to the superannuation of Judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court, of Justices of the District Court and of certain Court officers.</P>

      <P>In common with other Deputies, I tabled an amendment which was ruled out of order and I feel it may be appropriate to refer to what I had in mind on the Money Resolution rather than on any specific section.  This measure deals with the superannuation of certain court officers and I understand that the Minister as well as Deputies has had representations from county Registrars whose pensions will be affected by this measure.  The pension rights of county registrars are at present regulated by the Court Officers Act of 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it also provides that the county registrar is entitled to opt to accept the terms of this Section 4 and the subsequent section under which he can opt for a lower pension and transfer portion of the pension already already earned in the form of a gratuity to a wife or widow, as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>However that may be, I think I would have to <Col N="1513" /> say it does not provide money for pensions.  It does not provide funds for the pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say is that the present arrangement is that the 1945 Act applies except in respect of a few who were appointed before that Act.  Under the 1945 Act, the provision is that there is a pension of one-sixth of the salary for the first ten years service, together with one fortieth for each year in excess of ten up to a maximum of two-thirds after 30 years service.  The provisions of the legislation at the present mean that a county registrar, unless he was appointed prior to his 35 birthday, cannot have full service because he is obliged to retire at 65.  That, I think, applies to almost all the county registrars, with the possible exception of six or seven so that of the balance, which I understand is 25 or 26 county registrars, none of them will have full service because, owing to the nature of the appointment, they were appointed after the age of 35.  Most of them were 40 or upwards.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should consider introducing an amendment because, as the Ceann Comhairle rightly pointed out, it is not permissible for a Deputy to introduce an amendment which involves a charge on public funds.  I suggest that the same terms as are provided in the 1956 Courts of Justice Acts in respect of district justices should apply in respect of county registrars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office of county registrar is one which requires special qualifications. It is a responsible post and the person appointed to it must be a solicitor of a certain number of years standing, eight years being the minimum. Normally, the person appointed has more than the minimum service.  In addition to being the county registrar, he acts as returning officer in Dáil elections; he is registrar of titles and, in respect of circuit court work, I understand he does the work of three comparable officials of the High Court, Examiner, Accountant and Taxing Master.  He also has to compile the Voters List and Register and he <Col N="1514" /> adjudicates on claims and objections to the Register.  Also, in respect of workman's compensation, he has the onerous duty of adjudicating on the adequacy of compensation by lump sum agreement.</P>
    <P>District justices were formerly at a similar disadvantage because in their case they were not normally appointed until they had reached 40 years of age and consequently with retirement at 65 could not complete 30 years service. I suggest and I believe that there would be support for the introduction of such an amendment, that the same terms should apply in respect of county registrars as apply at present to district justices.  Very few county registrars can qualify for full pension. In fact, there is at least one case of a county registrar resigning from his post in order to take up a position as district justice.  Section 8 of the Courts of Justice Acts, 1953 reduced the qualifying period for district justices from 30 years to 20 years for full pension.  The Minister might introduce a similar amendment on Report Stage to meet this situation.  County registrars are not entitled to certain terms which higher civil servants, or perhaps all civil servants, get in respect of children's allowances and so on.  Consequently, a more equitable arrangement would appear to be one comparable with that operating for district justices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Cosgrave has said.  Quite apart from the individual case he mentioned, I am in complete agreement that there is a general case to be made that, where we provide that a person may take up a particular job only after having a certain number of years service, the basis of computation of pension for such a person is not comparable with that which applies in the case of a person who in the ordinary way goes into the public service in his teens or thereabouts. Because of the terms or conditions with which they must comply before they are appointed, only in the rarest cases can county registrars qualify for full pension when they must retire at the <Col N="1515" /> age of 65.  I do not think that is reasonable and I am quite certain that the Minister would appreciate the position in that regard.</P>
      <P>The fairest way of coping with the matter is the manner in which a similar situation was dealt with in respect of district justices under the 1953 Act, as Deputy Cosgrave has said.  Whether or not the Minister can do it in this Bill, I would strongly urge him to take up with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, the question of introducing amending legislation, either by way of amendment of this Bill or otherwise, to ensure that those who must serve for so many years before they have the right to be appointed and who do not by necessity serve that period, lose their pension rights to which all public servants are otherwise entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that there are many on this side of the House who agree entirely with what has been suggested by Deputy Cosgrave and supported by Deputy Sweetman. There seems to be something inequitable as between those two officers of the court.  When a district justice reaches retiring age, there is provision that his service can be extended from year to year until he reaches the age of 70 years.  The body that decides that consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to a county registrar is that when he reaches retiring age, he can apply for an extension and it is the Minister for Finance who grants the extension. Why cannot he also, as an officer of the court, come under the same body in respect of these applications for extensions?  In other words, why cannot the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General consider his application for an extension up to the limit of 70 years of age?  I would strongly urge on the Minister that he should consider what has been said here.  Those of us who have had this matter brought to our notice feel that it would be unfair and unjust not to deal with it on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured to <Col N="1516" /> make it as clear as possible that this Bill was based on the clear understanding, so far as the Government were concerned, that it would not entail any extra charge on the Exchequer. Therefore, I can do nothing in respect of the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Sweetman. In reply to Deputy Briscoe, the county registrars have at the present time the right he is now suggesting they should be given and do not have to secure the right as the district justices must secure it through the medium of the Judicial Committee on the basis of their being in a fairly healthy condition.  They have that right from the Minister for Justice to secure an extension from 65 to 70 years of age.  From that point of view, the suggestion put forward would in fact be a worsening of their position to some extent rather than an improvement.  I cannot say any more in regard to the suggestion that we should make these improvements suggested by Deputies on the opposite side.  Anything that would impose expenditure on the Exchequer cannot be entertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>May I comment on the Minister's statement with regard to there being a possibility subsequently of some charge being made on public funds, if these amendments were accepted?  Surely what the Minister assured the House was that the Bill as drafted would not entail a charge on public funds.  If the House is in support of these amendments, and I think most of us are, does that not absolve the Minister completely from any undertaking he may have given in the first place?  In actual fact, the charge on public funds will not be immediate and will not be very much in any case. I suggest the remarks the Minister made in good faith, and which were based on the Bill as drafted, should not necessarily bind him if the House is agreeable to release him from them. I hope he will not feel himself bound in that way and that he will be able to deal with these amendments on their merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) to increase the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta Teoranta from £10,000,000 to £13,000,000; and</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(ii) to provide for the issue by the Minister for Finance of repayable advances to the Company of such sums (not exceeding in the aggregate £1,000,000) as the Company may from time to time request.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation&mdash;the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1959&mdash;the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta is £10,000,000 of which £9,975,541 has been issued.  Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are subsidiaries of the parent company, Aer Rianta, the capital of which is used mainly for investment in the subsidiaries.  The existing capital has been used by Aer Rianta as to £2,977,974 in Aer Lingus and £6,921,477 in Aerlínte, the balance being retained by the Company for its own capital purposes.</P>
      <P>In the Capital Budget for 1961/62 provision has been made for the investment of £1,200,000 in the air companies, and tentative estimates of capital requirements in the years 1962/63 and 1963/64 show that an additional investment of up to £1,000,000 will be required, making a total investment of about £12,200,000. In the Bill provision is made for an increase in the authorised capital to £13,000,000.  It is not possible at the present stage to predict exactly for how long this provision will meet requirements in view of the spectacular expansion in our air business&mdash; to which I will refer later&mdash;and to the possibility that the increasing traffic may necessitate additions to the companies' fleets and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The amount of £1,200,000 in the Capital Budget for this year includes £150,000 in respect of Aer Rianta's investment in a hotel project to which I shall refer later.  The capital expenditure of Aer Lingus for this year is estimated at £450,000 which will be met by the Company from its own resources.  The Capital Budget provides £850,000 which will enable the Company to liquidate a bank loan on which it has been operating for the past few years.  Capital expenditure for Aerlínte is estimated at £600,000 of which £400,000 will be met from its own resources.  The balance of £200,000 will be provided by the Exchequer.  When these amounts have been issued, the capital structure of Aer Lingus will consist of £3,820,000 subscribed by the Exchequer and £1,000,000 long-term loan from a commercial source, as compared with £2,970,000 Exchequer participation and £1,500,000 loan capital on 31st March, 1961.  The capital subscribed to Aerlínte will be £7,120,000 as compared with £6,920,000 on 31st March, 1961.  There will be an increase of £150,000 in the amount retained by Aer Rianta for its own capital requirements.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta will require, for its own purposes, in the years 1961-62 and 1962-63 a sum of about £250,000 to cover the Company's investment in Irish and Inter-Continental Hotels Limited, a company formed to undertake the construction, furnishing and equipping of three hotels to be erected in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The total cost of the project is about £2,750,000 and the balance of the capital required is being provided by means of a guaranteed loan under the Tourist Traffic Acts and by a number of banking and private interests.  The amount of capital allocated to Aer Lingus for 1961-62 covers the liquidation of the bank loan already referred to and the purchase of such items as fleet and ground equipment.  The main ground for repaying the bank loan is the undesirability of the Company having a large proportion of its capital in the form of loan capital.  The capital required by Aerlínte in 1961-62 is for modifications in aircraft fleet, spares and equipment, ground <Col N="1521" /> equipment, premises and office furniture and repayment of working capital.</P>
    <P>The provision for the issue of repayable advances from the Exchequer to Aer Rianta is a new feature, and will enable Aer Rianta to obtain capital for items which would normally be financed by means of bank overdraft. It is considered desirable that certain short term capital requirements should be met in some other way than by the issue of share capital.  Examples of short term capital requirements are the purchase of electronic computing machinery which would be expected to pay for itself over a number of years and temporary cash shortages which would disappear in due course.  The provision in the Bill follows the lines of similar provisions in the Electricity (Supply) Acts and the Turf Development Acts.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well for me to give the House a brief outline of the results, financial and otherwise, achieved by the carrying companies&mdash; Aer Lingus and Aerlínte&mdash;during the past two years.  In the financial year ended 31st March, 1960, Aer Lingus had an operating surplus of about £170,000 and in the six months ended 30th September, 1960, the operating surplus was £310,000.  The financial accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st March, 1961, are not yet available but I understand that the airline as a whole&mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte&mdash;taking both the transatlantic and European sectors together, will have a modest surplus for that year.  In 1960/61 the number of passengers carried by Aer Lingus was 713,000, an increase of 25% on the number carried in 1959/60.  The total amount of cargo carried&mdash;12,000 tons&mdash;showed an increase of 39 per cent. on the 1959/60 figure, and the quantity of mail carried&mdash;18,000 tons&mdash;showed an increase of 5 per cent. on the 1959/60 figure.  In the year ended 31st March, 1961, Aerlínte carried 35,176 passengers, an increase of 51 per cent. or 11,898 passengers on the 1959/60 figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> The total amount of cargo carried was 244 tons which was two and a half times more than the amount carried in 1959/60.  The amount of mail carried was 49 tons, an increase of 11 per cent. on the 1959/60 figure. The Aerlínte financial results for the twelve months ended 31st March, 1960, showed that there was an operating loss of £589,080 for that year, compared with an operating loss of £788,599 for the eleven months ended 31st March, 1959.  The accounts for the six months ended 30th September, 1960, showed an operating surplus of £143,000 compared with a deficit of £286,000 in the same period of 1959. These results were achieved when the aircraft used by the Company were on charter from Seaboard and Western Airlines.  In the last three months of the financial year 1960/61 the Company operated its own Boeing jet aircraft and it is the invariable experience that the Winter months are not as favourable as the Summer months. Nevertheless, the prospects of the Company are bright and the number of passengers carried in the period January to March, 1961, was 5,837 as compared with 3,085 in the corresponding period in 1960.  This trend is continuing and forward bookings are very promising.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure, as the Minister said, provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta.  The report which the Minister has just given the House of the recent returns in relation to finance, the number of passengers, goods, and mail carried is satisfactory.  The trend is in the right direction.  The State investment in general air development is very considerable.  The construction and equipment of airports and the purchase of aircraft for the air companies have involved very considerable State expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the company are satisfactory.  The trend in the case of the transatlantic air service is also in the right direction.  I have always held the view that we should develop our air services to the fullest possible <Col N="1523" /> extent, while at the same time paying due regard to the resources of the country and to the opportunities which present themselves for proper development of our air services.</P>
    <P>The staff of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus are efficient and have brought credit on themselves and on the companies.  They have a well-deserved reputation for courtesy and consideration in dealing with the public.  It is, therefore, right that the standard of efficiency and courtesy set up by the officials and staffs of these companies should be fully recognised, because that standard has reflected credit on the companies concerned as well as on the individuals.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to advert in this debate.  One is the question of whether it is desirable, in view of the very heavy capital commitments involved here and the nature of the particular investment, for Aer Rianta to invest money in a hotels project.  I understand that companies elsewhere have made similar investments but, in view of the very considerable State investment involved here and the fact that this business is somewhat outside the range of activities which one normally associates with the air company, I wonder whether it is desirable to embark on an investment of that character.  There is, undoubtedly, room for further hotel accomodation in the city and, indeed, in the country, and any project such as is envisaged deserves encouragement, but in view of the very heavy capital commitments and the large sums of money involved, whether it is desirable for the company to make an investment of that sort is a matter which is certainly open to some question.  I mention it in order to hear the reasons the company decided to make this investment.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wish to mention is that since the company acquired the Boeing jets, the bookings have considerably increased and I should be anxious to hear from the Minister if the Boeing jets have been found to be satisfactory, if the range of flight which they can cover is the same both ways, <Col N="1524" /> eastward and westward, and if, generally, the aircraft have proved satisfactory and as suitable as was estimated when they were purchased.</P>
    <P>In air transport, one has to keep abreast of technical developments and if this country is to provide services comparable with or better than those provided by other countries, we must keep abreast of the various technical developments and secure, not only trained and competent personnel, but also the most suitable aircraft available.  This is a particularly difficult matter for a small country like ours, because we have to buy these machines from suppliers outside the country and, consequently, the matter depends to a very considerable extent on judgement at a particular time.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, in the Department of Industry and Commerce, when the matter of the purchase of the Viscount planes came up for decision for the first time, recommendations were made on the best evidence available.  At that time, there were a number of opinions as to what was the most suitable plane to acquire.  Eventually we took the decision to purchase the Viscounts and they have undoubtedly proved very satisfactory, but, when a new type of aircraft, which has not been proved from the point of view of public experience comes on the market, the opinions which have to be taken into account and the evidence which is available are not always as convincing as would be justified by subsequent events.  While, as I say, the purchase of Viscounts proved very satisfactory, when the decision was taken initially, it was taken only after very serious consideration.  I hope the Boeing jets will prove to be equally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Subject to the information, which I hope it will be possible to get on these matters, we approve of the terms of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the approach by Deputy Cosgrave to the matter under discussion today.  We have now clearly moved from the attitude of mind on the part of some people, who regarded the development of air services as unnecessary, on the ground that we could not afford the <Col N="1525" /> expenditure for purely prestige purposes. It is now accepted that the development of air services serves a good utility purpose and is of general importance to the nation.  It is also good to know that the operations of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are internationally recognised as offering exceptionally good services.</P>
      <P>I also have a certain amount of doubt, such as expressed by Deputy Cosgrave, as to the wisdom of the Government in allowing a State-subsidised and State-supported organisation to get into a business in competition with private enterprise.  I have heard a great many people criticising the entry of the air company into the hotel business, particularly at a time when there appear to be very big development prospects for private enterprise.  I do not know how this new hotel venture will develop but, in my opinion, it is not an operation with which the air company or the air service generally should have close contact.</P>
      <P>I want to take advantage of this opportunity to state publicity and to put on record one of the criticisms I have had with regard to air development in this country for a number of years.  I have said many times&mdash;I have said it every year&mdash;that there is not sufficient consideration given by this air company, whether Aer Lingus or Aerlínte, to furthering the development of our exports by making available to our industrial side an economic air freight rate.  I know they are tied up with this international body, I.A.T.A. who sit in various countries in the world and who have fixed air freight rates for all classes of goods.  If that body were situated within the jurisdiction of the Republic, it probably would be invited to appear before the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when this State-sponsored body should recognise its responsibility to all the other sections which go to make up this State.  We are now at the begining of an industrial revival which demands air freight rates that will make exports possible. I know&mdash;and I have evidence of it&mdash; that the reason these international conferences keep up these air freight rates <Col N="1526" /> is that if they reduced them to an economic level for those who would avail of an air freight service, they would not have sufficient planes to carry the cargo offered.</P>
    <P>At the same time, those companies prevent the development of charter services.  We could ship lambs in season to Switzerland, chartering planes that charge a reasonable freight rate.  However, if these charter planes arrive at Collinstown and if a van arrives alongside to offload its contents on to the plane, it becomes uneconomic because a handling charge is made although there is no handling done by the company.  That charge is what makes that business impossible. If the servants of the company were putting the lambs into the plane, the company would be entitled to something but this plane that arrives there is charged a landing fee which goes to pay for the upkeep of the airport.</P>
    <P>I realise our exports are related to our productivity.  We are not able to pay 5/- a kilo for exportable goods because they are not diamonds or gold. We are down to ordinary agricultural surplus.  I do not know why Aer Lingus or Aerlínte have not considered the possibility of securing planes purely for freight purposes and offering an air freight rate which would attract business on a large scale.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill, the Minister pointed out that there are periods of the year when our planes are not fully loaded with passengers.  This is the period when, if you do not lose money, you certainly do not make it. I have pointed out here to the air service that this is the time when every journey could be made pay by arranging to have commodities at call to fill up the vacant spaces in the passenger planes when they fly light.</P>
    <P>The time has come when those who are in control of the development and future of the air services should have a little more vision, a little more advertence to the national situation and not concern themselves solely with what is obligatory upon them because of international associations, and so forth.  This is a small country and when air services were first discussed <Col N="1527" /> by the Government of the day, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce and who was the father of all this development, pointed out we could not get into world competition with ordinary shipping, that we were too late, but we could get into competition with the world with air services.  We were in time for that.  As Deputy Cosgrave has rightly pointed out, we have in this country without doubt persons who, whether pilots or officers of the comapny, are equal in competence, intelligence and efficiency to those in similar occupations in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>In order to make our services grow and grow rapidly and at the same time help the development of industry in relation to which exports are vital, let the air services concern themselves with the unlimited possibility of the development of air freight as distinct from passenger-carrying services which are limited to a rather small growth and limited also by conditions and circumstances as they change from day to day due to world situations, weather and also to changes in the minds of people as to whether they want to be tourists.</P>
    <P>We cannot guarantee that there will be an ever-growing stream of passengers coming to this country year after year but we can lay the foundations for constant shipment of goods, knowing that we have these items, that there are markets for them and that the only thing that stops their being sold abroad is the difficulty of meeting a freight charge.</P>
    <P>It is possible for us to export to America ordinary items like fresh eggs.  They could be put on board a plane either at Collinstown or Shannon and be on the tables of those who want to eat them the next day in the United States.  What is the air freight charge today?  It is 2/4d. a lb.  I would ask the Minister to give the air company a bit of a shake up with a suggestion that they might meet to talk seriously with those who are concerned with the development of exports rather than be as difficult as they are in saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" />&ldquo;Here are our rates.  These are in accordance with I.A.T.A.  We have no further interest in or consideration to give the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is now some four or five years since I first began to investigate this question.  I urge the Minister to accept what I have said in the spirit in which I have given it and to put it to the authorities concerned that they should do something now about this whole problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill but when I saw that the Minister for Transport and Power was introducing it, I was interested.  I am interested in anything the Minister for Transport and Power does.  I do not want a day to come when I or any Deputy will put down a question regarding Aer Lingus or Aerlínte or Aer Rianta, Teoranta or, maybe, when we get out to the Airport and look at the planes and they bring us down to earth and we see &ldquo;Irish Air Lines,&rdquo; and the Minister for Transport and Power will rise and in his usual form say that it is not his function.</P>
      <P>I notice in Section 3 (1) the phrasing is &ldquo;sums (not exceeding in the aggregate one million pounds), as the Company may from time to time request.&rdquo; I have no doubt a company of this sort would need that kind of money.  I hope that when this Bill goes through and if the occasion arises for any Deputy to ask any question, he will be answered and that there will be no such thing as the Minister dodging the column.</P>
      <P>As regards Irish Air Lines, let me say for a start that I come from a city where we always looked abroad before ever there were airplanes.  I happened to notice that Deputy Briscoe said that when the present Taoiseach had it in mind to establish an airline, he said we were in time to get in, as far as the air services were concerned but we were not in time, evidently, as far as shipping is concerned.  That is not correct. Even though it has nothing to do with this Bill, that was the time when they could have got ships for £30,000 or £40,000 rather than pay £300,000 for heaps of scrap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have Irish Air Lines and we can be proud of the personnel of Irish Air Lines and of their <i>esprit de corps.</i>  They are a credit to us wherever they go.  When these balance sheets were so good, as the Minister read out in his brief some time ago&mdash; they were very good last year: £350,000&mdash;I think Irish Airlines or Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta or Aerlínte should not have been so tough as to put their pilots out on strike.  These people are worthy of better treatment.  As we all know, this is a newly-established business in this country.  Before I leave this end of it, I will say our personnel cannot be excelled by the personnel of any country; they might be equalled occasionally.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the air companies going into the hotel business.  It would be better for the Minister to reconsider this whole matter.  The Irish hoteliers have done a reasonably good job.  I have been travelling and staying in Irish hotels for longer than I care to remem ber and longer mayble than anybody is in the House.  I know a great deal and have experience of a great deal of the improvements hoteliers have made.  Now that they have made these improvements, I do not think it right that a State-sponsored company should go into competition with them in the three centres of Dublin, Cork and Limerick where we have airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned air freights.  I do not think Irish Air Lines are doing what carrying companies used to do in the matter of air freights, that is, railway and shipping companies. I have to mention these because of the comparison.  They operated for freights and in order to make sure that the freight would be offering, they sent out canvassing agents, especially in off-season times. <Col N="1530" /> I would recommend to the Minister and to the air companies that they should have canvassing agents.  They have their own means of estimating what their carrying capacity will be at various times.  Furthermore, knowing when the real off-season occurs, they go out and canvass various interests in the country, especially the fresh meat and fresh food interests.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that people in the fresh meat industry in this country have proved themselves to be pioneers in sending our fresh meat to the ends of the earth and in discovering markets we never knew existed.  If there were canvassing agents from the air companies at the appropriate times, it could prove very profitable in getting us as much as possible out of the squeeze of the rings formed by the various air companies.</P>
    <P>I am reminding the Minister now that if in the future, I or any other Deputy should ask him any question in relation to Irish Air Lines or Aer Lingus, or any of these air companies, I consider it to be his duty as a Minister of State who came before us and asked us to vote this money to answer our questions and not to duck out of it and say that it is a matter for the executive of Aer Lingus or the executive of any other portion of the company. It is good we have this company and it is good that when we are buying aircraft we should look to the United States and Great Britain because, as has been proved, they had good and suitable planes.  We should not be buying aircraft from countries which buy very little from us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to air a small complaint.  I am sorry the Minister did not make sufficient copies of his speech available to the few Deputies in the House to give us an opportunity of having the figures before us.  There are a number of figures, and substantial sums of money have been referred to.  I find it impossible to remember all the figures the Minister quoted during his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister comes to us looking for an increase in the capital of Aer Rianta from £10,000,000 to £13,000,000 is an indication of the <Col N="1531" /> activities of Aer Rianta and its offshoots, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, during the past two or three years.  It is only a short time ago, 1959, since the House sanctioned a very substantial increase in the capital&mdash;I hope I am correct in this sum&mdash;from £4,000,000 to £10,000,000 to cover the purchase of the jet aircraft for the transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill also coincides with the 25th anniversary of the establishing of Aer Lingus.  I think it is an appropriate moment to pay tribute to that company for the remarkable progress they have made in that quarter of a century.  Every one of us, irrespective of what doubts we may have had some years ago&mdash; certainly in the early year&mdash;about the feasibility and practicability of an Irish air line, would wish to pay tribute to the success of Aer Lingus and hope that in the quarter of a century ahead they will maintain their outstanding rate of progress.  Anyone who travels with Aer Lingus, irrespective of whether they are Irish or are outsiders visiting here, cannot speak too highly of the courtesy and efficiency of the national air line.  That is an enviable reputation which both the company and the staff would be anxious to maintain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Lynch touched on what I thought was a very important point.  That is, that in addition to the success which Aer Lingus and Aerlínte have achieved in the substantial increase in passenger traffic, they should make a greater drive to increase freight traffic.  I say this because we have had a good deal of talk recently, and particularly in the last day or two, about the emergence of a Free Trade Area in Europe. Irrespective of any estimates we might make as to the chances of our home industries surviving in the competitive era ahead, we would all agree that one thing we should be able to sell competitively outside is the produce from our 12 million acres of arable land, whether by way of meat or other forms of agricultural produce, such as processed vegetables, butter, milk products, cheese and so on.</P>
    <P>If that is so, as I believe it to <Col N="1532" /> be, it is essential that we have a rapid and efficient means of carrying this produce from this country to the extremities of what would be eventually, I presume, a European trading area.  Now is the time to look ahead. Aer Lingus have shown commendable foresight in the past.  I hope they will show the same foresight in establishing now, while all these proposals for a Common Market and a Free Trade Area are under consideration, contacts and making arrangements to have available when the time comes the latest means of carrying on refrigerated air traffic to the various parts of the Continent we will want to serve with our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>In reply to a recent question of mine, the Minister referred to the difficulties standing in the way of bringing the air passenger rates between airports in the Twenty-Six Counties and Great Britain into line with the rates between Northern Ireland airports and British cities.  I understand the position is that air traffic between this country and Great Britain is treated as air traffic between two foreign countries, whereas air traffic between the Six Countries and Great Britain is treated as internal air traffic.  It is, possibly, a difficult situation from the Minister's point of view.  But, looking at it from the point of view of tourism and increasing air traffic between the two islands as such, it should be possible to do something to bring the two rates closer into line.  Certainly, we do operate at a substantial disadvantage at the moment compared with the air traffic between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It has always been my ambition that, instead of the terminus for the transatlantic air service ending as it does at Dublin Airport, it should end at the logical place, Shannon Airport.  I long wondered at the cost of bringing down the transatlantic Boeing jet at Shannon for a few brief minutes, during which the passengers cannot avail of the advantages of purchasing at the duty-free shop, then bringing this very expensive aircraft into the air again and landing it a quarter of an hour <Col N="1533" /> or 20 minutes later at Dublin Airport. It would seem that the more efficient arrangement would be to have the service terminate at Shannon, to have the turnabout there, and to have the normal Aer Lingus services connect Shannon not only with Dublin but with London, Paris and other cities. Possibly I am motivated by certain selfish considerations in suggesting that, but it does seem to me that it would save considerable expense if that arrangement were come to. Furthermore, it would ensure that instead of the transatlantic planes being serviced at Dublin, they would be serviced at Shannon.  That would give considerable employment in the south-west, where it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's figures showed a very substantial increase in the number of passengers carried on Aerlínte.  We should not forget that that increase is concurrent with a very substantial decrease in the number of passengers carried by other air lines which now either overfly Shannon or call there much less frequently than previously. The result has been a very steep drop in the sales of the duty-free shop at Shannon, which has shown a steady decline over the past three years.  Possibly, this cannot be helped.  I know the Minister's predecessor, the present Taoiseach, took the point of view that if we did not cater for what is described as the Irish-American air traffic the danger was that this traffic would be taken to London, Paris or elsewhere and some arrangement made to ferry them back to Dublin or Shannon, and that arrangement would be so unsatisfactory that there would be a complete falling off in air traffic between the United States and this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is a valid argument. I am not sufficiently versed in transatlantic air traffic to give an opinion.  Certainly, from the point of view of Shannon, the greater the number of landings there, the greater the number of passengers who embark or disembark there, the greater the number of people who purchase goods in the duty-free shop, the better for the airport and for the citizens who live <Col N="1534" /> in Limerick, or Ennis, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Aer Lingus have investigated the possibilities of developing an air ferry service between Great Britain and this country?  Perhaps the distance is too short and the cost too heavy but, as we do not seem to be able to make any inroads into the monopoly that controls the cross-Channel trade between ourselves and Britain by sea, it behoves us to do everything we can to bring as many people and as much goods as we can by air from Great Britain to this country and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>In spite of what I think some of the other speakers have said, I believe Aer Lingus has done a considerable amount of work to encourage tourists to come to this country and I think their offices, in various parts of the Continent, certainly, and in New York and other United States cities have been in the nature of tourist bureaux. I am quite certain they could do more and, if so, I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to get them to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; this country to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>Comments have been made on the desirability or otherwise of Aerlínte investing funds in the development of these new hotels in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I join with other speakers in having some doubts as to the desirability of a State-sponsored company competing in what, up to now, has largely been left to private enterprise or to the private enterprise system with the aid of State funds.  The Minister will probably reply that there are certain areas of the country still short of hotel accommodation and would probably point to the Limerick area as one of these.  But it is a fact that at present very substantial and extensive alterations and additions&mdash;in some cases complete rebuilding programmes &mdash;are being carried out to Limerick hotels.  I ask the Minister to have regard to that when considering investing substantial State sums or funds of State-assisted companies in a branch of activity so far carried on by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Taking it by and large there is, no doubt, still room for improvement in the standard of hotel accommodation <Col N="1535" /> in this country.  We are making substantial progress and, generally speaking. I think the hotel industry is alive to the necessity of improving hotels and bringing them more into line with those in other countries but that takes time and a good deal of capital.  The accumulation of capital by private enterprise, as I am sure the Minister will agree, is an extremely difficult thing especially in the case of a private or family-owned hotel which has been, perhaps, in the same family for two or three generations.  It is difficult to get capital and I think every opportunity and concession should be given to the hotels to develop the industry themselves, if necessary with State aid.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in the forecast I am now going to make but I think before the end of two years the Minister or possibly his successor will be coming back to the House to seek to increase again very substantially the capital of Aer Rianta. One thing about air traffic is that you are either in it or not.  Once we made the decision to go into transatlantic air traffic and stay in it it is obvious that we must be prepared to vote very substantial funds indeed.  If we are to judge from the reports one reads from time to time the development of air traffic is going ahead very rapidly and, within a few years' time, people will be talking in terms of supersonic planes crossing the Atlantic in two or three hours.  If we are to keep up in this race this House should realise that it will be a very expensive business and some future Minister for Transport and Power will not be coming to this House for an increase of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 but perhaps for an increase of £20,000,000 or £30,000,000.</P>
    <P>In assessing the value of our investment in transatlantic air traffic, I think we should have regard to the investment in terms of employment for our people and also in regard to other business outlets where sums of that size might perhaps be better invested.  Personally, I have always been a believer in air traffic.  I think <Col N="1536" /> the success of Aer Lingues is an indication that we can do the job.  The only doubt, if I might express a doubt, is in the country's financial capacity to stay in what is a very expensive race.  However, we are in it now and I think we must stay in it.  The Minister's technical advisers and those connected with Aer Rianta and its subsidaries are the best judges as to what the future cost of these developments is likely to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard anybody in this country express anxiety or apprehension in regard to Aer Lingus. I think everybody wanted to see Aer Lingus established and to rejoice in its success.  I can with a clear conscience say that I have travelled by many air lines and none provided a better service than Aer Lingus.  I suppose I have travelled as much by air in foreign countries, in five Continents, as any other Deputy.  I have never found any other air line to provide a superior service to that provided by Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>One feature of our service has often struck me and that is that the pilots of Aer Lingus seem to be able to bring down an aeroplane with less bumping than pilots of any other aeroplane on which I have travelled.  That is a very important thing.  Taking off and coming down are often serious ordeals for people not familiar with air travel and one of the most remarkable features of Aer Lingus is the skill with which that important business is transacted by our pilots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as one who has flown on many air lines all over the world, including most of the great American air lines, British air lines and Air France, I have often been struck by that peculiar feature and I patiently await, in all the flights I have made by Aer Lingus one bump on coming down such as I have frequently met on other air lines, and I have yet to experience it.  Bumpless travel would not be sufficient justification for an airline, but apart from the outstanding performance of our pilots, there is the general standard of comfort and atmosphere associated with Aer Lingus which I have not <Col N="1537" /> found excelled in any air service I have used.  The financial results of Aer Lingus show the fruits of that distinguished service which they provide. It is very important that we should be clear in our minds on the distinction between Aer Lingus, Aerlínte and Aer Rianta which are three distinct units, or ought to be.  I notice, however, in the Minister's statement a tendency, which I have often noticed before, and that is, to start to mix them all up at suitable moments for the purpose, I am afraid, of confusing the public mind.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand the position, Aer Lingus is doing remarkably well, considering the competition it has to meet on the European air routes it services and in that I include Dublin, London and other English cities.  Aerlínte, I understand, operate the transatlantic service and Aer Rianta is the holding company which finances both operating companies.  We should bear in mind for the future when examining these figures that the operating results of these airlines, Aerlínte and Aer Lingus, are one thing, but we cannot dismiss the fact that the operating costs of these airlines carry no charge in respect of the costs of Shannon Airport itself.</P>
    <P>According to an answer furnished by the Minister for Transport and Power on 9th February this year, the expenditure on Shannon Airport, which included capital expenditure on the provision of buildings, facilities and equipment, total operation of facilities and interest on capital and depreciation and pension liability, amounted to £13.789 millions.  For the same period, the total receipts amounted to £4.976 millions.  When you examine these figures more closely, the capital expenditure for providing building and equipment amounts to £4.1 millions; the total operating costs of facilities amount to £5.7 millions; the interest on capital expenditure and depreciation amounts to £3.5 millions and pension liability to £.3 millions.  The total revenue, including landing fees, rents, concession fees and profit on catering and sales at the Airport amounts to £4.9 millions.  That means there is a net deficit on that account of £8.8 millions <Col N="1538" /> up to and including 9th February, 1951.  We have to bear that aspect of the situation in mind when we consider the situation of Aerlínte because these figures I have quoted have no connection whatever with Aer Lingus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy for a moment, it would be hardly fair to him to measure receipts against total costs.  There is a loss which represents the failure to pay depreciation and interest on capital.</P>

      <P>To date, the operating cost of facilities is £5.76 millions.  The total receipts, including landing fees, rents, concession fees and profit on catering and sales at the Airport are £4.9 millions, so that, on the operating of the Airport, there is a deficit of £800,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above that, there is a large capital sum outstanding which represents over-investment in the Airport which has to be borne in mind when reviewing the operations of Aerlínte.  What I want to emphasise particularly is that these figures I quoted have no reference at all to Aer Lingus which operates from Collinstown and has only the remotest association, if any, with Shannon Airport. I can never fully understand why those using the Airport at Shannon cannot be required at least to meet the operating costs of the Airport.  I imagine a great deal of bluff goes on naturally, in which the large American and British operators threaten to overfly the Airport but I often wonder if to-morrow morning they were told we were going to close down Shannon Airport, how long the bluff would last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Airport has operated to save the lives of thousands of passengers and the fate of many aircraft because it was available to serve as an emergency landing.  It is much closer to the transatlantic routes than any other landing place with comparable facilities. <Col N="1539" /> I cannot believe that transatlantic operating companies could, with equanimity, contemplate the disappearance of Shannon as it would so very substantially add to the normal hazards of the services they operate.  I am quite convinced they would be prepared to pay a very liberal premium to insure against its disappearance.</P>
    <P>As I see the situation at present, we are providing capital investment of £13.798 millions and we are getting the advantage of that for our own three jet aircraft and we are getting the landing fees and the diminishing yield of catering and sales, but I feel we should be able to derive from the total volume of transatlantic traffic using that Airport sufficient to meet the total cost of its operation.  It has always been a mystery to me why we cannot.  Sooner or later, this House must face the facts about transatlantic traffic as operated by an Irish company and in a statement of this kind, it is a silly thing, for which I rebuke the Minister, to run away from the facts and to try to cloak them.</P>
    <P>I now formally charge him with doing that.  He tells us very properly in paragraph 8 of his statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think it would be well for me to give the House a brief outline of the results, financial and otherwise, achieved by the carrying Companies &mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte&mdash;during the past two years.  In the financial year ended 31st March, 1960, Aer Lingus had an operating surplus of about £170,000 and in the six months ended 30th September, 1960, the operating surplus was £310,000.</P>
    <P>That is clear and comprehensive, but now read the next paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The financial accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st March 1961, are not yet available but I understand that the airline as a whole&mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte&mdash; taking both the transatlantic and European sectors together will have a modest surplus for that year.</P>
    <P>That is an astonishing change.  At a certain point we are told the results of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, and while <Col N="1540" /> we are in that mood, having heard of the handsome surplus on the part of Aer Lingus, we come upon the Delphic phrase: &ldquo;The financial accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st March, 1961, are not yet available&rdquo; but the Minister understands &ldquo;that the airline as a whole&mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte&mdash;taking both the transatlantic and European sectors together &mdash;will have a modest surplus for that year.&rdquo; If the Minister had the information on which to base that judgement, presumably he had corresponding information with regard to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.</P>
    <P>Later in his statement, after giving the statistics of the number of passengers carried by Aer Lingus, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the year ended the 31st March, 1961, Aerlínte carried 35,176 passengers, an increase of 51 per cent. or 11,898 passengers on the 1959-60 figure.  The total amount of cargo carried was 244 tons which was two and a half times more than the amount carried in 1959-60.  The amount of mail carried was 49 tons, an increase of 11 per cent. on the 1959-60 figure.  The Aerlínte financial results for the twelve months ended 31st March, 1960, showed that there was an operating loss of £589,080 for that year, compared with an operating loss of £788,599 for the eleven months ended 31st March, 1959.  The accounts for the six months ended 30th September, 1960, showed an operating surplus of £143,000 compared with a deficit of £286,000 in the same period of 1959.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the last three months of the financial year 1960/61 the Company operated its own Boeing jet aircraft and it is the invariable experience that the Winter months are not as favourable as the Summer months.</P>
    <P>That is the strangest <i>non sequitur</i> I ever read.  He does not go on and tell us what he means by that, except to say: &ldquo;Neverthless the prospects of the Company are bright&rdquo; Oddly enough, having given us results up to the six months ending 30th September, <Col N="1541" /> he then jumps the three months between September to January, resumes the tale for January-March, 1961, and says that: 5,837 passengers as compared with 3,085, were carried comparing January-March, 1961, with January-March, 1960.  &ldquo;This trend is continuing and forward bookings are very promising,&rdquo; he says.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he has the information on which to forecast a modest surplus in the year for those two companies, he must have corresponding information which will enable him to tell us approximately the surplus for Aer Lingus and the deficit for Aerlínte.  It would be much better to tell us that, than to give us that Delphic calculation.  How can one know that A plus B equals 10 if one does not know the value of A or B?  Can that make sense?  To know that A plus B equals 10, you must know what A or B are, because if you know what either A or B is, then, if A is unascertainable, the answer is that A amounts to 10 minus B, or if B is unascertainable, B equals 10 minus A.</P>
    <P>There is one thing certain: if the net result is a modest surplus or £10, you must have a corresponding loss-no more&mdash;in either one of the different constituent parts which have gone to make up the modest surplus.  From that proposition there can be no escape.  I suggest that it is self-deception for the Minister to pretend he does not know the value of A and B, if he can vouch to the House that the sum of them represents a modest surplus.</P>
    <P>I should like to be reassured on certain important matters.  Most of the airlines at present are throwing heavy emphasis on their ability, with modern jet aircraft, to travel direct from the begining of the journey to the end.  Reading international advertisments for Pan-Am, T.W.A., Air France, the Dutch and the Scandinavian combines, it is noticeable that they state their ability to travel from Rome to New York, Paris to New York or London to New York in one stage.  Great emphasis is laid upon that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> Are we in a position, with the equipment we now have, to give a corresponding unqualified guarantee in respect of the Shannon-New York and the New York-Shannon trip, that in all the circumstances our equipment can make the journey in one stage?  I saw recently that President Kennedy, when returning on a military aircraft from Paris, stopped at Gander to ensure that before his arrival in Washington, he would get a night's sleep, before he embarked upon the dull grind of his presidential duties.  I cannot imagine anyone going to Gander.  I was there once and I could not rest until I got out of it because one manages to suffer from claustrophobia in one of the most exposed spots of the world, surrounded by forests and tundra.  It is a most desolate spot.  I should like to be reassured by the Minister that we are in the position, with the equipment we have acquired, to make the flight from Shannon to Boston or New York without the necessity for any intermediate stop arising, through the necessity for re-fuelling or activities of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is no use in pretending, and I do not want to pretend, that I share the view that once you have taken a gamble, you are in it and cannot get out of it.  I did not believe that our entry into the transatlantic air war was a wise or prudent enterprise. I still do not believe it was. I am quite certain that Aer Lingus was not only wise, but I never doubted our capacity to build up that service into something that would equal, or excel, any corresponding service in Europe.  I think all our resources should be mustered and deployed to keep the service of Aer Lingus in the forefront of international aeronautics. We have the personnel to do that; we have the facilities, and there is no reason at all why we should fall behind in the race.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to transatlantic transport is quite another cup of tea.  We are a small country with a population of under 3,000,000.  As Deputy Russell pointed out, it is common knowledge that, in the course of the next decade, the type of aircraft necessary to operate up-to-date transatlantic <Col N="1543" /> services will change progressively and the capital burden will grow. We are already taking very heavy losses on this traffic.  I doubt if we will ever break even on it.  Mark you, the equipment we now have is as up-to-date as that of any airline in the world.  I think the Boeing 707 we are operating is as up-to-date a machine as any airline in the world is in a position to put in the sky.  In five years' time we will be in a radically different situation.</P>
    <P>Goodness knows I am not an expert on transport problems but, if we are going to operate a transatlantic service, our minimum equipment must be three machines because we will have to keep two operating in order to maintain the schedule.  In peak periods it may be requisite to operate three.  One thing we have got to have is a standby because in modern circumstances, if people book jet aircraft depending on its time schedule and its amenity, one simply cannot offer an entirely different kind of transport in the event of one of our jet aircraft being temporarily withdrawn from service for normal servicing operations.  Therefore we must face the fact that a minimum of three aircraft is requisite to maintain a transatlantic schedule.  The capital cost of that will be gigantic and it seems to be true&mdash;though this is a matter again of technical detail&mdash;that as the capital cost of these aircraft grows, their passenger capacity must grow with it, because a very high occupancy is absolutely essential in order to attempt to break even with capital cost and the minimal provision for depreciation requisite for maintaining the service.</P>
    <P>The situation as I see it is, therefore, that we have Aer Lingus growing, expanding profitably, justifying itself most comprehensively, providing a service which is in every respect excellent, financing the capital invested in it and generally doing an admirable job.  With Aerlínte we have a service which, I understand, is quite excellent.  We have a splendid personnel.  At the moment we have excellent aircraft, but we are taking staggering losses.  Now no one must find fault with that if that merely represents the initial stages of getting into the picture, blazing the trail.  The <Col N="1544" /> problem is: are we not faced with a situation in which the evolution will be that the more irrevocably we are committed to that venture the heavier our capital costs will become and the more staggering will be our losses, to a point ultimately at which Aer Lingus would be quite unable to meet, as the Minister suggests it has met in the past year, the deficit of the sister company, Aerlínte?</P>
    <P>I would far sooner see the profit of Aer Lingus ploughed back into Aer Lingus so that, as well as keeping abreast of what the others offer, we can be a step ahead of them.  Mark you, I think we can be, but I do not think Parliament wants Aer Lingus to pay a profit to the Treasury.  I think Oireachtas Éireann would cheerfully see Aer Lingus use its annual surpluses for servicing its capital and improving its facilities.  We might as well face it: it is one of those awkward facts that, in respect of certain services, such as transport, power and light, State-operated enterprises, once they come off, can use their surpluses to improve their services.  They have no dividends to pay.  We are adopting the strange device here that, having developed this admirable service, we are now driven into the position in which the entire surplus, which might be used to keep Aer Lingus away in front of all competition, will be poured into Aerlínte, which may well be starting a race that it can never win.</P>
    <P>Think on what Aerlínte means. We are now operating between New York, Boston and Ireland.  T.W.A., Pan-Am., B.O.A.C. and Trans-Canada, all these lines, are operating not only from their capital to New York&mdash;that is only half their journey&mdash;but right across the United States.  If they can tap Chicago, Salt Lake, San Francisco, and all the points in between, for traffic they have got an immense initial advantage over us.  But nobody has corresponding advantages over us in regard to our Aer Lingus operations. We have been able to run services to any point in Britain or Europe where it suits us to do so.  We have been able to try out routes to see if there is a demand and, when it proved there was not, to drop them without any crippling expenditure at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> I rejoice to learn&mdash;I am astonished the Minister has not seen fit to mention it here today&mdash;that Aer Lingus is at present investigating the possibility of the acquisition of jet aircraft of medium size so that we can move over to provide jet services on the European lines.  I think that is an admirable development.  It is made possible by the splendid services that Aer Lingus is operating.  That is the kind of progress and development I welcome.  I should love to have it to tell that Aer Lingus was providing an all-jet service on these intermediate routes before any other air company in the world.  I think the publicity value of that would be invaluable.  I think that, if we were in a position to say in respect of services between Great Britain and every other country, Aer Lingus was one jump ahead, blazing the trail, the advantage would be incalculable from the point of view of attracting passengers who would prefer Aer Lingus services.  They would be coming with their hats in their hands to a company like Aer Lingus which had acquired the reputation of always being in front of progress, so that they would have it to tell that Aer Lingus, which was notorious for investing a large amount of capital in its services, having surveyed the whole field, had chosen their aircraft. That is the kind of thing that is valuable publicity, not only from the point of view of attracting custom but also from the point of view of getting advantageous terms from the suppliers of aircraft.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there may be force in the argument to which Deputy Russell referred.  I believe he said he understood the Taoiseach was apprehensive that if we did not operate from Shannon other airlines would by-pass Shannon, that unless we operated this service others would not bother to call. Others are not bothering to call.  When Shannon was first built, of course, every transatlantic service called at Shannon as the first point of call.  It is notorious that the vast majority of the Continental services and services to London are by-passing Shannon every day but I very much doubt if any of them would face with equanimity the disappearance of Shannon, as I have already said.  I believe it would be possible to keep <Col N="1546" /> Shannon operating without getting ourselves involved in this staggering cost which we are meeting and which Deputy Russell envisages may grow as our obligations to maintain larger and larger jet aircraft arise in the effort to maintain our place in the transatlantic travel field.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised also that in seeking further capital the Minister did not take the opportunity of dealing in greater detail with the prospects of freight traffic.  I remember saying in this House 15 years ago, just after the war, that with the situation which was developing then, the long-term prospects of Shannon were extremely ambiguous because, with the capacity in aircraft to travel much greater distances non-stop, their tendency to come down at Shannon would grow less and less but that I recalled that the port of Hamburg and the port of Rotterdam had grown great on <i>entrepót</i> trade, especially the port of Hamburg, and that it appeared to me that in the new world to which we were moving it was not inconceivable that you could shove back <i>entrepót</i> trade from the west coast of Continental Europe to the west coast of Ireland.  I also said that it seemed that it ought to be possible to bring bulk freight into Shannon and by providing adequate facilities there to persuade people to break the bulk there and to distribute to the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>That proposal was then derided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is now the Taoiseach as being of relative insignificance, not important to the main purpose of maintaining Shannon Airport in being. I expressed the view then that it was the only hope in the long term of permanently maintaining Shannon as a viable airport.</P>
    <P>I still believe that that prospect has never been adequately investigated.  It is something on which it would be legitimate to take a formidable gamble. It would be a considerable gamble but at least it would have this quality about it that it would be a once-and-for-all gamble, with a limited cost which you would have to stake in the full knowledge that you might lose it but, if you lost it that would be the end of your loss because if you were going to make Shannon into an effective <Col N="1547" /><i>entrepót</i> port you would have to examine the whole range of merchandise passing into the Continent of Europe from outside at the present time and provide a complete storage capacity for every variety of traffic that is passing through the ports of Hamburg and Rotterdam at the present time.</P>
    <P>That would involve very heavy capital cost.  Much of that capital cost would be in the provision of refrigeration and obscure forms of storage and accommodation which you would have to realise might never be used but, if you wanted to acquire for the port the kind of reputation that Hamburg and Rotterdam have, that is, that they can handle anything, whatever the complications may be, you would have to start right from the bottom up and provide all that kind of accommodation at Shannon on a scale adequate to cover any possible development of air transport of that character, say, for a period of ten years ahead.</P>
    <P>If we did that, we would have something which, as I say, would be a limited risk and which would have some prospect of paying a magnificent dividend if it came off.  If it came off, it would have the immense added advantage that it would become a self-supporting enterprise because its surpluses, which are to be measured, remember, by the phenomenal wealth of ports like Rotterdam and Hamburg, could be ploughed back into expanding the facilities and amenities at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Let me be clear.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that a bulk of goods comparable with that which passes through Hamburg or Rotterdam can ever in our lifetime be anticipated as passing through an airport because the range of goods for which air transport is suitable is very much more restricted than the range of goods being carried by sea to Hamburg and Rotterdam but Hamburg and Rotterdam have grown infinitely great as compared with all other European ports because they are in the <i>entrepót</i> trade and have acquired that reputation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> If you want to go into France a great majority of people will go in through Rotterdam rather than in through Marseilles because the distribution facilities are at Rotterdam.  If you want to go into Continental Europe a great majority of people will go in through Hamburg rather than go on to Gdynia or some of the more accessible ports even further east because they have the facilities for redistribution.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  They, of course, depend largely on their rail facilities in addition to the extraordinary docks system they have built up.  The advantage of air transport is that there are not any rails associated with aeroplanes.  They can fly direct to the distribution centre.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there is a risk in that but I believe the burden of that transhipment could be shared with Aer Lingus and might very conceivably provide very profitable occupation for certain surplus equipment that Aer Lingus must carry in order to meet the possibility of momentary breakdowns or servicing of aircraft.  While at the present stage servicing equipment may be required to stand part of its time idle, if there were such a development at Shannon it could be mobilised to assist in the distribution of the broken cargoes that would originate from Shannon Airport.  I still believe that is a possibility.  I admit freely it is something that would have to be examined by experts.  I doubt if it has ever got the consideration which is its due.</P>
    <P>On this occasion when the Minister for Transport and Power is seeking to raise more capital, which I think is capital not only for Aer Lingus or Aerlínte but for Aer Rianta&mdash;and in fact Aer Rianta is, for the purpose of this Bill, the company&mdash;I am surprised he did not tell us something about the development of the factories at Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I did not elaborate on that is that the Estimate will be coming up in about three weeks' time.  The question of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is not really germane to this Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1549" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that goes to the very heart of our difference about this. The important thing is to keep our eyes on the available traffic.  I sometimes think the Minister's principal concern is to keep his eyes on the aircraft and the more excitement being created by them, the better pleased he is.  I like to see nice aircraft flying about in the sky but I like to ask myself what is in them because of the painful experience we already had on which I elaborated to the House.  I should not like to see Aer Lingus which I believe has a great future suffer because of the activities of its more profligate sister.  I cannot but feel that in his heart of hearts the Minister has a soft corner for the houri of this company, whereas the respectable dowager and honest-living woman has little or no appeal for him.  I have a more conservative approach to this matter.  I like the honest woman who is going about her lawful occasions. Although the other may have a more attractive exterior, I should like to know what the cost is.  It is time to ask ourselves the question: can we afford to keep her any more?</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the prospects of traffic, whence it is to come.  If the Minister had been in a position to tell us today that there was a great pool of traffic generating in the Shannon Free Airport and that that would help Aerlínte in the years that lie ahead, I would have been very much relieved in mind.  When one comes to examine the figure and assess how important passenger traffic is to the success or failure of the transatlantic service, one realises that traffic is the thing that matters.</P>
      <P>As I understand the position, Aerlínte is carrying relatively little freight from Shannon.  I understand it is another company altogether that is serving Shannon Free Airport for the bulk of its freight transport.  Which Deputies know what airline carries the freight from Shannon Free Airport?  Is there not some airline called Western Seaways or something like that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they are <Col N="1550" /> carrying the bulk of the freight. Suppose they stopped in the morning serving Shannon, could Aerlínte take up the load?  Are our aircraft designed for the purpose?  I do not know.  We have three Boeings which carry passengers. I know the passenger liners carry passengers and freight.  I do not know whether the Boeing airliners can do so.  Perhaps the Minister did not deal with the output of the Shannon Free Airport or with the Shannon trading position because it is not relevant to the affairs of Aerlínte and Aer Lingus but it would have helped us if he had said even that much.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the overall finances of Aerlínte.  Secondly, I want to go on record as saying that I cannot agree with Deputy Russell that anybody has felt apprehension about Aer Lingus. Most of us foresaw that Aer Lingus had a bright future, that it was something in which it was wise and essential to invest our money and which most of us have felt has amply justified itself since it was established.  I join with Deputy Russell in offering them our congratulations on the silver jubilee of their establishment.  I join with him in congratulating them on having retained in their ranks some of the distinguished personnel who have been with them from the very beginning and who have reflected glory on the company which had the privilege of employing them.  I congratulate them on their performance and it may gratify them to know that everyone in the House looks upon Aer Lingus as an organisation of which this country may be proud.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister specifically whether we can meet confidently the challenge of other airlines in providing, travelling both east and west, a direct flight from Shannon to Boston or New York without being forced to make a refuelling stop at any intermediate point.  I should like the Minister to say when he comes to conclude what are the figures on which he bases the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> The financial accounts of the company for the year ended 31st March, 1961, are not available but I understand that the airlines as a whole&mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte &mdash;taking both the transatlantic and European sectors together, will have a modest surplus for that year.</P>
    <P>If I describe the revenue of Aer Lingus as A and that of Aerlínte as B and their sum as the modest sum to which the Minister referred, would he give us the corresponding amount of the items A and B for the period he mentioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself substantially in agreement with the point of view that Deputy Dillon has expounded to the House.  We all realise that in modern conditions an air company must expand.  It is also necessary for the Irish airlines, if they are to stay in the race today, to modernise their equipment.  They have not only to modernise their equipment every four or five years but they have continuously to be able to put modern aircraft on the lines so as to keep themselves in the position they are in already.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further I should like to pay a tribute to Aer Lingus.  It is not a very powerful or wealthy corporation as compared with other corporations carrying out services throughout Europe but it has given, right from the beginning, a magnificent service. They are noted particularly for their caution.  I know myself, having flown by Aer Lingus a good deal, that they never take the slightest risk, even at the expense of holding passengers up in airports which is not a popular thing to do.  They always do it if there is the slightest doubt one way or the other.  They have also managed to produce a safer service and to have a public record of which every Irish person no matter where he or she may be can be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think it is rather unfortunate that Aer Lingus, in showing a sizable profit for giving such a magnificent service, finds itself in the position <Col N="1552" /> of having to support the losing member of the firm.  In their continental flights, B.E.A. have recently turned over to the more modern type of jet aircraft.  It is indisputable that we shall have to do the same.  I feel it would be quite possible for Aer Lingus to do that themselves on the existing capital and on the profits were it not that they have to support the losing member of the firm.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Taoiseach, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was responsible for introducing the Bill.  One of his main arguments was that unless we produce our own line from Shannon Airport we would lose the trade that was in existence there and that we might even lose Shannon Airport altogether as it was going to be over-flown by jet aircraft.  Again, I find myself substantially in agreement with previous speakers that there was never any question of the great airlines of the world permitting Shannon Airport to go.  Shannon Airport is perhaps one of the greatest safeguards that the transatlantic alliance have at present.  Never more than a month or so goes by that one does not open a paper and find that some lame duck has limped into Shannon Airport on maybe two or three engines. The existence of Shannon Airport is a safeguard to these flights.</P>
    <P>Were it ever necessary, as it never will be, to consider the closing down of Shannon Airport, the other airlines would come forward and if necessary subsidise it to keep it in existence. Therefore, I do not think it was a reasonable argument for the present Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make in favour of opening this line.</P>
    <P>No matter how the Minister glosses over it as he did rather quickly and rather astutely in his speech, the fact is that Aer Lingus, with all its efficiency and all it has done to build up its high prestige, is carrying the other airline on its back.  It looks to me as if it will have to do so for the next few years.  Nobody will dispute that any State-controlled or State supported company such as Aer Rianta must, in order to keep in competition with the <Col N="1553" /> trend of events in the modern world of today, come to this House to look for money.  However, I should like to feel satisfied that this Dáil will not vote money to embark on tremendous expenditure to procure a lot more aircraft in order to expand the existing transatlantic line.  It may be desirable to keep that line in existence but I should like to feel that the greater portion of that money will be spent in maintaining Aer Lingus in the high position which it holds in the air services today.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3,000,000 approximately is the amount the Minister is looking for.  I think he has been singularly lacking in information to this House as to what the actual expenditure will be. The only real information we have had from him is that the air company proposes to go into a hotel venture.  I cannot help feeling that the best motto is &ldquo;Everyone for his own job&rdquo;.  An air company knows nothing about hotels.  It is true that some of the other wealthier corporations have started hotels in different places.  There does not seem to be any particular indication in the wide earthly world why a State company should expand its capital, one of the reasons being to provide a hotel service.  At one time we had a hotel service in this country by a State or semi-State sponsored body &mdash;Bord Fáilte&mdash;which should know a certain amount about that type of project.  It proved a dismal failure.  The hotels were sold, many of them at a loss.</P>
    <P>Probably some of our colleagues on the other side will say that this side of the House was responsible for that venture.  That may be.  However, all things on that side are not always successful either.  I am drawing the parallel to show that the Minister by this scheme is walking the company into something which they are not competent to carry out.  They have not the authority or the facility or the knowledge to do so nor do I think it is wise or sensible for them to enter into that project.  There might be an argument in favour of having some form of hotel, if private enterprise were not prepared to produce it, in the region or vicinity of Shannon Airport but the <Col N="1554" /> idea of the Air Company putting up hotels in Cork and Dublin seems nothing short of ludicrous.  I suggest the Minister should abandon that project altogether.</P>
    <P>I spoke of my appreciation of Aer Lingus.  There is one criticism I should like to make and it is a criticism I make from personal experience.  Up to some months ago, the Aer Lingus terminus in Dublin was in Cathal Brugha Street which lies adjacent to the main bus routes. It lies adjacent to several taxi ranks where it is possible for incoming passengers to procure transport.  Quite a lot of people who come into Dublin have never been in this country before and know nothing whatsoever of the city.  They have no idea how to get anywhere or to go to any place.  The position that obtains at present is that they are brought to the bus terminus at the Busarus which is away from the central bus routes of the city.  There is no taxi rank whatsoever there.  I have had personal experience of this on two occasions.</P>
    <P>I happened to come into Dublin on a Sunday evening by Aer Lingus and to be dumped at the Busarus. With me was a load of foreigners. I think I was the only Irish citizen in the group.  We stood there in the cold evening while an official blew a whistle for a taxi.  There was no bus to take anybody anywhere unless they wanted to travel to the remote parts of rural Ireland. This went on for quite a time.  About every ten minutes or so, a taxi turned up. Eventually, when I got out of the cold into a taxi, I shared it with a German because he could not get one.  He was going to one part of the city and I was going to another.</P>
    <P>I facilitated him because he was a non-national.  I asked the taxi-driver why we could not have a taxi outside so that we could walk over to it as in any other city.  He told me they were not allowed to stay there, that that was one of the regulations.  If that is one of the regulations, I suggest to the Minister he transfer the terminus from the Bus Station to some other place <Col N="1555" /> where incoming visitors will be facilitated. If the Minister looks at it from an unbiased point of view, he will see that one of the worst impressions that can be created on people coming to Ireland for the first time is to find they have to stand with their luggage on the side of the street for approximately a quarter of an hour.  That is what has happened in two instances.</P>
    <P>There is one other criticism I want to make.  It does not entirely concern Aer Lingus.  I ask the Minister as the Minister in charge to make representations on this matter to his colleague or to whoever may be responsible for it. I have noticed in travelling abroad that in numerous airports there is practically no customs control whatever.  I know the Minister does not make the customs control but I am asking him to make this representation to his colleague.  Many people come to this country, again for the first time.  They have travelled through Paris Airport and London Airport and they get through in quick time.</P>
    <P>Many Americans come here with quite a considerable amount of luggage, having travelled extensively throughout the world on these tours.  I have heard them complain of being held up for an unreasonable length of time and having every case opened.  I know the Minister and his Department are not responsible for it.  On several occasions, I and other Deputies have brought up this subject in the House and we have had no satisfaction.  If we Deputies cannot get satisfaction, perhaps if the Minister takes it up with his colleague, he will see that this unhappy state of affairs does not persist. I feel it is detrimental to air traffic coming into Ireland.</P>

      <P>In the last Air Navigation Bill we had in 1959, the share capital of Aer Rianta was increased from £2,000,000 to £8,000,000.  The bulk of that increase was to facilitate the purchase of the three jet aircraft for the Atlantic route.  On that occasion, we had a Second Reading speech from the Taoiseach, speaking, I assume, on behalf of the Minister for <Col N="1556" /> Industry and Commerce.  I trust the Minister will not consider what I am now about to say as a reflection on himself, because it is not intended as such, but in that speech we had much more information on Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta than is contained in the four-page speech of the Minister today. It is due to the House that we should have much more information than is contained in that speech.  We have had various measures containing proposals to spend sums ranging from £100,000 to £1,000,000 and there have been more detailed explanations of them than we have had on this.</P>
      <P>I agree that if the share capital of Aer Rianta is to be increased by £3,000,000, it does not necessarily mean that the Minister for Finance has to increase taxation to the extent of £3,000,000.  The important thing is that we are going to allow the further expenditure of £3,000,000 by a holding company called Aer Rianta.  I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to give us, in a little over a page, a report on the workings of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte over the past four years. Perhaps the Minister in his reply will give us much more information in justification of the proposal contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the 1959 Bill, replying to objections raised from various parts of the House, the Taoiseach said Aerlínte should be &ldquo;out of the red&rdquo; by 1960.  I think I have the actual quotation here.  At column 1311 of Volume 176 of the Dáil Debates, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>If it is likely that 87,500 people will want to fly to Ireland or from Ireland across the Atlantic in that year, how many can Aerlínte get, operating these propeller driven Super-Constellation aircraft? If the original Aerlínte estimate that they can get the transportation of that number proves correct, there is no question that Aerlínte will break level on its accounts in that year, and, indeed, I think it will be able to show a not inconsiderable revenue surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that is a forecast by the Taoiseach, and no one would tie him to a <Col N="1557" /> forecast he made in 1959 in respect of 1960.  But surely what the Minister has said in his speech cannot be represented as what the Taoiseach then described as &ldquo;a not inconsiderable revenue surplus&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister do not seem to justify the prophecy the Taoiseach made on that occasion.  I was one of many people doubtful about the success of a transatlantic air service.  Many of us who expressed doubts at that time were told we were unpatriotic.  However, I still have doubt at that time were told we were unpatriotic.  However, I still have doubts about the transatlantic air service, but, like other people, I find myself in this position: that the House, by a majority, decided to go ahead with this project and now it is nearly too late to turn back.  Much money has been expended on this venture.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing today that the capital of Aerlínte be further expanded by £3,000,000.  I do not know why we have decided to go into one of the most highly competitive businesses in the world.  We have no particular talent for running a transatlantic air service in which we are competing with countries with far greater resources than ours.  Here we are competing with countries that have been pioneers in flight and we expect to make a success of it.  If we do, well and good, but I am pretty doubtful that we will.</P>
    <P>All the evidence seems to point to the fact that while Aer Lingus has been successful, Aerlínte has not been particularly successful.  How far we are prepared to go is anybody's guess. This project has been encouraged by the present Government mainly for the sake of the tourist trade.  That is what the Taoiseach said in 1959 and the present Minister for Transport and Power stressed the importance of the American tourist in his speech today. I wonder do we overestimate the importance of the American tourist?  Do we under-estimate the importance and value of the British tourist?  When I say British tourist, I include, naturally, the tens of thousands of Irish people, particularly those from Britain, who visit this country every year.  Do we under-estimate the value of the tens of thousands of Irish people now in <Col N="1558" /> Britain who would dearly love to visit this country each year if cheaper facilities were provided for them?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us what proportion of tourists from the United States come through Shannon. I could not put a figure on it or attempt to do so but I know that many of the United States tourists&mdash;one could say American tourists because they also come from Canada&mdash;come through other ports, seaports, and through Dublin airport.  Many of the 35,000 people who go from Shannon to Boston and New York are also Irish citizens and the 35,000 who land at Shannon must contain a big proportion of people who go from this country to Boston and New York on ordinary business.  If this service is being retained merely to maintain in turn the American tourist industry I wonder if it is worth while?  If these people are going to visit Ireland they will do so whether they land in France, Belgium, Britain or any other European country.  The fact that we have a service to this country does not necessarily mean that we will get any more tourists than we would get in the ordinary course of events, that is, if they landed at some British or continental airport.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, to give him his due, made a very accurate forecast in 1959 when he said it was expected that about 87,500 people would travel from the United States of America across the Atlantic in 1960 and that it would be reasonable to assume that we would capture 40 per cent. of that trade.  I think 35,000 represents 40 per cent. of that figure but the Taoiseach was not entirely accurate when he attempted to forecast what they would mean in terms of cash because the loss, as stated in the Minister's speech, for the 12 months ended 31st March, 1960, was £589,080.  That does not coincide with the Taoiseach's forecast in July, 1959, when he said that the Aerlínte service should show a &ldquo;not inconsiderable revenue surplus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With small experience of Aer Lingus, I also pay tribute to that particular company for its efficiency and for the efficiency and service of its officials. I do not think the criticism that was <Col N="1559" /> brought to the attention of the Minister for Transport and Power by Deputy Esmonde was quite justified. It is a small point and not necessarily a blemish on the record of Aer Lingus. It would indeed add to the prestige and general efficiency of Aer Lingus if small things like that were rectified so that those who travel by Aer Lingus, when they arrive in the country, would maintain the high opinion they have of Aer Lingus and be impressed by the facilities that are available to them from the airport.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the British tourist potential.  I do not say that the Minister under-estimates it but I think it could be more fully exploited.  At present we have an airport in Dublin and at Shannon but for continental and cross-Channel travel the one most used is Dublin airport.  Very shortly, I assume, Cork airport will be open for traffic but from what parts of Britain and the Continent I do not know. Has the Minister ever considered the establishment of two or three other airports in other parts of the country such as Galway, Sligo, Tralee or Wexford?  Such a move in my opinion would do a tremendous amount for the tourist industry.  Those in Great Britain who want to travel to Ireland want to do so with the minimum trouble.  As it is, a traveller from London who wants to visit Mayo, for perhaps a week, does not think it worth while because he travels, possibly, by air to Dublin and then has to endure a very long journey across the midlands to Mayo or possibly down to the southern portion of the country.</P>
    <P>We could, I think, attract many more people as visitors if we had better air facilities for the benefit of places like Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway.  People in various parts of Britain would certainly be attracted in their thousands to visit their homes or friends in this country for short periods if they knew they could get to these places within a reasonable period of say, four or five hours as against the time they now have to spend travelling, of anything between 30 and 48 hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> I do not know the details of the financial tie-up between Aer Lingus and Aerlínte but I think an effort should be made to have the two companies run on their own, so to speak. Aer Lingus is a company which is earning general praise from the people of this country and from people abroad who have had occasion to use its services.  Aerlínte is another matter. Aerlínte is a company that has been described as being entirely dependent on Aer Lingus.  The House should therefore be informed as to the exact position of Aer Lingus and of Aerlínte.  I do not want to oppose the proposals in the measure now before the House but the House would be much more satisfied if the Minister in his reply answered the different questions put to him and gave us a little more information as to the details of expenditure in the general running of Aerlínte and the subsidiary companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken, I want to pay a tribute to Aerlínte on the magnificent progress it has made since its inception.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of pride to all Irish people to find that our first transatlantic airline should prove so successful in such a relatively short time.  It is in this frame of mind that the House is agreeable to the Minister asking it to vote what, by comparison with other State financial provisions, is a pretty formidable sum, but we are confident there is a future for our Irish airlines and, in particular, the first line that was established, Aer Lingus.  However, I do wish to say to the Minister that his request to the Irish taxpayer and the Irish investor to expand the investment in air traffic would meet with much more enthusiasm if he had met the ordinary people in relation to their proposals regarding surface transport with a little more understanding, and if he had provided those of our people who do not avail of air transport with the facilities they require, particularly in those parts of the country where he has eliminated the railways and where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, Sir.  May I repeat that the House is agreeable to providing this huge sum of money to the Minister.  We are in quite a co-operative frame of mind.  This Bill provides us with the opportunity of making a few comments in regard to this aspect of transport, the question of the expansion of our Irish airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only a few remarks I wish to make.  I wish to repeat the question Deputy Esmonde put when he asked who was responsible for the transfer of the city terminal from Cathal Brugha Street to Busarus and why was it done.  The experience which Deputy Esmonde had was one which I also had in relation to being dumped out at Busarus in the dark and having to go as far as Amiens St. Railway <Col N="1562" /> Station to secure a taxi for people who had no transport to take them from Busarus.</P>
    <P>My criticism is more for having introduced people to Ireland by means of the worst slums in Dublin in the approach to Busarus.  Why the bus could not, if it had to go to Busarus, come down Parnell Square and O'Connell Street when approaching the city, in view of the few buses which operate between the Airport and the city terminus, I cannot understand.  We know that in every capital where there is an airport, they go out of their way to provide a proper access to the city from the airport.  The approach we had to Cathal Brugha Street in the earlier days was infinitely more favourable than the present approach through Marlborough Street.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter which was first voiced today by Deputy Esmonde.</P>
    <P>Another matter is that many visitors have expressed their surprise to me that we had not indicated to them, on the flight over the Atlantic, what facilities were available in the shops at Shannon and that quite often it was only on their return journey, when possibly their exchequer was somewhat depleted, that they saw the opportunities there were for purchasing suitable souvenirs and very valuable gifts to bring back to America.  The opportunity should be availed of to see that proper notice is provided on the Aerlínte planes to indicate to the passengers the facilities available in the shops at Shannon.  Also, in regard to Aer Lingus&mdash;and this is a very small grouse&mdash;in order to keep some people's blood pressure down, it might be well if more than one of our national newspapers were provided on the planes.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express the concern there is in Cork city and county about the repeated delays in opening Cork Airport.  We know that on the last occasion it would appear at first glance there was a legitimate delay caused by the cement strike, but it is also true that Cork County <Col N="1563" /> Council are ahead of schedule in their part of the undertaking, the provision of proper access roads to the airport site.  This further delay has created much concern in the minds of those people in Cork city and county who have been awaiting the provision of an airport for so long.  I trust the Minister will ensure that there will be no further delays and that this airport in the southern capital will be provided in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned last evening, I had just given credit to the Minister for the tax remissions in his recent Budget, with particular reference to the reduction in the standard rate of income tax which I welcome, with every other taxpayer in the country.  I suggested that would be a useful means of encouraging private and personal enterprise and initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also commended the Minister's action in regard to the special concessions he has given, admittedly to persons in the higher income bracket. Contrary to the views expressed by some Deputies, I think that category covers many who have shown the greatest enterprise and initiative in advancing the country's interest, <Col N="1564" /> admittedly with their own.  It is only right that that section of the community should also be encouraged as well as every other section.  I went on to criticise the omission of the Minister in not giving what I regard as adequate incentives to corporate or company initiative and enterprise.  I suggested that in one instance at least the Minister had been guilty of a retrograde step to which I intended to refer later on in my contribution to the debate.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech, the Minister emphasised the absolute necessity for manufacturers to equip themselves with up-to-date plant and machinery, to modernise their buildings and have them fully staffed with efficient workers and technicians, if they hope to survive in the Free Trade Area which is now assumed to be advancing on us at a fairly rapid rate.  The Minister and the Taoiseach, and even more recently the Minister for Education and the Minister for Lands, have gone out of their way to emphasise, to industrialists in particular, the need for putting their plant into a competitive condition to face the very difficult trading position which obviously lies ahead.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these facts, I suggest to the Minister that the main emphasis in his Budget speech, apart from the welcome tax concessions and certain help which he has given in the way of social assistance, should have been on helping industrialists and manufacturers to help themselves.  To me, one of the most obvious ways of doing that is to enable the industrialist to retain in his business for further investment in it a greater proportion of his earned profit.  Under the present system, whether profits are retained in the industry or paid out to shareholders, they are subject to taxation. It might seem a revolutionary move, but I think it would be a worthwhile move for the Minister to absolve from taxation completely, profits ploughed back into the concern or the industry.  If that is too radical a step to take, the Minister could have given some special concession in the way of a reduced rate of taxation on profits <Col N="1565" /> retained in an industry for its further development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not seen fit to do that.  I suggest to him that, with the comparatively low return on capital in this country compared with other countries with which we will be competing in the fairly near future, it is an absolute necessity to allow manufacturers and industrialists the greatest possible use of their own capital to expand their factories and re-equip them for the competitive era with which we shall be faced, apparently, in the near future.  As I say, all these profits retained, as well as those paid out, are subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>If a firm earns, say, £10,000 and pays something like 40 per cent. in taxation, either through income tax or corporation profits tax, if that £4,000 happens to be required to purchase some essential item of machinery, it is necessary for the industry concerned to borrow that money from one of the commercial banks or to go to the Industrial Credit Corporation for it. To my mind, it would be a much simpler and more desirable procedure for the company to finance that type of development out of its own resources.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some concession in addition to the initial allowance at present given to purchasers of machinery and equipment. To a large extent, it is a deferred allowance only, and, to my mind, it would have been a practical step to substitute for the initial allowance an investment allowance, something on the lines at present operating in the United Kingdom.  Furthermore, I should like to see the Minister extending to non-industrial premises the same depreciation allowances as are applicable to industrial premises.  I refer to warehouses, offices and shops, and all those buildings which have to be renewed or repaired.  With the rising tempo in international competition, it is now more than ever necessary to encourage owners of that type of premises to renew and repair them. If they renew those premises or alter them substantially, their rateable valuation <Col N="1566" /> is increased and they must pay increased rates.  For that reason, it is necessary that there should be some effort to help them in another way, if they must bear that increased impost of local taxation.</P>
    <P>Up to now, corporation profits tax has been allowable as a deduction when a company is calculating its profits for income tax.  The Minister has decided that is not to be the case any longer.  With all due respect, I think that is a retrograde step.  I know the Minister has argued that by reducing the standard rate of taxation, he has offset his latest move not to allow corporation profits tax as an expense in the running of an industry.  I suggest that a concession offsetting the disallowance of C.P.T. as an expense is not a proper step to take.  If the Minister is giving a concession to industry, then he should give a clear-cut concession and not bring in something else to offset it.</P>
    <P>I think a very good case could be made for the abolition of corporation profits tax altogether.  It is a form of double taxation.  A firm pays income tax on its profits and then it pays corporation profits tax if its profits exceed £2,500.  Some years ago that limit used to be £10,000.  It was reduced to £2,500 and it has remained at that figure for a number of years. I think the time has come when that ceiling must be increased substantially. It is a form of penal taxation.  It is another form of taking profits away from a company or a manufacturing concern, profits which could be spent modernising and improving the concern. I hope the Minister will seriously consider making some concession in that regard.  It would be a valuable concession particularly to the smaller type of business of which there are large numbers throughout the country. As I have said <i>ad nauseam</i> in the past, these businesses find it extremely difficult in present circumstances to accumulate capital for development purposes.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the grant for the employment of industrial consultants was 50 per cent.  A few years ago the <Col N="1567" /> figure was reduced to 33 1/3 per cent., or one third.  Because of the necessity for modernising our industries, making them efficient, and bringing them up to date, I think it would be a worthwhile step to consider restoring that contribution from the Exchequer to 50 per cent.  Not all these industrial consultants have been a success.  We are all aware of that.  I am also aware, as I am sure the Minister is, that in a number of instances they have made very advantageous changes in a number of industries.  I think their employment should be encouraged. It would bear fruit in the long run.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two other points which I should like to mention. I should like to refer once more to the old reliable&mdash;death duties.  First of all, I should like to commend the Minister for the improvements he has made in the rates.  That is a practical step in the right direction.  I am sure the Minister shares my view that we should aim ultimately, if not at the complete abolition of death duties, at least at the raising of the limit in successive years.  There is another small matter to which the Minister might give his attention.  In the Budget he provided for an increase in the dependent relative allowance from £80 to £110.  This is an obvious logical step having regard, amongst other things, to the introduction of the old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to look into the present position in regard to the allowance for the income of a child in its own right.  That figure is at present £60 a year.  I think I am correct in saying it was originally £40. That was in 1920.  With the exception of one change over the last 40 years, the figure has remained at £60 a year. I suggest that now that the income tax allowance for a child has been brought up to £120 a year the allowance for a child's income in its own right should be adjusted accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget statement referred to the fact, and quite rightly so, that the level of taxation in this country is lower than in certain comparable countries which he instanced. <Col N="1568" /> I should like to suggest that it is not sufficient to have taxation lower.  Again, in order to accumulate sufficient capital for development, we must have a rate of taxation here substantially lower. A comparatively poor country, such as ours, cannot afford a rate of taxation comparable with that of a wealthy industrialised country, such as Great Britain, Belgium or Western Germany. Although our figure of some 23 per cent.  compares favourably with 25 per cent. in Great Britain, when one has regard to the individual incomes of companies or businesses, the comparison is still invidious.  It should be the aim of the Minister&mdash;of all Ministers for Finance&mdash;to concentrate on a regular reduction in the rate of taxation.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis the capacity of a country to produce wealth and ensure prosperity for its citizens depends on three things&mdash;education, investment of its capital, the efficient productive capacity of its manufacturing concerns and, above all else, of its people.  Every Minister for Finance should weigh his Budget with these three things in view. The Minister in his recent Budget has gone some of the way but, having regard to the points I have just mentioned, he might have gone a good deal further particularly in relation to giving more opportunities to manufacturers and companies to spend out of their own resources the capital so necessary to put this country into an efficient competitive position to face the Free Trade Area which is bound to evolve in the space of a few years.</P>

      <P>I believe this Bill should be opposed and I intend to oppose it.  I look across the floor of this House and I see three or four Deputies sitting behind the Minister. I look again and I observe that none of them is from rural Ireland.  That is not surprising when one remembers that this Bill has nothing in it of advantage to rural Ireland.  Indeed, there are many things in it disadvantageous to rural Ireland and it is my task to point them out to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last 12 months 7,990 acres of land have been sold to foreigners.  One might say in round figures 8,000 acres of the land of Ireland have been sold <Col N="1569" /> to foreigners.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a repetition of that. On the contrary, there is something in the Bill to foster that situation.  I am sorry Deputy Carty, Deputy Millar, Deputy Kitt or Deputy Mark Killilea, is not here to help me out in this.  In Galway, there are 16,561 farmers, each of whom is trying to exist on less than 30 statute acres. That represents three-fifths of that number of people in the country who have less than 30 acres.  I have here the names of people who sold land, the names of the estates sold and the acreage involved, in the past 12 months.  I cannot pronounce the names of the buyers, whether they were Jews, Japs or Germans, but I have them here if the Minister wants to see them.  The Government allowed roughly 8,000 acres of land to be sold to foreigners within the past 12 months and granted them exemption from taxation, while at the same time the number of people in Galway who have less than 30 acres of land each is 16,561.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, certain Fianna Fáil Deputies have been holding meetings inside closed doors, talking about the achievements of the past four years, about our exports for the past four years.  Do they not realise that our chief exports for the past four years were people, that 200,000, mainly small tenant farmers with less than 30 acres, have emigrated for the simple reason that they could not exist in view of the present cost of living and other things of that description for which the Government are responsible?  Then they tell you of their plans.  We read in the local paper the other day that Deputy Kitt at some meeting referred to the Fianna Fáil plans.  There was a plan to provide water; there was another plan for drainage.  Of course, the plans were vote-catching plans and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain how it happened that over 8,000 acres have been allowed to be sold to foreigners who got certain exemption from taxation, while at the same time 200,000 of our people had to emigrate <Col N="1570" /> and, in Galway alone, there are 16,561 persons, each of whom is trying to exist on less than 30 acres?  There are 1,569 of them, each of whom has less than one acre of land; 1,521 who have from one to five acres 2,758 with from five to ten acres; 2,361 with from ten to 15 acres; 8,362 with from 15 to 25 acres and there are 16,561 trying to exist on less than 30 acres. At the same time, those Germans, Jews, Japs, Negroes, are allowed to come here and buy up overnight thousands of acres and are getting special tax exemptions.</P>
    <P>Since the time of Lord Lucan and the Clanrickardes, there has never been such a clearance of people from the land as there has been within the past 12 months.  I defy contradiction of that statement.  I want to warn the Minister that whoever will occupy his position after the general election will have to introduce measures to prevent foreigners coming in here and depriving the small tenant farmer of a way of living.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to restore the food subsidies, the removal of which has caused so much trouble and which has been the cause of emigration from the rural areas.  The small tenant farmer was not able to pay his son or daughter £1 or 30s. a week, with the result that they went away and the father and mother went with them.  One hears some members of the Fianna Fáil Party saying that emigration is in our blood, that they would go in any case.  That is all cod. I know many homes that have been closed up, where the little holding is set for a year or two or three in the hope that some day the people who left them will have acquired a few pounds and can return.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in this Bill to give us the 100,000 jobs promised four years ago.  Of course, people like Deputy Kitt may say that there have been a few thousand more people employed in industry.  That is a good thing.  I wish there were more of it. At the same time, it is admitted in a Government publication that there are 29,000 fewer people working on the land than there were four years ago. <Col N="1571" /> The agricultural workers are the chief producers, the only people who make new money in this country through their sweat and toil.  Nevertheless, after four years of the present Administration, there are 29,000 fewer persons working on the land and 200,000 have emigrated.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that there is a form of taxation which does not come before this House, that is, rates.  Something must be done about rates.  At the present time, in many cases the land is not worth the rates being paid for it.  In County Galway at the moment, the rates are nearly 53s. in the £.  Galway is the most heavily rated county in Ireland and it is one of the poorest counties.  Does the Minister not realise that the land is not worth the rates and that very soon the people will have to run away from the land on that account?</P>
    <P>Neither is there anything in this Bill to restore one of the great Acts introduced during the inter-Party Government's time when the late Deputy Murphy was Minister for Local Government, namely, the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That Act was a great help to people in the rural areas.  Even Fianna Fáil people, including Deputy Corry, praised it.  Of course Fianna Fáil can blow hot and cold as it suits them.</P>
    <P>I intend to vote against this Bill. There is nothing in it that is of any advantage but everything that can be a disadvantage to the people in the rural areas.  The way things are drifting, I say let us have a general election tomorrow or the day after.  No matter what Party are in power, if serious measures are not taken by legislation in this House, a chaotic situation will prevail in a few years' time.  I have often heard it said that no one would ever succeed in driving the Irish out of Ireland.  Nevertheless, in places where the Irish should be there are Japanese, Germans, Jews and Negroes.  If as many Irish people drift away in the next four years as have gone in the past four years, there will not be many Irish left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out by many speakers, the amount of money the Government are spending is colossal and the way in which it is being spent does not meet with the approval of many of the people in rural Ireland.  Deputy Donnellan has devoted most of his speech to rural Ireland.  The part of rural Ireland I want to refer to is the provincial town.  I want to ask the Minister and the Government to desist from going around the country and making statements to the effect that the country was never so prosperous and having those statements sent to the Press, while people who are down and out and who know that no such prosperity exists have to read them.</P>
      <P>With reference to the constituency I represent, East Cork, and with particular reference to the town from which I come, Fermoy, the people of Fermoy have been, since we attained native Government, appealing to all Governments to give us some kind of help in regard to industrial activity. We have got nowhere in that appeal, although when men were wanted, that town gave great service indeed to this country.  The position is much worse today than it was four years ago because unfortunately many of the young men who grew up with me and who are now in their forties are over in England or elsewhere seeking a living.  I want the Government to give serious thought not only to the position of Fermoy but to the position of many towns like it throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not long ago in this House, I said this Government were too Dublin-minded. The more I see of their activities, the more I am convinced that is so.  They are not giving consideration to people in towns like Fermoy, Midleton and Mitchelstown who find it hard to meet all the commitments placed upon them, people like shopkeepers and those unfortunate people who have to wait on the side of the street for the customer who is just not there.  The Government ought to ensure that the grants and inducements they give to the towns in the undeveloped areas, if at all <Col N="1573" /> possible, are extended to the towns to which I refer and are not now in the shaded areas, because they are just as badly off as those towns in the shaded areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when he is replying the Minister will let us have the answer to this question.  I was always told, taking the provincial towns again, that they could not exist except there was a prosperous industrial community around them.  I believe that, not only for Dublin but for these provincial towns, agriculture is the only hope for their survival.  I cannot understand why, out of the £250,000 earmarked by the Government for the finding of markets abroad for our agricultural produce, only £30,000 has been spent. In the era we are facing, we must make a serious attempt to get markets abroad for our agricultural produce and perhaps the Minister will explain what attempts have been made and why this money is left unexpended in the Government's coffers.  Once again, I appeal to the Government to consider other parts of Ireland besides Dublin.  If they do that, the people, especially the people of East Cork who sent me here, will say there is some consideration for them at last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the economy is as sound as the Minister and the Government like us to think, one would have expected the Government to perform the necessary operations which are crying out for attention in our whole financial structure.  When the economy is sound, then is the time to make changes in the status and functions of the Central Bank.  The Minister and his Department know that these changes will have to be made, if we are ever again to avoid the difficulties which we twice experienced in the last decade when the balance of payments position went against us.  It is cowardice on either the Minister's part or on the part of the Government that they were not prepared to do what they ought to have done, or else they know that the economy is on the brink and that any change now would cause chaos.  That would not suit them in a general election year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most significant factors <Col N="1574" /> in our economy over the past couple of years has been the colossal all-time record profits of our banks.  That is why the experts are trotting the country showing the bank accounts with black figures instead of red ones because they are doing well, although the incomes of the majority of the people are falling all the time.  If ever there was an obligation on the Minister, it fell on him this year to impose a special bank tax.  Is the Minister going to say that the banks are in such a shaky position that they could not have carried a special tax?  I believe they could have carried a tax without any great upset to the banks themselves. One of the effects of that might have been that the banks would have dropped their lending rate in order to avoid paying tax.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, when there was an obvious course open to the Minister, he would not take it.  The only worthwhile tax relief he gave was one to those who are paying surtax.  It is no wonder therefore that at chambers of commerce dinners, bank dinners and financiers' dinners we have the clapping of &ldquo;good old Jim Ryan&rdquo; on the back.  Never have these financiers been so well off; never have they got such concessions.  Never was there a time when it was more necessary for the Minister to redistribute the wealth within the economy but he has failed to do it.  On that account, I believe this Finance Bill is a hopeless effort to try to tackle the problems of this country as they face us today.</P>
    <P>In recent years, due mainly to the foresight of Deputy Sweetman, we have seen the value of having investment in this country and encouraging that investment by giving tax reliefs for investments here.  I do not believe we have gone far enough.  That was a positive and excellent approach.  It is an indication of what Fine Gael will do when returned to power.</P>
    <P>I believe a very useful step in that connection would be to impose a dividend tax on investments of Irish people abroad.  I believe, in the same context, that if we are as sound economically and financially as the Government pretend we are now is <Col N="1575" /> the time to consider some operation of exchange control so that, when the necessity for exchange arises, we will be able to apply it without having to come into this House in an unsettling atmosphere.  At a time of financial difficulty any discussion on a Bill giving extra powers, and so forth, would cause an even more unsettling effect.  The Government must be condemned because they have failed to do it.</P>
    <P>If we had a property-owning democracy we would have a much better economy.  It is a sad reflection on the Minister that he did not avail of this Bill to abolish stamp duty on all properties of a lesser valuation than, say, £3,000.  The Minister may take any figure he likes.  The figure I have in mind is the figure that would purchase a home or a small farm for an average person in the community.</P>
    <P>I think it is ludicrous that when the State and local authorities have to subsidise housing we should subsidise housing for people who certainly have an income with which they could purchase their own dwellings and thereby relieve the national Exchequer.  I have indicated a way in which the Minister could have obtained extra revenue without any great difficulty, a way in which he could collect it, a way in which the burden would be least painful. Therefore, the Minister cannot say that we on this side of the House have looked for more money without indicating where it could be got.  I am now indicating where relief could be given.  It is necessary in order to encourage people to purchase their own properties.  It is socially desirable and I advance it on that ground.</P>
    <P>Another thing which discourages people from purchasing their own property is ground rent.  That is a matter for another Department and not one which I would ask the Minister necessarily to deal with in the Finance Bill.  In relation to the same matter, there is Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; tax.  It is ludicrous to apply a special penal tax on people who invest their savings in their own property.  We are imposing that tax.  The Minister may say that <Col N="1576" /> an occupier who has paid a rent does not pay the tax.  He simply pays the ground rent to the landlord and he pays it.  However, the burden of making two separate payments, one to the landlord and the other to the Revenue Commissioners, lies on the unfortunate person in the house.</P>
    <P>We ought to abolish Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; tax on people residing in properties of lesser marketable value than £3,000. The Minister might want to adjust it in relation to rateable valuation.  I have no objection to that.  However, if we are to encourage people to invest their savings in Ireland we ought to encourage them to purchase their own property. One way is by abolishing Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; tax on properties of low valuation.</P>
    <P>In the same context the case is that the Minister must keep his mind on the revenue end and feels he cannot surrender Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; tax in that regard.  I would not hesitate to increase Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; tax on people who have ground rents.  If it were done, the Department of Finance would probably, as I believe they do at present, resist very strongly the abolition of ground rents, because they believe the Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; tax would be abolished with them.</P>
    <P>We must discourage people from investing in ground rents.  It is a nonproductive investment.  It does not add one penny to the country.  It does not produce any valuable service.  It is an investment in a private tax.  It is a negative thing and of no economic value to the country.  It would be good economically to discourage people from investing in these private taxes. If they were discouraged from doing that and discouraged by extra tax levies on foreign dividends, they would have to invest in the brawn and brains of our people in this country.</P>
    <P>It is not because I resent any contributions being made to build up the economy of rural Ireland that I make my next remarks.  I want to dispel any idea in the mind of the people in rural Ireland that Dublin is doing well.  It may be doing well on the front&mdash;the banks and expense accounts, gentlemen and ladies.  The lounge bar <Col N="1577" /> gentlemen and ladies may say:&ldquo;Good old Jim.  Good old Lemass.  He is an an economic genius, and so on.  They are doing all right.&rdquo;  However, let us look at the figures.</P>
    <P>During the days of the Costello administration the average rate of surrender of Dublin Corporation houses and flats was 500 per year.  That is, 500 families in Dublin per year handed back the keys and emigrated. Of that 500, you will probably allow even up to 50 who might have been buying their own houses, or the person occupying the house might be dying or going to another country.  Say that 450 houses per annum was the average number of surrendered dwellings.</P>
    <P>Since this Government have taken office that figure has increased and the average is 1,400 surrendered dwellings per annum.  Three times as many people are leaving Dublin City, which is supposed to be well off now, compared with a few years ago.  Where is the wealth?  Where is all the prosperity that we are told is in the country? Why are people giving up?  It is because they are being told they were never so well off.  The impression is being given that we were never better off.</P>
    <P>The people are saying: &ldquo;If this is what &lsquo;well-off&rsquo; in Ireland means, we will go abroad.  We could not be any worse off there even if we do not do any better.&rdquo;  These are realistic figures. Forget about the joy of the bank directors and all these well-to-do people.  Look at the figures that have been given by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies.  Look at the figures I have given which are official figures and which cannot be controverted.  If you think I am lying, look at the official reports of the Dublin Corporation. They are there.  Dublin Corporation, which, under the Costello régime, was building 1,500 dwellings per annum to meet the demand for houses, last year built a mere 250.  They are afraid the point will be reached in a few years, if our housing programme continues and if the rate of emigration which followed on the return of Fianna Fáil continues, at which we will have more houses than people to occupy them. <Col N="1578" /> That is the Dublin that is supposed to be getting everything.  If it is getting all that and is in this miserable position, it is no wonder rural Ireland is suffering from increased depopulation and depression.  It is not a situation which any of us wants to see or which gives pleasure to any of us on this side of the House; but it is there.  When the Minister had an opportunity in the Finance Bill of doing something about it, he failed miserably.  On that account I believe this Bill is not worthy of the support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must apologise to Deputy Sweetman for not circulating a copy of my opening speech.  But I honestly thought it was hardly worth circulating as there was so very little in it.  It was merely a factual statement of what was in the various parts of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy Sweetman's view in regard to the way the Special Import Levies have been dealt with since this Government came into office.  My recollection does not coincide with his that we in Opposition had condemned these levies outright. My recollection is that we divided the levies into two categories.  First, those concerning commodities necessary for health&mdash;in particular, we mentioned oranges&mdash;and those concerning the welfare of industry.  When we returned to office, we tried to remove such levies.  At that time, the levies were yielding about £4 million per annum.  Last year, we got £1 million from them.  I have not got the figures, but I know the greater part of the £4 million came from levies that were abolished.  Others were brought into ordinary taxation and some were modified and brought in also.  Those that remained were levies on what might be regarded as semi-luxury items.  I think nobody will object, when taxation is necessary, to raising it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also said that the momentum of output and export was reducing during 1960.  That was true so far as the figures went from quarter to quarter but, on the other hand, I am glad to be able to say that the export for the first three or four <Col N="1579" /> months of this year is quite favourable, so that we may, perhaps, look forward to a good return from both output and export during the year 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know really. One point Deputy Sweetman made was a point he also made in his Budget speech.  Perhaps I misunderstand him. but if I do not misunderstand him, I think he is wrong.  He pointed out that in making the change in the deductibility of corporation profits tax and income tax, we have put investors in Irish companies at a disadvantage. I must say I cannot see that point.  If a person puts money now into an Irish company under the new conditions the Irish company, when it determines its profits at the end of the year, will pay corporation profits tax at the rate of ten per cent., less the first £2,500, and then pay income tax on all the profits, not having deducted as heretofore the amount paid in corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman had in mind, I think, a person making an investment here and, let us say, in England.  If he invests in an English company, when that company makes up its profits at the end of the year, 15 per cent. is taken in profits tax and then income tax is taken at the higher rate and is paid on the whole lot, as here.  Therefore, the amount paid in an Irish company with fairly substantial profits, because the first £2,500 does not make any difference, would be about 41½ per cent.  In England, it would be about 52½ per cent.  I cannot see therefore, Deputy Sweetman's point that we are putting the Irish company at a disadvantage.  Perhaps I have not understood the Deputy properly in the point he made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The next point he made was that in assessing the increase in national income and output, we had in all our discussions taken the datum year as 1958, that 1958 was a bad year from the agricultural point of view and was, therefore, abnormally <Col N="1580" /> low in output and that that gives a better figure for 1959 as compared with 1958.  There is something in that point certainly, but it does not make a great difference because I had that figure examined and, even if 1958 had been a normal year, as between 1957 and 1959, it would make a difference of something less than half per cent.  It would, of course, make that difference.  On the other hand, we must keep in mind that the increase in national income in 1960 over 1959 was better still than 1958; and in that case, of course, the datum year of 1958 does not come in at all.</P>
      <P>A good deal was said about the Government's attitude to the Common Market.  I do not want to go into that very fully, but I want to say this: If the Taoiseach makes a statement that we have not applied for admission to the Common Market group, surely it should not be deduced from that that we have done nothing?  We might have done quite a lot of work in making inquiries as to whether we should apply or not and we might have given it a great deal of thought.  Maybe it might appear that the more thought you give it, the more thought you found necessary to give it.  You might have done a great deal of work before making an application.  If the answer is given, therefore, that we have not made an application, it is not fair of Deputies to say we have done nothing in the matter.</P>
      <P>The next matter which came up for discussion was the changes made with regard to stamp duty on land purchased by non-nationals.  Deputy Sweetman asked if it was a printer's error that 19th April appeared as the date from which the tax would be changed on the pre-1947 company. Well, it was not a printer's error.  As a matter of fact, when the Deputy made the point I must say I thought we should give attention to the matter but I believe it has become common practice, in matters of customs and excise at least, to impose the duty on the day on which it is announced. However, I do not think there is much in the point and it is most unlikely that anybody should be caught out on that particular day.  However, I will have it examined further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> Another point which Deputy Sweetman made, and which is more technical and a bit beyond me at the moment until I have an opportunity to study it, is in regard to subsection (9) of Section 29 where it reads &ldquo;irrespective of whether or not it has been stamped with a particular stamp&rdquo;, etc., the Revenue Commissioners can call for a re-examination and a re-stamping.  I should say that the argument is not altogether on Deputy Sweetman's side and I shall take more time to examine that point between now and the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this whole question of charging 25 per cent. stamp duty on purchases by non-nationals, the object is to make it more expensive and more unattractive for non-nationals to purchase agricultural land.  These section are designed only to deal with agricultural land.  We have, as Deputies are aware, excluded land within the urban area; we have excluded a house standing on less than five acres of land and we have excluded land purchased for an industry.  As I say, our only aim is to make it unattractive for a non-national to purchase agricultural land and to make it, as it were, more competitive for the Irish buyer of land to get land in opposition to the non-national. Whether we succeed or not is a question that I cannot answer at this stage.  My only object in putting in these clauses was to see that as far as possible there was no avoidance or evasion of the law.  Perhaps other cases will crop up as time goes on where again we shall find avoidance of the law and if so we must deal with these different cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way as far as I know of dealing with this thing in a thorough fashion, short of giving very full power to the Land Commission to say: &ldquo;You must sanction every sale and reject those you think are not in the interests of agriculture,&rdquo; or something of that nature.  That would be a drastic step which I think no Party would like to take unless, of course, <Col N="1582" /> the matter became very much more serious than at present.  Another thing which I should like to say is that if we do enter the Common Market that matter will all go by the board because it is part of the Common Market scheme that there must be free access to all citizens of other countries to our own country and free access of capital, so that we would have to face that if we wanted to join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave complained that P.A.Y.E. was a very complicated system. All I can say is that when we were drawing it up, as far as I could understand the matter&mdash;it is very technical of course&mdash;we did adopt a system which is much less complicated than the system in England.  When I brought the Bill before the Dáil and when I thought I might be asked to explain the scheme up and down, I must say that as I got an understanding of it at the time I thought it was comparatively simple.  Any person I have asked about it who is dealing with the system, an employer who is dealing with the matter himself, or an employee dealing with it on behalf of his employer, has told me in every case that it was not complicated and in fact has been simplified as far as possible in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth spoke about the increased duty on motor parts.  Our desire was to simplify the duties of motor parts and to cut down the number of duties as far as possible. It was an honest calculation of the Revenue Commissioners that the new duties, provided there are the same number of cars coming in this year as last year, will give exactly the same revenue.  There may be more cars coming in and there may be fewer; in that case we will collect more duty or we will collect less, but the calculation was on the assumption that we would have the same imports this year as last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth also referred to the matter which I have mentioned already where companies are now paying their corporation profits tax on all profits over £2,500 and they will then pay <Col N="1583" /> income tax on the total profits.  Up to this, as I said, the amount paid on corporation profits tax would be deducted before income tax was calculated. Deputy Booth says he is doubtful whether most companies would be as well off this year as last year because, he very wisely said, the Revenue Commissioners would be inclined to make a change that would favour the Exchequer. I said when bringing in the Budget that any company earning a profit under £52,000 would be somewhat better off this year on account of the reduction in income tax, but if they earned over £52,000 they would be better off only to a very insignificant amount.  On the previous occasion I mentioned what the amount was on £100,000 but I forget now what it was, something like £200.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello says that the Budget gives only £600,000 to social welfare and £1.2 millions for income tax payers.  He said that for that reason it was a Tory Budget.  One does not mind being called a Tory but one would like to know why that name is given to this Budget.  It would be a pleasant thing for any Minister for Finance, and I am sure he would get the applause of certain people if he did so, to give all the surplus he had to social welfare recipients.  He would have done nothing in that case towards creating more employment and, after all, as another Deputy said, the unemployed are not seeking social welfare but jobs.  If the Minister for Finance were doing his job properly, he should devote at least some of that surplus to the provision of employment for the unemployed.  That would not be done by giving the whole surplus as extra benefits.  Furthermore, if that were done for, say, two or three years in succession, there would obviously be no increase in revenue over these years. There would be stagnation of the economy here and we could do nothing to build up the country and give employment to those now idle or to improve the lot of those who are employed by giving them a better standard of living.  If that is what a Tory approach means, I am all with Deputy Declan Costello and his idea of how to manage finances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> Deputy Costello went on to say that in our capital Budget, we had also shown great conservatism, that we had reduced the amount for housing. First, I should like Deputy Costello and Deputy Ryan to settle the difference between them because Deputy Ryan told us that no more houses are necessary in Dublin city and that there are too many vacant at present.  I do not believe that story, of course.  Apart from that, I want to say that what is put into the capital Budget is the estimate of what will be used for housing.  There is no use in my putting in £10 million or £15 million, if it is not going to be used.  I have put into the Budget what I think will be used and if Dublin or Cork Corporations and other town councils go ahead with more building and tell me &mdash;or whoever is here next year&mdash;that more money is required, I am sure more money will be given.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think that because the amount is lower now than it was, say, five or six years ago, it is Government policy that fewer houses should be built.  It is merely an estimate of what is required for housing in all circumstances.  I have certainly never given a direction to the Minister for Local Government to keep the bill down.  In fact, the Minister for Local Government has increased his grants in many directions under this Government and he has made these increases with&mdash;I shall not say without any&mdash; little resistance by me.</P>
    <P>The next point Deputy Costello made was that we had any amount of money for what he called prestige spending.  He mentioned the air companies.  It is a phobia with Fine Gael that too much money is being spent on air companies.  I do not know why Fine Gael are so much against air companies.  It is one thing for which they always attack Fianna Fáil&mdash;&ldquo;no money for old age pensions, no money for the farmers but always money for air companies.&rdquo;  I wonder why this hostility is shown to the air companies?  I imagine that if we had closed down the air companies and said that there were British, American and other companies coming in to <Col N="1585" /> take people away from here by air and if we had put no money into those companies, Deputy Costello would say that I was a Conservative or Tory Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Whatever money will be put into the air companies will be put in on the calculation, as far as it can be made, that it will be money well invested and will pay dividends.  If we have made a mistake&mdash;well, I suppose we have made more mistakes than that&mdash;but that is the basis on which the money is being invested.</P>
    <P>In regard to direct taxation, Deputy Cosgrave said that Mr. Declan Dwyer had complained that in our system of grants and concessions for industry, we had favoured the new man coming into the industry as against the industrialist who had been there all the time, and that we had built up those industrialists by these grants and concessions which were introduced.  The concession on income tax on export profits was brought in as an inducement to people to export more.  It was not introduced as a reward for those who had built up exports.  To that extent Mr. Dwyer is right.  I do not think it would be favourably received by Deputies if Deputy Sweetman, when he brought in this concession first, had brought it in as a flat rate for all industries because it would look like rewarding people for a business that was obviously profitable when they were exporting at that time.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the concession was to be made for all increases in exports so that the exporter who was already established as such, was, after all, in a better position to build up exports than the man coming in for the first time and was more likely to benefit by the concession than the man coming in for the first time.  For all his increased exports, he would get the concession.  Apart from that, this particular complaint was made when I first became Minister for Finance and we thought there might be something in the point.  We introduced a 25 per cent. relief for existing exports, so that the man who was previously exporting and who goes on into more exports now, can take either the 25 per cent. <Col N="1586" /> flat or take the 100 per cent. on his increased exports, whichever he likes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that Fianna Fáil believe that this country can survive irrespective of the agricultural industry, or, in other words, that we are prepared to let agricultural fall into bankruptcy and that we think, according to him, that we can make the country survive even in that case.  There are a few points that Fine Gael will dwell on very much coming up to the general election and one is that Fianna Fáil are not interested in agriculture, but the one class of people they will not get to believe that are the agriculturists themselves.  They may get people in cities to believe it or those who take an academic interest in economic affairs but why, or how, can they make that accusation against Fianna Fáil? Everybody knows it is very hard for a Minister for Finance to make ends meet, but even so, we are endeavouring to provide £8 million more for agriculture than was provided in 1956-57, the last year in which the Coalition Government were in office.  That money is provided for various purposes and we believe that the only way we can help agriculture is to help farmers in their production.</P>
    <P>We have given liberal subsidies for fertilisers and so on in order to enable farmers to get more out of the soil, whether crops or grass, so that they can produce more on their farms. In addition, we have provided more for price incentives.</P>
    <P>There were certain price incentives under the previous Government.  We have increased the price incentives for milk products and also for top grade bacon, and we have over the past year brought in price incentives for beef.  I do not know of anything else we could usefully do for agriculture. I am certain of course that no one from the Fine Gael side has suggested anything else we could do.  They are trying to persuade the country that we are doing nothing for agriculture, and trying to give the impression to the country that they would do a whole lot more, without saying what they would do.  I do not think that will carry much weight with the country <Col N="1587" /> people, unless Fine Gael tell them what they will do.  They have not said anything of that kind.  After all, the farmers are a very big class, and we all agree that they are not doing as well as we would like to see them doing, but it is unfair to the farmers, if Fine Gael have some policy up their sleeve and do not tell us what it is, in order that we can improve the lot of the farmers now, and not wait until after the next general election to do so.</P>
    <P>What I would call a rather undesirable type of propaganda is coming from Fine Gael, and Deputy Dillon is the man who is spearheading it. He talks about what we have done for industry, which we have put on its feet, contrary to what some Fine Gael Deputies say.  He says we have made industry prosperous and have done nothing for the farmers.  In other words, he is appealing to a very low instinct in the farmers and trying to create a feeling of jealousy in them by saying they are not doing as well as every other class.  That is a very bad thing to do because, after all, if the farmer is not as well off as the others, he should be left fairly content as he is, and this feeling of resentment and jealousy should not be stirred up against the people in the towns because the farmers are not doing as well as the people in the towns.</P>
    <P>We, of course, had not the same opportunity of doing that, whether or not we would have done it, because when the Coalition were in office, we could not draw the attention of the farmers to the fact that the people in the towns were doing well, because they were not doing well.  I am appealing to Fine Gael not to try to stir up this feeling of jealousy amongst the farmers.  Deputy Dillon is a very impressive speaker.  I can quite see that if he were speaking, his audience would be convinced that the farmers were never so badly off as they are at the present time.  But why are they paying so much for land?  Land was never so dear.  The farmers may be very good supporters of Fianna Fáil, but I am quite sure there is no Fianna Fáil farmer who would pay £1 more for a <Col N="1588" /> farm than he thought it was worth, for the sake of boosting Fianna Fáil.  He pays for it because he thinks the land is worth it, and because he has confidence in the future of agriculture, and he buys the land to make his living on it.</P>
    <P>Under the Coalition back in 1956, every other farmer one talked to was in the doldrums.  He was called in by his bank manager and told: &ldquo;You must pay something off your bill.&rdquo;  In the past few years, the bank managers have been saying: &ldquo;Do you want any more money for your business?&rdquo; Bankers are not fools; bankers do not give money in order to boost Fianna Fáil, but because they know there is a future in agriculture.  The objective opinion of the bankers and the farmers that agriculture is progressing and will progress is much more useful than the pessimistic propaganda of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish talked about the income tax reliefs and said that he was dissatisfied.  He quoted figures to show that a single man earning £1,000 a year got much bigger reliefs than a married man on the same salary.  It is inevitable unless we make some big changes in the system that when we bring down income tax, the single man will get a bigger relief.  Of course, when it goes up, he pays more than the married man, because as every Deputy knows, the married man is exempt at a higher level than the single man. Therefore, when income tax goes down, the single man gets more out of it than the married man.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also talked about indirect taxation and said it was unfair, in a way, to the less well-off person because he has to pay his share of indirect taxation in a higher proportion than the better-off man.  First of all, I should say that Deputy Corish is right when he says that of our total revenue 70 per cent. comes from indirect taxation.  I remember saying in my Budget speech that I was very much inclined, so far as it was possible, to change from direct taxation to indirect taxation, for the reasons I mentioned earlier to-day, that we would get better results from building up the economy by taking less from <Col N="1589" /> earnings and putting a tax on spending instead.</P>
    <P>However, Deputy Corish may be right when he says that the poor man will have contributed a certain amount on tobacco or a pint of beer in indirect taxation.  Let us take the three big items of indirect taxation: tobacco, alcoholic beverages and petrol.  They make up four-fifths of the entire amount collected in indirect taxation. I do not say that a person on a low income should not have a smoke or a drink, but at least he can regulate his spending on those items to a moderate amount, if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>I mentioned elsewhere, not here, that our total revenue from income tax is almost equivalent to the amount paid out in social services, if you like to put it that way.  In answer to another point raised by Deputy Corish, we are taking income tax from people and giving it out in social services.  If the income tax payer pays 6/4d., he is doing well and helping his brethren, and the more wealthy man who must pay 13/10d. at the top of the surtax rate is helping his brethren also.  While the rate of income tax and surtax is lower here than it is in England and in other places, it is still a fairly substantial amount to take from a man's earnings.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish pointed out, it is true that the amount of money collected by way of revenue is very much higher now than it was in 1956/57.  I think it is higher by about £20,000,000 as far as I remember but, if you take the Departments mentioned by Deputy Corish&mdash;that is, Education, Health and Social Welfare&mdash;and if you add to them the Department of Agriculture, these four Departments between them are taking £16,000,000 more than they did in 1956-1957.  Therefore, apart from these four the amount coming in in extra revenue now as compared with 1956-1957 is a fairly moderate amount. It is not true, as Deputy Corish said, that those in receipt of social welfare benefits are worse off now than they were three or four years ago.  The one class usually mentioned in this connection is the non-contributory old <Col N="1590" /> age pensioner.  From 1st August next he will have 25 per cent. more than he did in 1956-1957 and the cost of living has gone up, as far as I recollect, between 14 and 16 points.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish wanted to know what would happen to the industries established in the undeveloped areas. The point made by the Deputy was, of course, that they were obviously uneconomic, otherwise they would not have got the very large grants they did to induce them to go into these areas, and they are obviously competing at a disadvantage in operating in these areas.  He asked what will happen to them if we go into the Common Market?  I do not know.  It may be that the industries which are operating in remote areas may have certain advantages.  We only hope they will be able to carry on even if we do go into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell spoke of our tax on undistributed profits and he advocated something that has been advocated very often before; he said we should have a lower tax on undistributed profits. The reason he thinks that should be done is because our profits are low by European standards.  While admitting that our profits are lower.  I can only answer the Deputy by saying that our taxes are also comparatively low by European standards.  It must be remembered, too, that we are giving exceptional treatment by way of grants, loans and so on to industries starting here.  Taking our treatment of industries generally, I do not think we can be accused of treating our industries less generously than industries are treated in other European countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell said that a good case could be made for the abolition of corporation profits tax.  I do not know. It must be remembered that corporation profits tax and income tax combined amount to just a little over 40 per cent.  I do not think you will find another country in this part of Western Europe where taxation is so low. It has been argued of course that in very wealthy countries they can afford to pay bigger taxes because their businesses are bigger and they have better profits.  On the other hand, in countries <Col N="1591" /> which are not so wealthy money is required more for the Exchequer, and so on.  If you take the company as compared with the individual, I must admit I think the individual here is badly treated as compared with the company.  The individual, if he is in business, pays income tax on profits, and he pays surtax as well.  He may actually pay as much as 13/10 in the £. The most that the company will pay is 8/4 in the £.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Russell that the three prerequisites to progress in industry are education, capital and productivity. Deputy Russell thinks the Budget did not go far enough in encouraging these.  My only answer to that is that it went as far as our resources would permit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan spoke about local rates.  For some while past I have been thinking the time has come when the whole question of financing local authorities should be examined by some independent body to see if a better system could be found.  I do not know whether or not a better system can be found, but I think the matter should be examined.  I suppose that is not likely to happen now until a new Government takes office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that serious thought should be given to conditions in towns like Fermoy.  In answer to a Parliamentary Question not so long ago, I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce state that he had the whole system of grants and the present division as between undeveloped areas and other areas under review to see if a better system could be evolved.  I know the Minister is examining into <Col N="1592" /> that and he may, or may not, produce a scheme in due time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that, while we are talking about the great progress the country has made, people's incomes are falling all the time.  Now that cannot be true.  After all, total national production is going up and it could not go up if incomes were going down. Secondly, the yield in income tax is going up and it could not go up if incomes were going down.  Deputy Ryan will have to find some other cause for what he regards as the great depression in the country.</P>
    <P>He also advocated our doing more to encourage people to buy Irish shares as opposed to foreign shares. He asked me to supplement what Deputy Sweetman did when he was in office.  I must say I was not aware that Deputy Sweetman did anything while he was in office.  I may be wrong in that, but the system of giving relief in income tax on the interest from Irish shares was brought in by my colleague, Deputy MacEntee, when he was Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the stamp duty on the purchase of property.  He said it was very, very high.  He made the point that a man purchasing a house should not have to pay the very high rate of stamp duty exacted at the moment.  When a house is bought by a purchaser from a builder for the first time, the rate of stamp duty is not much more than nominal.  However, I do not profess to know all about the operations of stamp duty on the purchase of property.  It is a matter I shall have to look into.  I do not think there is any other point to which I need reply, but, if I have missed any point, let me say that it was not because I was trying to avoid it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I said I would try to answer many of the questions that were put to me if possible and that what I had said on the opening of the Second Stage had been confined to the essential facts in view of the coming debate on the Estimate.  I would like, first of all, to refer to some of the points made by Deputy Corish.  Deputy Corish appeared to have no great faith in the American tourist potential market. While I agree with him that we must always pay attention to the very great market available at our door from Great Britain and although the effort of Bord Fáilte is rightly concentrated on attracting tourists from Great Britain, nevertheless there is a tremendous untapped American market available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Americans, in a recent year, were reckoned to have spent $17,000,000 in this country.  At the moment, of those who cross the Atlantic by air only about five per cent. land in Ireland <Col N="1595" /> and although our Estimates are based on that general percentage continuing, we hope, by promoting good air services and by other tourist development, to attract an ever-larger number of Americans to our country. In fact the whole of the investment both in respect of Shannon Airport and in respect of Aerlínte, when considered in relation even to the present income which Americans leave behind in this country, is not exaggerated in any way.  If one were even to relate the capital investment in jet planes, together with the investment in Shannon Airport, to the additional market made available to Irish farmers by Americans who stay in our hotels, I would still say it was a good investment.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives in starting Aerlínte was to develop transatlantic air traffic as a whole, to stimulate other carriers to compete with Aerlínte so as to ensure a continual interest in the transatlantic services stopping at Shannon.  We have succeeded in that.  No fewer than eight air carriers have services regularly calling at Shannon this summer.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Aerlínte service which I think I should mention.  The world is shrinking very rapidly and any Irish air service which looks only eastwards is not taking full advantage of the potential offered by modern travel. One of the purposes in starting the Aerlínte Boeing jet service was to encourage east-west traffic, to encourage people to cross the Atlantic and to move onwards to Europe in Aer Lingus planes and equally to return home from Europe, staying in Ireland and going on the same service to America.  Everything that the Deputies have said in relation to the excellent service offered by Aer Lingus &mdash;and I would like to reply on behalf of the company and acknowledge the tribute that has been paid to Aer Lingus&mdash;can only be represented in this way: if the service is as good as that, we should encourage people to make a complete round trip from America to Ireland, to England, other parts of Europe and back again.  It <Col N="1596" /> is in order to provide a complete service east and west that Aerlínte was started and I believe it is an essential feature of a modern Irish air service. The idea that we should go no further towards the west than Shannon is an utterly out-of-date conception.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and some other Deputies asked me to say something more about the statement in the Second Reading speech that for the financial year ending 31st March, 1961, it was likely that, taken as a whole, the Aer Lingus and Aerlínte services would balance each other financially.  I can give approximate figures.  Accounts have not been completed and I want to make it quite clear that the figures are only approximate, the anticipated surplus in the case of Aer Lingus is in the neighbourhood of £180,000 and the loss in the case of Aerlínte is in the neighbourhood of £80,000.</P>
    <P>It is true that some years ago when highly speculative predictions were made of what would be the financial outturn in each of the first three years of Aerlínte's operation, it was hoped that in the year which has ended Aerlínte would break even.  I think that to arrive at a loss of £80,000 after successive losses of over £800,000 and of over £500,000 indicated that the prediction was not inaccurate having regard to all the difficulties of making a prediction of this kind.</P>
    <P>This year Aerlínte will have its fleet of three Boeing planes.  It will be a year of transition and all I can say is that there has been a very great increase of traffic, as I indicated at the beginning of the debate, and that forward bookings are extremely satisfactory. I hope that although previous predictions were not fully realised the Company will progress.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the idea that Aer Lingus is going to be bled by Aerlínte, which was suggested by several Deputies, is utterly without foundation.  Both these companies are run by the same management group.  Their accounts will be kept separate and one company will not be allowed bleed another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> Aer Lingus puts aside in every year a very considerable sum for depreciation. The amount required under this Bill would be very much larger were it not, as I indicated in my speech, that Aer Lingus are financing part of their programme out of their own depreciation reserves.  The Aer Lingus depreciation reserves are not being taken in order to finance the development loss of Aerlínte.  I can assure the House that it would be the duty of the Minister for Transport and Power at all times to ensure a correct relationship between one company and another and that the development of one company will not in any way be restricted or hampered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon gave some figures in relation to the total loss that has been experienced so far in the operation of Shannon Airport.  It is quite evident that any airport in its early stages, when traffic is developing, will lose considerable sums of money.  I should point out that, not including depreciation and interest on capital in a recent year, the operating revenue at Shannon Airport was slightly in excess of the operating expenditure, showing that, as traffic has grown, the financial postion of the airport has improved.</P>
    <P>In 1960, some 412,000 passengers passed through the airport.  Insofar as raising the charges for planes landing at the airport is concerned, I should tell Deputy Dillon there is an upward limit to that process.  So far as I know, there are no civil airports in the whole of Europe which pay their way.  We have made comparative investigations of the deficits experienced here as compared with those in typical airports of Northern Europe.  If you take Dublin or Shannon Airport, and take the receipts as a percentage of expenditure, we compare very favourably with the airports of Europe.</P>
    <P>I personally believe that airports should be made to pay.  I would dearly love to raise the landing charges of all the aircraft landings at Shannon and Dublin and to make up my mind that these institutions should pay their way. I do not see why they should be subsidised by the taxpayer when going in an airplane is becoming as common as going in a motor-car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is quite different as between services that are purely internal, such as C.I.E., and where we depend on such services paying their way and services which relate to aircraft coming in from abroad.  It would be impossible for me to insist on landing charges which would result in both airports paying their way and paying interest on depreciation and capital.  If I were to do so, it would jeopardise the whole of the general growth of the numbers of aircraft calling at the two airports concerned.</P>
      <P>I cannot raise landing fees so that they appear completely distorted in relation to the turn-over of the airport concerned and the facilities offered abroad.  Anybody examining the position will find the same thing.  I can predict that whoever takes charge of the two airports will find it impossible for us to do anything.  As far as we can, we must try to make the airports run ecoomically, insist that the loss be as low as possible and maintain the trend of landing charge and fee which are reasonably comparable with those asked abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke about the whole question of stimulating the passage of freight through Shannon and using Shannon as an <i>entrepôt.</i>  That was in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, during the whole development of Shannon Airport.  I should say that there has been some progress. In 1955, 12,498 tons of freight passed through Shannon Airport.  By 1960, the figure had grown to 22,340 tons. The coming of freight-carrying jet planes may modify that picture to our disadvantage, but I hope the industrial estate at Shannon will generate new traffic to make up for any traffic that is lost.  Whereas, in the old days, all freight planes had to call at Shannon on the way to America, now it will be possible for jet planes to fly right across.  The future of Shannon as an <i>entrepôt</i> depends on the future structure of bulk freight rates across the Atlantic.</P>

      <Col N="1599" /> Quite considerable decreases in air freight rates were agreed to at the International Air Transport Association Conference held recently.  We have not had the opportunity yet of analysing the full import of those reductions.  We know that whereas before, in respect of the ordinary freight rates, there was no differential between the freight rate from New York-Shannon as compared with New York-London, now there is a slight differential.  It is an extremely complex matter to describe how far a bulk rate will actually encourage consolidation of traffic at Shannon for onward movement and the breaking-up of bulk traffic for onward movement either westwards or eastwards. The costs have to be compared with sending a large volume of freight, not calling at Shannon, to further European ports and sending it to Shannon, breaking it up, incurring the handling charges involved and rerouting it through various channels of air transport to different parts in Europe.  We are about to study that matter and Aerlínte and the Shannon Development Company are interested in it.</P>
    <P>The utmost advantage will be taken of any changes in the freight rates which will benefit Shannon.  At the moment, I cannot be over-optimistic in regard to the result of these freight-rate decreases.  I would not say they will necessarily have any beneficial effect so far as the use of Shannon as an <i>entrepôt</i> is concerned.  I should also state that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is doing propaganda and promoting the use of Shannon as a freight centre and has sent organisers to America to interest people there in the project.  We are completing a freight terminal building. Everything is being done to encourage the idea that Shannon should be a centre for freight on the route from the United States to Europe.</P>
    <P>Much may depend on the comparative efficiency with which goods can be transhipped to Shannon as compared with some of the airports in <Col N="1600" /> Europe where very considerable delays are experienced.  A great deal depends on the attitude of industrialists towards air freight.  Much of the economy that can be secured by air freight relates to the outstanding interest on raw materials moving into a factory and the finished goods moving out of a factory.  A great many manufactures are beginning to use air freight.  Although the actual freight rate is greater than the surface rate, the interest saved often makes it advantageous to use air freight.  That is a matter which is being pushed by Aer Lingus.  I have already indicated that the volume of air freight increased enormously in 1960 compared with 1959 and is growing steadily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell referred to the position of the catering suppliers at Shannon.  Although there has been a decline because of the coming of the jet planes, the receipts for the year ending January 31st, 1961, were as high as or slightly higher than in any year since and including 1957, with the exception of the year 1959, so that although there has been a reduction from 1959, the receipts have not been unsatisfactory of recent date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the restrictions imposed by the International Air Transport Association on the freight rate structure of Aer Lingus. There is nothing we can do about that. I believe, and my predecessor believed, it is to our net advantage to subscribe to I.A.T.A.  As a result, the rules have to be kept and there are minimum freight rates that have to be observed. Advantage can be taken of bulk cargoes within that system, but it would be no use my pretending that Aer Lingus can go below the rates prescribed by I.A.T.A.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also referred to the handling charges for the export of lamb by air to Switzerland.  I have had no complaints in regard to that matter, but I have asked Deputy Briscoe to give me full particulars of the handling charges which have to be met at the airport.  I shall be glad to examine any suggestion that excessive handling charges are being asked from companies seeking to export lamb by air to Switzerland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> Charter flights are engaged from companies other than Aer Lingus for special flights and Aer Lingus also does charter work itself.  I should make it clear there is not a monopoly of freight carriage by Aer Lingus which, as far as I know, could possibly impede the development of new exports by air freight.  In fact, a great many industries are making use of air freight for their exports.  These include some very remarkable commodities which one would imagine would not pay.  One of the most recent examples of that I heard of was the export of very large quantities of footwear manufactured in Ireland and sent by air to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the desirability of Aer Rianta investing in the three new hotels.  I should say that their investment is comparatively small compared with the total capital required, £2¼ million.  The investment by Aer Rianta was necessary to ensure the interest of all the shareholders who made it clear they would not take part unless Irish Air Lines took up part of the subscription.  As everybody knows, the main company constructing these hotels is connected with Pan-American Airways.  Quite apart from any conditions suggested by the other investors, I would think it an excellent thing for our air holding company to have an interest in hotels which have been constructed, partly as a result of the interest of Pan-American Airways in order that they could take advantage of hotel development here and in order to ensure that they will have part of the reservation facilities in these hotels.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that since 1947 only a few hundred bedrooms with bath had been constructed in this country until Bord Fáilte, as part of the economic programme of the Government, arranged to provide grants and loans for hotel development.  There has been a very great lack of hotel accommodation with bath in this country.  The estimate we have whereby we hope that by, I think, 1963, 132,000 Americans will come to Ireland will not be realised, unless we have a great many more rooms with baths.  It is believed that this plan to construct three luxury hotels is an excellent one and that it is wise for Aer Rianta to <Col N="1602" /> have a modest investment in it, in view of the international character of the undertaking and in view of the importance of being able to reserve luxury accommodation for the many Americans whom we hope to bring to this country.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked by some Deputies, including Deputy Dillon, in regard to the efficiency of the Boeing aircraft purchased by Aerlínte.  I should say that the Boeing 720 aircraft has been able to take advantage of the experience gained during the earlier flights of the Boeing 707 and has had a number of modifications incorporated in it.  Therefore, when Aerlínte took over these Boeings, they already had modifications applied to them which otherwise would have had to have been applied during their flights under the auspices of Aerlínte. Naturally, these planes passed through some teething troubles but they are now operating up to specification.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch challenged me on the ground that occasionally I say that questions in regard to State companies are matters of day to day administration. I think it is equally true that I have answered a very great number of detailed questions in this House, as my predecessor did, on many aspects of the administration and financing of the State companies.  It is for the Minister to judge what is day to day administration.  I do not think I have been illiberal in my attitude in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Russell referred to the comparative air fares between Belfast and London and Dublin and London.  There is nothing we can do about it.  Internal air fares within Great Britain are not subject to I.A.T.A. rules and, unfortunately, Belfast to London is considered by I.A.T.A. to be an internal air route and, as such, we cannot compete with that particular fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Russell also suggested that the Aerlínte flights should end at Shannon.  Quite a large percentage of the passengers, both east- and westbound, desire to leave or arrive at Dublin and the service is attractive <Col N="1603" /> from that standpoint.  Anybody who studies the general habits of tourists in other countries know they frequently want to go to the capital city in the first instance.  We could make no change in regard to that.  It is quite essential that the service should commence at Dublin.</P>
    <P>Questions were also asked about the development of an air ferry service. As the House knows the B.K.S. Company are running an air ferry for cars between Liverpool and Dublin and both Aer Lingus and my Department are engaged in exploring how additional services could be started.  One of the difficulties is to find a suitable air field in Great Britain for that purpose and another difficulty is to find the right kind of plane which will economically carry a large number of cars and passengers.  We believe a plane will be available sometime later in 1962, or early in 1963, which will make the proposals more attractive.  In the meantime, the potential accommodation for cars on the surface routes has been increased this year by 50 per cent., which should encourage tourists to come here with their cars.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said I gave insufficient information on the proportion of this capital to be devoted to Aer Lingus and to Aerlínte.  Very roughly, and excluding the amount of the capital replacing a bank loan, the amount of capital for Aerlínte is some £200,000 and for Aer Lingus, some £800,000, showing that there is no prejudice in favour of Aerlínte in that regard.  Several Deputies complained about the facilities at Busarus.  I should say the use of Busaras as the centre for transport arrivals from Dublin Airport is obviously of some advantage to tourists.  It is, first of all, near to the bus station, it is near Amiens Street Station, and close to Westland Row, and it brings travellers within close contact of three very important surface transport centres.  I am going to have inquiries made with regard to the inadequacy of the taxi service.  I quite agree it is most unfortunate if a large number of travellers arrive and are unable to get taxis to their destinations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> A Deputy suggested that there was not enough done to encourage passengers on transatlantic aircraft to purchase goods in the shop at Shannon Airport and that no advance propaganda was used.  I can assure the Deputy that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company do a large amount of publicity, both on our own line and on other air lines, in order to advise people of the facilities at Shannon. Deputy O'Sullivan regretted the delay in completing Cork Airport.  I am afraid there is absolutely nothing we can do about that.  It is not a question of overtime, it is simply a question of the technical results of the delays experienced through the recent industrial dispute.  We hope that the first departure will take place on October 15th or 16th.  If we could do anything in the meantime within reason we would do it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked whether we could not develop some other airports in addition to Cork, Shannon and Dublin.  We must allow Cork to develop in the first instance before we study any further projects. If you look at the map of Europe and examine the relationship between airports and population and tourist facilities, it will be found that with three airports we are doing fairly well.  Quite evidently, we must continually examine the position and if it appears that another airport is desirable, one presumably in the west or north-west, I am sure we would take the same forward-looking attitude as we did in Cork.</P>

      <P>When I finished speaking last week, I was dealing with the amount of money voted to the National Library.  I said that I did not want anybody to say that I am making an attack on the Irish language movement.  If anybody does I shall reply to him.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the Grant-in-Aid for the purchase of books by the National Library.  The grant is £5,000, which is inadequate when we look at the increase in the cost of books and the increase in books of the type that a library like the National Library should buy.  I want the Minister to note that we are in an age of great scientific advances and research and this scientific research has resulted in the publication of a great number of standard scientific works.  The amount of money we are giving to the National Library would never give the National Library a chance to lay up a stock of the books.  Another point is that the National Library should be able to buy practically every type of book published in the country because there are a lot of books published for which at first there is no demand but as time goes on people discover they are good books and start to look for them.  I want to point out to the Minister how small and parsimonious £5,000 is when our fellow countrymen in Belfast get £20,000 for the same purpose, if I remember rightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead (b) (1) in the Votes, the grants towards the publications of books in Irish by independent publishers is £10,000 and the grant to periodicals if published in Irish, and newspapers publishing current news in Irish, is £18,000, making a total of £28,000.  I had amongst my papers a list of publications published in Irish by An Gúm but unfortunately I have not got it with me now.  It was a <Col N="1606" /> formidable list running into hundreds of thousands of copies.  The only customers that could be found were the paper mills to pulp them.  I made inquiries about the publications.  I thought that many people who seem to be foremost in the Irish language movement would be customers for this type of book, but they were not. I asked was any reduction ever made in the price, and I discovered that many of them were reduced to nearly a penny each.  The apostles of the language movement would not even give a penny each for them.  Yet, we still vote this money.  On Radio Éireann, we are broadcasting some programmes the people do not want to listen to, and now we are printing books and periodicals no one wants to read.  People will not buy them even when they are offered at a fraction of the cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look to the National Library.  I read a speech made by a prominent member of the Oireachtas at a congress within the past few days, and the old cliché about our national heritage was trotted out.  We should look to our heritage in the National Library.  We should add to it and make it a worthwhile heritage for the generations to come.  One of the difficulties in the National Library is that the reading room is overcrowded.  I went in there again to-day and it was overcrowded. The Minister should see to it that immediate accommodation is provided in the National Library, the National Gallery and the National Museum.  There is overcrowding in the reading room of the National Library; there is overcrowding in the store rooms in the National Gallery; and there is overcrowding in the store rooms of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>On several Votes in this House I said that matter should be taken up with the various educational institutions and that where there are museum pieces of value, of interest or of sentimental value to an area&mdash;if there is something of sentimental value to Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, or Galway&mdash;it should be exhibited there instead of being stored in the cellars in Dublin.  I am sure there are an <Col N="1607" /> enormous number of museum pieces relating to the '98 Rebellion which would be of interest to Wexford.</P>
    <P>As I say, that is what we do about buying books or helping the National Library to buy books.  We are treating the National Gallery in the same manner, throwing them money that can only be classed as pennies.  George Bernard Shaw remembered the National Gallery in his will.  I asked a Parliamentary Question three or four months ago and the Minister for Finance told me that the royalties, which George Bernard Shaw left to the National Gallery, from performances of <i>My Fair Lady,</i> ran to over £300,000. That has put the National Gallery in a position to buy the kind of picture which I am sure the Director and the Board would want to buy.  They have them now and no thanks to the Government of this State&mdash;thanks to the man many people would not have any use for.  He was always an Irishman, no matter what was said to him, and he was always proud to be Irish.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Director of the National Gallery has bought some pictures already.  He, and the Governors of the Gallery, are the people who will buy pictures with this money.  I have nothing to say about them.  They are the best judges, but I will say that no pictures should be bought for this nation by any Government Department but the Department of Education, acting on the advice of the Director and the Governors.  There is a great danger that a clever artist who wants to sell his pictures will try to paint not a work of art but the &ldquo;man who&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I re-read a famous story by O. Henry entitled &ldquo;Art and the Broncho&rdquo; in which the equivalent of a Government or State Department in the United States was about to buy a picture.  By an extraordinary coincidence, the name of the man mentioned by O. Henry was Senator Mullins.  Senator Mullins went to his counterpart, another Senator, and said to him: &ldquo;We are buying this picture.&rdquo;  The other Senator looked at it and said: &ldquo;I would not give six bits for it without the frame.&rdquo;  Senator Mullins said: &ldquo;You do not know who <Col N="1608" /> painted this picture.&rdquo;  The other Senator asked: &ldquo;Who painted it?&rdquo; and the reply was: &ldquo;It was painted by the son of the man who.&rdquo;  The second Senator said: &ldquo;Why did you not say that before.  Of course we have to buy the picture.&rdquo;  There is always a danger of that happening in this country.  There is always the danger of an artist who may be &ldquo;man whoing&rdquo;, painting the &ldquo;man who&rdquo;, and we will find ourselves with a spate of these pictures on our hands.  I saw one lately and I only hope and pray that it will not be bought by this nation.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should have referred is the shortage of teachers.  The Minister mentioned in Clery's Restaurant some time ago that there were tens of thousands of national school children who had never laid eyes on a trained teacher, and that 25 per cent. of the national teachers were untrained.  I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that that was the fault of his own Party and of his predecessor, the Leader of his Party at the time, and now the President, who was Minister for Education at one time.  He came to the conclusion that the fewer teachers we had the better and he lopped off the de la Salle College in Waterford.  That is why we were short of teachers.  We were short of teachers because of the treatment meted out to them by the Minister's predecessors in that period.  We were short of teachers&mdash;many teachers who were loyal supporters of this Government would like to forget it&mdash;because the Fianna Fáil Government batoned them in the streets of Dublin.  That was one of the reasons we were short of teachers.  There was no future for teachers.  When the teachers came out on strike, they were not treated as the members of other unions were treated.  They got the big stick from the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I believe one of the Minister's predecessors went to a congress in Clare in the thirties and he was shocked and surprised at what he learned there.  He did not know until then that the primary teachers were compelled to put all the children in their <Col N="1609" /> schools in for the primary examination, irrespective of whether or not they were mentally fit.  He admitted that was a frightful state of affairs and he assured the teachers then that he would see to it that the position was remedied.  It has not been remedied.</P>
    <P>I mention the incident of the National Flag.  That was not just a nine days' wonder.  The flag is still there; it has been there for years. That action was due to an enlightened teacher who, with the aid of his manager, and the support of the parents of the children, erected a flagstaff; the National Flag is hoisted there with ceremony and it is taken down at the proper time.  I draw the Minister's attention to it, though I do not think it should really be a matter for the Department of Education.  But the Minister might make some suggestion to managers and teachers generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello is here and I will leave it to him to deal with the problem of mentally retarded children, in whom I have some interest myself. I belong to an organisation in my constituency which is doing excellent work for these children.  I do not say that I do any great work.  It is an organisation of dedicated men and women.  They are doing splendid work with, I will admit, some assistance from the State.  The problem of mentally retarded children calls for attention.  On a purely localised basis, the numbers may be small; there may be only one or two in an area.  The Minister should examine the feasibility of having these children collected from the different areas and brought to a central school for training, returning home in the evening to their parents and the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is one of the fairer-minded Ministers in Fianna Fáil and I know that, when he is replying, he will pay me the courtesy of answering the points I have put to him.  I should be greatful if he would reply to the point I made about the National Library, its reading room and any policy it may have with regard <Col N="1610" /> to the acquisition in the future of near-by properties.  I should also like to hear from him with regard to the National Gallery and the storage space available there and I should like to be told what the policy is with regard to the National Museum.</P>
    <P>I should also like to hear from him on the suggestion that the Vote for the National Library be increased and what he thinks of the suggestion that some of our national treasures should be sent on exhibition to various centres throughout the country for the education of our youth in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMJohnston" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on the very fine school-building programme carried out by the Government. It is very heartening now to see the splendid new primary and vocational schools throughout the country.  Other schools are being enlarged, repaired, or renovated. Because of the pace set in the Department, we can look forward in the near future towards the complete disappearance of old and insanitary schools.  That is profoundly to be wished.</P>
      <P>I have one criticism to make.  The schools built in the past ten years, or so, are already proving too small.  In may constituency, three recently constructed vocational schools have had to be enlarged.  Enlargements are an expensive business and I think it would be better to build the schools in one compact unit at the outset, even though all the space may not be needed immediately.  It would be less expensive than putting on additions from time to time.  I suggest a more liberal attitude in regard to the size of these schools.  As far as I know, the general plan is to increase educational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his policy of providing grants for the painting of primary schools.  Many rural schools have been neglected&mdash;I do not blame the managers for it&mdash; because of the high cost of painting. I trust those responsible will now be encouraged to undertake the work of renovation and painting.  Perhaps the Minister will in time be able to extend <Col N="1611" /> this very welcome concession to vocational schools also.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Estimate last year, the Minister said there was some idea of linking up vocational, secondary and university education. Has any progress been made along those lines?  Perhaps the Council of Education is studying the matter.  I should like to hear if any progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a vocational education committee and we have one very big problem with regard to the employment of rural science teachers or instructors.  I am sure the problem is general in rural areas.  When we are lucky enough to get a rural science instructor, we find that the moment there is a vacancy for an instructor under the county committee of agriculture, our instructor promptly leaves us and goes to the county committee. Of course, one can hardly blame him. Our disadvantage lies in the fact that there is a serious discrepancy in the salaries paid by the respective committees.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the rural science teacher and the agricultural instructor have exactly the same qualifications.  They take the same degree.  It does not seem reasonable then that one should be paid less than the other just because one happens to teach in the vocational school and the other does field work under the county committee of agriculture.  The rural science teacher in the vocational school is most important and he should be held there at all costs.  I appeal to the Minister to give him parity with his colleague working under the county committee of agriculture. If that is done, I am quite sure he will be only too glad to stay in the vocational school.</P>
    <P>Both sides of this House are well stocked with primary teachers and I should not care to trespass on their bailiwick, but some of the remarks made by some Deputies require comment. Deputy Lynch advocated the return of the cane to the school.  In theory, I suppose that is all right but teachers, like the rest of us, are human and just as liable as we are to lose <Col N="1612" /> their tempers.  In my school days, I saw a good deal of brutality carried out with the cane and I could not agree with the Deputy that it should be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt made a very fine suggestion which I would recommend the Minister to adopt, that is, in primary schools, particularly in rural areas, to have a first-aid kit.  Many of the younger teachers are qualified in first-aid and such equipment would be very useful.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the financial provisions have been increased under most heads.  Education cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty years ago in this State, a political revolution occurred when part of this country, at least, obtained its freedom.  It is time now that a social revolution occurred in this State.  Our society is stratified into very rigid classes, mainly as a result of our educational system, and it is time we had in this country what can only be called a revolution in our educational system.</P>
      <P>No person should be denied the education which his talents require because of lack of means.  Unfortunately, in our system at the present time there are not sufficient services available and not a proper system in operation which would mean that secondary and university education would be made available to those who in the normal way would not be able to afford it.  We have in this country at the present time a system whereby it is largely true that the child of poor parents finds it extremely difficult to get adequate education.</P>
      <P>That system must change.  It has changed in nearly all the countries of the world from different ends of the political spectrum, from the extreme socialist country of Russia to the extreme capitalist country of America. It can be said that in most advanced countries now, wealth is not a criterion for the education which a child is to receive.  It is time this occurred also in our country and we must be prepared to make whatever financial sacrifices are necessary to provide the educational services to bring this system about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> As a start, it is time that the Minister introduced a greatly expanded system of scholarships.  The number of scholarships available at the present time is pitifully inadequate.  It is time also that the number of places in our secondary school system should be extended. Places in the secondary schools and places in our universities should be made available to a much greater extent than they are and as soon as possible for those children of ability who can benefit from the training they will receive there.</P>
    <P>It is not every child who is suitable for a complete course of secondary education or a course of university education and for children who are not suitable for that type of education, facilities should be made available in vocational schools so that they can develop the talents they have been given.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the subject of the Irish language.  I say &ldquo;briefly&rdquo; because it has been the subject of considerable debate in this House from time to time and I think it is unnecessary to rehearse again the arguments which have been thrashed out over so many years.  One thing I think I can say is that there are more and more people coming to the realisation that the continuance of our present system of teaching Irish in our national schools is a disgrace.  I think it is a national disgrace that the present system of teaching Irish in our national schools is continued, that that is becoming more and more accepted and that public opinion will force the Department to change its policy.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to children coming from poor homes, whose length of time in school will be so short in most cases, that they should be required to learn a language which they will never use again and for which, at the end of their school period, they have little love.  It is wrong and I think it has been proved to be of psychological harm to them that children of tender years should be forced to learn a second language which is not their home language.</P>
    <P>This view has been expressed in public by a very responsible psychologist. It has never been denied, or <Col N="1614" /> effectively denied, by any person who wishes to maintain the present system. Until it is denied and established on adequate proof that it is incorrect, there is at present evidence which, to my mind, is coercive to establish that it does psychological harm to young children to be required to learn a second language.  Of course, it retards them in their ordinary educational work.</P>
    <P>The children in the city of Dublin for the most part get education up to the age of 14 years and for those few years at school they are dependent on getting what education they can to prepare them for the struggle of life.  It is wrong that they should be required to learn the Irish language for such length of time during that period.  If it could be said that the present system, which has operated since this State was founded, was a success and that the result has been that we are now speaking the Irish language, then you could justify it on the grounds of those who support the revival of the language, but, on any ground, on any test that is applied, it is clear that the present system has been a lamentable failure.</P>
    <P>It is time also for those who are in favour of reviving the language as a spoken language in this country no longer to accept what was regarded as a principle and raised to a dogma that the Irish language can be revived only through the medium of our schools.  If the Irish language is to be revived, it will be revived because the people want to do it, because they like it, because they want it, because they believe in it.  That is the only way the Irish language can be revived.  It will not be revived by forcing it down the throats of our children in the national school, when they never use it once they leave school.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which public opinion has become more considerably agitated in recent years is the problem of mentally handicapped children, a problem which up to very recently has been largely ignored in this country, one of those problems which have been a social disgrace in this country for so many years.  It is a problem to which the public conscience is now becoming alive and steps are now being taken to try to do <Col N="1615" /> something about it.  It is an immense problem.  It is an extraordinary fact, one of those facts that are ignored, kept hidden, pushed under the table, so that if possible it may be forgotten, that we have in this country literally thousands of children who do not get the specialised training necessary for them because they have been born with some defect, because they are retarded or because of some psychological <i>malaise</i> in their make-up.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of such children.  Any Deputy who has any experience of the national schools or who talks to teachers will know the problem of the child who is put at the back of the class and who everybody knows should be getting special care and treatment.  Everybody who has come in contact with the kind of child who is below that intelligence quotient, who has not even been able to go to school but stays at home with his mother, a mother who has generally got the tremendous task of bringing up a family as well as looking after the mentally retarded child, appreciates the difficulties of the situation. There is nowhere for them to go.  There are thousands of mentally retarded children who cannot be got into our hospitals because there are no places for them.</P>
    <P>Steps have been taken and a commission has been set up.  I sincerely hope the Minister will not allow, as so frequently happens in these matters, the establishment of a commission to be an excuse for doing nothing and for shelving the problem for a couple of years until the commission has reported.  You are dealing with human lives and if, even in the space of the next couple of years, some special training is made available for even 100 children who otherwise would not have got the service, something good will have been done.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Minister has recently established a special six months' course for training national teachers who would be prepared to take up this work.  I do not know what the outcome of that has been.  I would be very much surprised if he did not get a great number of applications <Col N="1616" /> for this course.  My only regret is that it seems to be limited to a small number and limited in time. This is not one of these insoluble problems.  It is not one of these problems that merely involve lack of resources. This is a problem with which we can deal if we go the right way about it.  We can deal with it within our resources because it would not need a fantastic amount of money to bring about a proper system for looking after our mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>One further aspect of the matter of education to which I wish to refer very briefly is the question of punishment in schools.  Everybody appreciates the difficulty under which teachers very frequently have to labour.  Everybody appreciates the problem of overpopulated classes, the difficulties facing the teachers sometimes in very unsatisfactory conditions, ill-heated establishments, and so on.  Everybody can understand if sometimes human frailty gets the better of their judgement. However, it does happen that no matter what the regulations say, children are unjustly punished and assaults perhaps of a serious nature take place which should never take place.  It is not sufficient for the matter to be referred to the Department, for the Minister to say he has investigated it and has taken proper steps or some steps to remedy it.  It is not sufficient to say he has brought it to the notice of managers and to teachers that the regulations provide that such-and-such steps should be taken.  There is the old saying that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The parent who has had his child unlawfully assaulted, who sees the teacher continuing in the same school, apparently without anything having happened, is a discontented person. There should be some system of complaint which would lead to an impartial investigation of an assault. This complaint should go before some impartial tribunal whose findings would be published.  The matter should not be dealt with behind closed doors as at present.  That is wrong.  There is a volume of evidence <Col N="1617" /> to show that unjustifiable assaults do take place and the public is naturally concerned and troubled about it. It is a matter in which a balance has to be maintained.  There is no doubt that the teachers have a difficult task but it does happen sometimes that they go too far, that things are too lax, and they are allowed to continue in certain instances where injustices are done.  That situation should not be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to the National Gallery.  The country is very fortunate that the Shaw Bequest has enabled the Trustees of the National Gallery to expand greatly their purchases for the National Gallery.  We have an excellent body of Trustees in the National Gallery and they can be relied upon by the public to purchase pictures for the nation which will be suitable and will adorn our Gallery.  However, the Minister and the Government, and particularly perhaps the Department of Finance, should not regard the money from the Shaw Bequest as a means by which grants from the Government can be cut down.  The money from the Shaw Bequest should be used for the purchase of pictures. If there are desirable items of expenditure&mdash;and I am certain there are &mdash;the Trustees of the Gallery should not be informed that the money is available in the Shaw Bequest for this purpose.</P>
    <P>One item on which much more money should be spent is on advertising the treasures in our Galleries.  There are very fine pictures in the National Gallery and in the Municipal Gallery but there are very few tourist brochures I have seen in which any reference is made to either of the Galleries.  It is a matter that the Minister should take up with his colleagues.  I wonder have any of my colleagues in this House travelled back from London, as I have done, and been given a booklet or pamphlet in the plane showing the sights to be seen in Dublin.  They are all rather uninteresting commercial places.  I am not going to mention them.  Deputies probably know all of them.  It is generally true to say that in our tourist literature very little is said <Col N="1618" /> about the National Gallery or the Municipal Gallery.</P>
    <P>Most other capital cities that have national galleries advertise them in the streets.  It is not done here.  It would be a matter of very slight expenditure and one in which the Department should interest itself so as to bring the treasures in our Galleries to the notice not only of our own public but of our visitors.  They are something of which we can be justly proud.  They add something to our national life and in this instance we are certainly hiding our light under a bushel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us here are pleased to hear the Minister tell us in his opening speech of the increase that has been given to teachers and the extra money being spent on school building and maintenance.  Deputy Johnston congratulated the Minister on the increase in school building and seemed to think that the building of schools was the be-all and the end-all of education.  If Deputy Hillery were the Minister for Local Government he could still build schools.  The important thing is education itself.  I trust when his record is examined when he leaves the Department of Education he will have attributed to him an improvement in the educational system rather than the building of so many schools and that alone.</P>
      <P>The efforts to make classes smaller are very welcome.  They tend to improve educational facilities in this country.  We also welcome the announcement of the course to train teachers who, in turn, will train mentally subnormal children.  That also is an advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become traditional in this House over a number of years to talk in an airy-fairy way about our high standards of education and, after making these few references, to go on to talk about the Irish language and to make either a virulent attack on it or else a strong defence of it.  I do not propose this year to talk at any great length about the Irish language because if the Minister for Education, the Taoiseach and the members of the Government have not an idea as to what Deputies think about the teaching <Col N="1619" /> of the Irish language and the revival of the Irish language, then they know nothing.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows my view and the view of Deputy Esmonde and the views of others who have spoken on this Estimate year after year and have given these views consistently. Deputy D. Costello's reference to the Irish language and his speech is an indication of the frustration of a number of people because of the methods by which successive Governments have sought to revive the Irish language.  If the Minister could make any sort of change in that respect, still keeping in mind the revival of the language, his name would go down in history.  There is dissatisfaction every place about it and I am sure even in the Minister's Party.  I can appreciate the reluctance to say so.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not tell us there has been any eminent success, so far as the revival is concerned, not since he came into office, but in the past 25 or 30 years.  There has been a diminishing Gaeltacht and no seeming improvement in the speaking of the language in Dublin or Kiltimagh or any other place.  However, I may be falling into the bad habit I complained of, when opening my speech.  I do not intend now to say what I said before about speaking the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an important Ministry. Ordinary though it may seem to many people, it is very important.  His officials and the teachers are there to equip the youth of this country to make a way in life and to make a living for themselves.  There is no need, therefore, to stress the importance of primary education.  In the first place, it is primary education but, more important still, it is the only type of education the majority of the boys and girls in this country receive.  For that reason, the highest importance should be attached to it.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister ever considered the method by which our teachers are trained?  I do not talk about the actual training but the atmosphere in which they are trained.  I do not want to appear to criticise the training colleges <Col N="1620" /> but the Minister ought to consider loosening the atmosphere in these colleges and not have it so rigid. Consider the freedom university students have.  Some of them, I suppose it might be said, have too much freedom.  However, a certain amount of strict control is exercised in these places where teachers are trained.</P>
    <P>It has often been said&mdash;and let me whisper it&mdash;that teachers are sometimes regarded as boys among men and men among boys.  The students ought to be allowed to get more experience of the world.  There are strict rules as to when they may go out and when they should come back.  I am speaking now of young men up to their early twenties.  They are treated like young schoolboys in a preparatory or secondary school.  The Minister should look into that aspect.  They ought to have a little more experience of life and of the world.  They should be allowed to come and go in a freer way than I am led to believe is the case at present.  I am not saying anything against the teaching they receive.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister thinks about the primary school programme. He must see some significance in the fact that the primary school programme was drafted in, I think, 1926 and modified to some extent in 1934.  Has it changed much since?  Has there been any radical change in the programme for primary education since 1934?  Surely we have had many changes in education since 1934?  We certainly have had changes in the world and in this country but we are still operating under the same programme as modified in 1934.  Education should consist of something more than a sort of machine process.  The parents should enter much more into primary education. The only contact there seems to be between the parents of the children of this country and the teachers is when there is some sort of row or when they believe their children have been wrongfully punished&mdash;in short, when they have a row with the teacher.</P>
    <P>Nobody ever seems to encourage the parents to take an interest in the education of their young boys and girls.  I want to repeat what I said on the last <Col N="1621" /> few Estimates.  Nobody in this country seems to be concerned about vocational guidance.  Pupils are turned out with their Primary Certificate, their Intermediate Certificate or their Leaving Certificate at 17 or 18.  They have a certificate in their hands, a certificate that means very little at present.  Vocational guidance has been advocated by some people in the country who seem to realise its importance.</P>
    <P>Vocational guidance is practised to a very large extent in many countries in Europe&mdash;in France, Britain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and so on. All these countries are concerned about the occupations their young boys and girls will engage in.  There is consultation between the parents and the teachers, with the Department of Education in these various countries entering into it, to try to ensure that these young boys and girls will not be sent into blind-alley jobs.  Going through the primary school, they have no idea, at that age, of what they will be.  The tragedy is that all they seem to be required to do in the secondary school is to get a bit of paper to show they have a Leaving Certificate.  Most of them become clerks who are badly paid.  Most of them have not the opportunity of going to the university and therefore end up in a blind-alley job.</P>
    <P>If, about 14 years of age, our pupils were guided into some avenue of education, and trained for a job for which they would be equipped, they would be of use to themselves, to their homes and to the country.  I believe that in the vocational section of education there seems to be an attempt to guide children.  It does not seem to me any attempt is made in educational establishments here to advise boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 as to what subjects they should study or what occupation they should take up when they leave school.  The Minister must take the initiative in this.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to have a talk with about 15 young boys doing their Leaving Certificate.  Subsequently, they got very good marks.  But I asked them, as a matter of interest, what they were going to be.  Not one of them had an idea of what he he was going to <Col N="1622" /> be.  Nobody had suggested to him that he might pursue particular subjects, with a view to having a scientific career or taking up some clerical or administrative position.  That is the usual pattern throughout the country.  Unless they get into the University after the Leaving Certificate, they do not know what they are going to be.  Otherwise, because they have the Leaving Certificate and a good standard of education, they are taken up by members of a profession I shall not name to act as clerks for 30/- a week.  They endure it for a couple of years, because 30/- is a big sum compared with the 5/- pocket money they used to get, but after that they go to England.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make an effort to ensure, with the co-operation of educational authorities and parents, that there will be some system of vocational guidance.  In case anybody should misunderstand what I mean, I should say I do not want a system of direction.  What I want is vocational guidance rather than vocational direction. This body I hope will be established would advise young persons what subjects they should take up if they wished to become, say, engineers or tradesmen.  It does not necessarily mean that they must follow that advice but at least it will help them to make up their minds.  They will be told that this body, representative of the Department, the teachers and the parents, believes they are best suited for a particular job and they will be told what the prospects are.</P>
    <P>As far as primary and secondary education are concerned, the Minister should endeavour to establish the teaching of civics in the schools.  I do not think it would upset the school programme.  I do not suggest it should be taught every day, every week or even every month.  Our children do not seem to have much idea of a civic spirit at present.  Whether it is in Ennis, Wexford, Dublin or Gorey, they still mutilate trees and damage public property. Every Sunday, when they seem to have more pocket money, or, perhaps, every Friday when they get their pay, the streets of our towns and cities are littered with the wrappings from lollypops and everything else.  One is <Col N="1623" /> ashamed of the condition of our streets.  We are aspiring to be a major tourist country, but if a foreigner saw the condition of our streets, he would get a very poor impression.  In every town where the city fathers plant ornamental trees and shrubs, these plants are mutilated within a week. The electric light bulbs in the E.S.B. standards are broken.  I probably did the same when I was a boy and probably the Minister was no different from anybody else and behaved in the same way, but it is a fair comment to say we did not know any better because nobody told us any better.</P>
    <P>The retort may be that this is a job for the parents.  That is true to some extent, but these things could be put in a much clearer way in the schools. It need not be done by the teachers alone.  Is there anything to prevent a local government official giving a talk to these children and telling them that every time they multilate trees or do any damage to public property, the town in which they live has to pay for it.  They should be told that that means their parents will have to pay a little more in their rates.  These children have no idea of what rates mean. If the Minister could induce somebody to give such a talk to a class even once a year, I believe it would do tremendous good.  I believe he should consider the idea.</P>
    <P>I pass now to secondary education. Primary education is important, as I have said, because the vast majority of our people do not go beyond the primary school.  Too few of our children get a secondary education. In the majority of cases, they cannot afford it; or they may be able to afford it, but their people cannot afford not to have them at work.  That is the important thing.  There has been a lot of talk in recent years about scholarships.  I did not note in the Minister's speech any revolutionary change in respect of scholarships. I must confess I was somewhat disappointed that the Minister did not announce a tremendous scheme to develop secondary and university education here.  I do not know how many secondary pupils we have.  I <Col N="1624" /> suppose we have some tens of thousands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 76,000 secondary pupils here.  The number of scholarships awarded to secondary schools by county and county borough councils on the examinations of 1957, was a miserable 572.  I think the State and the local councils could afford more.  The Minister would do well if he accepted the introduction of some State schemes whereby many more scholarships could be given for secondary education because 572 in a country of our population seems to me to be pretty niggardly.  In the local councils we are able to provide money to assist other sections of the community but the most we can afford for secondary scholarships all over the country is the funds necessary to provide 572 scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer and to which some other Deputies referred&mdash;the position of the teacher in the secondary schools.  The Minister announced that he was going to supplement the salary of a secondary teacher in the first year of teaching to the extent of £200.  As it is, the secondary teacher in his first year is not allowed to take up an incremental position and in most cases he is dependent on a salary of some £200 to £250 per annum.  The Minister says now, if I understand it correctly, that he will supplement that to the tune of £200 per annum, making the salary £450.  I wonder does the Minister mean that will be applied for the first year only and does he assume that every secondary teacher obtains an incremental post after his first year? I do not think it is the case generally. Perhaps the Minister when replying would say whether or not that £200 will continue until the teacher in question obtains an incremental post, because it is a well known fact that many of them do not obtain these posts for quite a long time.  The Minister, bearing in mind the sort of world we live in, seems to be very pleased with the extra number of people taking science in secondary schools.  I do <Col N="1625" /> not think he has any reason to be too enthusiastic about the number taking science in the secondary schools, or pursuing science in any of its particular branches up to, say, the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>We have not received much recent information on it but I gather that in 1958 3,668 boys did the Leaving Certificate and of those 854 did chemistry, 818 took science, 265 did general science, 242 agricultural science and 107 did botany.  These do not seem to be spectacular figures and, as far as the secondary schools are concerned, we should not generalise so much in our courses.  I assume the circumstances are the same as when I was going to school when, for the Leaving Certificate, and indeed for the Intermediate Certificate, there was a veritable host of subjects.  You had the three branches of mathematics, Irish, English, history, geography, science and all these subjects.  The Minister should encourage these pupils to specialise from the Intermediate Certificate up to Leaving Certificate. It is difficult to ask these boys and girls who do their Leaving Certificate to get honours in three subjects, from mathematics, Irish, English, history, geography, science, commerce, Latin or Greek and a few other subjects. They should be encouraged to aim at passing a lot of these subjects which are not going to do them any good. We could include a certain amount of history and geography in these subjects which are not going to benefit them in later life.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have regard to the age in which we live.  Everybody has decided we should pursue education in the scientific and engineering fields and let us concentrate on those subjects.  I should like to see students specialising in them.  I do not know what the system is in Britain but I know they are encouraged to specialise in subjects which would be of use to them in after life rather than to get honours in these academic subjects which may be all right for general education but which are not going to be much use to them in the occupations they will follow in later years.  The result of our present <Col N="1626" /> system is that a boy having obtained his Leaving Certificate goes into a university with a good general education but as soon as he goes into the university he is expected to specialise immediately.  His training for specialisation should be started after he has done his Intermediate Certificate. Whether it is science, commerce, or any of the languages, he should be specially equipped in regard to the particular subject so that he may pursue that specialisation expected of him when he goes to the university.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to know a lot about vocational education but I think the various local committees are to be complimented on the advances they have made in recent years with, one might say, the limited resources they have.  Students should also be encouraged to specialise in the vocational schools.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever considered it but vocational education has been described as the poor man's university.</P>
    <P>I wonder should the Minister endeavour to go a little further and try to make it possible for students who attain a certain standard in vocational education to enter the university from the vocational schools?  The Minister should consider that.  It would not be unreasonable to allow them to specialise in particular branches of education in order to enter the university. I do not know if we still have the stupid rule in our system, which dates far back, that even if you get honours in Irish, English, mathematics, and other subjects, if you have not passed in Latin you do not get into the University.  That is a stupid rule but whether it obtains now or not I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for medical students alone.  As a matter of fact, to be a barrister in this country, you must have Latin as well.  I certainly would like to support the idea of the provision of more scholarships for university education.  I know there are cranks in this country who will ask: &ldquo;Where will we get the money?&rdquo;  Others will ask: &ldquo;What will we do with all our university students when they graduate?&rdquo;<Col N="1627" /> My point is that in the vast majority of cases it is money which determines who goes to university. Therefore, no one can say there are equal opportunities for boys and girls to pursue a particular course, provided they have the intelligence to do so. What I ask for, therefore, is that more scholarships be provided in order that those who are deemed to be fit&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash;may pursue university courses.  That would ensure that those who are able for it will get the best education and will, we hope, give the best services to the country.</P>
      <P>The latest report of the Department of Education is the 1957/58 Report, although we have not had a printers' strike for years.  Some one said we were very generous with education, that we provide free primary education and give what can be described as generous capitation grants to secondary schools but it is a case of &ldquo;thus far shall we go and no further.&rdquo;  The system we have operated is such that we leave the provision of university scholarships to the local authorities. What do they do?  They behave in much the same way as they do in the provision of home assistance for destitute people.  It is the very last thing they will consider.</P>
      <P>According to the report, 111 scholarships are awarded by county or county borough councils.  I assume that is the correct figure.  The ratepayers of this country can afford only 111 scholarships in one year.  I think scholarships are a good investment, not only for the local authorities but for the State.  I was amazed when I read that figure in the report.  I am certain it has not improved since.  I do not think Wexford County Council has become any more generous in the last four years.  I think Wexford County Council still provided only four scholarships; Galway five; and Leitrim two; and so on.  That is what we do for our youth who cannot afford to go any further than secondary school.  We say: &ldquo;There are the 111 scholarships and the boys can scramble for them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister do anything about it?  The Government are providing <Col N="1628" /> this year, as I had occasion to say recently, about £5,500,000 to make cows healthy.  I do not object to that. I appreciate that we would not have the money for education, or anything else, if we have not healthy cattle.  But if we can expend that sort of money on the cattle industry, if we can give grants to people to establish industries, if we can give grants amounting to millions, without a means test, to hotel owners to build hotels, to enlarge, renovate or reconstruct hotels, surely we can do something to educate those who cannot afford to educate themselves and ensure they get the best education possible.  We can spend money in every direction but, when it comes to university education, we can do nothing apart from what is given in the general Vote.</P>
    <P>When one advocates that more university scholarships should be provided, it may be asked: &ldquo;Why should the taxpayer send these fellows to university and pay for their education?&rdquo; At present, so far as I am aware, 71 per cent. of the cost of educating pupils in the university&mdash;in one university at least&mdash;is paid by the State. What I want to ensure, therefore, is that those who are deemed to be fit can pursue a university course and have a reasonable chance of taking the course.</P>
    <P>I think I heard the Minister say in a speech some time ago that he was introducing a scheme of grants for university education.  I do not think I saw any reference to it in his speech on this Vote.</P>

      <P>It would have been a great help and would have prevented much talk from people like me if the Minister had given some indication in his speech as to what he proposes to do in respect of those grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other matters were brought to my notice and perhaps I can dispose of them pretty quickly.  I should like to support the plea made by Deputy P. Byrne on behalf of the secondary teachers.  I am informed that secondary teachers who have been in employment in Britain and return to this <Col N="1629" /> country get no credit for their service in Britain whilst, on the other hand, Irish teachers who take incremental posts in Britain get credit for the years they have served in this country.  There should be some sort of reciprocal arrangement.  The Minister for Defence told us he co-operated to the extent of sending witnesses to the Six Counties to give evidence to the effect that certain Irish people were getting I.R.A. pensions and at the same time drawing national assistance.  If the Minister for Defence can give that sort of co-operation to do harm to Irish people, then surely we could have some system of co-operation with Great Britain in an effort to do good to Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also have another look at the capitation grants paid to secondary schools.  The last adjustment, I am informed, was with regard to junior pupils in the secondary schools&mdash;I assume, up to the Intermediate Certificate standard.  That adjustment was made in 1954 when the capitation grant was raised from £7, at which it was fixed in 1926, to £11.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that money values have changed and the expenditure in secondary schools is now much greater than it was in 1954.  There must be a case for an increase in the capitation grants in the secondary schools.  They must teach science, and all the subjects usually included under the heading of science.  The Minister will appreciate the expense on the secondary schools of providing the equipment to ensure that pupils will get the best possible training in these subjects.</P>

Táimíd cineál tuirseach den seanphort seafóideach &mdash;&ldquo;Compulsory Irish; cramming Irish down the children's throats, ramming Irish down the necks <Col N="1630" /> of the poor children&rdquo; agus ladús den saghas sin.  Tabharfad solaoid do lucht an ghliogair sin a léireodh dóibh nach ollphiast mar a tuairisc an t-arrachtach seo atá ag dó na geirbe iontu.  Níl inti ach créatúirín bocht séimh ná dearna díobháil ar bith d'aon duine, óg ná aosta, a thug gean nó cion don Náisiún.  Seo í an tsolaoid.</P>
      <P>Tá trí scoil i mBaile Mór na hInse i gCo. an Chláir agus tá ceann eile i ngiorracht trí choiscéim dhreoilín den áras inar rugadh an tAire.  Múintear gach ábhar trí Ghaeilge sna scoileanna sin, agus bliain i ndiaidh bliana gnóthaíonn daltaí na scoileanna atá i dtreis agam breis agus trian de na scoláireachtaí a dháiltear de thoradh na Meán-Teiste agus na hÁrd-Teiste. Cruthaíonn si nár chuir an &ldquo;Ollphiast&rdquo; dallamullóg ná mearbhall ar mheabhair na leanbh a oileadh sna scoileanna sin.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Ua Coisdealbha ag caint anseo cúpla nóiméad ó shin dúirt sé go raibh fealsamh cáiliúil ann a dúirt go ndéanann teagasc dhá-theangach díobháil do leanaí óga.  Trua liom nár luaigh sé ainm an fhealsaimh an-aithnid seo, ach, b'fhéidir gurbh fhearr leis é a cheilt.  Ba mhaith liom a mheabhrú dó go raibh iliomad fealsamh ag Seán Buí a chruthnaigh a mhalairt.  Tagadh sé siar liom thar bóithrín coirceach na staire&mdash;siar go Reacht Chill Chainnigh&mdash;agus uaidh sin aniar trí gach reacht is aindlí a choise ar Ghaela a dteanga féin a labhairt is chífidh sé toradh saothair fealsamh Sheáin Bhuí.  Ríomh mé a ngíomhartha sa Tigh seo anuraidh, is ní rún liom aithris a dhéanamh ar an méid adúras an tráth úd.  Ba mhaith liom, ámh, an ceathrú a dingeadh de rinn bhata isteach i gcluasa agus i meabhair leanaí a tógadh le Gaeilge a thabhairt dó.  Seo é é:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I thank the goodness and the grace</P>
      <P>That as my youth hath smiled</P>
      <P>To make me in my early days</P>
      <P>An happy English child.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Ó Loingsigh ag caint do leig sé don nimhneachas atá aige d'iar-Aire áirithe é a dhalladh ar an bhfírinne.  Dúirt sé gur dúnadh De La Salle d'aon ghnó chun rud éigin nach feasach dom a agairt ar <Col N="1631" /> Chumann na Múinteoirí.  Ní hamhlaidh a bhí.  A mhalairt ar fad a bhí ann.  Oileadh an oiread san múinteoirí an tráth úd nach raibh ionad ná folúntas dóibh i scoil ar bith.  Oileadh iad ar chostas an Stáit is ní dheachaigh cuid acu le múinteoireacht riamh cheal folúntas sna scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé tagairt do bhrat na hÉirestail agus chuir sé an milleán ar an Aire céanna.  Fiafraím de cé ghearr an tuarastal agus cé rinne foghail ar Chiste na bPinsean?</P>
    <P>Rinne sé tagairt do bhrat no hÉireann sna scoileanna is thuigeas óna chainnt go raibh sé ag iarraidh milleán a chur ar an Aire ina thaobh.  Ní call dó ach strac-fhéachaint a thabhairt <Col N="1632" /> thar a ghualainn agus, mura bhfuil breall orm chífidh sé duine mór dá Pháirtí féin adúirt tráth amháin &ldquo;nach sléachtfadh sé don tseanacheirt go deo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bhí daoine ag cur síos ar Chlár na mBun-Scoileanna anseo inniu agus is léir óna gcaint nach eol dóibh dada ina thaobh.  Molaim an Clár is molaim ní hamháin an tAire ach gach Aire a ghabh roimhe, cé nach réitím le cuid acu i gcúrsaí polaitíochta. Bhíodar uilig dílis don Náisiún.</P>
