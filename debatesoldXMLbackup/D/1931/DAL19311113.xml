    <Title>Finance (Increase of Income Tax) Bill 1931&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we pass this Bill I would like to make a few observations. I want for my own information, for the information of the House, and for the information of the public who are interested in the matter, to know what is going to happen in connection with the collection of income tax this year.  It will be in the recollection of those who did me the honour to listen to me the other day that I drew attention to certain peculiar hardships in the collection of income tax which seemed likely to arise in this particular year.  I raised two distinct points with only one of which the Minister dealt yesterday.  I want to be quite clear about what is going to happen.  I want the Minister to correct me if I am wrong.  As I understand, the point arises in respect of assessments of British and foreign investments. I understand I was right in assuming that under the provisions of Section 11 of the Act of 1929 the assessment will be made on the basis of the preceding year.  I am now dealing with my first point which arose where investments were transferred from British to Saorstát Eireann <Col N="1526" /> securities.  In that case, as I understood from what the Minister said yesterday, the assessment will still be made on the basis of the preceding year, and relief will subsequently be given as a matter of course, and as a matter of right, on application to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so, I have nothing further to say about it, but I want to appeal to him to consider the other point to which he did not refer.  It has nothing to do with the exchange of investments, but has to do with the falling off of the proceeds of British or foreign investments this year, as compared with the preceding year.  Let us take an example.  Assuming that a man last year received £100 from British investments and that this year these same investments only bring in £30.  That is not an exaggerated proportion when we remember that many companies have either passed their dividends altogether or reduced them, and many have not even been able to pay anything on their preference capital.  Obviously that is likely to create very considerable hardship. Had this occurred last year there would have been a certain measure of relief because, under Section 4 of the Finance Act of last year, where such income was less by more than 20 per cent. than it was in the preceding year, certain reliefs were available. That provision is not found either in the present Finance Bill or in the earlier Finance Bill of this year.  Consequently whether people are aware of it or not, the inspectors will have no option but to assess the taxpayer in the case I have taken on 70 per cent. more than he actually received.  I know the answer is that if it had gone the other way, and that if a taxpayer in a particular year got £100 where he previously got £30, he would be assessed on £30.  Therefore he must take the rough with the smooth, taking one year with another, what he lost in the roundabouts he would gain on the swings.  In normal times that would be a perfectly fair answer and I would have no quarrel with it.  In a general way the change that was made in 1909 was for the general convenience and advantage of everyone concerned. <Col N="1527" /> I impress upon the Minister in the peculiar circumstances of this year, and in view of the notorious fact that people's incomes are seriously affected by the general trade slump which has taken place, that he might take an opportunity of re-introducing the mitigating clause which was contained in the Act of last year, so that some measure of relief will be available for people whose incomes this year are being very seriously affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this Bill except to address myself to a few personal remarks which the Minister for Industry and Commerce made on this day week.  I am sorry the Minister is not here.  The Minister was not here when I was speaking on the Financial Resolution.  Quite obviously he was not aware of the trend of my remarks or of the trend of the remarks of the Minister for Finance.  One of the statements made by the Minister for Finance was that the reason why the Currency Commission, presumably with the acquiescence of the Government, had decided to remain on the gold standard, was that if they had an independent currency in this country certain difficulties would be set up in the way of trade between ourselves and Great Britain.  What I had in mind to say was&mdash;and I admit that my remarks as reported are not as clear and as lucid as they might have been, as I was speaking extempore&mdash;that, as the balance of trade was against us, naturally greater difficulties would arise in the case of those goods which were imported as compared with the goods which were exported.  Naturally if we import approximately £12,000,000 worth of goods more than we export, any handicap which the ordinary operations of arbitrage might create for traders in that matter would react most heavily upon the trader who was selling most.  As Great Britain sells more to us than we do to her, naturally if there were independent currencies the very fact that these difficulties would arise would tend to restrict the excessive import of goods into the Twenty-Six Counties.  It will <Col N="1528" /> be quite clear that that is what I had in mind, if my speech is read and if the speech of the Minister for Finance is read.</P>
      <P>I do not really make this statement because of anything that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in regard to any theories which I put forward in this House.  So far as his interventions in debates here are concerned, marked as they always are with the element of bitter personality, they have about as much effect here and in the country as those unpleasant little insects which sometimes inflict themselves even upon the most cleanly persons in public places.  His remarks are generally highly coloured and slightly venomous but have little lasting effect.  So far as the flea-bite dialectics of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are concerned, I have only to say that he of all others should not talk about the Midas touch.</P>

It dealt with a Constituent Assembly, Article 11 of the Constitution, Deputy Lemass as Minister for Defence, raids on Mountjoy for prisoners, the personal characteristics of Deputy Davin, Deputy Lemass and myself.

      <P>He, of all persons, should not have the hardihood to refer to Midas in this matter, because whatever other faculties posterity, if it remembers him, will ascribe to him, it certainly will not say he had the faculty of turning everything he touched into gold.  He had the idea once of converting the waters of the Shannon into another Pactolus.  He <Col N="1529" /> got his new toy and with the usual petty personality, like the small boy he is, when he got the new toy he had, on account of a certain petty spleen, to set himself to break it.  The country can judge the Minister, this wagerer of lost reputations, by the critical position to which he has brought the Shannon Scheme, in which such a large amount of the country's resources have been invested, and on which so large an amount of public hope was founded.</P>
      <P>Leaving the Minister for Industry and Commerce to one side, I still contend that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was aware of the trend of trade between us and Great Britain, particularly during the last four months, he would not even have attempted to make the misrepresentation that he made of my speech.  Because even if we had set up an independent currency, and if we tried to remain, so far as we were able, on the gold standard, nevertheless the tendency of trade between us and Great Britain during the past three months would have been such that we would have to take steps to restrict the quantity of imports, particularly the quantity of luxury imports.</P>
      <P>The important point about it is that if we had had an independent currency the people would have been able to see the danger signal, and would have been able to see the danger from the moment we had the prescience to cut ourselves adrift from the currency of Great Britain.  The fact of the matter is, as a study of the figures will indicate, that for a considerable period of years we have not been paying our way in our trade relationships with Great Britain, that we have been living upon our capital, and that a good deal of the excess imports, which have been the characteristic feature of our trade returns from year to year, have been paid for by the realisation of investments abroad and by the sale of industries at home.  That is why the British millers were able to come here and buy the biggest flour mills in the country.  That is why one by one, industries like our tobacco industry and others, have passed into the hands of and are now under the control of foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> One of the greatest disadvantages which the policy of the Government has placed this country under, is that it has no economic barometer.  It has nothing which will indicate the economic position of our people <i>vis-a-vis</i> Great Britain and other countries. I do not regard the rate of exchange as being a trade regulator.  In view of the developments in currency management, and in view of the interferences which have taken place in all countries with the free operation of gold exchange, I do not think that the rate of exchange can any longer serve as a regulator.  It does serve as an indicator and as an instrument which will show the economic trend.  If we had had such an indicator here, I believe the fact that our currency would tend always, in view of our excessive imports, to stand at a discount as compared with sterling, would compel the Government, in spite of themselves, and in spite of the considerable body of importers in the country who support them, to take steps to protect our native industry, and to restrict the flow of imports into this country.  In particular, it would have compelled them to take very drastic measures during the past four or five months to do that.</P>
    <P>I would ask any Deputy who is concerned in the question, to refer to the trade returns for July, August and September of this year.  For the month of July the adverse trade balance was £1,616,000; in August it was £410,000 and in September £971,000, giving a total of £2,992,000 for the three months. In every month there has been a tremendous decline in the amount of goods exported by us.  There has been a very large increase in the adverse trade balance for the past three months.  The Government remained inactive, but I do not believe that if we had had an independent currency the people would have permitted them to remain inactive, because then the people would have seen whether they were going and what was going to be the inevitable consequence of the Government's policy.  If we had an independent currency in September when Great Britain went off the gold standard, there would have been <Col N="1531" /> possibly a relative improvement in our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> British currency, but, nevertheless, on these figures, unless something drastic had been done, our currency would tend to be at a discount as compared with sterling.</P>
    <P>If we wanted to protect our gold reserve&mdash;most countries want to protect it, and make no mistake about it no country has willingly gone off the gold standard, no country that values its reputation, no country that is a buyer in foreign markets and that has to carry on a foreign trade went willingly off the gold standard&mdash;if we wanted to protect our gold reserves&mdash; and we should have&mdash;if we wanted to be honest people buying no more than could be paid for, and were anxious to safeguard the interests of the community, then we would have been compelled either to stop the export of gold to meet the balance which would be required to meet the adverse trade balance or we would have been compelled to stop the import of foreign manufactures.  That is precisely the position which would have existed here.  It is the position which I had in mind and which I wished to indicate to the House when speaking extempore on Friday last.  It is clear from the tenour of my remarks that I had two things in mind: First of all that the arbitrage difficulties created would be in favour of our people, taking the community as a whole; and in so far as they would tend to put difficulties in the way of excessive imports, then to the extent that these excessive imports were imports of manufactured commodities, they would tend to help our home manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Secondly, taking into consideration the Ministry that we have now, and would have had then, even if we had gone off the gold standard, then by reason of the fact that we have in power a Government whose dominating principle is the principle of inertia, of being unable to do anything unless they are driven to do it, we would still have between ourselves and Great Britain a depreciated currency, a currency which would have to be maintained, if not by exporting our gold, <Col N="1532" /> then by restricting our imports of manufactures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Law's point, the position in regard to change of investments is as I indicated.  The Deputy, I think, clearly understands that there will be no double charge on any income.  If the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that there is in any case, as a result of a change of investments, a double charge under any of the existing provisions relief will be given.  Of course, the Deputy understands that they have to be satisfied that there has been a change of investments and that the facts are as stated in the case.  If they are so satisfied relief will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other point that the Deputy raised on the question of charging on the basis of the preceding year, nothing can be done on that.  As a result of frequent representations we decided to adopt the basis of the preceding year in 1929.  For the first year, certain relief was given to cover any transitional hardships that might arise, but it was not contemplated that we should in effect lower the tax by continuing to give relief in the case of a falling income.  The position is, as the Deputy put it, that people have got to take the rough with the smooth. As regards all incomes, which were formerly assessed on the basis of three years' average and these formed a great part of the income that was liable to tax, the factor which the Deputy referred to always existed.  It frequently happened in the old days that a business which made no profit at all was liable to income tax because in the two years previous there had been perhaps good profits made.  Unless we were to have all incomes charged on the basis of the actual year of assessment which would, of course, present great difficulties and tremendous financial complications, we must really to some extent ignore these hardships.  They are something inevitable in the working of this scheme. There is no provision in the Act.  That is intentional and it would not be possible to put any provisions in now even if we were desirous of doing so, <Col N="1533" /> because that would again cause delays and would tend to defeat the purpose of the Bill which is to go some distance towards closing the gap that has appeared in the Budget.</P>
    <P>With reference to Deputy MacEntee's statement, I think the real fact is the Deputy is so anxious to prove that the Government is wrong and neglectful that he did not mind his step and that, as on another stage of the Bill, he talked about the matter without having given thought to it and he walked into a somewhat obvious blunder.  I do not know that the Deputy yet has thought over the matter to any great extent, that he has done more than to try to find something that he might advance with some appearance of plausibility against the policy of the Government. The Deputy should have seen that even the statement he made this morning will not bear any examination, that if we have any adverse balance of trade taking all the factors into account, the invisible as well as the visible factors, certainly the amount, if we could calculate all these factors, does not seem to be very considerable.</P>
    <P>The position is that whatever adverse balance, if any there is, is being paid for by the realisation of capital and none of the checks, the safeguards or the indicator instruments that the Deputy refers to, would operate to any extent so long as there is a big invested capital abroad which can be realised.  That is really the governing factor in this position, that there is a huge Saorstát investment abroad. If there was a very much larger adverse trade balance than there is any reason to think of, none of these barometers, indicators or checks would operate appreciably because any currency difficulty that might arise could be overcome by the realisation of some fraction of this vast investment of capital abroad.  The currency difficulties, such as the Deputy indicates, would only arise where a country has not these investments abroad, where if there is an adverse balance of trade, there is an immediate strain on the currency which cannot be met in any other <Col N="1534" /> way than by the immediate creation of a serious difference in the rate of exchange.  The Deputy seems still to think that there would be some advantage in our remaining on the gold standard when our next door neighbour with whom our trade principally exists, had gone off it.  I notice that he indicates that if we had a store of gold here, and if a certain situation arose, we would have to stop exporting gold, that is, we would have to go off the gold standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Minister in that statement.  I am not saying that we should always remain on the gold standard, but I say that we should have a currency which would be independent of Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that we should have an independent currency simply for the purpose of being able to do by some definite act here, what has been done automatically.  I do not want to go into this thing.  It is really very far from the immediate subject matter of the Bill.  The Deputy, as I say, has walked into a blunder and has been simply anxious to prove that the policy which has been carried out is harmful to the country, that, in fact, any other policy would have a great many advantages. He has had to alter his remarks this morning or mend them in some way. I just want to say that the remarks he has made this morning will bear no further examination.  None of the advantages, which he indicates would arise from a separate currency, could, in fact, arise in our situation here. The disadvantage of a separate currency, provided there was no big difference in the rate of exchange would be trifling.  If parity or something close to it remained, the disadvantages would be trifling.  If there came about a wide difference in the rate of exchange the disadvantages and confusion would be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked over the Deputy's speech on the first occasion in which he stated that if we had remained on the gold standard and the British had gone off it, that would have the effect of creating a barrier against British goods here.  He did not specifically deal <Col N="1535" /> with that point this morning, but it is quite obvious that the opposite would be the effect, that it would encourage an in-flow of British goods here, and that it would put a barrier against the export of our goods to Britain.  As I say, I think the Deputy walked into that obvious blunder because instead of considering these questions&mdash;and all these are very difficult questions about which it is not easy to get absolutely reliable advice and about which it is not easy to avoid falling into mistakes&mdash;the Deputy did not take even the most elementary precautions against falling into blunders, but simply decided that this is the sort of matter in which it will do to say anything provided it means to be reflection on the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me quote exactly what I did state on last Friday:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly I think that if we had gone off the gold standard there would have been set up a rate of exchange between this country and Great Britain, one of the effects of <Col N="1536" /> which would have been to impose a tariff on imports and to have given our manufacturers a chance.</P>
    <P>I did not insert the word &ldquo;adverse&rdquo; before &ldquo;rate of exchange.&rdquo;  My speech has been directed this morning to show that in the circumstances which immediately existed in September, even if we had an independent currency and if we had gone off the gold standard simultaneously, as we should have been compelled to do at that moment, we would have had a serious adverse trade balance for the month.  I do not think, if the Minister reads my words, they will bear the construction he puts on them.  Undoubtedly, I was rather loose in my statements, they were not as precise as they should have been on that occasion, but the Minister will have to remember his action in springing a Supplementary Budget on us without any notice, so that, without any materials at our disposal, we had to pronounce on these proposals immediately.</P>

      <Col N="1539" /> Anois b'fhéidir go bhfiafrochadh duine éicínt 'tuige ar thug mise isteach an Bille seo.

In mo cheanntar féin fághann siad go leor.  Le ainm a chur ar chúpla duine a thugas síneadh láimhe dhóibh 'chuile bhliain, tá an Dr. Mac Giolla Mhártain, Ard-Easboc Thuama, agus go leor de na sagairt atá 'na dheóise agus daoine eile dá réir a bhfuil maoin shaolta acu tugann siad ó chéad púnt anuas go dtí scilling.

    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill, firstly, because the promoters seek to take the finance required for it from the portion of the sweepstake money that is to be allotted to the country hospitals.  The other hospitals have been reaping a rich harvest from the past three or four sweepstakes.  The country hospitals, up to this, have not received anything from the proceeds of the sweepstakes.  A Bill was introduced here within the last few months which allotted to the country hospitals 33 per cent. of the proceeds from the present sweepstake and from future sweepstakes.  This Bill now seeks to take one-twenty-fifth of the portion that is to be allotted to the country hospitals from them.  That is actually before they have received anything whatever.  It would be far more equitable if an attempt had been made, under this Bill, to take, say, a hundredth part of the total amount available from the sweepstake rather than to take the money from one section of the hospitals only and that a section which has not already benefited by the sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Fahy to the work done by other nurses.  I am quite willing to pay the highest tribute to the work done in country districts by the Jubilee nurses and the nurses under <Col N="1542" /> the Dudley Scheme.  The work they have done and are doing could not be surpassed in any country.  They are doing at least as good work for the poor as any section of the community. They are not overpaid and I quite understand that the difficulty of raising money by voluntary subscription is increasing.  But, as Deputy Fahy pointed out, there are other nurses working in the country.  Their work is just as good as the work of these nurses and they are wretchedly paid.</P>
    <P>As regards County Mayo, the midwives there receive something like £20 a year as salary.  In County Roscommon, where they are supposed to be pretty well paid, they receive £40 and in County Leitrim they receive £30 and £35.  The best paid midwives in the whole country receive something like £67 a year.  The midwives, everybody will admit, do splendid work.  They are wretchedly paid.  The county boards of health under whom they work at present are not willing, owing to the state of the country's finances and because they are very wary about increasing rates, to give them what they are entitled to.  They will not give them anything like a decent salary and they will not give them anything on which they can live in reason.  Personally I would like to see, when an effort is being made to extend the benefits that accrue from the rich harvest of the sweepstakes, that some attempt would be made to include that section of the community who are, I believe, just as deserving as the section that it is intended to include.</P>
    <P>In saying that I am not detracting one iota from the good work that the Jubilee and the Dudley nurses do.  I do not intend to say either that voluntary hospitals are becoming immensely wealthy out of the sweepstakes. I do not mean to convey that impression.  The voluntary hospitals in Dublin and all over the country have been struggling for a very long time in order to keep their doors open.  I was one of the strongest supporters of the original Bill.  I was anxious to give them what I thought they were justly entitled to out of the money collected by the <Col N="1543" /> sweepstakes.  I will say, in conclusion, that I do not think the country hospitals, before they have received anything at all out of the sweepstakes money that is to be allotted to them, should have the amount so allotted reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposition to this Bill, so far as I can understand it, is grounded on two factors, first, because the money it is proposed to devote to nursing associations under this amending Bill is drawn from the portion which is handed to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for county hospitals and not from the other portion of the fund given to hospitals under the Principal Act, and secondly, on the ground that certain nurses and midwives doing, as everybody knows, very excellent work in the country, are not included.  I submit to the House that these are not sufficient reasons for rejecting this Bill.  So far as the first point is concerned, it is not one that I feel very strongly about, one way or the other, but it does seem natural that provision should be made out of the proportion going to county hospitals and, on the whole, it seems to be most equitable because the work that these nursing associations do is obviously much more directly connected with the work of local care of the sick than with the work of the big central hospitals such as are in Dublin and elsewhere.  I submit that whatever way we look at it the first reason given is not a sufficient reason for rejecting the Bill on Second Reading.  Still less is the second point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true we do not in this Bill propose that assistance should be given to midwives and others employed by the county boards of health.  As a matter of fact, the whole matter of the allocation of the grant is proposed to be left to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Quite candidly I do not suppose that would be one of the things the Minister would do, but at any rate because you cannot do everything at a particular moment is surely not a good reason for doing nothing.  Deputy O'Dowd has <Col N="1544" /> paid tribute to the excellent work done by certain nursing associations which we have in mind.  He must not make the mistake of supposing&mdash;and I want to make this clear&mdash;that there is anything in the Bill which confines its operations to the associations which he named.  I know no reason, for example, and I hope I will be corrected if I am wrong, why such bodies as the Little Sisters of the Poor should not receive assistance in this connection if it seems proper to the Minister.  At any rate, there is a substantial case for giving help to these main associations which carry on a work in the country of which everybody approves.</P>
    <P>I think all we are called upon to do on Second Reading is to show, first, that the object itself is worthy, indeed the most worthy of objects, and, secondly, that a great need exists for assistance.  These are the only two points I propose to press.  Let me take one of the principal associations which is undoubtedly intended to be benefited by this Bill, the Dudley Fund for providing nurses for the poor and sick in the poorest parts of the country.  Let me give the House one or two points in connection with that.  That association has to its credit in the last year the formidable number of 712,900 visits paid to sick persons in their own homes by nurses.  Let me say that the institution, in addition to direct nursing, also trains nurses in courses which are approved by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The nurses are trained in school medical inspection, tuberculosis work, treatment of eye diseases, midwifery, health visits and so on.  Previous to 1922 the work was very largely subsidised from across the Channel.  In that year £2,000 was made available for our poor.  Since that time that help has been very largely cut off, and the association has been obliged, properly and rightly, to rely on itself.  It has managed to struggle on and it has been trying to build up an endowment fund.  The House will, I am sure, be sorry to hear that it has been obliged during the last few years to close thirteen districts for want of <Col N="1545" /> funds.  I may say that it has opened certain others, too.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows the West of Ireland will agree, I think, that the association is very far from having reached the full measure of its possible activities.  As a matter of fact, if it had the funds I am informed that it could within the next few months place at least twenty more nurses in districts which are in great need of such assistance. There have been many applications from priests, doctors and others interested in respect of the need that exists for nurses.  These applications come from many areas.  In my own county, County Donegal, there are the districts of Fanad, Malin, Moville.  In Co. Galway there are the districts of Annaghdown, Carraroe, Letterfrack, Leenane, Ballyconneely, Renvyle, Lettermullen, Tulley, Clifden.  In Co. Mayo we have Lahardane, Achill Sound, Killawalla. In Kerry, Dingle, Dunloe, and Tarbert. Applications have been also received from Oldcastle and Mount Nugent, Co. Cavan; Glasslough, Co. Monaghan; Mountmellick in Leix; Boyle, Co. Roscommon, and Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath.</P>
    <P>These applications are made by certain people interested in the poor in the district&mdash;by priests and others. That therefore shows one of the chief points the onus of proving which lies upon us, namely, that there is a need. I again emphasise the fact that the Association to which I have referred and whose figures I have quoted is only one of several which can be, and which I hope will be, benefited by this Bill</P>
    <P>In order to show that the work of that and similar associations is appreciated, perhaps I may be allowed to quote a brief extract from a paper circulating in Connacht, &ldquo;The Connacht Tribune,&rdquo; a paper well known to many persons here.  The article is so good and so much to the point that perhaps I may be pardoned for reading a small portion of it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To be poor in a world of plenty is bad enough, but to be poor, ill, and uncared for is to be in sorry plight. No one will deny that the Dudley Nursing Scheme has done excellent <Col N="1546" /> work along the west coast of Ireland, and that these self-sacrificing women who have been doing splendid service in Knock, Bealadangan, Rossmuck, Carna, Recess, Roundstone, Cleggan, Clonbur and Cornamona deserve well of the people of the Saorstát.  And everyone who is interested in social welfare work and sick nursing amongst the poor will deplore the fact that because of the lack of funds some of those nursing districts are likely to be closed</P>
    <P>Then there is a reference to myself:</P>
    <P>In many of the remoter districts of the west coast, as will readily be recognised, resident nurses are often more essential than doctors.  Far from restricting the number of those district nurses there seems to us to be a very real need for extending them.  For instance, to name but a few places, district nurses for the poor are badly needed in Lettermullen, Ballyconneely, Renvyle, Leenane and in many parts of County Mayo where they are not now available. The purpose of the Bill is to set aside a small proportion of the available surplus from the Hospitals' Sweepstake for the purpose of maintaining such district nursing organisations in areas where they are shown to be necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>And may I recommend to the House the concluding sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>When the aim of the measure is understood, we feel sure that it will meet the unanimous assent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that every member of the House must examine in a spirit of the most sympathetic consideration.  But I regret to see that the Government have not stated what actually is the intention if the Bill if carried into law.  Deputy Law has just read a statement indicating that if this Bill becomes law additional facilities will be provided in the poorer districts, which I think generally speaking, judging by the list that he has read out, are the poorer districts in the Gaeltacht areas where nursing associations are not already in existence.  The first thing that strikes <Col N="1547" /> me is: Is the Minister going to take over this nursing scheme altogether in the Gaeltacht areas?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there is a skeleton control left by the people who now control the association, it would be a pity to take the work out of their hands.  I do not know who they are, but anyway they are very sincere and devoted workers, and I have already expressed the opinion in this House that where we have voluntary associations of that character, where the people in charge have done such excellent work, it would be a pity that the work should be taken out of their hands.  I think that it should be made quite clear what the position is to be in regard to the control of these organisations.</P>
      <P>The next point is: As the matter is in connection with the Gaeltacht I think it should be stressed that any nurses who are in the Gaeltacht or who are likely to be appointed to the Gaeltacht should have a good knowledge of the Irish language.  That is a thing that may be impossible to achieve within a year or two, but at any rate, steps ought to be taken to give the nurses who are in training and even the nurses who are actually doing work in the Gaeltacht an opportunity of acquiring the language.  I know that some of them who are there already at work and who do not speak Irish feel their position very keenly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in connection with this is, in my opinion, the most serious of all: This is a matter that cannot easily be dealt with in this manner&mdash;it must be dealt with in regard to the general position of the Gaeltacht as a whole.  I have stated before that the most serious omission in the Gaeltacht Commission's Report was that there was no reference to poor law or to the provision of proper medical services for the poor people in these districts.  I have also stated in the discussion on derating that in fact the ideal we should have in mind ought to be to abolish rates altogether in these areas.  As an English authority described it on one occasion&mdash;it is a case in these counties <Col N="1548" /> along the western seaboard of the poor maintaining the destitute.</P>
    <P>The Dispensary Medical Service is not satisfactory in these areas.  Deputy Hennessy, who was a member of that Commission which investigated this question, knows that it has been charged against that service that the poor people are not getting the services to which they are entitled.  It is all very well to say that the poor people are not applying for the red tickets.  The fact is that if you look at the figures which show the number of attendances of dispensary medical officers in the Gaeltacht counties, as given in Appendix 8 of the Report, you will see that they are very small. You will see that for some reason or another these poor people prefer to go long distances to doctors and pay them fees rather than have them come to their houses on a red ticket. Whatever the explanation may be, that is the position.  If you look at the returns for County Mayo, for example, you will see that the total number of cases attended by medical officers at patients' residences in the year ending 31st March, 1925, was only 1,572.  I have not had an opportunity to go fully into the figures, but we must remember that the population in Mayo is between 180,000 and 190,000.  In County Galway the number of patients attended on red tickets at their own residences was only 2,713; in West Cork, 2,014; and in Tirconaill, 3,130.  If you examine the other counties, which are certainly in a more prosperous condition, though they may have large numbers of poor people also, you will find that visits at patients' residences were much larger in number.</P>
    <P>For example in County Louth, which is a very small county although it has some big towns, you will find that the figures are greater than the figures I have quoted.  The figures are 3,289. In Tipperary North Riding they are 2,071; Tipperary South Riding 4,578; Westmeath, 3,413, and so on.  It seems to me from a cursory examination that the figures are lower in the Gaeltacht counties than in the other counties. The question is whether this is going to get to the root of the matter.  It is only a palliative.  I think it is a great <Col N="1549" /> pity that the Government, now that they have the opportunity of opening up the whole question instead of transferring their responsibility to the sweepstakes and trying to get out of it in that way, would not prove that they have the real interest in the Gaeltacht and in these poor people that they claim they have by inquiring very definitely into this question of medical services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy propose to discuss medical services on this Bill?  I was wondering how he was going to make this relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the provision of medical treatment for the poor people in the Gaeltacht has arisen.  I do not propose to say very much more on it.  I simply wish to call attention to the fact that the problem is there and that this is not a real effort to meet it.  How are you going to take a certain area in the Gaeltacht or anywhere else, and say that the poor people there should be provided with free nursing service if you are not going to do it all over the country? There are poor people everywhere and while we are all anxious to do as much as we can for the Gaeltacht, once you extend the principle of the Bill beyond the original purpose of applying only to hospitals, I see great difficulty in stopping.  It seems to me that it may be extended further and that there is nothing to stop me, for example, from bringing in a Bill to provide that dispensary medical services in the Gaeltacht should be provided for out of the Sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also do what other individuals have tried to do, namely, get up a sweepstake for the special purpose of looking after the Gaeltacht. I might say that the Gaeltacht problem as a whole is just as serious and important a matter as the question of hospital services.  I might come along and say that, in view particularly of the conditions in the Gaeltacht at present, a special slice of the proceeds of the coming sweepstakes ought to be set aside for the provision of special works in the Gaeltacht.  We are all in agreement <Col N="1550" /> that something should be done.  The point is where you are going to draw the line.  My complaint against the Government is that they have not attempted to face up to the situation in the Gaeltacht, that they have not attempted to take over any of these medical services or to improve them. The poor unfortunate nurses are doing all the work and the Government come along now and pretend that they are going to do something good for the Gaeltacht by putting on to the sweepstakes funds the comparatively small amount that will be necessary to found an additional service or services.  I think it is simply an attempt of the Government to relieve themselves of the responsibility of the whole matter. I would call attention to the fact that in the Highlands of Scotland there is a special scheme by which the poor people in these areas can get medical services at a low fee.  It seems that the people in the Gaeltacht, generally speaking, have an objection to the red ticket system and that system in my opinion ought to be closely inquired into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. Murphy Mr. J.X. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Derrig's point, because I do not think that this is an attempt by the Government to deal with the whole situation, nor is it an attempt by Deputies Mongan and Law to deal with the whole situation.  It is only an effort to get a small portion of the money out of the sweepstakes to help these nurses.  I do not really very much care whether the proportion that is proposed to be given comes out of the allocation to the country hospitals or the Dublin hospitals.  In fact I think it would be fairer if it were distributed all round.  As far as I can see, the Dublin hospitals have done very well out of the sweepstakes.  I have some experience of the Jubilee Nurses' Association and it is at present entirely supported by voluntary contributions. Unless the Association gets some help in this way the services in the country will have to be very much curtailed. Certainly the services cannot be increased and I believe that the services of these nurses are very necessary in places where there are not nurses at present.  I think Deputy Derrig is <Col N="1551" /> confusing the issue, as this is not a Government Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not seem to me to raise the general question of medical services in the country at all, though we may have to touch on that.  The question that arises is whether the sweepstake funds should be used for a particular purpose.  The Bill does not raise the general question of dispensary treatment in the Gaeltacht, or outside it.</P>

      <P>I know it is intended to supplement certain services that exist, but the main question is whether the sweepstakes are the proper method to use for this purpose. On the Second Reading of this Bill it is correct to argue, as it was argued by Deputy Fahy, if my recollection serves me right, that there are other purposes to which the sweepstakes might be devoted, or that they ought to be devoted to no other purpose but the one originally intended.  But to lead us into a general discussion on <Col N="1552" /> poor law services, and medical services in the country, on this Bill, and as to the Government's policy in regard to that, would be carrying us too far.  I think Deputies will agree with that. The debate would travel altogether away from the Bill.  On Second Reading it is always possible to depart from the Bill by a process of saying that if you were solving this problem, you would not solve it this way. Certainly it is not possible in this Bill to take us away completely from the sweepstakes, or the advisability of using them for a particular purpose, to a discussion on what this Government or some other Government ought to do with regard to poor law services generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of this Bill.  I feel that there are certain problems peculiar to the West and amongst them is the nursing problem.  We have had it on the authority of Deputy Law that many of the services in these areas had to be dropped because of want of funds.  Section 1 of this Bill provides for poor persons suffering from physical disease or injury, and maternity cases.  I have had a long experience of one welfare society in particular where very valuable work was done by the nurses of that association. The association was maintained almost solely by voluntary subscription, but it was found that at the end of a period these voluntary subscriptions were gradually growing less and less.  The result was that the activity of the nurses had to be very much curtailed.  Now while we must expect of course that a Government Department&mdash;in this connection the Department of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;must be responsible, in a measure, for the nursing of the sick poor, at the same time we find that owing to the resources of the country not being strong enough to do all that is required these nursing associations have been able, because of the personal influence of those in charge and possibly other factors, to get subsidies from private sources.  As a result of certain circumstances related by Deputy Law we find that since 1922 the Jubilee nurses' fund <Col N="1553" /> has fallen away considerably, with the result that many stations previously catered for had to be closed down.  I said that this Bill applies particularly to the West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I gather there is a misapprehension among many Deputies that the intention of the Bill is that it is to be confined in its operations to what is called the Gaeltacht.  That is not so.  These nursing associations are operating in Cork, Westmeath and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>It is not peculiar to the Gaeltacht, but I feel, in this matter, as far as the borough that I represent is concerned, it will not derive any advantage from it.  I am quite uninterested from that point of view, but at the same time I am in entire sympathy with the object this Bill is attempting to achieve.  Section 2 (2) provides that the particular areas shall be specified by the Minister.  I take it that these areas will be areas in which poverty and sickness are more general than in other areas.  I fail to see that any undue discrimination will be exercised.  Of course we will have raised, from time to time even in a Bill of this innocuous kind in the sense that it is non-political and non-party and will I hope be discussed in that spirit, questions of partisanship particularly when it is suggested that the particular areas are to be specified by the Minister.  No matter what Party is in power for my part I would give authority to the Minister to specify the areas because we do know that this Bill will apply mainly to the Gaeltacht area where they have their own peculiar problems in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is anyone in any part of Ireland who does not recognise that most capable work is being done by the Jubilee nurses among the sick poor all over Ireland.  Not only in the Gaeltacht is this work done but especially along the western seaboard where conditions are extremely bad it is even more valuable.  The work done by the nursing association in these particular districts is more valuable <Col N="1554" /> than where perhaps the conditions are not so hard.  It is a deplorable thing to think that, as Deputy Law said, there are so many districts that cannot have nurses appointed to them because funds are not available.  Anybody who has been to the west of Ireland knows from the wild condition of the country the difficulty nurses have to go through very frequently in getting to their patients.  They have a great deal to contend with.  They are a most capable, self-sacrificing body of women and I think it is quite reasonable that out of the sweepstakes funds collected for the hospitals some share should go to these associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would the hospitals be without the nurses?  How would the doctors get on if it were not for the efficient help that the nurses give them?  I think that up to this their share in this matter has not been recognised. This is only the beginning.  A beginning has to be made with everything and the place to begin is in the poorest parts.  No doubt the poorest parts in this country are in the Gaeltacht.  I think it is but right that nurses who undertake very difficult and very hard work by night and by day along the sea coast should be assured of decent comfort when they break down in health, and that there should be a fund to help them.  Several plans have been adopted so as to provide pensions for nurses.  Gardens in different parts of the country have been opened on Sundays and other days in order to raise funds for this purpose.  I do not know what the result of that has been, but, I am afraid that it has been disappointing, and that it is not likely to bring in much more money.  More money must be got from some other sources in order to open up new districts and to provide a sufficient sum for these noble women who are doing such good work under difficult circumstances.  I think it is quite right that the money should come from the enormous and ever increasing sum that is being collected from the sweepstakes.  It is but right that this important side of the medical profession, as it is, should have its share.  Hitherto nothing has been done for the nurses.  It is only right that a beginning should be made now <Col N="1555" /> to provide that not only should there be a decent amount of money available for nurses while they are at work but to help them when they are past their work.  No district where the services of a nurse are needed should be without one.  I hope this Bill will be passed unanimously.  It would be a disgrace if out of the three millions that are collected something was not done for the nurses without whom patients would be perfectly helpless. The doctors know perfectly well that their work would be hopeless in many cases but for the assistance they get from nurses.  I am sure that all doctors, whatever opinions they may hold, agree that the work of the nurses deserves recognition and that it is our duty to support this Bill, even though it is only a beginning of the recognition of the great services rendered by these women to the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this Bill are so wide that it is very difficult for anybody to know exactly what is covered by it.  It seems to me that those who have been talking about restricting it to Jubilee or Dudley nurses are talking away from the Bill. The Bill seems to me to give to the Minister for Local Government full discretionary power to apply this money for the service of any nursing organisation that he thinks fit.  He can choose any nursing organisations whatever and apply this money to it. He can say in what areas they are to operate.  The first question we naturally ask ourselves is this, whether we are justified in giving this full discretionary power to the Minister.  It gives to him the power of patronage and other powers which I think it is only fair we should see restricted to definite organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to get this money from the portion of the surplus which is being made available for the county hospitals.  When the last amendment to the Sweepstakes Act was before the House we endeavoured to get that sum increased from the fraction of one-fourth, which was in the Bill originally, to one-half.  A compromise was reached and a sum of one-third was made available <Col N="1556" /> for the county hospitals.  We felt that that was an unfair division but now it is proposed in this Bill to make that division still more unfair, by taking away from the county hospitals the fraction to be made available for this purpose to assist nursing organisations. Deputy Law has pointed out that that could be amended in Committee. We are quite willing to admit that it could be, if the House were willing, but our experience on the last occasion does not, I think, justify us in hoping that the county hospitals are going to be relieved from having to provide this money out of the share that otherwise would be available for themselves.</P>
    <P>The next point is that it would seem the Bill is not to bring any assistance to midwives under local control. Excellent as is the work that has been done by the Jubilee and the Dudley nurses&mdash;I think every one who has spoken has paid a tribute to their work &mdash;excellent work has also been done by the midwives.  We think if this Bill were to go through at all there should be an amendment widening its scope. But the moment we think of widening its scope we are brought face to face with the real danger that is in all these Sweepstake Bills.  If you were to widen the scope of this Bill and deal with the case of the midwives you would immediately be bringing in, as was brought in in the case of the county hospitals, a principle where we are supporting what should be State services by methods such as sweepstakes.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to this whole matter is this, that we think the medical services for the poor should not be left either to charity or to chance, that there is a definite obligation on the community to provide these essential medical services, and that any attempt like this is merely a palliative.  Suppose this Bill were passed and that it were made possible to put a few more nurses, say in the Gaeltacht, by doing that you would be making it easier for the community as a whole, and for the State to turn its back on the rest of the work that ought to be done.  I think as a community we ought to face that particular problem, <Col N="1557" /> and regard it as an obligation and a duty to provide for the poor the medical services that are necessary for them, and to provide them in a definite way, and not merely, as I have said, to leave it either to charity or to chance.</P>
    <P>I said the moment you widen the scope of this Bill you begin to realise the dangers you are running.  Assume now that this Bill is passed, you will have a service in the Gaeltacht made dependent on the success of these sweepstakes.  If, for instance, a time came when it was thought wise in the general interests to discontinue sweepstakes or to take them over and make them a State affair&mdash;particularly the question of discontinuing them&mdash;you would be up against the difficulty that the discontinuance of them would mean a very severe hardship on, for instance, people who are getting service from these nurses.  That is what was intended, I think, when one of our speakers spoke of vested interests that are being created.  Every service the continuance of which was dependent upon the continuation of such sweepstakes would be appealed to as a reason why sweepstakes should continue.</P>
    <P>When the Sweepstakes Bill was introduced first it was stated very definitely that it was introduced as a temporary measure.  Now it has extended beyond the dream of anybody who was in the House when the measure was passed.  I was not in the House at the time but I read since some of the speeches that were made. It is evident that nobody who made any speech dreamt that the success of the sweepstakes would be such as they have attained or that they would be so wide as they have become.  The sweep is now being looked upon as a means of financing not merely what might be regarded as charitable purposes but what are, in our opinion, essential State services.  If it is going to be regarded in that light at all then I say that the whole question will have to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>When the last extension was proposed the Executive provided for certain regulations.  They felt that these regulations were necessary in view of the widening scope of the sweepstakes <Col N="1558" /> and if there were to be any further extension of the principle there is no doubt whatever that the whole question of the necessary regulations would have to be gone into too.  That being the position, although as you know from the votes that were taken here in the past, we gave our votes without as a party at all considering it this time, because we believe there are essential community questions involved, we have decided to oppose it as a body.  We intend voting as a Party against this because we cannot see that we can extend it to make it equitable without creating a situation which would demand a complete reexamination of the whole question.</P>
    <P>The question of vested interests was mentioned.  I indicated how services might be made dependent upon the continuance of these sweepstakes.  The more services that are made dependent on them the greater will be the difficulties you will have in your way in any fair consideration of the question anew.  I have not any fixed idea myself about this whole question.  I do, however, hold strongly, seeing the dimensions it has now reached, and the tendency there is to look upon this as a means of getting finance for State services, that the time has come when we should examine the whole question and see where it is going to lead us. We have heard from the other benches recently a great deal about democracy and the steps that should be taken to safeguard democracy against, for example, anything like an armed attack upon it.  Everyone of us here knows that there are other dangers to democracy than merely an armed attack. There are very serious dangers when large sums of money like the huge turn-over there is in this are made available by a monopoly which is conceded by the representatives of the people.  When we are conceding a monopoly of this kind we should not forget that we have to face very serious risks and that all the dangers that are attendant when conceding a monopoly in any direction are here and perhaps in a greater measure than they would be elsewhere.  So that as I say we have come to a stage now when we on this side of the House anyhow <Col N="1559" /> are satisfied that before there is any other extension of this principle the whole question will have to be reexamined. In this apparently we are going step by step until a stage will be reached in which we cannot give sweepstakes up if we wished to, so many people would be affected if we did so.</P>
    <P>For instance, when we were discussing barley the question arose as to how difficult it becomes to deal with it when you have one large firm employing thousands of people whose livelihood depends on the continuance of that firm.  In the same way, as sure as this extends and as the livelihood of more and more people is made dependent on it, so surely will the time come in which you will be presented with a situation that you will scarcely be able to change.  Now is the time to look ahead and to take measures.  We see the direction in which it is going and the magnitude it has reached.  We say, at any rate on this side of the House, that before we go any further with it the whole question will have to be reexamined. In the last case certain safeguards and so on were introduced. We do not think that these would be sufficient at all to cover the situation. If we propose to extend this Bill now from the hospitals to essential medical services where are we going to stop?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I interpret the opposition to this Bill, it resolves itself into two heads.  Clearly the Leader of the Opposition holds, first, that the Bill is too extended, that it gives power to the Minister for Local Government which he should not possess.  Number two is that it conflicts with the idea that he has given expression to, and number three is that it would assist in the general ruin which he thinks these sweepstakes are going to inflict on the country.  I will deal with these points briefly.  It is notable that in his objection to this extension he raised the question that midwives are excluded.  Surely the Deputy is aware that midwives are in a State service.  They are already fairly well paid and have fees as well. We are considering here the Jubilee and Dudley nurses.  They are engaged in the Gaeltacht, which I know well, <Col N="1560" /> because it comprises a large portion of my constituency.  I can give him many instances of the good services they render.  Around the coast, close to my residence, there are eleven inhabited islands.  There is the island of Arranmore which has a population of roughly 2,000 people.  Up to recently the people there had to depend on the services of the dispensary doctor who resides on the mainland.  During the winter months, it frequently happens there is no communication between these islands and the mainland.  The sick, the sick poor especially, were neglected.  Since the Jubilee and Dudley nurses were placed there I have been assured by the medical officer that they have been of the greatest possible assistance to him. Without their assistance he would not be able to carry on successfully the work he has to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing is true of the mainland. The area there is a very extensive one.  It is in the Glenties rural district.  The dispensary doctor has three districts to attend to, the area of which would be practically fifty miles square.  This area, I may say, is a very congested one.  In the case of illness or of an epidemic the doctor would be placed in a hopeless position if he had not the assistance of these nurses.  On the mainland they have one Jubilee nurse.  The people in that area are looking forward with the greatest hope to being able to place nurses in two or three of these districts when the Bill becomes law.  Surely the Leader of the Opposition does not want to deprive the poor in the Gaeltacht of that beneficent assistance because it does not fit in with his ideals of how this money from the sweepstakes should be applied.  I support this Bill most cordially and would appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to allow it to pass its Second Reading.  On the Committee Stage we can discuss in greater detail many of the matters that were raised. I think it would be a cruel thing to deprive these poor people of the beneficent services of these nurses.  At present they are paid by an organisation that has to raise the money required in a charitable way.  It would <Col N="1561" /> be a cruel thing to deprive the people of the Gaeltacht of the benefits which this Bill provides for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>When the first measure in connection with sweepstakes was introduced it was designed to help what are known as the voluntary hospitals of the country.  At the time they were in a very serious financial position owing to the change in the value of money and the extra cost entailed by reason of that change. That was the sum and substance of the first measure that was introduced.  A departure from that proposal came when the measure, which was introduced here a short time ago, took a portion of the proceeds which the Leader of the Opposition has said he endeavoured to have placed at 50 per cent. instead of 33? per cent.  That was the first departure that was made, and the Deputy himself, although he derides the departure, according to his speech he supported it.  That was the first occasion on which an impost was placed on this method of raising money which normally, in the Deputy's mind, ought to have fallen upon either the State or the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot have it hot and cold.  We either stand for that particular proposal or we do not.  If we support that there is no use in coming along and saying that is a bad principle.  The fact is that the House approved of it. In this particular measure the proposal is to review&mdash;to place it on no higher basis&mdash;that particular proposition.  The effect of this Bill, if it passes into law, will be to see to what extent it may be possible in the distribution of the moneys to render help to particular services, to extend and keep in operation services to which Deputies, in practically all parts of the House, have paid tribute.  It is unnecessary, I think, in this connection to make more than passing reference to the report of the Committee of Enquiry into health insurance and medical services.  Pages 112 and 113 of that report deal mainly with the nursing system.  There, too, will be found remarkable tributes to the work that is being done.  Now this particular form of assistance, medical assistance if you like, is moderate.  It is efficacious in its results <Col N="1562" /> and so beneficial to the neighbourhoods concerned that, whenever there was any danger of a limitation of its operations, there have been representations from those most closely in touch with the needs and necessities of the people&mdash;the local parish priest or other people.</P>
    <P>I had occasion this year to see for myself the usefulness of this organisation. On the coast beside the sea a man got splashed badly with tar.  At the time of the accident he was three miles from the local village.  Fortunately it was possible to get him into the local village where the nurse was resident, but if there had been no nurse there he would have had to go five miles, and then possibly the local doctor would not be at home.  In that eventuality he would have to go another journey.  Therefore, one can see at once how useful this particular service is.  How did this service come to be provided?  In the first instance, through the instrumentality of the late Lady Dudley who apparently envisaged the necessity for a service of this sort. That service started with something like eight nurses, but the organisation of it has now spread to something like 31 centres, principally in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There are other voluntary agencies in other parts of the country, but this particular agency, the one conceived and started by the late Lady Dudley, is supported entirely by voluntary contributions. I am positively certain that contributions were much more easily obtained some years ago than they are now.  We need not go into the reasons for that.  The fact is that it and kindred organisations engaged in this work are now faced with the necessity either of limiting the services rendered by the nurses, the number of centres in which they carry on their good work, or alternatively, of getting an increase in their revenues from the voluntary and philanthropic bodies which at present are providing the money to enable these services to be carried on.  That is the proposition that we have got to face.  It is not a State medical service.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.  If it should, why support the <Col N="1563" /> proposal to take away any of this money for the voluntary hospitals? Personally I believe that after meeting the proposal of Deputy Mongan there will still remain enough for the local authorities.  I believe that in this particular sweep the sum that will be made available for the local authorities will be in the neighbourhood of a quarter of a million.  One twenty-fifth of that is £10,000.  This £10,000 should be regarded as an endowment fund, the interest on it to be used to provide nurses and to maintain the service so that there will be no interruption of the activities of this organisation when the sweepstakes come to an end&mdash;to see that there will be no hardship as a result of the fact that there will be no further moneys to look for from that particular source.  That is the kind of business-like proposition that I expect would be in the minds of those interested in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it would be possible to put all the things into the Bill that should be in it.  I am simply saying that it is a matter of construction and that such a business-like interpretation of the scheme would be in the mind of the Minister for Local Government.  I think any other interpretation would be foolish.  To send out nurses all over the country and spend all the money and then, when these sweepstakes stop, to give these nurses notices of dismissal would be cruel to the nurses and to the people concerned.  The question we have got to consider is whether this nursing scheme is a useful public service.  I think we are very much indebted to the people who first conceived the idea of sending these nurses throughout the country.  I think we are very much indebted to the people who voluntarily contributed towards the maintenance of that service.  We are very much indebted to the services of the nurses themselves, who have given perfect satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we satisfied at this moment that we are entitled to refuse this particular method of keeping that service in <Col N="1564" /> operation?  Are we satisfied, seeing such considerable sums being made available for other purposes, furnishing the hospitals and other things, to say that it is more important that the last penny must be spent in respect of having these perfectly up to date, irrespective of the fact that it may be necessary to give notice of dismissal to certain nurses in certain places or to refuse to send nurses to other places where there is a real and crying need for them?  I cannot subscribe to that view from facts I have before my mind in connection with this matter.  Is the sum asked for in this measure, to provide for the maintenance of the existing nursing organisations throughout the country, necessary?  I say yes, in my opinion.  Secondly, is it desirable, if it be possible, to extend that service, to the extent that is asked for in this measure?  I say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; to that also.  I do not think I would be justified in refusing to reply in the affirmative to either of these questions.</P>
    <P>There is a third question: can local authorities suffer the loss of this one twenty-fifth?  They did not get anything last year.  As a matter of fact they have not got anything yet.  The sum will be so considerable in my opinion that this twenty-four twenty-fifths of the quarter of a million divided amongst local authorities will suffice to provide what will be reasonably necessary, taking into consideration the fact that this is not the last of those Sweepstakes, in the way of medical and other appliances throughout the country.  The sum of money expended by the State in recoupment to voluntary agencies for the year 1929-30 was £10,252 6s. 9d. That is from State sources.  The State, bearing in mind the importance of this service and seeing no other means possible of maintaining it, took the view that it was better to assist the voluntary organisations engaged in the work than to scrap it and take on the whole of the work itself.  In the year 1930-31 the sum in the Estimates in respect of recoupment to voluntary organisations was £11,362 15s. 4d.  The Minister for Local Government informs me that there is about the same amount this year to local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> There is evidence that the Oireachtas had in mind the necessity for assisting those voluntary organisations. That is a very considerable sum.  It is not proposed and I do not think the Minister had it in mind&mdash;I certainly would advise him not to have it in mind&mdash;that there should be any equivalent contribution to these sums from the sweepstakes, but that is another question.  If the money be used as a capital sum the income from it would be devoted towards providing extra nurses.  I would not be inclined to close up the pocket in respect of that.  Personally I think Deputy Mongan deserves very great credit indeed for introducing this measure. He understands the necessities of his district but he does not confine himself in respect to the introduction of this measure to the Gaeltacht.  Whenever it is found necessary and desirable and wherever the resources and revenues of these voluntary organisations will admit of an extension of these services, I think it would meet the general public approbation to see them extended.</P>

I have been a member of the Athlone District Nursing Committee for some time and I know that this Bill if passed into law will give this association much needed assistance.  The sick poor of Athlone have been very fortunate in having a district nurse ministering to them for the last 12 or 13 years.  Not only does <Col N="1566" /> she minister to the sick poor in their homes in the urban district, but she goes out to the rural district to nurse the sick there.  Many Deputies in discussing this Bill seem to be under the impression that there are no district nurses in any part of the country except in the Gaeltacht.  We have two nurses in Westmeath, one in Athlone, and the other in Killucan, and I must say that the services rendered by these nurses are simply magnificent.  As the House is aware, the cost of maintenance of these nurses is almost wholly derived from voluntary subscriptions. We also receive some small sums from the Government for the upkeep of these nurses.  The number of visits paid by the nurse in Athlone would run into thousands per year.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is very necessary in this sense, that we should have some-help to maintain these nurses.  Ten years ago we had an epidemic of 'flu in Athlone, and then we had to collect the money to pay two nurses.  We have had only one nurse for the last seven or eight years, but we are very glad to have that one.  I hope that when the Bill is passed the money which it will provide will be devoted to sending nurses to many other parts of the country where they are badly needed.  I entirely agree with the principles of the Bill.  As to the proportion that will be allotted to the county hospitals, as the President has stated, we are getting a fairly decent sum out of the sweepstakes and we can agree that something should be taken out of that fund for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>The President seems to argue that because certain Deputies agreed heretofore to the extension of the monies that are paid out from the sweepstakes, they should also agree to this.  If he followed up that line of argument he should oppose everything in connection with this matter because he was one of the small minority that opposed sweepstakes at the start. There is no consistency in his argument. I think I can claim to be as great an advocate of the rights and the welfare of the people of the Gaeltacht as any of the Deputies opposite, who considered it wise to sit tight on <Col N="1567" /> occasions when they might have done something for the people of the Gaeltacht. Deputy Mongan seems to suggest that the idea for this Bill came from the priests in the Gaeltacht.  I would like to know if the priests in the Gaeltacht have come around to the point of view that the only hope for the Gaeltacht is by providing sweepstakes, lotteries and gambles of that kind.</P>
      <P>Surely all the resources of civilisation have not run out to such a degree that those people over whom the Deputies opposite have shed such crocodile tears to-day, have to depend for those particular services on the income from sweepstakes, lotteries and gambles. I consider that the people in the Gaeltacht are the most highly taxed people in the world, when one considers the conditions under which they have to live.  I consider that we are making this Parliament, the status of which we boost so much, a laughing stock, to have us here discussing every week an extension of sweepstakes and lotteries to assist social services in the State.  Is there no other means of assisting social services, or serving the people in the Gaeltacht, the last remnant of our ancient race?  Is there no other means by which we can come to their rescue in the matter of medical services than by utilising sweepstakes and lotteries?  I say we are making ourselves a laughing stock before the world by advertising sweepstakes in order to use the money so realised for the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>If we make these people dependent for their medical services and other services on the income derived from lotteries and gambles, will the argument be put forward in a few years time, when it is suggested that these sweepstakes should be dispensed with, that we cannot dispense with them or else if we do dispense with them we will do a great injury to the people of the Gaeltacht, will throw thousands of people out of employment in Dublin, and do other injury?  Are we going to allow this to become a sort of vested interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> No one wants to find the slightest fault with the Jubilee nurses.  They have been much greater friends of the poor all along than have the Deputies on the Government Benches who have introduced this measure.  When the Jubilee nurses were travelling throughout the country night and day in order to dispense charity to the poor, some Government Deputies did not even dispense charity.  In the course of his Irish remarks Deputy Mongan stated &ldquo;Is ceart an trocaire do roinnt.&rdquo;  It is right for us to extend charity to the people of the Gaeltacht, he said.  I say it would be much better for us to extend justice to the people of the Gaeltacht, the poor of the Gaeltacht, rather than extend our charity.  Let us extend justice to those people and, if we do, we will be doing much more for them than by bringing them now under this scheme of gambling and sweepstakes.</P>
    <P>If the success of the sweepstake is not assured it may be a cause of trouble and worry for the people who are dependent on these nurses for attendance.  Are they to be left hoping for the success of sweepstakes and gambles in order that they may have some medical services which are not now given them by the Government? I think this is a step absolutely in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for the people of the country to understand the mentality of Government Deputies and of the President who, at one hour's notice in this House, can provide £2,000,000 for the Shannon Scheme after a bungle and who can come in here at an hour's notice and make provision of from £5,000 upwards for the guarding of Deputies in a pretended scare.  The Government have not at any time during the past nine years provided anything of any value for the people of the Gaeltacht whom they now talk so much about.  The Government are now appealing to the gamblers of the world to come to their rescue by making the sweepstake a success.  I say it is an insult to the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Law has nothing else to offer the people of Donegal than mere dependence upon the success of a gamble, then he is an absolute failure <Col N="1569" /> as a Deputy representing the Gaeltacht, and the same applies to Deputy Mongan.  I have no objection to giving the people assistance in some way, but I contend that placing them in the position of being dependent on the success of a gamble is an absolute insult, and I will not be a party to it. The plea may be made that you are giving somewhat out of sweepstakes to other sections of the community and why not give it to this section?  If that plea is put up by Government Deputies and if they look back on history they will find their answer.  The answer to that plea should have been found long ago.</P>
    <P>Years ago, when we on this side pleaded for co-operation with the Government Deputies to get down to the Gaeltacht question and the problem of the congested districts by accepting the Gaeltacht Commission Report and providing money for services badly needed there, if the Government had then as great sympathy with these people as they profess to-day, they would not now have to be asking this House to pass this measure.  The nurses who have been all along attending to the poor have been doing admirable work.  I repeat that to place the people in a position of being dependent upon the success of a gamble is an insult over which I certainly will not stand.</P>

      <P>The only trouble we find in the County Donegal is that it is impossible, under present conditions, to provide nurses where they are really wanted.  It is easy enough to provide a nurse in a district where you have a number of people willing to put their hands in their pockets and form a voluntary association.  I have had representations put up to me from districts where such people do not exist, where the people are poor and where <Col N="1570" /> there is no possible way of forming a voluntary association.  Therefore the people must do without the nurse.  I do not think I have listened to a more futile argument than I have heard within the last hour.  Is it enough to come here and say that this Bill should not pass because of so-and-so, because the sweepstakes may end in some years' time?</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera tells us it ought to be a State service.  Why does he not bring forward a Bill?  If it ought to be a State service, then when the sweepstakes end let the Deputy come along and say that some alternative method must be adopted.  In the meantime we cannot let the people die or suffer from the want of a nurse.  When the sweepstakes end, let him come along and say: &ldquo;We must take over this.  We all recognise this is a useful and a beneficent service, and now is the time to take it over as a State service.&rdquo; Either do that or establish it as a State service to-morrow.  If the Deputy succeeds in defeating this Bill, then let us have a Bill to make this a State service.  Do not, in the meantime, let those people suffer on until such time as the State can help them.</P>

      <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Mongan has for its object a very excellent purpose.  I believe there is a great need for an increase in the members of the Nursing Association in Co. Galway, especially in the Connemara area.  The Co. Galway also is not very fortunate in the number of its district hospitals.  There is an excellent county hospital in Galway City where they treat all the major operations, practically all the surgical operations and the serious clinical cases that are met with in the county, and there are several cases not of such a serious nature, at least in their beginning, that have to be treated at home.  I believe that more people die from lack of adequate and good nursing than die from lack of good doctoring. I believe the nurse is of most importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly candid in this and I am making no reflections, as may be suggested by Deputy Fahy, because <Col N="1571" /> here is what happens.  I was in practice and I found I prescribed rather freely, but there was no one there to carry out my prescriptions.  That is much more the case in Connemara because the Connemara dispensary districts are abnormally large and contain an abnormally large population, a poor population.  It is well known that there is a greater incidence of illness amongst the poor than amongst the wealthy.  I think it is very fitting that a certain amount of the money going to the counties from the sweepstakes should be used for increasing the efficiency of these nursing organisations. I am surprised at Deputy Fahy, who must have a great interest in Galway, lending himself to any opposition to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not mind what Deputy Derrig says.  He brought forward some figures in support of the contention that the dispensary doctors of Mayo did not pay sufficient attention to their patients and the patients were under the necessity of paying the doctors.  The Deputy went as far as that.  The figures he quoted do not mean very much because several people rather than walk a couple of miles in the morning for a ticket will go to the doctors without a ticket.  I remember when I was a dispensary doctor often doing three hours poor law work and when I would come to my file I would not have one ticket to show the work I had done.</P>
      <P>An Inspector was sent down to investigate the statements made against the County Mayo doctors, and the inspector returned and reported that the doctors there did their duty most efficiently and attended gratuitously not only those who were entitled to gratuitous treatment but also attended those who were on the borderline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest that a sum of money should be set aside from the allotments to the city hospitals to form the nucleus of a pension fund for nurses generally and especially for those who are not in the poor law service.  I admit that in the poor <Col N="1572" /> law service the salary is bad, the nurses are underpaid, and the result is that they will have a bad pension. One follows the other.  I am aware of the necessity of keeping the hospitals up-to-date in town and country; but we should think of the nurses who are the human equipment of these institutions.  Deputy de Valera in his usual fatal way defers everything.  He hates arriving at a quick decision.  He will take five years or nine years to come to a decision that any ordinary one of us would arrive at in twenty-four hours. He says, practically leaving the matter rest, that it is an objectionable way of meeting the wants of the county nurses' organisation to provide for them out of the sweepstakes fund.  Well, I did not hear any condemnation of this by the Irish Hierarchy; and I think that if there was anything immoral in it, we should probably hear from them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in due time Deputy de Valera will come to our way of thinking in this matter.  I must say I cannot realise why the Fianna Fáil Party oppose this Bill.  Is it because that, no matter how meritorious may be a Bill which is introduced from this side of the House, the Fianna Fáil Party must automatically oppose it? I am making an appeal to every unprejudiced member of the House to support Deputy Mongan's Bill, because it is truly a very excellent Bill, and it will save the lives of hundreds of people in the areas for which it provides, whereas if we were to adopt the advice of Deputy de Valera I am afraid a number of deaths would result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle of this Bill is to provide money to continue services that are essential to the well being of the poor in certain districts.  I think that is the principle of the Bill, and that is the reason that I intend to support it. But, though it is a short measure, I think that it requires a great deal of amendment.  In the first place I think that the fund from which the money is going to be taken should not be the first portion of the fund to be raided by those people who have granted it. <Col N="1573" /> The county hospitals are very necessary institutions.  I think doctors in general will agree, although I do not think they agreed the last time, that county hospitals are not getting the amount of attention that the city hospitals are getting in proportion to the necessary work that they do for the poor in the districts which they serve.  If you had well equipped county hospitals you would give the surgeons of these hospitals the means of doing good and very serviceable work, and you possibly would relieve the burden thrown upon the city hospitals. That is the reason why I think that this very much needed first instalment to the county hospitals should not be raided.  It is a very bad precedent, and possibly when any other measure of this kind is introduced you will find another attempt made to raid this portion of the county hospitals fund.  That is my first objection to this measure.  It is a matter that should be amended in committee, and very extensively amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do agree with Deputy de Valera that medical services should not be left to charity or chance; but I think that argument holds good with reference to the relations of the sweepstakes fund to the county hospitals just as well as to these services.  I think if we are to see these things become national services that the county hospitals should be provided for and provided for extensively out of national funds.  The principle is right, but the point we have to remember is this: that sweepstakes are here and that money is available, and that when these services have to be carried on in the interests of the poor or the sick poor, we ought to take every means in our power to try to carry them on and make them as beneficial services as possible.  I do believe that there is another class of nurses who certainly ought to be included and who do possibly just as much work, and, as far as I know, better work than even those nurses are doing.  Some Deputy on the Government Benches said that midwives are well paid.  The fact is that they are wretchedly paid and that their salary is not capable of keeping them in any decency or comfort.  To suggest that <Col N="1574" /> they are well paid is not in accordance with the facts.  They should be included under this Bill.  Deputy Law objects because they are paid out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While I agree with what Deputy de Valera said&mdash;that medical and such services should not be left to charity or chance&mdash;still the fund is there to make use of, and we ought to endeavour to make use of it for alleviating the circumstances of the sick poor.  In regard to the districts: while I am anxious that the Gaeltacht&mdash;as possibly the last stronghold of the Gael&mdash;should be supported and subsidised as far as possible, there are poor people in other districts who are as badly in need of help and attention as those in the Gaeltacht.  I think that this Bill should not apply solely to the Gaeltacht, and, as far as I can see, that is the intention.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in refusing to allow Deputies to make representations in person to the Deciding Officer on behalf of old-age pension claimants whose cases are on appeal, whether at the instance of the Pension Officer or of the claimants themselves.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that no case has been made in defence of the Minister's action in making the drastic regulation that is the subject of this motion. The silence of some of the Independent Deputies has been particularly noticeable during this debate.  Perhaps it is that they are satisfied that Deputy Jasper Wolfe spoke for the whole of them and expressed their views sufficiently clearly to make it unnecessary for them to take any part in the discussion. I find it difficult to believe that Deputy Wolfe represented the views, for example, of Deputy O'Hanlon, who claims to be an Independent. A very considerable time ago this matter was under discussion, when it was raised on the Motion for the Adjournment by Deputy T. Murphy.  On that occasion Deputy O'Hanlon took part in the debate. He certainly was very emphatic in his denunciation of the Minister's order and of the Minister for making it.  In fact I think he was more emphatic in his language than anybody has been during the course of that debate.  With your permission, sir, I should like to quote some of the remarks of Deputy O'Hanlon on that occasion.  In Vol. 32, col. 2058 of the Official Reports of 4th <Col N="1576" /> December, 1929, Deputy O'Hanlon is reported as having stated:</P>
      <P>I do say that a more outrageous idea than the one introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to shut out the representatives of the people from advocating the cases of the poorest type of their constituents, I have never heard in my life.  This is not a question that should be discussed on the Motion for the Adjournment. It is a question that must be dealt with in the light of the administration of local government in this House.  In my experience of all the Ministries there is none that requires the attention of the elected representatives of the people so much as the Ministry of Local Government. The people's representatives need to keep their eye on that Ministry. That Ministry is at present drifting into a state when the term &ldquo;local government&rdquo; is a misnomer.  There is no such thing as local government in this country and every day in this House we are learning the lesson that local government has ceased.</P>
      <P>Later on he says:</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into particular cases, but if anybody else belonging to one of the larger Parties in this House does, I hope that a motion will be put on the Paper when we sit here next February to consider the whole question of local government and the manner in which it is carried on.  I do not see for the life of me why the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should bring in a barrier of this sort &mdash;a barrier shutting out the representatives of the poor people in the country from access to the officials administering the old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that when this motion was put down for discussion one of the strongest supporters we would have in this debate would be Deputy O'Hanlon.  But the debate is now concluding. The motion has been on the Order Paper for a very considerable time and the debate has dragged on for a long time, but we have not heard a word from Deputy O'Hanlon.  It <Col N="1577" /> would be rather interesting to know if Deputy O'Hanlon has changed the view that he expressed here in 1929.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jasper Wolfe suggested that an experience he had in the Old-Age Pensions Department was sufficient to bring about such a change in the regulations as has been made.  He told us how he sat in the Old-Age Pensions Department while the affairs of old-age pension claimants from all parts of the Free State were being discussed. I should like to know from Deputy Wolfe what on earth he was doing in the Old Age Pensions Department. It would be interesting if he would explain why he sat there while somebody else's private affairs were being discussed.  Certainly, if many Deputies were guilty of the bad taste exhibited by Deputy Wolfe, on his own admission, when he told us that he sat in that Department and had not the good manners to leave when a Deputy appeared to discuss the private affairs of his constituents, that is a possible reason why the Minister may have found it necessary to curtail the freedom of Deputies in this respect.  It was an aspect of it that had never dawned on me before.  Although I have been a frequent visitor to that Department I was never present while any other Deputy was discussing the affairs of his constituents.</P>
    <P>Under the present arrangements, so far as Deputies are concerned, it is much simpler for them and much easier to write into the Department and state that they are interested in a certain old-age pension case that is before the Minister on appeal.  They will get an acknowledgment from the Department that the case is before the Minister on appeal, that their representations have been received on a certain date, and that the matter will receive attention.  They can send on that letter to the claimant.  It is a very impressive document and it probably will produce the necessary political results and save them the trouble of studying the claimant's case, of putting up the possible arguments that could be put up in favour of the claimant, and of bringing the advantages of their special knowledge of the condition of the claimant before the deciding <Col N="1578" /> officer.  It is very simple for a Deputy, and I presume the simplicity of it will explain the number of votes that will be cast against this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that there is no necessity for representation in person to the deciding officer, and in fact the Minister for Finance suggests that even written representations are undesirable.  In all probability the next step in the process will be that Deputies will not be allowed to make any representation whatever on behalf of the old-age pension claimants.  The Minister asks us to believe that the fact that the old-age pensions sub-committee in the country investigated the claim and that the claimant is entitled to be present when the claim is being investigated is adequate protection for claimants in old-age cases.  I think it is obvious to anyone who has come to the use of reason that very many of those people are physically unfit to be present when the sub-committee are considering their cases. Some of them are blind and are claimants for blind pensions.  Many of those even physically fit are almost illiterate, and it is foolish to suggest that those old people could argue their legal rights before the sub-committees and review the legal interpretation that the old-age pensions officer puts upon the Act.  While the pensions' officer may be present at the sub-committee he is under no obligation whatever to be present.  In very many cases the pensions officer is not present, with the result that the claimant has no opportunity of knowing what case has been made by the pensions officer as to why he should not get a certain pension awarded by the sub-committee.  If the claimant cannot find out the details of the case made against him it is certainly impossible for him to meet that case and to secure that justice shall be done.  Formerly the files of evidence in the case and the pensions officer's report of the estimated means of the claimant were available when Deputies' representations were made in person.  In that way a Deputy was able to find out, on behalf of the claimant, what was the case that was made behind the claimant's back.  I suggest that unless these <Col N="1579" /> files of evidence are made available to somebody on behalf of the claimant, the claimant cannot meet the case made against him.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting to compare the treatment meted out by the Appeals Department in the matter of old age pensions with the treatment extended to the claimants for army pensions.  In the case of army pensions the claimant can be present before the deciding officer.  He can call officers to his assistance and Deputies to give evidence.  He can call in any influential persons whom he can persuade to come before the deciding officer, and they can give evidence on his behalf, and there is not a word about the terrible evil effects that may result from contact between the deciding officer and these persons. Persons giving evidence on behalf of army officer claimants are guaranteed that however false their evidence may be, the light of day will never be let in upon it.  If that is justified I hold that the course of action which shuts out Deputies from making representations on behalf of old age pension claimants certainly cannot be justified by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting to run briefly over some of the views expressed by Deputies who took part in this debate. In that way we can get an idea of the mentality and the angle from which those Deputies who intend to vote against this motion approach the question.  Deputy Bennett said the privilege was seldom of advantage to Deputies.  Later on he admitted that he never achieved any success by personal representations.  Apparently the only thing worrying Deputy Bennett in this matter was whether the privilege was of any advantage to him or not, or whether he personally secured any success.  But the point of view from which we should approach this question is not what benefit it should be to Deputies, but what benefit representation in person by Deputies would be to the old age pension claimants.  Again Deputy Bennett said the privilege was availed of by a good many Deputies, and not by others.  Of course it was.  It was <Col N="1580" /> availed of by Deputies who took a particular interest in this class of their constituents, and it was availed of largely by them.  It was not availed of by Deputies who, when there was a lesser opposition in this House, got into a lackadaisical method of discharging their duties to their constituents. But the fact that Deputies who do take a deep interest in that privilege, availed of it to its fullest extent is not sufficient reason why that privilege should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Egan told us that it opened up avenues for abuse.  It is all very well to say that it opened up avenues for abuse but no evidence was submitted by Deputy Barry Egan or anybody else to show that actual abuse took place.  If abuse did take place, what conclusion does it drive us to?  It drives us to the conclusion that the deciding officer, before whom representations in person were made, was not able to stand up against the personal contact with the people making the representations.  It is a reflection upon the deciding officer which we think is unmerited.  I may say, at this stage, that of all the departments I have had experience of since I came into the House, there is no Department of State where the officers discharge their duty more conscientiously than the Old Age Pensions Department, and, although I was in that Department very frequently, I never got anything there but the greatest courtesy and assistance in trying to investigate cases and get down to the truth.  If there have been abuses, as Deputy Barry Egan asks us to believe, how is it that nobody became aware of these abuses from 1922 to 1929?  It seems to me to be rather extraordinary that these abuses should have crept into the Department suddenly in 1929 like a bolt from the blue and that the Minister for Local Government issued this order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Egan says that these old people have friends down the country. He suggests that the local curate and local shopkeepers can always give assistance to old age pensioners when claims are pending.  Apparently Deputy <Col N="1581" /> Egan thinks that anyone and everyone can make representations on behalf of old age pensioners, except the people whose duty it is to do so, and who are elected to defend the rights of these old people as well as the rights of their other constituents. Deputy Egan says he could imagine the difficulties of getting information fifty or sixty miles away from the claimant's residence.  Those who are opposed to this motion are not concerned at all about the old age pensioners' claims, or concerned to see whether they get justice in the appeals to the Department or not.  They are concerned with the difficulties personal representations would place in their way, and the possible results of these representations.  The Minister for Local Government in the course of his speech the other day stated that Deputies were not prevented from making statements, that they could dictate any statement to an officer supplied for the purposes.  Of course that is perfectly true.  Deputies are not prevented from going to the Department and making a statement, but what on earth is the use of going to the Department to make a statement to a junior officer who knows nothing whatever about the Old Age Pensions Act, knows nothing whatever about the case under discussion, who has not the file of evidence available, and who cannot tell the person making the representation of the case that has been made against the sub-committee's award?</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that the sub-committee is the pivotal point, that everything turns upon that, and that the claimant must look to the sub-committee to make all the representations that are to be made.  But the Minister must be aware that the sub-committee very often makes a mistake and does not give a claimant all that he is entitled to.  I think claimants very often appeal against the decisions of the sub-committee, as well as against the decisions of the pensions officers.  Sub-committees are under no obligation whatever to take any particular protective steps in favour of the claim, and when they make a <Col N="1582" /> mistake it is up to the claimant to find someone who will even fight the sub-committee on his or her behalf. The Minister admitted during the course of the discussion that the pension officer gets instructions as to the value he is to put on the various items, such as crops, stock etc.  The value that the pension officer puts on the various items that constitute a claimant's income is never disclosed either to the claimant or to the sub-committee. When the pension officer appears before the sub-committee his estimate of the income of the claimant is a certain round figure, but what goes to constitute that round figure is not disclosed.  Obviously there is room for a tremendous amount of error there. If the pensions officer has instructions to put a certain value on a cow, an acre of potatoes or other crops, these instructions cannot have universal application. In many parts of the northern end of County Monaghan, if pension officers applied the instructions supplied to them for the purpose of estimating a claimant's means, and put the same value on half an acre of potatoes in that end of the county as on a half acre of dry land in another part it would be an injustice, because the potatoes put down in the northern end of the county never came up.  In the same way if he said that a cow has a certain value, surely that could not have universal application.  A cow dying of old age could not have the same annual value as a well bred cow in the prime of life.  All these things go to show that unless the case that has been made by the pension officer against an old age pension claim can be seen and examined in detail by someone who can defend the claim, justice cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that it is unfair to the deciding officers to have personal representations.  That suggestion must carry with it the further suggestion that these officers would be influenced by the personal contact. There is no obligation on the deciding officer to decide the case there and then.  If any Deputy goes to the Old Age Pensions Department and discusses an old-age pension appeal, the <Col N="1583" /> deciding officer can produce the file, can discuss the claim and let the Deputy see the case made against it, but he need not decide the case at all. He can make a mental or written note of the representations that are being made by the Deputy, but he can take his own time to verify them.  He could send it down to the pension officer again, to see if the officer agrees with the representations, and in that way he can take adequate precautions to ensure that a Deputy in no way exaggerated the case.  The majority here may of their own free will and with their eyes open deliberately vote against this motion.  They may deliberately deprive themselves of the right to make personal representations on behalf of the old-age pension claimants but, if they do that, it is a matter for themselves, and, at least, they will do it with their eyes open.</P>

      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the House to a statement made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in regard to an old-age pension claim raised by me in the House on the 22nd October last.  On that date I asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to state why he refused sanction to payment of an old-age pension to Mrs. Annie McGranaghan, of Tober, Ballinadrait, County Donegal.  The Minister in his reply stated: &ldquo;This claim was disallowed on appeal on 23rd September, 1931, on the ground that I was not satisfied that the applicant had attained the statutory age.&rdquo;  I put a supplementary question to the Minister as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Is the Minister aware that this applicant is unable to procure her birth certificate owing to the fact that no birth certificates were kept there at that particular time?  Furthermore, I submitted to the Minister's Department her marriage certificate. Unfortunately no date was shown on it, but I submitted two affidavits by two old-age pensioners which furnished conclusive proof that <Col N="1584" /> the applicant had reached the required age.  In view of that, I should like to know what further evidence the Minister requires to enable this woman to obtain the pension to which she is entitled?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;I do not think that the Deputy is correct in saying that the marriage certificate contained no evidence of age.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister: &ldquo;I have the marriage certificate here, and I was quite correct in stating what I did.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;My information is to the contrary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of that unsatisfactory reply which the Minister gave I raised the matter on the adjournment that night. The Minister, for some reason known only to himself, refused to stop in the House during the discussion.</P>

      <P>On the night of the 4th November the Minister in the course of a discussion on the old age pensions stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decline to discuss questions of old age pensions here because this is not a competent place to discuss them.  We have a sample of the lengths to which Deputies will go in the case of Deputy Cassidy the other night, who got up and abused some of us for our attitude towards old age pensions.  He cited a case in which the question at issue was one of age.  He made the emphatic statement that no certificate of birth being available and the only certificate being the marriage certificate, the marriage certificate made no reference to the age of the person in question, whereas in fact the <Col N="1585" /> marriage certificate does state the age of the person in question, and does show the person to be considerably younger than 70 years of age. He was aware of that, because all the local people connected with the case, together with the sub-committee, were aware of that.</P>
    <P>I desire here and now emphatically to contradict the statement made by the Minister.  I assert without fear of contradiction that the marriage certificate to which I alluded contained absolutely no evidence of age.  I have the marriage certificate here.  I will read it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The marriage certificate recorded in the Registrar-General's Office shows that the marriage was solemnised at Donaghmore between Patrick McGranaghan, aged 27 and Annie Gallagher, age 19 on 25th May, 1883 and a certificate to that effect was signed by the Rev. D. Doherty, C.C. with the marks of Patrick McGranaghan and Annie Gallagher.  This shows that in reporting the marriage in the proper form at that particular time the priest who solemnised the marriage reported that Annie Gallagher was 19 years of age on the 25th May, 1883.  The information that that age was recorded was before the sub-committee which dealt with the claim on 16th September, 1930.</P>
