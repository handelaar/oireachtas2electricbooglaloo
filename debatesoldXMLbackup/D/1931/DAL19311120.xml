      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that the wives and near relatives of prisoners held to be tried by the Special Tribunal under the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931, have been unable to get any information as to where those prisoners are; and to ask the Minister for a list of such prisoners and where they are detained; further to ask the Minister whether he will apply the rules obtaining in the case of prisoners detained for trial in the Civil Courts in the cases of these prisoners.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware that people like Mrs. Liam Barry, who has a young family, and Mrs. Hurley, who has six children, have to come to Dublin and wander about trying to find out where their husbands are.  They do not know what condition they are in.  And people like Mrs. Gilmore and others who used to send washing in to their sons have found it impossible to get into communication with them, a complete change having taken place in the system which obtained when they were in the civil prison, namely of having visits and getting in parcels and <Col N="1908" /> changes of washing.  Is there any way by which that can now be done?</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that the relatives do not know where these people are very often.  If the Minister is asked where the prisoners are will he let the relatives know if they get into direct communication with him?  Will he tell them where exactly they are?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he would publish a set of rules drafted by him under the Act dealing with detained prisoners so that it would be known whether there would be any way of getting into communication with those people, as has always been allowed under military law when it was in this country. During the civil war it was always possible for persons to have some communication with prisoners.  Does the Minister propose to issue rules by which the same communication can be held between prisoners and their relatives outside who are suffering possibly a great deal more although they have nothing to do with certain activities?  Women and children are suffering through being unable to get into communication with their relatives.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this amendment at some length last night so that it is not necessary again to go into the various points raised.  I merely want to say that I remain entirely unconvinced by the Minister's arguments.  If I thought that the insertion of this amendment requiring that particulars of leases of State mines and minerals made by the Minister should be furnished to the Dáil would impede the mineral developments of the country or impose any undue hardship upon persons obtaining such leases I would not propose the amendment, but I cannot see how such impediment or hardship could arise.  I agree that the Minister made a point worthy of consideration in relation to prospecting leases and I am prepared to alter the amendment so as to ensure that particulars of such prospecting leases should not be furnished to the Dáil.  But in the case of ordinary leases for 99 years made by the Minister in consideration of a payment, or no payment as the case may be, we think the procedure laid down in the State Lands Act should apply.  The Minister indicated that there might be some possibility of industrial information leaking out which would be of value to the commercial rivals of the persons seeking the lease.  I cannot see that there is any real danger of that happening at all.  I take it that the matter of any particular lease would not be raised in the House unless it happened that two or more persons were in competition for the purpose of securing the lease and that it was revealed that the lease was given to a particular person <Col N="1910" /> on terms less favourable to the State than other persons were proposing to offer or that in some other manner it should be questioned.  If that should happen it seems to us desirable that before a lease is made and State property alienated an opportunity should be given to the Dáil to question, if it so desired, the action of the Minister and to secure from him an explanation as to his conduct.</P>
      <P>It is altogether undesirable that State property which may be of considerable value should be leased by the Minister for a long period on his own initiative and without any other body having any power of amendment or annulment.  As I said last night the lease made would be binding upon the whole State or upon any future Government of the State until it expired and could not be altered no matter what mistake was made in framing it or how unfavourable it was to the State.  I therefore strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his position and to accept my amendment which is in the form of the relevant section of the State Lands Act and which merely requires that certain particulars of such leases should be submitted to the Dáil and that they should not come into operation until the expiration of 21 sitting days or until a resolution is passed by both Houses.  The Minister's alternative suggestion that he should every six months or twelve months furnish to the Dáil particulars of the leases made, while of some value, obviously does not meet the case I have in mind.  I think that suggestion might be embodied in the Bill if the Minister does not accept this amendment but I suggest as preferable the procedure in my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to summarise what I said last night in regard to this amendment because nothing that the Deputy has said has caused me to change my attitude to the amendment. The Deputy has indicated one possible amendment of his own suggestion, and that is in regard to the prospecting leases which makes the situation worse.  In other words, the Deputy <Col N="1911" /> would allow the Minister to give the two years take note or prospecting lease, and when somebody had got a prospecting lease, and developed, from information at his disposal, then when the real lease comes to be made, it will have to be brought before the House and debated backward and forward.  The prospecting lease is the only one which can be given.  The other lease, which will be founded upon the prospecting lease, has to come up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be any lease longer than the prospecting lease, that has to come up here, as the prospecting lease, ordinarily, will only be for a very limited period.  There will be something else grafted upon it &mdash;the ordinary 99 years lease&mdash;and that will come up here and the relevant infromation that the Dáil will be entitled to ask for is what was discovered by reason of the prospecting lease, so that a man when he sees himself getting a prospecting lease, sees that immediately, unless the thing is a failure, and he does not want to go on with it, he will have to subject himself to the ordinary inquisition here if there is somebody else running for that lease.  Of course there will be always somebody running for it.  If you give notice that a lease is about to be made, affecting pieces of ground, to somebody who is interested, immediately there will be speculators who will certainly be able to worm out by questions through Deputies what is the particular substance that is being looked for.  The whole fruits of the first man's endeavour will be thrown open to a competitor who comes in here for the purpose of receiving information.  He will give a little bit extra if he can get a bargain.  He will, at any rate, worsen the bargain for the first man, and that is the system under which trade is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one would look at such a prospecting lease.  They will go in completely and entirely for a long lease and will be able to put up the case better than in the other instance that they are working in the dark, that <Col N="1912" /> they have no great information about the whole thing and they will look for the main lease.  The Deputy says there is no reason why there should be any revelation.  Unless this is a dummy amendment, meant only to uphold a certain point of view, without any real substance backing that point of view, the revelation must be made. Look at the particulars the Deputy speaks of:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Minister proposes to make or grant a lease under this Act he shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statements showing the person to whom such lease is proposed to be made, the property proposed to be included in such lease, the rent, purchase money, or other payments (if any) proposed to be charged for such lease, and the covenants, conditions and agreements proposed to be inserted in such lease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely if there is to be any substance in this thing, if there is going to be anything in the possibility of a debate, there can only be a debate when there is revelation.  If there is to be no revelation the amendment is not any good.  The Deputy says his foundation for this amendment is that the Minister must be questioned as to whether he has given away any valuable State property.  Surely to know the value of the property you must know what is the substance.  To know whether it is given away you must be able to relate purchase price to the value.  If Deputies are to criticise whether the Minister has given away State property, and whether it was valuable, they must get the relation between the price charged and the substance to be developed.  If that is brought out there must be a revelation of what the would-be developer has in mind.  There is going to be no trading in that type of State property under these conditions. It is bad enough to have the House considering a lease say for a building, or a piece of land.  But when you come to this where at the back of this prospecting lease there must be some element of secrecy, and depending upon the secrecy is the man's security that what he has discovered is not going to be revealed to all and <Col N="1913" /> sundry.  But here after a period of 21 days questions could be prompted, and put up, to Deputies, for them to get information so that the debate might be made a real one&mdash;that it would ostensibly be for a parliamentary purpose&mdash;but in the background there would be somebody trying to get it instead of the first comer who had been vigilant and enterprising.  This amendment would never allow any development of this type of property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer is that if this amendment is passed and the power conferred of bringing these matters up before the Dáil that power would never be used except in exceptional cases.  As far as I know in the thousands of leases made under the <Col N="1914" /> State Lands Act only one was ever questioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always objected to the analogy of the State Lands Act.  There is nothing secret about that.  Here the thing is flashed upon the Dáil because a lease is indicated. The Deputy speaks of exceptional circumstances.  Every case will be an exceptional case because Deputies will naturally not be in the know about any lease laid before the Dáil. What can they know about it from the particulars mentioned in the amendment? They must go on and inquire further, and once they do every case is bound to become an exception, because there will be someone in the background asking questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section</P>
      <P>(1) the words:-&ldquo;provided that no such payment shall be made in respect of any exclusive State mining right where at the date of the reservation of such right to the Land Commission or its vesting in Soarstát Eireann the minerals in or under the land in respect of which such right is exercisable were not being worked or were not being worked efficiently.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in this section that where an exclusive State mining right is leased to any person that the former owner of the land shall be entitled to be paid by the State 25 per cent. of any land purchase money or other payment received by the Minister under the lease.  The amendment I propose is intended to provide that royalty of 25 per cent. shall not be paid to any former owner where at the date of the reservation of the mining right to the Land Commission or its vesting in Saorstát Eireann, the existence of minerals in or under the land concerned was not known to the former owners or that such minerals were not being worked efficiently by him.  This section, in our opinion, raises a most important point of principle in the Bill.  I do not know <Col N="1917" /> what reason can be advanced to justify the payment of a 25 per cent. royalty to the owner of an estate which was purchased by the Land Commission and who at the date of such purchase did not know and did not care whether or not there were minerals under the land.</P>
    <P>If subsequent to that purchase and as a result of the initiative and enterprise of somebody else the existence of such minerals is discovered, there is, I think, some good case to be made in support of the proposal to give that 25 per cent. royalty to the former owner of the estate who knew that there were minerals upon that estate, and who had made or was making some attempt to work these minerals.  That former owner knew that under the Land Acts he would be entitled to this 25 per cent. royalty.  The purchase price would be affected accordingly, but if the owner did not know that there were any minerals on the land, or knowing that they were there did not attempt to work them, this proposal to give him 25 per cent. of the royalty in perpetuity is, in our opinion, preposterous.  I do not know on what grounds the Minister will attempt to justify it.  In our opinion it is an attempt to safeguard the interest of the landlord class to a ridiculous extent.  If it can be shown that these landlords have an equitable claim to the payment of this money we will not oppose that claim but we are unable to see how that can be shown.  I propose my amendment and I would seriously ask the Dáil to consider it because there is an important point of principle involved, whether or not the amount of minerals which may be affected by the Bill or that exist in the country are extensive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass talks about the Minister in this section looking after the interests of the landlords to a ridiculous extent.  The only difference between the Minister and the Deputy is that the Deputy is look ing after the landlords' interests not quite to such a ridiculous extent as the Minister.  I am opposed absolutely to the section.  I agree with what Deputy Lemass said that it is preposterous <Col N="1918" /> that 25 per cent. royalty should be paid to the former owners.  With regard to the Deputy's own amendment I am not quite sure that it means anything because I am not quite sure that in any case whether the mines were being worked efficiently or not that they were reserved to the State or to the landlord.  I am not sure of that.  I would like if the Minister would give us some information on the matter.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I am absolutely opposed to this section; it was my intention to delete the section, but that being a direct negative could not appear on the amendment paper.  I propose to vote against the section unless the Minister makes a case which will satisfy me that it is either fair or equitable to pay this 25 per cent. to the former owner.  I think the Minister will find it impossible to satisfy this House that we should agree to any such proposal.  I am against the section altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Morrissey has said in reference to Deputy Lemass's amendment is quite ture. This is rather an involved piece of property law.  There are exceptions and there will be exceptional cases to the sort of general statement I am to make, but that general statement holds as far as the great majority of cases.  We are dealing here with mines and minerals which come into the possession of the State either because they are mines royal, that is gold and silver, or else, because they have come to the State under Article 11 because they were previously gripped by a State Department, the Irish Land Commission. That is the Department that controls most of the land where it is in the possession of a State Department. Any land that came to the Irish Land Commission came under certain Land Purchase Acts.  This is to be taken with some little reservation; but in general the Land Purchase Acts do not affect the minerals which when the estates passed were being worked by the owner of the mines.  So that mines which at the time were being worked, did not come into the possession of the Land Commission and therefore are <Col N="1919" /> not in the possession of the State at all.  There will be exceptions, but, generally speaking, that is the law. That particular point was the one which Deputy Lemass referred to and which Deputy Morrissey has controverted. The position is as stated by Deputy Morrissey.  This section deals with such minerals as actually were, previous to Article 11 of the Constitution, in the possession of the Land Commission, and from that flowed over to the State and the Government as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took up the old provision of a 25 per cent. royalty with regard to all lands not affected by the 1923 Land Act, because there had been a previous bargain made that that 25 per cent. should go to the original owners. Remember what the 25 per cent. royalty is.  It is not 25 per cent. of the value of the mineral wealth.  It is 25 per cent. of whatever rent or royalty might have been reserved to the State.  It does not mean that there is no extra burden put upon the person who develops the minerals.  It means that whatever is taken from him is divided, three-fourths to the State and one-fourth to the original owner.  That was part of the old bargain made under the earlier Land Purchase Acts, that the owner should get a fraction of whatever was reserved to the Land Commission.  Now under the 1923 Act the State did not carry forward that precisely; it left a percentage of the mines and minerals under the Land Acts to be fixed afterwards by the Oireachtas.  It stated that where minerals came into the possession of the State and those minerals were afterwards worked that there should be reserved to the owner such an amount as would afterwards be determined by the Oireachtas.  We took the sliding scale and put in it the 25 per cent.  It has been argued by a variety of people that the two classes of cases must be distinguished, the 1923 Land Act cases and the land cases under the old Acts.  In the first case there was something amounting to a definite bargain under the old Land Purchase Acts with regard to the <Col N="1920" /> 25 per cent.  In the second case there was no such bargain.  If there was it was a fluctuating thing.  It might be one per cent. or fifty per cent., or such a percentage as might be determined hereafter by the Oireachtas.  It has been further represented to me that differentiation must be made as between the two types of cases.  If there was a bargain in the first case in the land it passed under the earlier Acts.  If mines and minerals have since been worked the previous owner has got some value.  If they have not been worked no owner under that precise bargain has a right to expect anything and is not entitled to anything. I am prepared to accept that point of view.</P>
    <P>Similarly it is argued that although you have had a differentiation between the 1923 and other Acts as under the 1923 Act the bargain was such a loose one that we are free without any consideration of the bargain to decide what the percentage is.  On the whole, putting these two things together, if you consider that the bargain has been made with regard to the earlier Land Purchase Acts and if there is nothing except a loose bargain with regard to these things the simplest thing would be to wipe out the percentage altogether.  Consequently I am disposed to agree with the counter amendment of Deputy Morrissey to drop the section.  I am not quite sure that the dropping of the section would meet what is wanted however.</P>

      <P>None that I know of, but I have not investigated that very thoroughly.  I think in the investigation I would find the bargain that had been made and the percentage that had been fixed, but I think that any percentage that had been fixed must have been hypothetical because until a percentage had been decided nothing could have been legally exacted.  There might be some arrangement that something should be looked to in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entirely sure that dropping the section will meet what is wanted because merely dropping the section <Col N="1921" /> means that we leave the law as it used to be under the earlier acts, and that we do not put in any percentage into the blank left in the 1923 Act; it may be better to have the whole thing tightened up and to say precisely with regard to all land in the Acts prior to 1923 that there should be no percentage paid.  The twenty-five per cent. will be wiped out and we could say that with regard to the land under the 1923 Act the provisions now made by the Oireachtas are going to fill the gap.  It may require a more positive amendment than dropping the section, but if the section is deleted I will accept it that the twenty-five per cent. should be entirely wiped out.  That will be put in in the form of a positive amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I drew the Minister's attention to sub-section (4).  I cannot see the point in it yet.  As I read the sub-section if a person has been given a right to obtain minerals in a certain area and if some person has a private residence on that part of the area, there is power to restrict the person who has the right to take minerals from interfering with the area surrounding the house, but such person must be paid compensation by the person owning the house. That seems to be unreasonable.  It would be impossible to carry it out in certain cases.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy gets the atmosphere proper to this section.  The side note sums up the matter rather accurately.  It refers to the &ldquo;grant of restrictions on working minerals required for support&rdquo; of, say, buildings.  In other words, this is rather the opposite to the granting of ancillary rights.  On the one hand, we have a feeling that people might own minerals beneath the surface and for the proper working of these minerals they would require to get certain ancillary rights such as we describe in Section 18.  If necessary, in order to work the minerals they may divert a public road, a railway, a tramway or might demolish buildings and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the reverse case may happen.  You may have minerals the working of which may be a good and proper thing, but when one looks at the value of the minerals to be developed, and looks at the value of the building on the site, it appears that while the minerals could be worked, nevertheless care should be taken not to let down any buildings.  In that case, it is a matter for determination by someone.  There will be a report <Col N="1923" /> and a balance has to be taken as between the right to work the minerals and letting down or demolishing buildings, or alternatively paying compensation for working the minerals in such a way that support will be provided for the buildings.  In both cases we say that the person getting certain rights ought to pay for the getting of those rights.</P>
    <P>I think that the Deputy should read Section 29 and 18 together.  It is possible the balance might shift from Section 29 to Section 18 and the position might be that what would be required is not a restriction on the working of the minerals, such restriction being necessary for the support of buildings, but a restriction the other way.  It might be necessary to let down the buildings in order to work the minerals properly.  That decision will be given on the calculation that is made between the relative value of letting down the buildings or working the minerals properly. Supposing the person is getting good value from the working of the minerals, but has to take away from that value by supporting a building, there has to be another calculation as to whether or not he is going to be fined arising out of the working of the minerals by certain restrictions being placed upon him.  Alternatively, you might say, is he going to be allowed to demolish the building and pay compensation?  If the two section are read together I think the Deputy will see that the two cases are met, and that there is a shifting over at a certain point from Section 18 to Section 29.  If the two section are read together I do not think there will be any hardship.  Sub-section (4) is the sub-section the Deputy referred to on the Second Reading.  There again if there is compensation to be paid remember that the Mining Board comes in and will have the decision as to the amount. The question whether compensation is to be paid or not, or whether in fact it is a Section 18 point or a Section 29 point may lie with the Board for advisory opinion and with the Minister for final decision.  The question of <Col N="1924" /> amount will arise afterwards and there the Board can come in again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is that if there is to be compensation it will have to be paid by the owner of the buildings which are to be left undisturbed.</P>

      <P>Does it not look a very remarkable thing to propose?  If there is a group of houses in any area like Avoca, and if someone who has got mining rights comes to the district, and an objection is made that if he operates he will interfere with the safety of the houses, the owner of the houses is able to get an order against him, but it will be on condition that the owner may have to pay compensation to the mines lease-holder.  That is a thing that was never thought of.  The owner of the houses may not be in a position to pay compensation to anybody. I do not see any justice or reason in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say the section is going to be removed.  The Deputy might advance to that point. The section is wiped out, let us say.  I have a right to mine in that particular area.  There are buildings in that area. I have a right to come along and subtract the earth, let down the buildings and pay compensation to nobody.  That would be the situation if this section were not there.  This section comes in and says that an application may be made by the owner of the property. We started off with the person who owns the minerals having a right to take away the earth and let down the buildings.  Then we come on to this section which says that any owner of buildings can apply for restrictions to be put on the man working the minerals either as regards the method of taking out the minerals or the packing. We put the restriction on the man who has the full rights.  In the previous case, where the section was wiped out, the person who had buildings might simply have those buildings let down and that was all about them.  We give him protection. There is a balance between the man <Col N="1925" /> with the previous right to remove the building and the man who has a right that his buildings should be kept up. There may be a balance of payment to be made between the two.  Take sub-section 3:</P>
      <P>The Minister in determining whether restrictions should be imposed shall have regard to the buildings or works or the cost of repairing damage likely to be caused thereto by subsidence, as compared with the value of the minerals, or to the importance of the erection or preservation of the buildings or works as compared with the importance, in the public interest, of the working of the minerals.</P>
      <P>If there is to be compensation, there will be compensation on that.  The Board will decide the amount of the compensation.  They will have an effective say in that.  You must take the priorities with regard to rights and how they are affected in this matter of restrictions.  If the Deputy reads the section, he will understand that if a man gets a restriction he gets the right to have his buildings kept up, which he previously had not.  He has, at any rate, the right of allowing compensation to the man who previously had the right to subtract the earth and let down the building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I could never be convinced that the proposal is just.  So far from legislating in that way, I think legislation should be directed towards protecting the man who is there already and owns property.  If he is to be interfered with, the person operating for minerals should be obliged to compensate him.  But, instead of that, there is the right to present this man, who has been living there, with a sudden demand.  He may have invested all he has in his property there without any thought of subsequent disturbance.  Now, it turns out that somebody has the right to take minerals from underneath his house or mill and that he may be presented by the Mining Board with a demand for compensation payable to the person who owns the minerals underneath his house.  That does not look a reasonable thing by any means. <Col N="1926" /> I think it would be easy to bring in better legislation than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One remark the Deputy has just made shows me the error into which he has fallen.  He took the case of a man with a building, a man who had no thought of any interference.  Then, somebody else comes along and gets the right to work minerals underneath his property. Arising out of that, there is destruction of the building.  The Deputy must compare Section 18 and 29. Section 18 refers to the grant of ancillary rights.  The Deputy spoke of a man who had no thought of anybody interfering with him.  This refers to a man who had always the right to work minerals and to work them to the destruction of the building.  The owner of the building, although he may not have thought of it, was always subject to being let down suddenly.  Then we emerge and say &ldquo;You cannot do that. There will be restrictions on the method in which you will take up these minerals so as to protect the building.&rdquo; If the other is the case, the procedure will be under Section 18.  A person comes along for the grant of ancillary rights which involve injury to or destruction of a building.  In that case, he has to make a good case before the Mining Board that it is in the interest of the public the minerals should be taken up and the building let down.  Then the owner of the building will get compensation.  This is the reverse case.</P>

    <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a <Col N="1927" /> new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Revenue Commis sioners are satisfied that any petrol is being used entirely for agricultural purposes, they shall allow a rebate of fourpence per gallon.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to accept the amendment.  When the old petrol duty was in force there were numerous provisions for rebate.  It was found practically impossible to work them. The revenue officers had the choice of lax administration, in consequence of which many people got rebates who were not really entitled to them, or such a careful system that under it those who might be practically entitled could not enforce their claim.  There is no such rebate as this in Great Britain.  They have not the rebate because of the impossibility of working it.  If we were to insert such a provision in the Bill, it would involve not merely loss of revenue but probably as much again in the attempt to administer it.  When the original petrol duty was imposed, I gave a great deal of consideration to this matter, and I came to the conclusion that it was impracticable. It could not be worked in such a way as to be fair and to give satisfaction.  In whatever way it might be worked, the administration cost&mdash; the cost of inspection, returns and checks&mdash;would be so great that it could not be carried out.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Cole in this amendment, but I see the difficulty the Minister would have in defining what are &ldquo;agricultural purposes.&rdquo;  It might easily be said that a petrol-driven wagon going to a creamery with milk would come within the ambit of the amendment. It might easily be argued, if the amendment were accepted, that a car conveying a farmer and his family to town was being used for agricultural purposes.  I can see the difficulty of administering the Act if this amendment is included, and I am sure Deputy Cole will admit that it would be a very complex question.  If the Deputy had clearly defined his amendment, we would know what was meant by agricultural purposes, whether it was cars conveying milk to a creamery, or whether the petrol used in tractors or machines of that character would be included.  I am anxious to support the amendment, but the words &ldquo;agricultural purposes&rdquo; might be translated in various ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended that the amendment would cover only agricultural purposes on the land and not for taking milk to a creamery or anything like that.  I think it would be quite easy for the farmer to furnish a return showing the amount of petrol he was in the habit of getting.  In that way it would be quite easily carried out.  It was done before.  I furnished the returns myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was done before, but it was found that it could not be administered.  It really killed the tax. The system of exemption killed the tax.  It was found impossible to administer it.  It was found impossible, for instance, to prevent people applying for petrol which would be free of this <Col N="1929" /> duty and supplying it to their neighbours at the top rate.  Generally, the system was found, after three or four years' experience, utterly impossible to administer.  The revenue authorities had either to allow a supply of petrol to these people without really being satisfied that no abuses were involved or else they had to establish a system of control, or of bonds and storage, which could not be worked out.  The system was tried out fully, and was abandoned as impracticable.  As regards its use on land, there was a proposal in Great Britain a year or two ago to give exemptions for this purpose, but that was only entertained as long as it was the intention to have the tax also on paraffin.  As the tax is not on kerosene, the amount of petrol which it is necessary to use is very small; and if you confine it to that narrow scope &mdash; that no farmer could apply for this petrol except a farmer who had actually a tractor working on his land&mdash;and eliminate all possible leakages, the cost of administration would be out of all proportion to the advantage conferred.  Even in that case, the cost thrown on the Exchequer generally, by trying to administer one of the exemptions, checking it, and preventing farmers increasing the quantities of petrol used, was found to be prohibitive.  A man getting petrol duty free might not be above using it for purposes out of which he could make a little profit. All these things are difficult; and although there might be some relief for farmers, I do not think the cost of exemption could be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister has said about leakages of an undue character, but at the same time the amount which the farmer got could always be checked, and it would not be worth his while to try and make anything out of it.  A great many farmers have small engines on their farms which they find more economical to run on petrol than on paraffin.  This would be a considerable tax on farmers who are in the habit of using their engines for threshing purposes, or who send their engines round the country to carry out threshing operations.  It <Col N="1930" /> is a considerable increase in their taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a word to the case put forward by Deputy Cole.  I am a farmer using a Ford tractor, and from my experience I have found that commercial petrol is the most economical fuel to use.  My tractor is never working on the road; it is used entirely on the farm.  If the difficulty could be got over of making a distinction between farm engines and those used for transport purposes I think it should be done.  It is hardly fair to charge the present rate of tax on petrol for an engine that is never used on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Could not the Minister see his way to apportion a certain amount of petrol to farmers if they were using tractors or machinery for agricultural purposes such as slicing turnips and things of that kind?  Quite a number of farmers use these tractors now.  I do not see why he could not apportion petrol to these particular farmers, because we should remember that generally when those farmers sell their produce they fall in for this tax again.  Lorries and motors are very much used nowadays by farmers in taking their produce to market, and also the buyers who visit the farms in the country will be inclined to pass on any tax they have to pay to the farmers.  If the matter is properly examined it will be found that the farmer is unduly punished.  I do not see why the Minister could not adopt some method of that description, that where tractors or machinery are being used on farms he should apportion a certain amount of petrol to the farmers.  I do not see any difficulty in doing that, and there would not be the slightest danger of leakage.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has just suggested supplies another argument against it.  If you start by making exemptions there is no logical limit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Dowd supplied the Minister with a good argument, but the Minister has not replied to what I asked&mdash;would it not be possible to apportion a certain amount of petrol to those farmers who use machinery for the purpose either of ploughing, chaffing, slicing turnips, or anything of that kind.  I do not see why you could not apportion a certain amount to these farmers.  It is easy to discover the amount that would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That involves the question of new machinery, new inspections, new official employment, and the reliefs would not correspond in any case to the cost.  Then you cannot avoid wastage or abuse.  I am not saying that Deputy Haslett would begin to get a good deal of petrol and supply it to his neighbours to run about in their cars, but there are people who would do that. For every case in which you supply a certain amount of commercial petrol, you would have to set up a new system by which in some way you would apportion a certain amount of petrol to a farmer.  You would have no means of knowing whether a man who has a tractor and who has a motor car also would not use that petrol for his motor car.  His children might be using the car to go to dances and to all sorts of places.  Unless you went to impossible lengths in the way of checks in that way there would be no possibility of preventing abuses.  This is not a new <Col N="1932" /> thing.  It was tried out for several years.  A system of exemptions was set up, and there was a great deal of experience of them and of the enormous abuses that arose.  It was the impossibility of administering this system with exemptions that led to the abandonment of the petrol tax pre-war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister is aware that prior to the introduction of the petrol tax in England some years ago, again and again, Minister after Minister was appealed to to put a tax on petrol instead of the ordinary road tax and he said it could not be done.  The adminisstrative difficulties, it was said, were overwhelming.  They had come to the conclusion after careful examination that it was utterly impossible.  Now we have a petrol tax in England. When they wanted money in addition to the road tax, they found it was quite easy to get over the administrative difficulties and that these impossible barriers they saw in front of them really were not impossible at all. They found it an extraordinarily easy tax to administer and I think that one of the great advantages of the tax both here and in England, is that it is easy to collect.  Instead of being the terrible bugbear it was a few years ago, it is now one of the most useful things that it is possible to administer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in his present attitude, because practically every farmer who would have a machine for which he would require petrol&mdash;a tractor or engine or anything of that kind&mdash;would also have one or two motor cars or other vehicles.  It would be practically impossible to prevent his making a claim in respect of petrol that would be used for these other vehicles; and unfairness would arise as between one farmer and another.  My main criticism of the amendment is that it is like straining at the gnat and swallowing the camel, because every farmer is going to lose a great deal more from the general increase in the tax on petrol and the cost of transport than he is going to lose by the <Col N="1933" /> increase in the cost of running his tractor.  It is going to amount to a very substantial increase in the case of the farmer who is accustomed to send his cattle and pigs and so on to the market by motor lorry.  Why is it that Deputy Cole seems to accept that big increase and at the same time objects to an increase that will be very paltry?  There are very few farmers whom he has in mind who would use 50 gallons of petrol in the year in the running of their engines for tractor purposes on the farm.</P>
    <P>The amount of petrol that a farmer will use for these purposes is very small, while on the other hand the increased cost of conveying by motor lorry farm products and goods required for consumption on the farm is going to be a daily toll on the farmer.  And I may fairly say that there never was a greater instance of inconsistency on the part of the Government than this increase in the petrol tax indicates.  They have been claiming all along that their whole desire was to keep down cost to the farmers, and that they have had to look at every proposed measure twenty times, and examine it again and again in order that it may not represent any increase, or too large an increase at all events, in the cost to the farmers.  Here is a tax put on apparently without consideration at all, which is going to affect practically every item of the goods that the farmer uses, either in connection with his work, or in connection with his living. I am sure that, as a matter of fact, it is going to press, in present circumstances, so heavily on particular places where train services have declined, and where the farmer is now accustomed to get his goods by motor delivery&mdash;I am sure that the tax is going to press so heavily on these places that the Government will be forced in quick time to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>Certainly, and I am going to vote for it again.  I should prefer to see an increase in the petrol tax rather than an increase on the price of sugar used by the poor in the cities and in the towns.  I do not want any more burdens.  We certainly have had light thrown on the situation to-day. I know very few farmers who, in addition to possessing a tractor, also possess two motor cars.  We hear a lot about the poverty of the farmer. Deputy Moore has quite enlightened us.  The Deputy must know farmers who have tractors and two motor cars as well.  We are glad to hear a happy note struck here at last.  We are glad to hear that the farmer is not so down <Col N="1935" /> and out as he is supposed to be.  It is a good sign of the times.  Assuming that the Minister wants to respond to Deputy Cole's amendment and to put aside twenty thousand or fifty thousand gallons of petrol for division amongst the farmers who are using petrol solely for agricultural purposes, who use petrol for their tractors, how is that petrol to be divided?  The Department is right up against that.  A great number of people will claim that they would be entitled to petrol for similar reasons, and then you would have quite another problem.  Another lot of people would be dissatisfied, and you would have another disgruntled section of the community up against every Party in this State.  As far as this amendment is concerned, while I am in sympathy with it, I find that it would be very hard to administer it, and I will vote against it, though I dislike to vote against it.  I am in favour of the principle of the amendment, but I find that it would be impracticable. I do not see how the Minister could work it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony in the speech that he has just delivered has endeavoured to justify his attitude in voting for this tax on the grounds that he would prefer a tax on petrol to a tax on sugar.  But why should there be any tax at all?  Is not that the first consideration?  And unless the Deputy is convinced that there must be a tax on sugar or a tax on petrol he has no right to vote for either and ought to vote against. But in fact this is not quite such a simple tax in its incidence as Deputy Anthony seems to imagine.  As I said on an earlier occasion, the trouble about petrol is that it suffers from its evil associations.  Some people can only think of it in one aspect of its use.  Some people never think of the workmen in Dublin who are carried in buses to and from their work.  They never think of the buses which run down the Coombe bringing the workman <Col N="1936" /> to his mid-day meal who, before that service started, was never able to see his home or his family from early morning until late at night.  These are the people who are going to be hit principally by this tax, a tax imposed now at the end of the present motoring season when the amount of petrol used for luxury purposes is practically nil.  This tax is not a tax on luxury but a tax on transport.  It is a tax on production, and in the case of the working man it is a tax on his tools. Yet Deputy Anthony, who would not vote for a tax upon sugar, is prepared to vote for what will tax the tools of the working man.  He is prepared to do that without having been able to satisfy himself or anybody else that the tax is unavoidable.  We have said that if it were not for the fiscal policy which the Government have pursued it would not be necessary for the Minister to come here and say that he is faced with a deficit at the end of the financial year.  Even yet, if we face up to the situation we can still balance our Budget without imposing additional taxation.  Those voting for this tax will be supporting the Ministry in their failure to face up to that situation.</P>
      <P>That is the issue that is involved in this matter.  I have some extraordinary figures which have been supplied to me by people engaged in the transport of workers in the city of Dublin.  There is one case of four small 14-seater buses on the road.  In the year 1928-29 the tax on these buses amounted to £134 8s..  With the increase in the road tax that burden was increased to £336.  That is to say the imposition of the first tax on petrol resulted in an additional charge of £300 upon that particular transport service.  With the second increment in the petrol tax a further charge of £300 is going to be imposed on these four buses, so that in something less than two years the total tax burden on the transport of working class people in the city of Dublin, that section of workers who use these buses, has increased from £134 to £936.  That additional burden of £802 will inevitably be transferred to the workers in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation will exist in <Col N="1937" /> other towns and cities where buses are used for the transport of people to and from their place of employment. Inside of two years that burden of £802 has been imposed upon this transport industry, and as I have said, it inevitably is going to be transferred to the workers either in the form of increased fares, which will be paid by the passengers, or in the form of decreased wages paid to the employees. That is why we opposed and have opposed all along the imposition of this tax.  If we were satisfied that petrol was being used merely for luxury purposes, merely by the motorist out on pleasure trips, we would have no hesitation in imposing the tax because we believe that luxury motoring of that type could be fairly taxed.  Here we find that the ramifications of this tax are going to be borne not only by the farmer who has a tractor on his land but by every farmer who produces foodstuffs and sends them to the market as well as by every farmer who is a consumer.  In that connection I would remind Deputy Anthony of what he said, that this tax would inevitably be transferred to the consumer.</P>

      <P>If the farmer has to pay more for the goods which he himself produces; if his costs of production are increased, and he has to transfer that increase to the consumer, where does the Deputy think it is inevitably going to rest?  It is going to rest on the workers in the towns, who consume everything that the farmer produces.  It is the workers that will have to pay for the increased burden that this tax will impose on the farming industry.  By far the greater proportion of this petrol tax will rest there.  I am convinced that under any circumstances it would be borne by the workers in the cities, but in present circumstances, and at this period of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee has referred to the effect this tax will have on the bus services.  I would like to say a word on behalf of those who use the smaller motor cars solely for hackney purposes. Within the last twelve months a direct tax of 8d. per gallon has been imposed on petrol.  Assuming that a hackney driver will use only three gallons of petrol per day, that means that he will be paying in direct taxation to the State 2s. per day, or £36 10s. per year.  I submit that men in a small way of business, such as hackney drivers operating in the country districts, will not be able to stand that strain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no argument to say that petrol is cheaper now than it was some time ago.  The fact remains that a man who owns one or two motor cars and makes his living solely out of cars that he has for hire will have to pay in direct taxation from £36 to £40 a year in respect of each car, and, taking these figures, he will not be doing a lot of running. That man will really have to pay more than a man with a pretty large income will have to pay in income tax. In the British time these people used to get a rebate.  The tax was then, I think, 3d. a gallon.  As to the rebate they used to get, I never heard there was any abuse in connection with it. I suggest to the Minister that the owners of hackney cars throughout the <Col N="1939" /> State will not be able to bear the strain imposed on them by this tax and that the question of giving them a rebate should be considered.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee let flow a great deal of vapour about the poor working men in Dublin.  When a duty of 4d. a lb. on butter was imposed, a duty that meant a very serious imposition for poor working people, Deputy MacEntee did not wail or weep a great deal over it, nor did he weep or wail over the duty that was put on oats.  That was not of much advantage to the poor working man or to the small farmer who does not grow oats. The poor working man has had to pay an extra 1/2d. a lb. for sugar in order to provide the money required for a partial de-rating scheme for farmers. I would ask Deputy MacEntee what is being done for the poor working man? No duty is being put on to protect him from hunger, degradation and wretchedness.</P>

      <P>With reference to this tax on petrol, the Deputy who has just spoken seems to forget that we do not produce petrol.  The duties that were imposed in the case of butter and oats and on other commodities produced in this State are likely to bring a return in increased prices to the farmer. That will enable the farmer to pay better wages to his workers, but I do not see how a tax on petrol is going to have any such results.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate that has taken place on this tax, into which the farmers have been dragged, I wonder if the Deputies on the Labour and Fianna Fáil benches forget what the responsibilities of the farmer are in connection with this. Is there any more equitable manner in which the tax could be imposed than to make those who use the roads pay a reasonable share of the cost of maintenance of them?  Who has to shoulder responsibility for the maintenance of the roads which are used by buses, lorries and motor cars? Is it not the farmer?  In the great majority of instances, who has to shoulder responsibility but the farmer? He has to shoulder all the responsibility, <Col N="1940" /> and what benefit does he derive from it?  After all, who should contribute except those who make so much use of the roads?  You may have a motor car lying up for a week; it may not be in use for that period although the owner has paid his road tax.  He, at all events, has contributed his share, but on the other hand, you have buses and lorries out every day in the week, and they have contributed only the amount of the road tax.</P>

      <P>That is quite right.  Anything he does is always good.  I have <Col N="1941" /> no hesitation in saying that a tax on petrol is the most equitable that could be imposed.  It makes every user of a motor vehicle contribute his fair and reasonable share towards road maintenance. We cannot get away from the fact that the farmer is the one man who has to shoulder the main responsibility for road maintenance.  Anybody with experience of public boards and who has to deal with the affairs of local authorities in the country districts will realise that the farmer's responsibility is fast exceeding his capacity to live up to that responsibility.  I think the Minister for Finance is to be congratulated upon imposing this tax.  As far as I am personally concerned, I cannot look at it from any other point of view.</P>

It is going to defray the cost of central government and the farmers who have to pay this tax are not going to receive any benefit as far as I can see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davis wants to lay it down as a sound principle of taxation that the harder a man works, the more journeys his lorries make to the market carrying cattle and other livestock, and the more journeys people make from towns distributing goods to farmers, the greater the tax that should be imposed upon them. That is Deputy Davis' argument.  His tax policy is going to be based upon the principle that the harder a man works the more you are entitled to tax him; instead of helping and assisting him, you are to pile burden upon burden on that man until he is entirely crushed. If Deputy Davis were quite clear in his own mind as to the purpose of the tax he surely would not have made the <Col N="1942" /> statement he did make.  His speech was a plea for increasing the burden upon the man who works hardest, upon the farmer who produces most, upon the worker who is in constant employment.</P>
      <P>If there is any plea to be made in this House by a Deputy speaking for the agricultural community or for the working classes, instead of endeavouring to increase their burdens an endeavour should be made to decrease them.  We should endeavour if we can to secure these moneys out of economies or retrenchments.  We have often urged from these benches that the deficit that we are called upon to meet could be met by holding for the benefit of our own people the money that is really ours, the money that we collect through the medium of those taxes and then pay over by way of pensions to ex-R.I.C. men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it cannot be seriously disputed that a great portion of the use of petrol in the country is at least a semi-luxury use if not entirely a luxury use.  All sorts of people are using motor cars, even, as they may say, on business, in a semi-luxury way.  You find a business man who formerly came to town on the tram or on the train now driving to the city in a motor car.  Probably he saves five or ten minutes and he may lie a few minutes longer in bed in the morning in consequence; but to allege that if he were not able to travel to the city by motor and if he has to come in by tram or train there would be a serious economic loss in his business seems to be absurd.  The use of cars in a great many instances is, I will not say a luxury use, but at least it is a semi-luxury use. Take car owners in the City of Dublin, for example.  The use of cars in the city is in nearly all instances a semi-luxury use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> A great deal of bus travelling is something of the same nature.  There are many bus services, and if they were curtailed it would not be, to any great extent, a loss.  There are other bus services that supply an amenity which previously did not exist.  In some cases you have people travelling by bus who, with very little inconvenience, could travel by train or tram.  Where you have excess facilities, where you have three or four ways of getting to a place that are not really necessary, that is uneconomic, and in such a case the use of the bus is a luxury use.  I have not any hesitation in saying that a very <Col N="1944" /> great proportion of the use of petrol is either luxury or semi-luxury use, and therefore there is a very substantial proportion of this charge that does not by any process get back to a charge on the poorer members of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd mentioned a certain exemption which existed before, and he said he never heard that it had been abused; never heard there was any abuse in connection with it.  The story I heard was that there was never anything but abuse in connection with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment no. 1:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; line 18 to and including the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; line 19 and substitute the following&mdash;&ldquo;words indicating the country in which such goods were produced or manufactured.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the meaning of the words &ldquo;indication of origin.&rdquo;  The Bill says that &ldquo;indication of origin&rdquo; means a word or words indicating that such goods were not <Col N="1948" /> produced or manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.  I suggest that the meaning of these words in commonsense, and the meaning which should be attached to them in the Bill is as indicating the country in which the goods were produced or manufactured.  It is intended obviously in this Bill that certain classes of goods on importation or upon sale in this country, should have attached to them an indication of origin.  Attaching words stating that these goods were not produced or manufactured in Saorstát Eireann is not, I contend, an indication of origin. It is merely an indication that they were not produced in Saorstát Eireann. I am anxious to know why the Minister has adopted that particular interpretation of the phrase.  It seems to me that the proper interpretation is the one suggested in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words which the amendment suggests may be, and in many cases would be, the words which would be applied to imported goods.  The plan which we proposed under this legislation is that a commission reports, with regard to restriction orders or sale orders, and the Commission, where they report in favour of a restriction order, must specify the things set out in Section 9. The first of these is at least one form of indication of origin to be borne by such goods.  The commission's report comes before the Executive Council, and the Executive Council either pass it in that form, or modify it or send it back.  Eventually we get something done by the Executive Council on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be at least one form of indication of origin.  Supposing the Commission says it should indicate the country of origin, then it can definitely, under Section 9 (1) (a), say so.  There may be cases in which there will be a difficulty in determining which is the country of manufacture.  There may be cases where the raw material came from one country, some manufactured process being imposed on them, say in Germany, and a further manufactured process, say in France, and it may be rather hard to determine.  Even sub-section (5) of this section does not give <Col N="1949" /> complete guidance in that matter.  It may be hard to specify which is the precise country.  There is, in addition, the possibility that has to be looked forward to that there may be more intimate trade relations entered into with certain countries than with others, and it may be necessary in certain cases, for instance, to say &ldquo;French Manufacture&rdquo; or &ldquo;German Manufacture,&rdquo; or, on the other hand, to say &ldquo;Commonwealth Manufacture.&rdquo; We want, at any rate, to have the option left in the first instance to the Commission, and in the second instance to the Executive Council, to say that in certain cases they are not to be restricted to precise words indicating the precise country in which the manufacture has been carried out.  I should say that in the great number of cases where there is a clear case the indication of origin would be made in a specifically mentioned country.  It is better, however, to have a certain amount of latitude to meet rather exceptional cases, and even a case that may not be in such a small minority in future as it would be at this moment. But this does not prevent the Commission doing what the Deputy wants done.  In certain cases it may be done, but in certain cases wider latitude is given to the Commission simply to say produced or manufactured abroad, or manufactured in a group of countries, or the precise country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister adheres to this form for two reasons&mdash;(1) that it may be difficult to determine the precise country of origin, and (2) that it may be desired to use such a description as &ldquo;Commonwealth Manufacture.&rdquo; Somewhere in the Bill the country of origin is defined as the last country in which any process of manufacture was undergone.  That seems to me to remove that difficulty.  It does not make any difference whether the goods originated in Russia and had undergone a process of manufacture in Czecho-Slovakia and another process in Great Britain.  As far as the Bill is concerned these goods will come in as having been manufactured in Great Britain, because that is the last country in which the process of manufacture <Col N="1950" /> was applied to them.  The other objection which the Minister raised, however, is much more serious.  If it is intended to use the phrase &ldquo;Commonwealth Manufacture&rdquo; then the whole purpose of the Bill will be negatived, because that description can be as misleading as any other.  At present we are, unfortunately, part of the Commonwealth, and the phrase &ldquo;Commonwealth Manufacture&rdquo; might be misunderstood to mean of Saorstát Eireann manufacture.  In so far as goods were of Saorstát Eireann manufacture, it would be an accurate description to apply to them.  If that is the sole reason why it is intended to adopt this form of words in the Bill it seems to me that the case for the amendment is much stronger than I thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point the Deputy referred to, I think the section he is referring to is Section 1 (5) which says:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act imported goods shall be deemed to have been manufactured in the country in which they last underwent before importation a substantial change by reason of any treatment or process.</P>
      <P>We can see cases where that would not obviate the difficulty in every case of goods of a composite nature.  We can see that part of the goods had undergone a process of manufacture in one country and another process in another.  What is the description to be?  I think there are times when it would not be the correct thing merely to say a certain country because there has been some process of manufacture there.  There are certain Russian goods to which people in this country have a decided objection, and they come through Poland.  There is some process of manufacture there.  Is it desirable to have it determined that these goods are going to be marked &ldquo;Polish,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Russian&rdquo; goods?  We would rather have latitude, and I think there is considerable latitude under Section 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We consider that the Commission and the Executive are the people who ought to determine in each case at least the form of indication of origin to be borne by such goods.  The Commission must report on that.  We consider that it is better to allow them to have that latitude.  I have introduced the question of the Commonwealth matter and I think it is an important thing, but it has been taken up wrongly by the Deputy. There will be no question of allowing goods to be marked in such a way that people might say the Free State is in the Commonwealth and, therefore, that means home manufacture.</P>
      <P>There will always be a specific indication of the foreign origin of the goods, that is to say, goods having their origin outside this country. There might in addition be put in the precise terms &ldquo;Australia&rdquo;, &ldquo;Canada&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;Commonwealth&rdquo;.  We think it is wise to leave it as it is.  That is what did happen in other cases.  We think it a wise thing to leave the Commission in the first instance to the Executive Council, and in the next instance to say that in the case of certain goods under peculiar circumstances, certain latitude should be given to their description.</P>

If my amendment is accepted it would be possible to put this description on certain goods: &ldquo;that these goods were not made in the Saorstát&rdquo;.  The Minister's form of words prevents that description being put on the goods. That is the only difference between his form of words and mine.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), lines 41 and 42, to delete paragraph (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> The definition of the expression &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is applied to Part III of the Bill.  Part III of this Bill relates to goods which are made subject to a restriction order of one kind or another following the report of the Merchandise Marks Commission to the Executive Council.  It is proposed to indicate here that the expression &ldquo;sale&rdquo; does not include the sale of any foodstuffs which have undergone a process of cooking in Saorstát Eireann.  The reason I move to delete that paragraph (d) is because we think we see there a possible loophole being created by reason of the fact that certain classes of goods which are sold under a misleading description would be so sold in the future.  I have in mind one class of goods that might be sold as Irish produce though imported. That is smoked ham.  Whether the process of smoking is a process of cooking or not, I do not know, or whether smoked ham would mean ham that has undergone a process of cooking.  I do know that in Germany smoked ham is sold as cooked ham, and the smoking is deemed to be a process of cooking.  There is a possibility that the smoking of the hams here after being imported might be deemed to be a process of cooking. Therefore, we might have the practice of bringing in Chinese bacon, smoking it here, and selling it as Irish bacon allowed to continue, under this Bill, if this paragraph (d) is allowed in.  I think that description should be tightened up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty we are in about all these definitions is frankly this: There are certain industries in the country depending upon some process of manufacture being imposed upon raw material imported into the country.  We have to make a decision as to whether or not there is likely to be a substantial amount of a particular type of industry carried on and which might be prevented if the Deputy's amendment were accepted.  Deputies will notice a difference between paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) of sub-section (3).  They will notice that one paragraph includes cooking and preserving.  We cut preserving out of this particular section because there <Col N="1953" /> are certain processes of preserving which go on in the country and which are rather important.  We would prefer not to have this held up by any absolute prohibition.  Cooking is not prohibited at the moment, that is to say, goods imported into the country and which had undergone a process of cooking would not be prohibited.  I do not know what the interpretation would be as to whether it is cooking or preserving in some cases, or what particular description would cover this.  Supposing the Deputy's amendment were carried and that there was an application in for a restriction on the sale of goods that had undergone a process of cooking in the country: Looking at the processes as we see them now, we do not think that any application will ever be made under that, and therefore we decided that the best thing to do is not to prohibit but to apply this description to goods that had undergone a process of cooking in the country.</P>
      <P>The point is a very trivial one, but there is just a possibility that there might be an interference with something afterwards that might drive out industries.  On the matter of the application of this Bill we think that in the case of any cooked goods displayed in shops, there will be a way of getting over that by insisting that a label be attached to those goods, when exposed for sale in shops, indicating as to whether there was a substantial addition to the value by the process they had undergone in this country and that the goods were of such-and-such origin irrespective of the cooking process.  The amendment, to my mind, is a trivial thing.  I see no great difficulty one way or the other, but there is a possible danger if we accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister at all.  Take the application made to have imported bacon and hams stamped with the country of origin.  Suppose that application is recommended by the Merchandise Marks Commission.  The Commission recommends in favour of making a restriction order requiring that such shall be stamped with the country of origin.  If <Col N="1954" />&ldquo;smoking&rdquo; is a process of cooking, then bacon which is imported and smoked here is exempted from the operations of that order, and can be sold as in the past under the misleading description of &ldquo;Irish smoked bacon.&rdquo;  That is the danger that we are trying to safeguard against.  In Germany smoking is held to be cooking. There is some danger there, and I would like to see some safeguards erected against that danger.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), page 4, lines 12 to 15, to delete paragraphs (c) and (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this difference between this and the previous amendment, that whereas the previous amendment related only to goods which are subject to the Commission's restriction order, the definition of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; here relates to goods dealt with in Part IV of the Bill; that is, goods imported into the country bearing at the time of importation or offer for sale the trade mark of the trader or manufacturer, or some Irish place-name.  It is suggested that we should exclude from the definition of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; in that part of the Bill the sale of any foodstuffs in any hotel or restaurant or other premises for consumption thereon, or the sale of any foodstuffs which have undergone a process of cooking or preserving in Saorstát Eireann.  It is clear that these goods will not come in under Part IV of the Bill unless they bear the name of the trader or manufacturer or the trade mark of a manufacturer or trader in Saorstát Eireann.  If it is possible for them to bear that, they should also bear an indication of origin.  Therefore, I think it is necessay to delete paragraphs (c) and (d) in this part of the Bill.  I think it would be possible to ensure that an egg or rasher served at any restaurant would bear the indication of origin.  It will not be required to bear the indication <Col N="1955" /> of origin unless it bears the name of the producer.  If it bears the name of the trader, it must bear the indication of origin.  That is why it is necessary to delete these two paragraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two definitions in these two paragraphs (c) and (d).  There are distinctions between the two.  There is a further distinction that under Part IV of the Bill the name or trade mark of the manufacturer or trader must be on the label.  With regard to the point about preserving, there are some industries in the way of preserving foodstuffs. Are you going to keep all these in mind and are you going to keep in mind that there are a certain number of people engaged in preserving goods that come in from outside?  That is a special point.  The amendment is rather a trivial thing and I do not care how it goes.  With regard to paragraph (c) it is obvious that you cannot have hotels or restaurants putting on every man's plate an indication of the origin of the food on the plate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be, but there are certain things served at the table.  There may be mineral waters, and then there may be the question of the container of the mineral waters as opposed to the water itself.  We should have this label calling attention to the fact that the container has been made somewhere and that the water has been produced somewhere else. Similarly if sweets appear on the table it may be necessary to have a particular stamp on them.  Again if a box appears on the table there must be a little flag showing that the sweets are of particular origin.  In that way it seems to me that there would be innumerable difficulties arising.  I do not see any possibility at all under Part IV of this Bill where you could deal with the description of foodstuffs sold at hotels and restaurants.  Legislation must be of a general type.  If Deputies look at the possibility of something appearing on the table of a hotel for consumption it would be <Col N="1956" /> impossible to conceive how the origin of that article could be indicated.  A thing like that is so trivial that perhaps it would not happen once in a hundred years that you could have the indication of the country of origin.  I particularly would like at any rate that paragraph (c) should remain for preserving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot visualise any class of goods that may come in bearing a trade mark or trader's name or an Irish place name which undergoes a process of preservation here.  In relation to the other matter, if you take this example which the Minister gives of table waters, if a lemonade were offered for sale under the title &ldquo;Shamrock lemonade,&rdquo; if this Bill passes, it is not possible to sell that Shamrock lemonade over a counter but apparently it is possible to sell it in a restaurant without indicating the origin in the same manner as in the case of an article with a misleading title.  I do not want to press the point or to appear to deal with trivialities, but it is desirable that we should see that any goods which are imported or offered for sale here and which are so described as to create the possibility of a misunderstanding as to origin, that in that case there should be an indication of origin.  It seems to me that we should force that particular point of view in the case of all classes of goods and compel restaurants, hotels and the like to confine their purchases to Irish goods or to such goods the importation of which is permitted in the manner permitted under this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in that is trivial one way or the other.  The point in (d), cooking, ought to come in before, but preserving is the most important point.  It is well known that there are jams made and sold here under a manufactured name and with emblems and devices which absolutely and clearly suggest Free State origin.  It is notorious in these cases that the fruit comes from outside.  It is a question of how that is to be marked.  Does the preserving process add substantially to it, and if it does is it a thing that you want to count as sale under this <Col N="1957" /> definition?  There may be devices in trying to get that matter amended, but there are quite a number of gaps and the maintenance of the preservation industry is a thing we think important for the moment, and there would be very serious reactions through cutting out the phrase &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; in this definition.  Cooking can go.  As far as (c) is concerned, I do not hold one way or another against it.  By cutting that out we must envisage the possibility of applications being made for restriction on sale.</P>

      <P>On this section I would like to point out that a Commission will be set up which will be styled the Merchandise Marks Commission to perform the functions assigned to it by this Bill.  Sub-section (2) provides that &ldquo;the Commission shall consist of <Col N="1958" /> three members, of whom one, who shall be Chairman, shall be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, one shall be nominated by the Minister for Finance and one shall be nominated by the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo; It has been suggested to me that the members of the Tariff Commission might be asked to discharge these functions.  The burden that would be thrown on them under this Act will not be very heavy and the duties are somewhat analogous.  The procedure I think also is somewhat analogous and we might avoid adding to the number of officials and the expenses of the State if the Minister were to nominate a Tariff Commission to discharge these functions.</P>

      <P>On the section I would like to repeat here the view expressed in the Second Reading of the Bill. I think there should be no Commission at all and that the Minister should have retained to himself the power of deciding the applications and making the orders or submitting the orders to the Executive Council to be made here.  The Minister for Local Government said yesterday that the Fianna Fáil Party had a weakness for boards. It is quite obvious that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have a weakness for Commissions.</P>
      <P>Bad as the boards are, the commissions are probably worse.  It seems to me in this case that the sole reason why a Commission is established is in order to delay and impede the enforcement of the relevant sections of the Act.  It would be much more effective if the Minister had dropped the Commission idea and had made provision whereby persons desiring restriction orders would make their case to him and he would be free to act if he thought fit so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the Fianna Fáil Board and the Cumann na nGaedheal Commission is, that the Fianna Fáil Board is intended to shift responsibility while the Cumann na nGaedheal Commission is established with a view to getting expert advice and not to rush slap-dash into things.  I have the same view as <Col N="1959" /> Deputy Good, that the Tariff Commission would ordinarily be the body asked to inquire into matters like this.  The section has not been phrased so as to make it obligatory to appoint the Tariff Commission.  It might be that the Tariff Commission at a certain point would be overloaded with its own special business, and there might be a necessity, for a short period, if there was likely to be a big rush of applications, to have some other body set up. Ultimately I think that from the point of view of avoiding expense, and because the two bodies, if different, will be dealing with kindred matters, the double functions should be allocated to the same body.  As to the other point that I should take this responsibility on myself, if I do take it upon myself, what is to be the procedure?  I must establish an advisory body to look into the applications.  That body will sit and hear evidence.  What is the difference between that and a Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be legal formalities and fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There would have to be fees even if I were to set up this advisory body.  I think it only fair that where a considerable body is going to benefit, and where certain traders will benefit, there should be some slight payment, I do not care how little, but something to mark the principle that runs through everything which is State aided in this way.  There should be some contribution by the people most likely to benefit in return.  If I was to have the duty myself of making a decision and reporting to the Executive Council on the various matters, I would have to select three rather expert people and to ask them to go through the same formality. These applications would have to be made in a formal way.  Unless they are in a formal way you will not have the security that expert evidence will be placed before you in the way it should be placed.  The only difference would be that the Deputy's sight would not be disturbed by the fact that there is a board or commission intervening.  It would be hidden beneath the surface, and there would be the idea that the <Col N="1960" /> Minister was going to do all the work. I think on the whole the Tariff Commission would be primarily the body to whom these things would be given. There might arise exceptional circumstances in which there would be a big number of tariff applications, coincident with a very big number of applications under this Bill.  The Tariff Commission, by reason of its functions, will have to deal with the very same type of material that will fall for consideration in applications under this Bill, and they will be getting the same type of expert evidence that they get at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this section is passed I want to put before the Minister a complaint that has been made to me regarding the working of it.  Sub-section (d) provides for the attendance, for <i>viva voce</i> examination or cross examination of persons who have made submissions or given evidence in writing.  An illustration was given me of the unfairness of the procedure inasmuch as a manufacturer in the Saorstát may have a customer in a particular area who sells a considerable quantity of the commodity that he produces.  This customer may have exhibited for sale in his shop, a commodity manufactured outside the Saorstát, that may be doing considerable injury to the products of the Saorstát manufacturer.  That manufacturer finds that it is his duty to make a complaint to the Minister.  Under the procedure laid down here, when the Commission opens its inquiry this manufacturer has to go before it, and to be subject to cross-examination.  He has to appear as plaintiff against his own customer.  He thereby loses the advantage of that customer's orders in the future.  In other words he makes an enemy and makes a loss in his trade.  I think the Minister will see the force of that argument, and I hope that between this and the next stage he may be able to devise some means of meeting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable difficulty in meeting that.  There is the possibility of loss accruing to an individual because he antagonises a customer, by appearing in one capacity where the customer is appearing in another.  The Commission, by its regulations, can make provision for any of the following matters:</P>
      <P>The form and manner in which submissions shall be made, and evidence given to the Commission, and in particular, whether such submissions and evidence shall be given viva voce or in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And &ldquo;the admission or exclusion of the public to or from the sittings of the Commission.&rdquo;  I think on a case being made like that it is left to the discretion of the Commission. The commission may say: &ldquo;We will not ask that person to appear for a viva voce examination, or if we do we will ask him to appear at a private session.&rdquo;  It would be very dangerous to go to the other extreme, and to set out to prevent the Commission being able to procure the attendance and the viva voce examination of people who have made a submission in writing.  It is clearly a power that they should have, and in most cases exercise, seeing that these persons have made a submission in writing.  There might be certain points which would require explanation by viva voce examination.  It might be possible to put in some other phrase to indicate to the Commission that there were, in the view of the Dáil, exceptional circumstances in which the manufacturer who made the submission did not want to be cross-examined in the presence of a customer.  That is rather a small point, and I do not know if it is wise to refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that a complaint coming from a manufacturer should be kept as far as possible private so that the customer would not know.  Naturally a shopkeeper against whom action would be taken would feel aggrieved if a complaint was made by the manufacturer and he would say &ldquo;I <Col N="1962" /> have been a good customer in the past. Now you are giving information against me and you are drawing me into this trouble.&rdquo;  Possibly the business relations in the future would not be at all as friendly as in the past.  I think it is only fair to protect the manufacturer from incurring the odium of his customer seeing that it might be reflected in the business.  That business might be a considerable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the best safeguard of the kind required by Deputy Good is that suggested in my amendment number 4, that in such circumstances the Executive Council on their own initiative may refer the application to the Merchandise Marks Commission so that there will be no plaintiff or applicant as it were on the spot.  Any person who would give evidence would merely do so as a witness upon a matter referred to the Commission by the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that does not meet the difficulty.  A manufacturer is an expert in a certain business, the Executive Council nevertheless decide that they will take the making of the application out of the hands of that individual, and make the application themselves.  What does the Commission do?  They have to get expert evidence and they summon the individual as a witness.</P>

      <P>The Tariff Commission heard evidence in camera at the request of a manufacturer interested in a particular application who did not desire to give his evidence in public. Could the Minister say whether that <Col N="1963" /> was done at the discretion of the Commission or whether it is provided for in the Tariff Commission Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is in the Act.  In this case, the Commission can admit or exclude the public.  I do not know whether that would be wide enough to cover everybody but the person actually giving evidence.  But I know that what Deputy Moore has stated is correct&mdash;that manufacturers on a tariff application have made very definite complaints against retailers and have been unable to make those complaints without the retailers being present, in more than one case.  I would consider the phraseology of (e) to see whether it would be necessary to put in precise words as to the admission not merely of the public or of people interested, but of anybody, while a particular witness was giving evidence, but I would leave it to the discretion of the Commissioners as to whether or not they would exercise the power of exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not put in some paragraph of that kind, the Bill will not be as useful as it might otherwise be.  Naturally, the manufacturer will say, &ldquo;If I am to deal with this difficulty, I am going to lose a customer.&rdquo; He will consider very carefully whether the loss he is incurring at the moment is not the lesser of two evils.  From that point of view, he may not move, whereas if the procedure were different he would take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>These orders are rather difficult.  They cannot be made without expert evidence.  The expert evidence must come, in the main, from the manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Or an association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or an association of manufacturers.  The evidence must come from either a manufacturer or an association of manufacturers of the goods against which the importation or sale order is sought.  We must get that manufacturer or association before the Commission.  The difficulty is that Deputy Good wants to let these people give their evidence and not <Col N="1964" /> have them cross-examined in the presence of customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Or brought into contact with their customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says that he does not want them brought into contact with their customers he means that he does not want them brought face to face with their customers.  If the manufacturers' interest is, in fact, in conflict with the interest of certain customers, that is a fact and cannot be disturbed.  What the Deputy is anxious about is the disturbance of trade that might arise because of these two persons, formerly good business friends, being made less friendly by the fact of one giving evidence on one side and the other giving evidence on the opposite side. The aim of the Deputy might be secured by giving the Commission power to exclude all persons but the person who is being cross-examined. The difficulty will be that one side must put up a case and that another side must be in a position to deal with that case.  If somebody gives a bit of evidence and you want to find out how far it is true from persons interested from another angle&mdash;retailers or consumers, for instance&mdash;you must allow them to see the case that was put up against them.  The Commission on the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case would want to hear the case against. I will consider the matter before the next stage.  I may have to consult the Deputy more precisely and to ascertain whether the point he makes is one on which grave apprehension is founded.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Executive Council on their own initiative may, whenever they think fit so to do, refer to the Commission any matter or question which under the foregoing sub-section of this section an Executive Minister is authorised to refer to the Commission upon previous application by any person appearing to such Executive Minister to be substantially representative of persons engaged in the production, manufacture or sale of goods of a particular class or description, and the Commission shall consider and report on every matter or question so referred to them as if it were an application referred to them by an Executive Minister under the foregoing sub-section of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By this amendment I propose to give the Executive Council the same power in relation to applications to the Merchandise Marks Commission that they now have in relation to the Tariff Commission.  When the Tariff Commission was originally established it could only consider applications made by persons engaged in or proposing to engage in the manufacture of the goods concerned. <Col N="1966" /> Subsequently the Tariff Commission Act was amended to give the Executive Council power to refer to the Tariff Commission the question whether or not a tariff should be imposed on particular goods.  In this Bill it is provided that an application for a restrictions order must be made by persons who are substantially representative of persons engaged in the production, manufacture or sale of goods of a particular class or description. If no such application is forthcoming, then no restriction order can be made.  I think that that is most undesirable. There may be a variety of reasons why it will not be possible to have an application made in the manner indicated here.  The persons engaged in the manufacture or sale of a particular class of goods may not be organised or, for some other reason, may be unable to come together, put up the fee, brief counsel and take the necessary steps to have the application brought to the notice of the Commission. There may be other difficulties of the type indicated by Deputy Good.  In these circumstances, it seems advisable to us that the Executive Council should have the power that I propose to give them in this amendment&mdash;the power of sending a matter for the consideration of the Merchandise Marks Commission whether an application has been received or not, if it appears advisable to the Executive Council, of its own knowledge, that the question of imposing a restriction order on certain classes of goods should be examined. If it is intended to follow up in this Bill the procedure adopted in the case of the Tariff Commission, the Minister should have no objection to this amendment, because it is merely an attempt to amend this Bill on the lines on which the Tariff Commission Act was amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the Second Reading that I would be prepared to consider an amendment which would put it into the power of the Executive Council to refer to the Merchandise Marks Commission any matter or question which otherwise would have to be brought forward by <Col N="1967" /> a body of people substantially representative of persons engaged in the particular manufacture.  This amendment can be very sympathetically considered, but I want to point out the difficulties here and now.  The amendment does not meet the point raised by Deputy Good.  The person who does not want to be examined in presence of other people, instead of appearing as an applicant, will hereafter appear as an expert witness and will be subject to all the embarrassment that Deputy Good thinks is likely to be his lot in the other capacity. When the Tariff Commission Act was amended in this way, it was made quite clear that the main use the Executive Council was likely to make of that power was with regard to modifications or adjustments of tariffs previously granted.  It was recognised, of course, that there might be an exceptional case in which by reason of disorganisation a trade body could not be got together.  Certain difficulties were indicated at that time as likely to follow from the adoption of such a procedure as this.  The difficulties were of two types&mdash;that traders would not come together but would say that it was the business of the Executive Council.  That, we find, to some extent, happening with regard to tariffs. Secondly, where the Executive Council did take the initiative in putting a matter before the Tariff Commission, those interested, when asked to put up a case, always guard themselves by this sort of a phrase: &ldquo;This is not the case that we would put up if we were making the application on our own responsibility.  We have a far better case, but seeing that you are moving in the matter we rely upon you to put up the evidence for us.&rdquo;  In these circumstances, the application is likely to be less accurately examined and we are likely to have a less just decision than in a case where a body of people materially interested in the matter come together and put up the best case they can in the best way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not very much analogy on the whole between the Tariff Commission's procedure or, at least, the material that will fall for decision by <Col N="1968" /> the Tariff Commission, and the things that will arise for determination here, because under the Tariff Commission the thing to be decided is a big point of policy: Are people to be stopped from importing goods in a particular way or only allowed to import them on a fine for the benefit of certain people? What is going to arise under this measure is not a point of policy.  The policy is determined by the mere introduction of the measure.  There is almost the certainty, after the introduction of the measure, that goods produced outside shall be marked as produced outside.  There the particular point of policy is being determined by the introduction of this measure.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that will arise under this section is: What are the marks to be put up, and what way are they to be fixed?  As regards the details, I do not think there is going to be the same necessity for the publication of evidence as there is in the case of tariffs which concern a general question of fundamental importance.  Here is a matter on which you must have expert evidence.  Certain points of detail have to be attended to.  Otherwise that poise of trade which is so delicately balanced might be readily disturbed by a body of people, who are not acquainted with the difficulties of trade, coming in and suggesting that such-and-such a mark is to be applied in such-and-such a way.  Here, in a sense, there is not a point of policy to be determined.  But there is much more in the way of expert evidence required and there is consequently less reason why the Executive Council should take upon itself the task of making an application before the Commission which should be made by a body of interested persons.  If a body of interested persons do not come before the Commission in the position of expert witnesses, probably the Commission would find itself involved in such difficulties in the details of the application as might throw the whole thing back.  I think, more here than in the case of a tariff, there is dependence on people expert in the manufacture of a particular type of goods, and consequently they are more necessary as witnesses than in a tariff application. <Col N="1969" /> Although I do not object to the power which is sought under the amendment, it may result in traders not coming forward with the same alacrity as they otherwise might do.  Secondly, it might result in their not putting forward a case with the same weight; and thirdly, there might be much less occasion for the Executive Council taking action in this case than in the case of a tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to sub-section (2) of Section 6, which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever an application to an Executive Minister is referred by him under this section to the Commission, the persons by whom such application is made shall, as a condition precedent to the consideration of the application by the Commission, pay to the commission in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister for Finance such fee&mdash;not less than five pounds nor more than one hundred pounds&mdash; as the Commission, with the sanction of the said Minister, shall fix, having regard to the length of time and the expense which in the opinion of the Commission will be involved in the consideration of the application.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) provides that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;all fees paid to the Commission under this section shall be paid into or dispensed for the benefit of the Exchequer by the Commission in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that the underlying principle of the section is to protect the Commission from frivolous applications.  I think it is hardly fair that a trader who makes a complaint shall be burdened with this penalty, which is a heavy penalty.  He will have other expenses in addition.  I would suggest to the Minister that if the Commission come to the conclusion that the complaint is well founded, and is not frivolous, they should have liberty to return the moneys lodged, or leave the whole matter to the discretion of the Commission. Otherwise, I think that in a number of cases this will be a detriment to referring matters to the Commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good is correct in saying that the one reason for having a fee is to prevent frivolous applications being made before the Commission by people who are not going to press the case in a serious way, but that is not the whole reason. The other reason is that we want to keep up the principle, which we have maintained so far, that where a section of the community gets a special service from the State there should be some payment made by reason of that service, particularly where the payment is by way of contribution towards the expenses of the body set up to give them a special benefit.  It is quite possible, in fact I was considering this point myself seriously, that the minimum fee should either be lowered or taken away altogether, leaving it entirely in the discretion of the Commission&mdash;perhaps not entirely in the discretion of the Commission but in their discretion in consultation with the Minister for Finance&mdash;as to whether any fee is necessary in certain circumstances. My only difficulty is that if you delete the provision regarding the £5 and leave in the words &ldquo;not more than one hundred pounds,&rdquo; it looks as if you are regarding the Commission as a revenue-earning body.  You are giving an indication and creating an <Col N="1971" /> impression on the minds of the Commission that they are to charge heavy fees.  I would be prepared to drop the minimum and even drop the maximum fee, leaving it to the Commission in particular cases to say what fee should be accepted from the applicants.

One is that it is necessary to have some machinery for stopping trivial applications, and the second, that it is desirable that a section of the community seeking a benefit should be prepared to pay the expense of the body set up to give them that benefit.  There is adequate protection against frivolous applications in the wording of sub-section (1). The application is made to the Executive Minister, and if the Minister thinks it is a trivial application, that ends the matter.  He is not obliged to refer it to the Commission unless he is satisfied that it is a genuine application. Consequently the making of trivial applications is provided for under that section.  It seems to me that that section is very proper as providing against trivial applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it is not a question of providing benefit for a section of the community.  It is a question of providing safeguards for an industry here which is a benefit to the whole community by its very existence. Should we put unnecessary impediments in the way of any such industry getting all the facilities and assistance which it requires in order to develop? I think it is a point of criticism of the whole draft of the Bill that all the impediments are directed against an application being granted, but once the application is granted it is quite easy to have the restrictions order removed. The difficulties and the impediments erected by the Minister in the way of applicants are not there when it comes to a question of removing the restrictions order, and that would seem to upset the Minister's contention that the whole framework of the Bill presupposes the granting of orders in all cases.  The contrary impression was <Col N="1972" /> conveyed to me and to, I think, quite a number of other people who understood that it was the attitude of the Government that such restrictions order should not be made unless a strong case was made in support of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the objection that the Deputy's mentality raises to any Bill.  The Deputy wants to see tariff walls set up, and he thinks that we wish to see if we can break them down.  There are people in the country who want restriction orders in everything. I say that the whole framework of this measure predetermines the question of applications for restrictions orders.  The tendency is clearly and distinctly that the orders shall be made where the facts warrant it.  The Deputy refers to other sections dealing with amendments, revocations and exemptions.  They are clearly to prevent, in special cases of urgency, disturbances which in the minds of the Executive Council ought not to occur in certain branches of trade.  On the special point of the money paid, the Deputy says I have complete control, that when a trivial case comes along I need not refer such application to the Commission, and because I do not so refer them, no expense need be incurred. I prefer to have it this way, that I can say to a trader, who, I think, is substantially representative of the trade: &ldquo;What about this order? Go ahead and pay two guineas.&rdquo;  If the man says: &ldquo;It is not worth two guineas,&rdquo; I know then I have something to go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to pay two guineas in addition to whatever other expenses may be involved. If I see, according to the best attention I have given to it, that it is a good application, or if, on the other hand, I say to a man, &ldquo;You will have to pay two guineas,&rdquo; and that he says: &ldquo;It is not worth it,&rdquo; I think it gives me a line to go on.  In all the circumstances I think that a certain fee should be exacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I would be open to cross-examination here if such a fee was determined on.  If a good case could not be made for it on account of the extraordinary intricacies of the case which was going to be investigated, the cost it was going to involve which had to be met by somebody, if I could not make my case for the charge of 100 guineas, then a case would be established against me here and there would be certain repercussions from that.  On the second point, that people who get a benefit should pay for it, the Deputy says that it is not the traders who will make application who will get the benefit.  They will get the benefit primarily.  They will be a benefit to other people also perhaps, but somebody has got to meet the cost. If it is not going to be met by the people who primarily benefit, then the general body of the taxpayers who finance the Commission and its work, would have to bear it.  I think it is right that the people who are primarily going to benefit should be the first people to whom you look for payment. Bearing those principles in mind, I think it is quite fair, as Deputy Good suggested to-day, that we should do away with the minimum charge or even the maximum charge.  My mind does not run at the moment on the fees which are charged in a large number of cases that come before the Tariff Commission, but I feel certain that in no great number of cases has a fee like 100 guineas been charged.</P>

      <P>That would be a very much bigger matter than anything that will come before the Commission under this Bill.  I would be prepared to leave it at this that there is to be a fee and that the amount of the fee should be in the discretion of the Commission. The Commission may say that it is a simple matter and then the fee would be nominal, 2/- or 3/-, but I think we should have the principle established that there is to be a fee when there is a possibility of getting from the people who primarily benefit <Col N="1974" /> the expenses of the Commission that give them that benefit.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is only thinking of a fee of two or three guineas I am not concerned.  My sole concern was in regard to the possibility of fixing a fee of 50 guineas as was charged in some cases before the Tariff Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>I think there would be a number of 50 guinea cases before the Tariff Commission considering the extent of the work that had to be done and the expense that the Commission had been put to.  A tremendous benefit flows directly to the manufacturers concerned.  Considering that in the early days of the tariff at any rate the cost of that benefit has to be borne largely by the general taxpayer, it is hardly right that when a case has to be made out for that tariff, the taxpayer should also have to pay the expense of the body, before which that case is made.  I am prepared to consider some phrase that will leave this matter to the discretion of the Minister for Finance and the Commission but keeping the principle in mind that there should be a fee paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 6:</P>
      <P>6.  Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  If after consideration of a report of the Commission in favour of making an order or orders asked for in the application in respect of goods of a particular class or description the Executive Council are not of opinion that it is desirable that imported goods of that description should bear an indication of origin, the Executive Council shall refer the question to the Dáil within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which the Dáil has sat after such report has been received by the Executive Council and if the Dáil <Col N="1975" /> passes a resolution directing the making of a restriction or sale order or a restriction or importation order, or both such orders in respect of goods of that description such order or orders shall forthwith be made by the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that if the Tariff Commission reports in favour of issuing a restrictions order in respect of a particular class of goods, the Executive Council may issue that restrictions order.  I propose to insert a new sub-section which will provide that where the Commission's report is in favour of issuing an order and the Executive Council decide not to act upon that report, the matter shall be referred to the Dáil for decision.  It seems to me that it is undesirable from many points of view that the Executive Council should have power to reject a favourable report without the matter going further, first because it means that an application which is proved to be well-founded before the Commission would be turned down by a further examination which would not be half as effective and which would, in any case, be conducted in private, and concerning the reasons affecting such rejection the applicant would have no knowledge.  Secondly, we are aware that a certain difficulty in the Tariff Commission Act exists in so far as reports of the Tariff Commission cannot be considered by the Dáil at all unless the Executive Council introduces the financial resolution arising out of such report or unless some Deputy tables a motion for consideration in private members' time.</P>
    <P>We are anxious that that defect should not be carried into this Bill and that a report from the Merchandise Marks Commission, particularly if it is a favourable report on which the Executive Council decides not to act, should come to the Dáil in some automatic manner for consideration by the Dáil: that the Dáil then should have power to instruct the Executive Council to act on that favourable report whatever the attitude of the Executive Council may be towards the report.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  It is not intended to compel the Executive Council <Col N="1976" /> to make an order where the Merchandise Marks Commission reports against.  It relates only to such reperts of the Merchandise Marks Commission as are in favour of making restriction orders in relation to particular classes of goods, and where the Executive Council decides for some reason or other not to act on the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what the Deputy does mean. The amendment is drafted in this way, that if the Merchandise Marks Commission make the order asked for, and that the Executive Council are not of the opinion that it is desirable that goods of that description should bear this indication of origin, then there is to be a reference to the Dáil, and the Dáil may direct the Executive Council to make the order forthwith.  Would that involve the resignation of the Executive Council?  Surely it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to be practical.  We are in favour on this side of government by a Government.  We are not in favour of government by the Dáil&mdash;I say that frankly.  The Executive Council is appointed by the Dáil for a particular purpose, and the Dáil has always its chance of rejecting a policy of the Executive Council.  It can do it.  If applications are made, there must be applicants to make them, except in the peculiar case where the Executive Council may forward the application to the Merchandise Marks Commission.  The Commission may report in favour of that application, and the Executive Council may then turn it down.  If the whole thing has been conducted in secret, without expert witnesses being present, there is no possibility of anybody knowing about it or talking about it.  As it is, there is going to be an applicant or an expert witness or somebody who will be in the know, and from whom there can be publicity as to what has happened. There can be frequently used the medium of Parliamentary question in order to find out what applications have been received, what returns have been made by the Commission, and what is the effect of these returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> If the Deputy wants to have conditions imposed in order to get what would amount to a vote of no confidence in the Executive Council on a particular issue, there is always a way of getting that.  To my mind that is what his proposal means.  The Deputy's intention is to secure that on any issue which may be raised by reason of a report of the Merchandise Marks Commission, a vote of no confidence in the Government of the day can be sought, relying on a particular majority in the House to decide it.  If this proposal were adopted, it would simply mean that on very small matters that may come before the Merchandise Marks Commission, and to which attention may subsequently be drawn in the House by reason of certain processes, there is going to be a succession of votes of no confidence debated here in public time.  The result would be the same as if the other procedure were adopted, except that the other procedure confines such possibilities to occasions, just as they should be confined.</P>
    <P>Under this proposal votes of no confidence might be moved every day or on very frequent occasions and we consider that is not desirable.  We are distinctly of opinion that the procedure should be as it normally exists in any matters of this sort.  An expert body advises the Executive Council and the Executive Council takes the ultimate responsibility for any decisions as to policy.  Those decisions as to policy will be quite easy of understanding and any matters relating to them can be brought up by way of parliamentary questions.  There is one case, one exceptional case, in which there may be no possibility of publicity and no possibility of Deputies getting to know what has happened. With the exception of that peculiar case, I think the point of publicity is met.</P>
    <P>There will be opportunities of getting adequate discussion, if any Deputy likes to raise the point, on various matters.  For instance, the Executive Council may be forced in the Dáil to explain why it turned down a particular application upon which the Merchandise Marks Commission reported favourably.  That <Col N="1978" /> chance may be given Deputies on a request made.  Naturally, there will be certain responsibilities placed upon the person making this request.  There will be the question of how frequently are those requests to be made and to what particular matters do they refer. That is the sort of responsibility I would like to put upon people who are likely to bring forward these votes of no confidence, as I call them.  There has been no measure which I know of in which this procedure has been adopted of an Executive Council having automatically to refer to Parliament the reasons for an adverse decision taken by that Council in the case of a report made by the Merchandise Marks Commission on a particular matter submitted to the commission by the Council.  We certainly do not think that such a provision is suitable in a measure such as this Merchandise Marks Bill.  Certain evidence relating to a particular matter will be placed before the commission and will be voted upon by the commission, whose final report will later be submitted to the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>The Deputy points out that the Executive Council are less fit than the members of the Merchandise Marks Commission to report favourably or unfavourably upon the subject matter of an application that has been submitted for the consideration of the commission.  If they are not fit, can it be said that the Dáil is any fitter than the Executive Council to deliberate upon the commission's report and take a decision one way or the other?  The object underlying this proposal is to make trivial matters the subject of a vote of no confidence in the Executive Council.  Such opportunities should not be taken advantage of arising out of reports from the Merchandise Marks Commission.  I dare say many small points that could be debated will arise on those reports. The policy of the Executive Council in relation to some application, whether it be favourable or unfavourable, will no doubt be discussed, but I certainly disapprove of the idea of those votes of no confidence to which I have referred being moved on frequent occasions.</P>

      <P>The Minister supposes that there will be frequently cases of favourable reports by the Merchandise Marks Commission being turned down by the Executive Council.

Unless it is a very serious issue that is involved the vote of no confidence would not be passed.  What would happen is that an opportunity would be given to the Dáil to consider the matter; an opportunity which it otherwise would not have.  Let me remind the Minister that reports have been issued by the Tariff Commission recommending against the imposition of certain tariffs, so that no financial motions arose.  I put down motions on the Order Paper disagreeing with the decision of the Executive Council in some cases, and certainly in some instances the motions remained on the Order Paper for a period of eighteen months before they were brought forward for discussion.</P>

If what the Minister says is true, then I was preventing somebody else from raising the question.  In my opinion, it would be better that these reports should come up for consideration by the Dáil in Government time, and within a reasonable period after their appearance.  The main purpose of the amendment is to ensure that that would happen in the very special cases where the report of the Commission is favourable, and in which the Executive Council decides not to act.</P>

I think it does not need any amendment if we could be satisfied that the indication of origin would be translated in the proper way.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, I feel that the success or failure of the measure will depend largely on the application of the words &ldquo;indication of origin.&rdquo;  We are all aware that goods to the value of millions of pounds are coming into this country without any indication of their place of origin.  The printing industry, in which I am particularly interested, suffers severely from that, from laxity, if you like, on the part of the Government. I would like to hear the Minister explain at greater length the <Col N="1981" /> meaning of the words &ldquo;indication of origin.&rdquo;  I pointed out to the Minister on a previous occasion that very large sums of money are expended on printing matter imported into this country.  I can tell the House that the chief sinners in that respect are not the merchants and the shopkeepers. Some of them are amongst the importing printing concerns in the country.  I want to get an assurance from the Minister that when printing matter is imported into this country the imprint on it will be in type sufficiently large to indicate the country of origin and that magnifying glasses will not be required to enable one to discover that.  It is quite a common experience here that a very large amount of the printed matter imported does not bear the name of its place of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I think it is quite appropriate to refer to in this discussion.  It is this: where orders are placed in this country for certain kinds of printing and stationery, printing and stationery which in many cases cannot be executed let us say in Kilkenny, Wexford or some other provincial town, there is never any attempt made to see if it could be produced in Cork or Dublin, but immediately the order for it is placed with cross-Channel firms or with some firm in Belgium or Czecho-Slovakia.  That is a thing that I want to see stopped. The only way in which it can be prevented is by having the imprint on it in type sufficiently large that the ordinary person can read it without glasses.  The imprint should be as large at least as the name of the publisher. As regards certain classes of commercial printing known as shop dockets and printing work of that kind, it frequently happens that you have a block which suggests that the printing has been done abroad.  The customer who buys it gets the other end of the block on which there is no indication as to where it was printed. I hope that the words &ldquo;indication of origin&rdquo; will be translated in such a way that the industry for which I am speaking will now get the protection that it has been seeking for quite a <Col N="1982" /> long time.  We are not looking for a tariff, but if what I suggest is done the effect of it will be as useful as a tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has reference to the indication of origin and that is the point to which Deputy Anthony referred.  The only difference between the amendment and the section is that Deputy Lemass wants the Dáil to be the final arbiter on a precise motion brought before it by reason of an application being turned down by the Executive Council following its favourable consideration by the Merchandise Marks Commission.  I want to have it that if the Dáil is to have the final say it should not be by way of a vote of no confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exact way in which the indication of origin is going to be applied is somewhat outside the scope of this section.  The precise way in which the indication of origin is going to be indicated comes under the next section. The Merchandise Marks Commission must specify at least one form of an indication of origin and the manner in which that is to be borne by the goods to which it relates.  On that, I can go into the special points raised by Deputy Anthony.  Any question relating to a decision of the Executive Council after considering the report of the Merchandise Marks Commission will have to be raised in a precise form and on a particular case.  As regards the other matter, we believe in government by a Government not in government by the Dáil. We think the analogy Deputy Lemass sought to make with regard to a Tariff Commission case shows a weakness in his own case.  Even in a big matter like a tariff on fish barrels the Deputy himself recognised that as an absurd case.  He put down a motion with regard to fish barrels and left it <Col N="1983" /> on the Order Paper for 18 months without making any special effort to take it earlier.</P>
