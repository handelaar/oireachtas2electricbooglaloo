    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if it is a fact that the situation formerly held by Mr. P. Grant, Clonmany, Co. Donegal, has been abolished; if as a consequence Mr. Grant is now unemployed after giving 25 years' service, with unblemished character during that period; if the Minister will state on what grounds Mr. Grant's appointment was terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Post and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Post and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Post and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. Owing to the curtailment of the services on the Lough Swilly Railway it was found necessary to rearrange the local postal services, and this involved the abolition of a part-time post and the termination of the services of Mr. Grant who, however, was offered but declined similar employment at a neighbouring office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that the mails to Clonmany are at present being carried by 'bus daily?  Further is he aware that this man Grant was in the employment of the Post Office for 25 years and that the alternative employment offered to him was a job at Drumfreece at 14s. 5d. per week while the man who held the job formerly was getting 24s. 5d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the exact details in connection with the alteration in the mail service that took place.  I know in a general way that there has been an alteration on account of the curtailment of the services on the Lough Swilly Railway. Mr. Grant had not 25 years' service. He had 20 years' service in the Post Office.  It was found necessary either to terminate his service or the service of his brother who had almost equal service.  It was decided to retain his brother in the service.  The post offered to Mr. Grant was the best we could offer him in the circumstances. We realise that it was not convenient to him, but we had no other post to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="557" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain why it is that there were other men who had not the same length of service in that particular district or who had not the same unblemished character as Mr. Grant retained while Mr. Grant was dismissed? Further, can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what form the compensation, already mentioned in the correspondence, to Mr. Grant is likely to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Grant was not dismissed.  His services were dispensed with owing to redundancy at the time. I have no information whether Post Office servants with lesser service were retained, except in the case of a brother of Mr. Grant's.  As to the question of unblemished service, I am not prepared to state what class of service Mr. Grant had.  I regard that as a confidential matter.  I may add that Mr. Grant was an applicant for retirement under the Treaty.  That is the compensation question that is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that Mr. Grant will have a claim for compensation in some form; and, if so, does the Parliamentary Secretary think that Mr. Grant should be dismissed after twenty years, like a cast-off glove, he having eight children to support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Grant thinks he has a claim for compensation because he is an applicant for retirement under the Treaty.  It is not for me to say whether or not he has a claim for compensation. I have said that he has not been dismissed.  The terms of his appointment were such that he was not entitled to permanent employment, and the exigencies of the service made it necessary to dispense with his services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that if he presents a claim to the proper source, it will receive consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Grant's name has already been listed to go before the Tribunal dealing with claims under Article 10.  I have nothing whatever to do with that Tribunal.  He is not entitled to any form of compensation from the Post Office, apart from the possibility of having a claim in that <Col N="558" /> respect.  Mr. Grant's claim for further employment will be considered favourably in the event of a suitable opportunity arising, providing he does not get out under Article 10.</P>

For instance, the office of Master of the Rolls, Lord Chief Baron and various other offices of that kind, have been abolished.  It <Col N="562" /> is proposed by this Bill that, where the power of appointment of trustees was vested in the holder of an office, which office has now become extinct, that appointment should now be made by the High Court.  Similarly, where the appointment of new trustees was vested in the holder of a particular office, which office has now been abolished, the High Court, under the terms of Section 4, can either appoint a new trustee itself or can nominate the holder of some office to appoint a new trustee, the reason for that being that it would save numerous applications to court.  Of the charities affected, several are comparatively small.  In cases where it is necessary to get the consent of the holder of an office, which office is now abolished, to exercise powers of sale and leasing and the like, authority is given to the High Court to appoint trustees with these powers.</P>

      <P>The principle of this Bill seems to be a reasonable one in so far as it is an enabling measure giving certain powers, which originally were exercised by certain officers, mostly judges in reference to certain charitable bodies.  I rather expected that the Minister, when introducing this Bill, which I assume he is more or less adopting now that it has come from the Seanad, would have given the House, upon such a technical measure, an idea of the number of charitable bodies which were involved and how much it is likely to amount to. Some of the charitable trusts, I understand, are of very considerable size and some of them are very small.  I do not know whether the Minister has read the debate in the other House. Certain objections were raised there with reference to Sections 4 and 5. It was admitted it was a proper thing that the High Court should have power to appoint trustees, but objection was taken to the High Court having power to delegate that power to appoint trustees.  It seems to be against a very fundamental principle of law that a delegate should have power further to delegate his power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in a case where a judge appoints a trustee, he exercises his <Col N="563" /> judicial powers.  He has to examine certain documents, such as an affidavit of fitness, and, altogether, the exercise of the power of appointing a trustee must be regarded as a judicial function. I do not know whether the Minister has examined how far that impinges upon an Article of the Constitution which requires that only a judge can exercise judicial functions.  This is a matter of considerable importance, from the point of view of principle.  It is really a compromise on the principle that the High Court would never have power to appoint someone in a judicial capacity.  I do not say any judge of record, because that is too inclusive, but someone who has a judicial capacity.  The Minister mentioned that it was because offices like those of the Master of the Rolls and the Lord Chief Baron had been abolished that these trustees had lapsed.  It might be well to put in the names of those judges&mdash; Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court judges&mdash;who could be appointed to carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine that question closely before we come to the Committee Stage.  We should have an idea of the number of bodies affected by this measure, and, if possible, we should have a list of the names of those bodies.  This House consists of persons who cannot be expected to know much about a matter like this, which is extremely technical. The whole Trustee Act of 1893 is an extremely technical Act.  Therefore, the Minister should put the House in the position of having as much information as possible.  When he is dealing with this matter he ought to amend the list of securities that are regarded as trustee securities.  It is a very antediluvian document.  There are numbers of securities mentioned as trustee securities which no sane trustee would ever invest in at the present moment.  On the other hand, there are other securities which might be included as being proper for the purposes of investment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little's questions seem to be quite reasonable.  He wants to know the area and the size of the problem which is involved; <Col N="564" /> whether this is a big matter or a small one.  I am sure the Minister will be able to give us all the information we require, and the House will be glad to get plenty of information.  The Minister speaks of this Bill as dealing with offices which have already been abolished.  I do not know whether there are any other offices which have not yet been abolished, but which may possibly, later on, come within the ambit of this measure.  We would like to know whether the Minister is now taking anticipatory powers in relation to subsequent abolition of offices, or is he merely confining this measure to offices which up to now have been abolished.</P>

      <P>As far as Deputy Little's point is concerned about trustee securities and the revision of the list of trustee securities, I agree with him that it is a matter to be inquired into.  A certain revision is, no doubt, necessary.  However, that does not quite arise under this Bill.  That is a matter that is under consideration at the present moment.</P>

      <P>As to the question of the particular charities involved, I would not be able to get the particulars of the cases.  It would involve visiting the various offices to investigate the documents they hold.  It is sufficient that there is a large number of charities.  If a Bill of this nature did not become law, it would be necessary for each charity when its trustees had ceased to be and when no new trustees could be appointed to have a provision of this kind made or they could not sell or lease their property.  In that case, it would be necessary for each of them to go forward and promote a Private Bill.  That, of course, would be ruinous to a charity and even if there are only one or two charities it would not be fair to them.  When we are abolishing offices, as they have been abolished, it would be very unfair to the charities if they had to suffer any pecuniary loss by reason of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> Deputy Little asked if I had read the debates of the other House.  I have.  It appears to me that the answer to the argument of the Senator who brought in an amendment to Section 4 was very conclusive.  Deputy Little says that the appointment of trustees is a judicial act and that the judge should not delegate it.  Surely the Deputy is not putting up the case that all new trustees are appointed by the court?  They are appointed under new deeds and the power of appointing trustees is vested in some individual.  I am sure the Deputy himself has drafted many deeds where the power is given to appoint new trustees.  The court under Section 4 of this Bill has certain powers.  If the court thinks that the holder of some office would be the most appropriate person to appoint a new trustee, the court can delegate the powers.  That person would have no more power to appoint new trustees than, say, a person in an ordinary deed of settlement would have.  To go into court to appoint new trustees is not normal. It is abnormal.  The normal way is by the power for the appointment of trustees contained in the settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in order in developing this?  I want to point out that there is a very big difference in dealing with new trustees and giving those trustees powers to appoint other trustees.  Then there is a matter of property being taken over by the courts and dealt with.  Then it becomes a judicial matter, whereas it is an ordinary, private matter in these individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Dolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Railway Fires (Amendment) Bill be read a Second Time.  As compared with the Principal Act, this Bill proposes to give improved conditions to the owner of land whose property has been damaged.  It proposes to increase the amount that may be claimed from £100 to £200, and it is not necessary to prove negligence on the part of the railway companies.  It also makes another minor change.  It gives additional time for the preparation of a claim; it increases the time from fourteen to twenty-one days during which the detailed claim may be served on the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill was circulated, I have had time to look up only the Principal Act.  I am not clear as to the purpose why there should be any limit to the amount that may be claimed from a railway company as to the damage done by fires or sparks from the locomotives.  Presumably, there was some reason for the limit in the Principal Act.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain it. The Parliamentary Secretary stated that one of the purposes was to remove the necessity for proving negligence. What section of this Bill is designed to that effect, to the proving of negligence against the railway company? Was it necessary under the Principal Act to prove negligence, and if so which section of this Bill removes that obligation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Principal Act, the claim can be made up to £100 without proof of negligence.  If the owner of land can prove negligence against the railway company he can claim up to any amount of damage.  There is no limit to the amount of damage that can be claimed.  The ordinary claim for damage could be made under the Principal Act of 1905, and it could be made up to £100.  Having examined the position as it is to-day, the Department <Col N="567" /> of Agriculture have come to the conclusion that, particularly, in view of the re-afforestation that has taken place, and the fact that a large number of plantations have been planted along the railway lines, this figure of £100 should be increased.  So we are giving more favourable conditions now to the owners of land.  A claim can be made now for £200 without proving negligence, but the same condition that is in the Principal Act, the same terms are continued that you can claim for any amount if negligence is proved.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where the person holding a <Col N="568" /> particular office in or under a local authority is by law a member of any other body by virtue of his holding such office, such person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a member of such body nominated by such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the Dean's Grange Burial Board, which is a body set up under a provisional order, and the Chairman of the Borough Council of Dun Laoghaire and the Chairman of the Board of Health, Co. Dublin, are ex officio members of that body.

The Chairman of the Borough Council is nominated an ex officio member of the Board.  In the same way there are members of the county boards of health nominated members of the Board.

Let us take a county council, and let us take it that there is a vocational education committee in that county which is not a joint body.  In that case Section (a) (1) gives us power to remove a vocational education committee or alternatively (a) (2) gives us power to set up such number of persons as it is found necessary to act as a vocational committee. If, however, the vocational education committee is a joint body, if say as well as the county council in Clare the urban district council of Ennis is represented on it, then it comes in under Section (b).  Section (b) gives power to replace, if necessary, the nominees of the dissolved body on that vocational education committee and to replace them in any way, whether by the appointment <Col N="572" /> of the commissioner dealing with the county or the reappointment of the people who are already on the committee from the county council, or in any other way that it is desired to settle the representation on the joint vocational education committee.

Let us say that E, F, G and H are four members who are members of the urban district council, or who are representing the urban district council.  Let us take it that the county council is dissolved, and that Commissioner X is put in charge of it. Under sub-section (b) the Minister is authorised in his order to give power to A, B, C and D to continue to act on the joint committee, or to appoint one, two or three, or any number of other persons to act in their place, or to appoint Commissioner X to act without disturbing the representation of the urban council on the committee.</P>

      <P>Does that mean that the Minister seeks power, rather than the removal of doubts, to have the committees of suppressed bodies dissolved until such persons as he himself considers suitable to act are appointed?  The Minister suggests that where A, B, C and D are representatives of a dissolved county council on a vocational education committee he can continue that representation, but if he does not like the kind of collars they wear or the shape of their ears he can exclude them from further activity on that committee.</P>

      <P>In fact, that is all the amendment suggests.  If the Minister thinks that he can dissolve a subsidiary body of a local authority, the upkeep of which is met out of the rates struck by that local authority, I think he is going to have more doubts, because any local authority that has any knowledge of principle would cease to strike rates for the upkeep of such subsidiary bodies which would be taken out of their hands by the Minister's order.  The Minister will have more doubts.</P>

I want to know has he had representations made to him to permit the raising of a loan for the amount in question to be paid back over a number of years, so that the rates will not suffer by the extra imposition in a particular year; or if he has not had representations made to him, is he prepared to meet that situation by permitting the bodies concerned to raise the amount by way of loan to be repaid over a certain number of years, rather than the full amount out of one year's rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That question of loan has been provided for.  In reply to what the Deputy says about doing things at the beginning, and that the Minister made an order for a reduction of these salaries, the House will pardon me if I deal with that, because <Col N="576" /> it is a point that we had better deal with so that Deputies will know something about the facts, as it has been raised here again following some points made by Deputy Davin last night.  In 1920 the General Committee of the Irish Asylums Conference met three representatives from each of the Asylum Committees in the country and the representatives of the Irish Asylums Workers' Union.  There had been no joint action previous to that on the part of the committees in connection with wages.  The matter was considered and a certain scale of salaries was decided upon, and certain action took place increasing the salaries of the asylum attendants and nurses throughout the country generally.</P>
      <P>In November, 1923, when the Estimates for the year 1924-25 were about to be considered, the Minister for Local Government drew the attention of local authorities generally to the urgent necessity for a reduction in rates and a searching examination into current expenditure.  Following that, most of the mental hospital committees considered their position with regard to wages, and in a large number of cases reductions were made.  In fact, the only areas in the country in which a resolution was not passed in connection with a reduction in the wages of nurses and attendants was in Kerry and Sligo.  Reductions actually took place in Donegal in 1924; in Westmeath, I think, in 1925; and elsewhere, with the exception of Sligo and Kerry, in 1926.  The position in 1926, as far as Grangegorman was concerned, was something like this: The number of nurses and attendants had gone up between 1914 and 1925 from 331 to 454, an increase of 123, or 35 per cent.  The total annual amount spent in wages of nurses and attendants had gone up from £21,538 in 1913-14 to £76,913 in 1923-24, or an increase of £55,375, or 258 per cent.  The wages had risen until they were at a point 3½ times larger than they were in 1913-14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will make his case correctly.  Will he give us the number of inmates in 1914 <Col N="577" /> and in 1926; the cost of upkeep for inmates in 1914 and 1926?  Then we will get a fair picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving a certain picture.  There may be certain details that require to be filled in.  I have not at present the figures for which the Deputy asks, but they are available.  They can be put as facts with the facts as given here in reply to the point raised by the Deputy.  As I say, these were the circumstances in 1926, when a proposal came to the Ministry to appoint an additional seven attendants.  In July, 1925, in connection with the question of the appointment of seven additional attendants a letter was sent by the Minister to the Grangegorman Mental Hospitals Committee pointing out that in 1919 the hours of duty for nurses and attendants were reduced from 72½ per week to 56 per week; that the period of time that had elapsed was such that an examination might be made into the question of the hours of duty before appointing any additional members to the staff.  The letter was considered by the Committee who referred the matter to a sub-committee, who in October, 1925, put up a proposal, after having consulted the staff with regard to the question of hours, that the wages should be reduced.  On November 18th the Joint Committee as a whole approved of the report of the sub-committee, and on the 18th December a letter was received from the office of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  The letter was addressed to the Secretary of the Ministry of Local Government and was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the Ministry is doubtless aware, a Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital have passed a proposal to enforce reductions varying from ten per cent. to fifty per cent. in the wages of the staff employed in the institution. This proposal has been very seriously considered by the staff, and they strongly contended that in view of all the facts there is no justification for any reduction in their rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> As the reductions proposal must receive the sanction of your Ministry before it can be put into operation, the staff are very anxious that their views and evidence on the matter be heard by the Ministry, and they ask that a deputation be received to state their case.  We notified the Grangegorman Joint Committee of our intention of appealing to the Local Government Minister and at a meeting of the Joint Committee held on the 16th instant the following resolution was passed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee have no objection to the Transport Union or any other Union placing their views before the Minister for Local Government, prior to his consideration of the proposed reductions in wages of the staff.  If the Minister desires that the Joint Committee should be represented at such conference Mrs. Markey and Messrs. Sheil, Pim and Hernon with the Chairman and Deputy Chairman are authorised to attend same.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of this resolution we would earnestly request the Minister for Local Government to receive a deputation representative of the staff and hear their views.  We should be glad to learn in due course when such a deputation can be received.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That deputation was received and the proposed reduction was discussed with the members of the three unions and representatives of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee in the Minister's office.  On the 1st January, the following letter was written to the Vice-President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the General Secretary of the Irish Mental Hospitals Workers' Union and to the General President of the Workers' Union for Ireland and the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to the conference which took place yesterday (31st <Col N="579" /> December) on the questions at issue between the Grangegorman Joint Committee and their staff of attendants and nurses regarding the proposed revision of wages, I have to notify you formally of the decisions which were taken, viz.: The representatives of the Joint Committee and the staff agreed to submit for the consideration of the bodies they represent the following modifications of the proposals set out in report No. 50 of the 28th October, 1925 (Joint Committee's Minutes of Proceedings).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposals were that instead of certain reductions coming into force on the 1st of October&mdash;I find I have not the actual date&mdash;reductions to the extent of approximately 10 per cent. would come into operation, the first half as from the 1st of April, 1926, and the other half as from the 1st of October, 1926.  In reply, letters were received from the three unions.  The Workers' Union of Ireland, writing on the 6th of January, say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To the Chairman and Gentlemen, Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee, Portrane: On behalf of the members of the Branch I accept the terms laid down by the Committee and Minister for Local Government at the Conference held on the 30th December, 1925.  Thanking you for your patience, etc., on behalf of my branch.&mdash;John Ryan, Branch Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union wrote to E.P. McCarron, Ministry of Local Government and Public Health:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your letter of the 1st inst. embodying the terms arising out of the conference which took place in your office on the 31st ult. have been duly submitted to the staffs in Grangegorman and Portrane, who have decided, on our advice, to carry on under these modified proposals which we take it will now be confirmed.  We are forwarding a copy of this communication to the Chief Clerk, Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  An <Col N="580" /> acknowledgment will oblige.&mdash;George Spain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the Irish Mental Hospital Workers' Union there was the following letter to the Chief Clerk of the Mental Hospital, Grangegorman:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposals regarding wages made at the recent conference at the Local Government Department offices were considered by our members in Grangegorman and Portrane, and I am directed to state that, while protesting against the Committee breaking the Joint Conference wages agreement, it was decided to accept the proposals.&mdash;Yours truly, M.J. O'Connor, General Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to the proposals made for reduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the Irish Women Workers' Union was represented at that conference and if not, why not?  Is it not a fact that at that time they represented a considerable number of women attendants in the Asylum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they did.  The position as far as that Union was concerned was this: the Irish Women Workers' Union did not appear upon this particular scene and did not appear for more than twelve months afterwards, as a matter of fact&mdash;somewhere about June, July or August, 1927.  It was then that that Union and another Union, called the Mental Hospitals Workers' Protection Association, came on the scene.  I do not want to go into the general development of the court position with regard to this case because I do not think it would be profitable or that anything would come from it, but that body of which the Deputy speaks did not appear on the scene until 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister admit that the Women Workers' Union at the time of that Conference did actually represent a considerable number of the women attendants in Grangegorman and other places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot admit anything about that, but I think we must infer this, that they cannot have asked to be present and that they made <Col N="581" /> no representations in the matter. Reductions in wages were accepted and came into operation in April, 1926, and in October, 1926, and then nothing was heard until a certain decision was given in the courts.  The question was then re-opened in 1927, and the Union the Deputy speaks about came on the scene.  Deputy Briscoe looked for some figures, making a comparison as to the return that is got for the money.  He raised the question of the number of patients there so that when we compare one year with another, in the matter of cost we might compare one year with another in the matter of patients.  The figures with regard to patients are available.  But so far as wages are concerned.  I think the reductions were considered in Grangegorman.  The position with regard to wages was that the scale of pay for men attendants was in 1914, £22 by £1 to £37; in 1925, £60 by £6 to £90.  This as the maximum pay had been increased from £37 to £90 and there was in addition an increase in respect of long service.  That is where a man had 10 years' service he had £12 a year additional; 15 years £22 and 20 years £32.  There was increase in the extra charges for charge attendant of another £5 and for deputy charge attendant of £5 10s. In the case of female attendant nurses the scale had increased from £15 by 14s. to £25 10s. to £42 by £6 to £72, with the additional sum for long service of £12 for ten years, £22 for 15 years and £32 for 20 years, and there was an additional increase in respect of charge nurses and nursing certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to what the Deputy says about the Minister ordering reductions in pay or something like that, my personal position is that I have no desire in any way to force a hard bargain with any section of workers or to induce mental hospital committees to do so.  I have seen some of the work of these institutions, and if there is any doubt on one side or the other, as to whether the pay is big or small, I would be inclined to give the benefit of it to people like nurses and attendants in these institutions, but what the Department has not done and should not do in this particular <Col N="582" /> matter is to shut its eyes to the rapidly and greatly increasing cost of some sections of local government administration.  I hope that when the facts in connection with these negotiations are put before Deputies concerned with the administration of Grangegorman Mental Hospital they will be news to them.  If they are not news to them I cannot understand their attitude in making the charges against the Department of ordering a reduction in those salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister, because it will give us an opportunity of comparing it with other statements, and will enable us to satisfy ourselves in regard to the past and to arrange our conduct in the future.  I do not know whether the Minister wants to give figures merely for the purpose of making a statement, but he says that one of the things which confronted the Ministry in 1924 was the cost of maintenance, and that it had risen from £21,000 in 1914 to £76,000 in 1925.  The Minister should say that hand in hand with that there were so many patients per attendant, that the attendants worked so many hours; and he should also say whether he considered a working period of 76 hours per week was too much or too <Col N="583" /> little.  When he considers the question of wages paid to attendants he should also consider the cost of living in 1914 as compared with 1925-26.  The Minister knows that there was a considerable increase in the population of these institutions, so far as inmates were concerned, particularly during the War years, especially as regards a particularly dangerous type of lunatic who required more attention than an ordinary patient.  I have looked into these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what the number of patients was in 1914 and what it was in 1922-23?  The Minister says that it is his duty to see that efficient administration is carried out, not only in regard to the attention paid to the inmates, but also to see that there is no extravagance on the part of the Committee.  If the Minister were really anxious to hold a watching brief for the ratepayers he would try and help the Committee to recover from another Department of State arrears of the capitation grant which they have been claiming for a considerable number of years, and which now amounts to thousands of pounds. The reduction of the capitation grant meant an extra imposition on the shoulders of the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>We all can talk of war. I suppose the Minister can declare war but no one must fight except himself. Will the Minister now say that there was extravagance in connection with the number of attendants who were maintained out of the public purse in order to attend to inmates in these institutions? Will he say that they were overpaid to a great extent, or that their salaries were commensurate with their services, and that the number of attendants was not over and above the number required?  The Minister knows that the Committee recently asked him to sanction a small increase in the salary of the dentist who attends the hospital, but he turned it down.  If, on one hand, he says he is out to see that a proper return is given in the shape of salaries paid to attendants, and that he is not going to reduce them below what they are justly entitled to, how, on the other hand, can he put that on a par with his refusal to pay a dentist more than £100 a year for attending to the teeth of 4,000 patients?  When the Committee suggested that that dentist should be given an increase of £100 a year, in two instalments of £50 each, the Minister turns it down, and then comes here and says:&mdash;&ldquo;I am not going to stand for the underpayment of attendants or nurses, but I will not give a slight increase in salary to a dentist who has to look after the teeth of almost 4,000 people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On Section 6, I do not know if a point was raised with the Minister when a deputation waited upon him, but I heard it discussed, and I think it was the intention to raise it. However, of that I am not certain.  The point is with regard to the legal costs that were incurred arising out of the legal actions that were taken.  The Dublin Corporation was not in any way responsible for the actions.  The Dublin Corporation, except in so far as it was represented by Commissioners on the Grangegorman Board, was not responsible for whatever costs arose out of these legal actions.  It is not the declared opinion of the Corporation, but I know it is the opinion of a great number of members of the Corporation, that the Corporation and the ratepayers of Dublin should not be held liable for the addition to the rates due to the cost of these several legal actions.  I think there was an intention at some time to put it up to the Minister that the Minister, to a greater extent than the Dublin Corporation, at any rate, to put it mildly, being responsible for the legal costs in these actions, ought to pay and ought to indemnify the Corporation against the sum such as it was, and not charge it to the rates.  I would like to know if the question was at any time put to the Minister, and if it was not put to the Minister, if he would take it from me now and give an answer as to whether there is any likelihood of the Ministry bearing the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to divide the House on the question now before us, but I would like to know from the Minister before he gets final authority to pay out this amount at the expense of the ratepayers whether he merely intends to let things go on as they have been going on for the past three or four years in connection with this railway, and that the intervention of the Ministry during the period of the payment of the subsidy, when they do intervene, will be merely for the purpose of seeing that the agreement under which the sum will be paid for the next few years will be carried out by the company.  I want to know whether he can foresee what is likely to happen at the end of the subsidy period, whether he has any reason to believe that there is a likelihood of <Col N="589" /> the same position being created at the end of the subsidy period as was created two or three months ago when the line was partially closed down.  I understand that the agreement under which the amount is being paid is that the passenger-carrying services of the Lough Swilly Railway Company in future will be confined altogether to the roads, in other words, that any passengers carried by the company will be carried on buses now being run by that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know whether the Minister has any information to the effect that a decision was recently taken, and whether if so he was a party to the decision that passenger trains should be run periodically?  If such a decision has been come to, I think, it is contrary to the spirit and perhaps to the letter of the agreement recently signed on behalf of the Ministry and also on behalf of the Six County Government.  I want to know whether the Minister believes that as a matter of policy, he has no responsibility for the maintenance of a proper and efficient transport system in this county.  At the end of the two year period during which the taxpayers will be providing this money is the Minister going to allow any private transport company, whether by road or otherwise, to make whatever arrangements it likes, or is he going to face the period when there will be no proper transport system in the county either for passengers or goods? I believe that during the remainder of the subsidy period the Minister, having responsibility for the maintenance of an efficient transport system in the county as well as in the country, should set up some committee or commission to report to him at the earliest possible date as to the best method of maintaining a transport system in that county.  The county is situated in a peculiar way, as it is between Northern Ireland and the Free State.  I think the House and the country, and particularly the taxpayers who are called upon to find this money, are entitled to know from the Minister whether he is going to allow the same position to be created at the end of the subsidy period as was created two or three <Col N="590" /> months ago.  That is the only question I wish to ask in connection with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no breach of any obligation entered into with this company that they should run passenger trains.  What the company asked was that they should be relieved of the necessity of running certain passenger trains.  That is what we are taking steps to do.  That does not mean that they are forbidden to run passenger trains.  I hope they will find it profitable and remunerative to run passenger trains, but I hope they will not attempt to run these unless they are remunerative.  As to what is going to happen in that area afterwards is a matter that will have to be watched during the year that we are in.  We have no doubt whatever that a transport service of a type sufficient to meet what the county is likely to be able to pay for will always be maintained. The thing that I have to watch particularly is that the taxpayer is not going to have to pay what in fact will meet this situation&mdash;that he will be paying the wages of railwaymen to enable them to keep in occupation where the traffic does not entitle them to any such railway occupation.  A service of road transport of a type can at any rate be relied on to provide most of the transport that the county wants.</P>

      <P>It is so long since the matter was discussed, perhaps it would be no harm if I restated the case for the amendment.  In my opinion this is the most important amendment to the Bill.  The provision in the Bill is that a tenant must have forty years' continuous occupation of a tenement in order to become entitled to fixity of tenure.  The amendment is designed <Col N="594" /> to reduce that period of forty years to five years.  It is not the purpose of the amendment to provide that a person who has five years' occupation should be protected for all time against ejectment. Its aim is to ensure that a tenant who has been in occupation for five years cannot be ejected without cause. Under any circumstances a tenant who fails to pay the rent, breaks any condition in the contract of the tenancy, or against whom the landlord can advance good and sufficient cause, can be ejected.  Similarly a tenant can be denied renewal of a tenancy if the landlord requires possession for rebuilding or reconstruction, for the purpose of carrying out a scheme for developing the property, or for any reason consistent with good estate management. It is quite obvious, therefore, that the interest of the landlord is sufficiently protected by the Bill to make it unnecessary to add this additional safeguard that the tenant must have been forty years in occupation in order to become entitled to security of tenure. It is apparently the view of the Minister for Justice that a person who has been in occupation of a dwelling for thirty years, who has during all that period been a good tenant, who has regularly paid the rent, who has kept all the conditions of his contract, and who has given no reason whatever which would justify the landlord in seeking his ejectment should, nevertheless, be liable to ejectment without cause at the whim of the landlord, irrespective of what hardship that ejectment might cause the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to understand why there should be any limit in time at all in this part of the Bill.  I think common justice would suggest that where a landlord accepts a tenant, that tenant should be allowed to remain in possession of the dwelling, so long as the conditions of the contract are being observed, so long as the rent has been paid, and, in the words of the Bill, no good or sufficient reasons are given for the termination of the tenancy, unless, as is provided in Section 20, the landlord requires to resume possession for any of the reasons there stated.  It may be contended that a reduction of this period of time <Col N="595" /> would constitute a hardship for landlords. It is very difficult to see how it could.  The landlord is only bound by it so long as the tenant is paying him the rent which he has asked for the dwelling, and is keeping the conditions which he imposed in the contract.  At any time, when the yearly or other tenancy expires, the landlord can increase the rent if he is satisfied that such increase is justified in all the circumstances of the case, including competition for dwellings in the neighbourhood. In other words, the landlord has secured for that dwelling a tenant who will regularly pay the highest rent he can expect to get in the open market.  He cannot be said, therefore, to suffer any hardship. Nevertheless, it is apparently the contention of the Government that the landlord should, in addition, have power, for no reason whatever, to eject that tenant, even though he has been there the greater part of his life &mdash;thirty or thirty-five years.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will argue that this term of forty years was suggested by the Town Tenants Commission. It is undoubtedly true that the Town Tenants Commission suggested a period of forty years in this case, but the Commission also suggested a number of other things.  It is not fair for the Minister for Justice to pick out a recommendation of that kind here and there, put them into the Bill, and, at the same time, reject other recommendations that relate to them.  The Town Tenants Commission also recommended the enactment of legislation which would enable occupying tenants to go to court to get a fair rent fixed. If the Minister had accepted that recommendation this particular section of the Bill would not be nearly as important as it is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation of the Town Tenants Commission contained in paragraphs 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 dealing with excessive rents of occupying tenants.  If the Minister had accepted these recommendations, and <Col N="596" /> if he had made provision in this Bill by which occupying tenants could go to court to get a fair rent fixed, if they believed that they were paying exorbitant rents, the period of time mentioned in this part of the Bill would not be so important.  It is because the Minister has rejected these recommendations that the period of forty years for which a tenant must have been in occupation before he can get a fair rent, becomes wholly unacceptable. It is difficult to foresee what case the Minister can make for the proposal in the Bill.  Its only aim can be to enable the landlord to evict good tenants without cause, or else to make it possible for the landlord to extract from the tenants exorbitant rents, the highest rent he could possibly hope to obtain under Section 27 of the Bill. That is the only reason why that term should be there.  If it is the aim of the Minister to do justice in this case, to deal equitably with both landlord and tenant, I would suggest that not even a period of five years should be mentioned.  No period should be mentioned. If the tenant observes all the conditions specified under Sections 19 and 20, pays the rent fixed, in default of agreement by the court, on the basis of free competition and vacant possession, he should be allowed to remain in possession.  That is the argument I am advancing.  I hope the House will see the justice of it, and will not tolerate for one moment the fantastic proposal which the Minister is making.  The section with which we are dealing is the most important part of the Bill and, if it goes through in its present form, whatever little advantage the Bill confers on town tenants will be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support an amendment, but not the one moved by Deputy Lemass.  There are three different amendments incorporating different periods of time.  I think Deputy Lemass in his amendment suggests five years, another suggests ten years, and another twenty years.  It has always been the fundamental claim of town tenants that they should enjoy two things, fair rent and fixity of tenure.  That has been the claim <Col N="597" /> that town tenants have made in all the agitation that has been carried on for the introduction of this Bill.  The amendment moved by Deputy Lemass seems to go too far.  He wants to give ordinary people residing in houses certain privileges that we, on behalf of business tenants, have never sought.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass must be aware that there is a fundamental difference between a business tenant and a tenant living in an ordinary house.  In the case of a business tenant, fifty per cent. and probably more of the increased value of the premises is due to the invested capital of the tenant and due to his energy and enterprise. In the case of the ordinary tenant who lives in a house and pays his rental he enjoys undisturbed possession, but he does nothing whatever good, bad or indifferent, to add to the value of that particular house.  It cannot be contended in this House on an equitable basis that the ordinary tenant residing in a residential dwelling can possibly be put on the same basis as the man who has built up a business and good-will in an ordinary business house.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with the principle underlying the amendment moved by Deputy Lemass.  I ask the Minister to consider favourably the reduction of the figure of 40 years, which is the period stated in the original section of the Bill.  A period of 40 years before a tenant in occupation enjoys any privileges under this Bill seems, to my mind, a most inequitable period of time.  I suggest that the Minister could go some distance to give the ordinary residential tenant at least equity and fair play under this section of the Bill.  Take the tenant who has been in occupation of a house for 25 years.  Surely that tenant is entitled to enjoy a fair rent and enjoy fixity of tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across a case only a fortnight ago where the tenant had been in occupation of a certain holding for a period of 29 years.  It came to the ears of the landlord that he had living with him his married daughter, her husband and one child.  The landlord immediately endeavoured to eject the <Col N="598" /> tenant.  He served a notice to quit upon that tenant who had been in occupation of the house for 29 years. Will anybody in this Assembly pretend for a moment that a tenant in occupation of a residence for 29 years is not what anybody would call a good tenant?</P>
    <P>Surely there is a difference between a good tenant and a bad tenant.  A landlord gets in bad tenants, and I know that landlords suffer great financial hardship from bad tenants.  Bad tenants come and go like the waves of the sea.  All they want is to get possession of the landlord's house, and they endeavour to stick him for as much rent as possible.  Such a tenant is in a very different category to a tenant in occupation of an ordinary house for 25 years or 29 years.  When a tenant is in occupation of a house for a quarter of a century, and has paid his rent regularly and given his landlord no trouble, that tenant is entitled to some consideration.  To fix the period of 40 years, as is fixed in this Bill, does not, in my opinion, give the tenant the consideration to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>[<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I totally disagree with the amendment moved by Deputy Lemass, but I would suggest to the Minister that he would come some way to meet us and fix a period of a quarter of a century occupation, so that the tenant in occupation for 25 years should be entitled to enjoy fixity of tenure and a fair rent.  That would be an equitable provision that would work no injustice either to the landlord on the one side or to the tenant on the other side.  It will be quite evident that in asking the Minister to give the tenant who is 25 years in occupation the right to enjoy a lease under this Bill, we are not asking for anything unreasonable or anything that is unjust.  If anybody who has read the Bill considers the terms upon which that fixity of tenure and upon which the fair rent can be granted, he must come to the conclusion that no injustice can possibly be done to either side by making the period 25 years.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister in considering <Col N="599" /> this section the court has full and ample powers (1) to fix the annual rent that would be payable by the tenant if he obtains this new lease; (2) the court has also powers to order the expenditure of certain capital sums of money either by way of permanent improvement or otherwise, and (3) the court has power, and most important power, to increase, if necessary, the annual rental payable under the new lease that the tenant would secure.  Is there anything unreasonable in that? Will any man, any owner of property, contend that a tenant 25 years in occupation of a house who has been a good tenant and who has given his landlord no trouble, a man who has performed all his obligations as a tenant during 25 years' tenancy, contend that it is unreasonable for that tenant to come here and say: &ldquo;I have now been 25 years in occupation of this house, and I am entitled to fixity of tenure and to a fair rent&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In the case of the tenant that I quoted to the House a few minutes ago, who had been 29 years in occupation, I might inform the House that that tenant had still got his week's rent paid in advance after all that time.  There must be a limit to the rights of property.  We hear a great deal about the rights of property, but we never hear a word about the duties of property.  There is a famous dictum that property has its duties as well as its rights.  I say here that hitherto the rights of the landlord have been sacrosanct, and the rights of the tenant non-existent.  Under this section of the Bill we ask the Minister to come some way to meet us.  I suggest that it is only equitable and right that the tenant who has been 25 years in occupation is entitled to enjoy that fixity of tenure, and entitled to enjoy a fair rent.</P>
    <P>We do not suggest that the landlord is not entitled to a reasonable return on his capital.  No man will deny that when capital is invested there should be a reasonable return.  But the investments of the landlords hitherto have been much more like the investments of the Jews, demanding their pound of flesh without any <Col N="600" /> regard to humanity, or the ordinary rights of the citizen.  Let us assume for a moment that this tenant who is 29 years in occupation of the house has paid his rent for all those years. How many times over has the landlord been paid the capital sum for which he purchased that house?  Yet, that tenant does not own a slate or a brick in that house.  And then the landlord can come forward and say &ldquo;because your married daughter is living here with her husband as part and parcel of your family, I will serve notice on you, ejecting you on the street.&rdquo; There must be a limit to the rights of property, and some recognition of the rights of tenants.  Under the existing law, the rights of the landlord are observed, and fully developed, but the rights of the tenants are non-existent. When a tenant has been in occupation for a period of a quarter of a century, the landlord should be very anxious not to eject him, but to retain him.  Nobody will suggest that such a tenant is not a good tenant. It is a common cry of the owners of property: &ldquo;We are anxious to encourage good tenants.&rdquo;  If that cry be true, if they be sincere in making that statement, it is up to this House to say that some rights be given to the tenant under this Bill, and that a tenant who has been in occupation for an unbroken period of a quarter of a century should expect equitable and fair treatment.</P>
    <P>To offer a tenant no rights in an ordinary house for an unbroken period of forty years seems to be a most inequitable proceeding.  Deputy Lemass's amendment is quite impossible.  There is no Deputy here who would, for one moment, agree that a tenant five years in occupation is entitled to get a vested right from the landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Byrne does not understand the section at all. He is assuming that it is to apply to the one tenant in occupation.  It really refers to the tenant or his predecessors in title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If it applies to the tenant or his predecessors in title, that only makes the case worse.  If the <Col N="601" /> tenant, or his predecessors in title, are in occupation only for five years, does not that make the amendment more inequitable still?  When arguing the rights of town tenants in this country I have found a great number of the tenants themselves unreasonable.  I have always found that that unreasonableness acts as a great bar to the tenants obtaining their legitimate rights.  I do not think that Deputy Lemass was well advised when he was encouraged to put down this amendment. I do not think that any Minister who is anxious to hold the balance evenly between the conflicting rights of landlord and tenant could possibly accept the Deputy's amendment.  I hope the Minister will favourable consider reducing the period of forty years to a period of twenty-five years.  I suggest there is nothing unreasonable in that.  The tenant, under the terms of the Bill, can only get a lease upon what the court decides are fair terms. The tenant will only get fixity of tenure on fair terms and at a fair rent. When I use the term fair rent I use it equally in the interests of the tenant and the landlord.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to reduce the period of years to twenty-five.</P>

      <P>As regards fixity of tenure, I am, perhaps, to a great extent, in substantial agreement with Deputy Byrne.  I will ask Deputy Byrne to bear in mind that his suggestion, if adopted by the Minister, would require a good deal of qualification, or great injury and injustice would be done to people who own only one house.  The Deputy may make all the gestures he wishes, but his suggestion might end in the way I have indicated. The owner of the single house, if he happens to be a poor person, is politically contemptible and politically negligible and very few will cater for him in this House.  There are Deputies here who ought to have some sense of justice.  I am sure they will have a sufficient sense of justice, no matter on what benches they sit, not to confiscate the property of the poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the case of a widow who bought a house some ten or twelve years ago with the object of future <Col N="602" /> occupation by herself.  That was a very legitimate purpose.  She let the house temporarily, and it then came under the Rent Restrictions Act.  That Act prevented her from either occupying the house or selling it in the open market.  It is all very well to say that the owner of a house can sell it, but what is that owner really selling?  If you are not in a position to give possession of the house immediately on sale you will not get a price for it.  I know that that is the fact, and I may as well tell that to the House now. This unfortunate woman to whom I have referred is a dispensary doctor's widow.  She has six or seven orphans to look after, and she has to try to keep herself and the children on between £70 and £80 a year.  Now the suggestion is made that her house should be confiscated.  The amount of money she paid for the house was £1,200 and portion of it was borrowed in the bank.  The bank pressed for payment. She wanted to sell the house but could not do so.  The occupying tenant, a wealthy man who had as many thousands as she had pounds, said to her that he would waive his rights under the Rent Restrictions Act if she gave him £300.</P>

If that amendment were adopted it would relieve this injustice. However, there is no offer in that direction.  I do not imagine that any landlord who has nine, ten or twelve houses to let will want to be disturbed. I do not suppose he would be anxious to get rid of a good tenant.  I think, however, that it is most unfair in the case of a person who owns one house. I know, also, the case of a retired school teacher who bought a house with the idea of occupying it ultimately. He is now living in a garage, and the <Col N="603" /> tenant of his house is a well-to-do man. This retired school teacher cannot provide alternative accommodation.  The scarcity of houses is really a thing of the past because of all the new houses that have been built with Government grants.</P>

If the statements made by Deputy Hennessy are true, that the landlord was living in a garage while the tenant was occupying his good house, and that the house was covered by the Rent Restrictions Act, the Minister knows quite well that the question of greater hardship would at once arise under the Rent Restrictions Act, and the landlord would be entitled to get clear possession.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  We are all aware of the great scarcity of houses which exists at the moment.  We all know, how difficult it is for a person looking for a house to be accepted as a tenant. There is some reason for that, and the reason is simply this, that owing to recent legislation owners of house property do not feel secure that they have a genuine claim to their property.  If this amendment of five years is accepted, or even an amendment of 25 years, what would be the effect on house-owners?  The effect would be that when one of their houses became vacant they would not let it to any tenant, and justly so, because after five years that tenant would have a claim to that house.  Let us be reasonable about this matter and approach it from a business point of view.  The man who built the house invested his money because he thought it was a safe investment and thought that his money was secure for all time.  When he let a tenant into the house he thought that he was not giving away any right to his property and that the tenant was prepared to pay his rent, year by year, provided that the landlord observed his end of the agreement.  Those agreements are usually that the landlord keeps the outside weather-proof and the tenant keeps the inside, as a rule, in repair.  I would say that no matter what length of time the tenant lives in a house he should not have a claim to it other than under the agreement with his landlord.  Is there any such proviso in the case of anything else which he invests?</P>

      <P>Let a man put his money in other investments.  After ten or twelve years he is paid in full. Here it is thought that because a tenant lives in a house for 25 years he has bought the house.  I do not think that is a fair argument at all. <Col N="605" /> The tenant gets good value for his money per his agreement, and when he took the house I do not think he had at the back of his mind the thought that he would become part owner after a certain number of years. If this kind of legislation goes on, it will be almost impossible for anyone looking for a house to be accepted as a tenant.  Those who are pleading the case for tenants are doing a bad day's work for them, because when a house will become vacant no landlord will let the house.  He will try to sell it.</P>

      <P>If legislation of this kind is passed, it will be impossible for people who are looking for houses to be accepted as tenants.  Therefore let those who are pleading for the tenants be very careful or they will put them out of action completely.  In the old days house property was looked upon as a very safe investment. To-day that is not so.  A few years ago, in this House, a Town Tenants Bill was introduced, under which, in the case of a tenant living in a house for fifteen years, the landlord could not sell without giving him an interest of fifteen years' purchase as well.  That would be almost half the value of the house.  This kind of legislation is bad, because after all, we must be reasonable and sensible in this House, and see that we do not take anything which belongs to another. A great many in this country are anxious to get something for nothing.  They would stay up all night trying to get something for nothing, instead of working to get <Col N="606" /> it fairly and squarely.  It is most unfair to take rights from those who invest money in house property, or build houses.  Therefore, I am completely opposed to this amendment of five years or twenty-five years.  I say the thing should be left as it is, because there will be always a fairly good feeling between tenants and landlords.  We hear of one bad landlord here and there.  There are bad tenants too.  I think the things is all right as it is, and the less legislation dealing with house property which is introduced here the better for the tenants themselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connor has made a speech which, without offence to him, comes rather late in the day, because the principle of giving a renewal of a tenancy has, I think, been accepted by this House and by public opinion in this country.  Deputy O'Connor and, I think, Deputy Hennessy, rather tried to lead this House to believe that this amendment is entirely in the interests of the tenant and is inspired purely by greed and selfishness.  Of course, it is right to say that the amendment is conceived primarily in the interests of the tenant. There is no doubt about that, but it is more far-reaching than that.  I think that on reflection the House can see that the amendment, either in the exact form in which it stands or with such slight modification as may commend itself to the House, is in the interests of landlords or tenants.  Is any Deputy in this House, even Deputy Dr. Hennessy, or Deputy O'Connor, optimistic enough to believe that if the Bill, as introduced now, is passed with a forty years' period that there will not be considerable agitation in the country?

      <P>The House is not sure of the honesty of any person in this country except possibly the honesty of Deputy Dr. Hennessy.  But <Col N="607" /> taking the facts as we find them in the world where there are all sorts of honest men like Deputy Dr. Hennessy, perhaps slightly dishonest people like myself, what I ask the House calmly to consider is this: do they believe that this Bill, if it is pressed through this House with the enactment of the clause as it stands in the Bill, that there must be forty years in order to require the right of renewal in certain instances, will be accepted by the organisations of tenants in this country?  Of course it will not.  There will be a state of uncertainty, and that state of uncertainty is detrimental to builders who build houses, who, if things seems settled for a period, will proceed with their enterprises and will build.  They can calculate their costs and know where they stand if the law in the country, with regard to landlord and tenant, is substantially in accord with the public opinion of the country.</P>
      <P>If it is out of harmony with public opinion you will have that agitation to which I have referred, and you will have a grave feeling of uncertainty which will be detrimental to householders who have occasion to let houses. It will be detrimental to them in various ways.  They do not know exactly how they stand in regard to their tenants.  They do not know exactly how they stand as regards the saleable value of their interests.  They do not know how they stand as regards the value of their property, if they want a mortgage on it or to pledge it to a bank.  Reduce this period to five or ten years or some period that will commend itself to the general sentiment of the country, and you remove all that.  In that way you improve the position of what I will call, without offence, the speculative builder and you improve the position of the owner of a house who wants to let his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to believe that it is a narrow view of this amendment to represent it as selfish or to harp too much on words like honesty, greed and so on.  Surely the interests of the country would be better served if an amendment like this were dealt with by the use of language somewhat more restrained and somewhat calmer than that.  I think the Minister said when <Col N="608" /> he was introducing this Bill that he did not think the Bill was the last word as regards the relation of landlord and tenant generally.  That may not be a fair paraphrase of what the Minister said.  I thought the Minister said something to the effect that he did not think that this Bill completely dealt with the matter.  Be that as it may, there is no reason, at all events, why this section of the Bill, if dealt with now without passion in the House, might not for many a year represent a code upon which a tenant complying with the statutory conditions would be entitled to a renewal of his tenancy.  If this House were to wed itself to a period of forty years, or even a period of twenty-five years, which was suggested by Deputy Byrne, you would have nothing approaching finality.  I would appeal to the House to arrive at some period which will in that way be acceptable and which will serve the interests of both parties who are concerned in house property in the Irish Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connor must not have read this particular section, or if he did he must have read it with very prejudiced glasses.  His whole speech dealt with confiscation.  There is no suggestion of confiscation in this section.  He spoke as if his property was going to be confiscated. Where is that suggestion in the amendment or in the section? What is he fighting for?  What is he claiming?  He is claiming the right to have a tenant who has paid his rent regularly and complied with all the conditions of his agreement at his mercy, whether it is at the end of twenty-five, thirty or thirty-five years, so that he can send him about his business just when he thinks he ought to do it, irrespective of the fact that the rent has been paid regularly all these years, and that there is no suggestion that the man is a bad tenant.  If he refuses to comply with the terms of his agreement there is no suggestion that he should have any rights under this section or the amendment.  Then what is the meaning of this talk about confiscation that Deputy O'Connor has indulged in?  What does he want more than a fair return for his money?  He <Col N="609" /> is getting that in the rent that will be fixed.  Deputy O'Connor talked just in the language that was used forty years ago by landlords, and it was talk of that kind that caused a rebellion.  He is not going to do any good to the cause of the people he apparently represents here by talking in that particular fashion.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the tenants will be the last to agree with the Deputy in that respect anyway.  I suggest, as I mentioned before, that it would be contrary to our ideas of what living conditions are to be that a man, who has lived in a house for a great number of years, who reared his family there, and regarded the house not as a mere four walls to shelter him, but as a home with all the things that that word implies, should be at the end of a long period like that mentioned in the Bill, or at the end of twenty-five or thirty years, subject to be thrown on the roadside at the whim of the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy came along with a hard case.  Of course the Minister will be the very first to say that hard cases make bad law.  Even if there are such hard cases, Deputy Byrne, I think, has knocked the bottom out of these particular cases that Deputy Dr. Hennessy put up.  Nobody has attempted to make a case for the fixing of a period of forty years.  Deputy O'Connor attempted to make a case, but he talked about a thing, with all due respect to the Chair, that was entirely irrelevant because there is no suggestion of confiscation in this amendment.  I press very strongly on the Minister to consider whether or not it is possible or right to maintain this period of forty years in the Bill, apart altogether from the recommendation of the Town Tenants Commission.  It may not have been subject to examination at that <Col N="610" /> Commission, but it has been subject to examination since.  It seems to me that all the arguments are in favour of reducing that period very considerably indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to look at this question now not from the point of view of what you might call the human equities of it, the question of the right of a citizen to a home and so on, but purely from the point of view of a conservative-minded landlord. What does he want?  It is always said that no tenant is better than a bad tenant, and I agree with that, but once a landlord has got a good tenant he wants to keep him.  I think it is fair that the landlord should have an opportunity of getting to know whether he has got a good tenant, and the term in this section should be based upon that principle, from the point of view of the landlord.  If the landlord can find out in a certain period of time whether he has got a good tenant or not that should be sufficient for him from the point of view of his security. I suggest that the landlord who attends to his property will know within a period of five years whether he has got a good tenant or not, whether he is satisfactory from the point of view of maintaining his security.  There are two conditions from the point of view of the landlord.  The house must be well built in order to make it a good security.  When he is looking to buy house property he will try to get a place that is properly built.  He will not buy a jerry-built house, and that is the chief reason why people are a little bit afraid of the modern builder. They are afraid of the way in which the concrete has been mixed in building the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is afraid of investing money in property which is going to deteriorate very rapidly, but provided he has that security, that he knows the house is well built, the next thing he wants is a good tenant.  Having satisfied himself within a period of five years that he has a good tenant in the house, that he has no other grievance, if his rent is subjected to revision by a court of law, I cannot see what objection he could have to that.  After all, he wants a fair <Col N="611" /> return for his money.  Unlike Deputy O'Connor, he does not want to get all his money back in 10 or 12 years.  He does not regard house property as a sort of sweepstake; he does not want a gamble; he is out for a moderate rate of interest and first-class security.  I cannot see why a landlord should not be satisfied with sufficient security in the shape of five years learning what kind of tenant he has got.  After that he could be very careful not to have to change his tenant.  Even if he does have to limit his rent by some standard of justice fixed by a court, I must say that from the point of view of the community he has no real grievance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. B. O'Connor Mr. B. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I make is this: Deputy Little has taken me up wrongly.  There is no landlord going to change a good tenant.  If the tenant is paying his rent, he is undoubtedly kept on as a tenant.  The agreements usually run from three to five years.  At the end of five years, if the tenant feel that he has a bad landlord, he is  free to get away from him.  These agreements work both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised at the extreme attitude taken up by Deputy Lemass in his opening speech, because he claimed that as soon as a tenant got into a house he had an equity to remain there for all time.  He could not see why that should not be.  I should like to call the attention of the House to a statement which occurred several times in the report of the Town Tenants Commission.  I am reading from page 4, but you will get similar statements elsewhere.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>But even the least moderate advocates of tenants' rights hesitated to claim that mere occupation, for however short a period, gives a tenant a right to a renewal or a right to have the tenancy continued, after the stipulated period, at a fair rent to be fixed by some tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That proposition, which nobody on behalf of the tenants examined before this Commission thought could be sensibly put forward, is the very proposition which Deputy Lemass has put <Col N="612" /> forward in his argument in support of his amendment.  Therefore, it seems to me that Deputy Lemass has really not approached this amendment, or the whole consideration of the matter, from any real sense of endeavouring to do justice between two different classes of the community whose respective rights are very hard to reconcile. Deputy Lemass also said that while I was relying upon the forty years period I did not embody all the recommendations of the Commission.  I have embodied them all except one, and that one is on page 25:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where the tenant is in bona fide occupation of the whole or a substantial portion of the holding and has been so for a period of not less than seven years, and it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that there is a scarcity of accommodation in the locality in which the holding is situate and there does not appear to the Court to be a reasonable prospect of the tenant obtaining alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>That is a temporary thing.  That is really dealt with by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Act which is still in force.  The whole of that is governed by the fact that the Commission thought that in June, 1929, the emergency provision would cease, because they mentioned so on page 24.  Therefore, this period of 40 years is one of the recommendations of the Commission. The others are embodied in other sub-sections here.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment what this period of five years would mean&mdash; what would be the result.  Suppose some builder sets to work, develops an area and builds a very large number of houses.  He says to himself: &ldquo;I cannot let these houses for a period longer than five years, because after that period for all practical purposes they will have sunk enormously in sale value.&rdquo;  I agree with Deputy Dr. Hennessy that a landlord will get nearer the true value of his house if he can give vacant possession of it than he will if he has to sell, not the house itself, but merely a rent charge on the house, because that is what it comes to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> It has been stated here that landlords always want, in all circumstances, simply to get a fair return for their money.  That is not so.  Landlords very often have to realise their capital.  It makes a tremendous difference. Supposing a man dies and his estate has to pay succession duty, or has to be divided amongst his children, or sold to pay his debts, or for any reason of that kind it is necessary to realise the capital.  Very often a man wishes to realise his capital for the purpose of changing his investments. The capital value of a house most undoubtedly will have deteriorated if he has to sell, not the house itself but a mere right to a certain annuity out of the house, because that is what a fair rent amounts to.  What would happen if we inserted this five-year period?  I am pretty satisfied that what would happen would be that for every house for which there was a tenancy made there would be a letting made for four years, and at the end of the four years the tenant would have to put his furniture in storage possibly for about a week and the landlord would go into possession and there would be a new letting made for another four years. That is precisely what would happen, because you may be perfectly certain that landlords, seeing that there are circumstances in which it will be necessary for them to realise their capital and because they do not wish to put it out of their power to realise their capital in future, will make lettings that will defeat the purposes of this Bill if it were amended as Deputy Lemass and Deputy Morrissey has suggested that it should be amended.  I think that is perfectly obvious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan talked about getting security and that if this happened that security would be given to builders and that it would add to building.  I cannot follow that argument. If I build houses to rent, if I want to realise and get back my capital, I want to be able to sell them, even though I may at one period have let them to tenants.  If I know that the moment I let to a tenant for five years I have either to go through the formula of recovering possession every four and a half years or else there will <Col N="614" /> be an interest created against me possibly for 99 years in the premises, it is the greatest discouragement to me. I think it would almost kill building as an investment.  We must be very careful about this.  If we look at a problem of this nature only from one particular angle, it may for the time being benefit the tenant, but if we look at the matter from a wider and broader point of view, we may see that it will practically terminate the relationship of landlord and tenant, because I agree with Deputy O'Connor that there is that danger that people will not let a house if they find it is possible to sell it.</P>
    <P>There are a great many people, young men, for instance, starting in business, and other persons of that kind, who are only able out of their annual earnings to pay rent.  They have not got the capital sum to put down to buy a house and I think it is greatly to the advantage of the community that there should be a fair number of dwelling houses on the market for competition amongst persons not in the position to buy houses. Deputy O'Connell put forward no argument at all in favour of this four or five years' period or in favour of anything except a substantially long period.  The reason why this forty years was introduced into the Town Tenants Report is obviously this: they were taken by the argument that Deputy O'Connell has put forward now &mdash;that a man may have been for a great number of years in a house, that his children may have been reared there, or that his father or his grandfather was there before him, and that the place has a sentimental association for him and that it is very hard in these circumstances to turn him out and put him into new surroundings after being a great number of years in one particular house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that would apply to less than forty years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there comes the question as to what period of years.  That was considered by the Town Tenants Commission and they came to the conclusion that the period <Col N="615" /> should be forty years.  It was their opinion that unless there had been continuous occupation for forty years really home association has not grown up.  Forty years is their period, and I certanly think that that is the foundation upon which this rests entirely.  It is simply a question of preventing people from being put out of their homes.  It is a sentimental basis, if you like, not a basis that would occur to entirely business men.  But we are not entirely business men.  Everyone has a certain amount of sentiment in him and we must recognise that sentiment and human associations and things of that kind do play a very large part in human life and that they are matters we must take into consideration when dealing with things of that kind.  But to say such association arises at the end of five or ten years, or even twenty years which is the longest suggestion, appears to me to be entirely wrong and I shall ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from the Minister's speech why it is desired that a landlord should be in a position to eject without cause a tenant who consistently paid his rent over a very long period.  The Minister talked about the selling value of the premises, and draws attention to the fact that that selling value is increased if the landlord is in the position to give vacant possession.  It should be obvious that the selling value of a house when there is no scarcity is equivalent to the capitalised value of the rent.  If there is no scarcity nobody will pay more for a house than would represent the fair investment of what he is going to get in rent out of the house.  The selling value on the basis of vacant possession is increased in times of scarcity and the only purpose of the Minister's proposal in the Bill would be to enable a landlord to take advantage of the period of scarcity and to eject the occupier in order to get an enhanced price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious conclusion <Col N="616" /> of what the Minister was arguing is that if there is no scarcity of houses nobody is going to pay more for a house than what he will get out of that house in rent, and that a house will have a greater selling value on the basis of vacant possession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is illogical to assume it will.  The proposal here is to take advantage of any period of scarcity that may arise to evict tenants and sell their houses.  There is no regard to the interests of the tenants who in such circumstances will have great difficulty in getting alternative accommodation except at greatly increased rents.  If we are to strike a fair balance between the landlord and the tenant this period of forty years must be very considerably reduced.  It has been assumed by some Deputies that we are trying to protect a bad tenant and to give him security of tenure. That is not so.  The point is it is only a good tenant who can get protection under this Bill.  No matter what the period is that is fixed, whether it is five, ten or twenty years; no matter whether the tenant gets renewal or not, he can always be ejected under Section 19 if he does not pay his rent or if he breaks his contract or gives his landlord any good and sufficient cause to eject him.  The landlord can always evade an application for a new tenancy if he desires to rebuild or reconstruct or if he requires possession for the purpose of a scheme of development of the property or any cause consistent with good estate management. The landlord is secure under the Bill of the highest rent he can get on a basis of vacant possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor, it seems to me, advanced the most extraordinary case of all.  I am quite certain that if <Col N="617" /> Deputy O'Connor goes into the library and reads the speeches made by the landlords' representatives in the British House of Commons, when the first Land Bill was before that House, he will find words he used recorded there identically.  His attitude in this matter is the very same as those who represented the landlord interests when the first Land Bill was under discussion, when people were talking about giving the farmers fixity of tenure. People got up then and said the landlord may want to sell his land at any time, and does not want to have the tenant as part owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there is a difference, but the fact is the same that there are people in occupation of houses that are as much concerned to remain in occupation of them as the farmers are to remain on their land. The position is, that Deputy O'Connor talks about investments and getting his capital back in ten years, but he knows he is talking through his hat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, you did say that. A person putting money into houses is going in for a long term investment and not for investment for the purpose of speculation as a rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing to guarantee that person a safe return and to guarantee it by statute.  If Deputy O'Connor chooses to put his money into Hatry shares or railway shares he has no guarantee that it will not disappear in a short time, but, if this Bill is passed, he puts his money into house property, he is guaranteed the highest return which the market will give under the circumstances.  Under such circumstances why does the Deputy assume that landlords will not let their houses?  What more do they want for their houses except to be in a position to squeeze the tenants, so as to get the last farthing out of them? The only thing that can be advanced for this long period is that it enables the landlords to hold the threat of <Col N="618" /> ejectment over their tenants, so as to get a higher rent than under the terms of Section 27 would be considered a fair rent.  If their one desire is to get a fair rent under that section, they need have no fear of shortening the term, because they will get their rent no matter what terms are fixed.</P>

      <P>Anyhow, the point is this: the Minister, near the end of his speech, went on to justify the long period on the ground that the only reason for giving any concession of this kind was that a certain sentiment had arisen around a house from the tenant's point of view, and that the tenant had become attached to it.  As the Bill stands, however, the tenant may have been there only twelve months.  It does not apply to people who have been there all the time. Several speakers made the mistake in assuming that the same person had been in occupation for forty years, whereas, as a matter of fact, the tenant may have been there only one, two or five years.  If that is the only plea which the Minister can make for the longer term, obviously he has no excuse at all.  As Section 17 (b) stands, it reads: &ldquo;Such tenement was during the whole of the period of forty years next preceding the termination of such tenancy continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant thereof immediately before such termination or of his predecessors in title.&rdquo;  Further, it is curious that those who are objecting to this amendment did not point to the particular provision in Section 27 which would penalise and be objectionable to the landlords.  In that connection I wonder are landlords generally opposed to the proposal which we are making?  It seems to me that many <Col N="620" /> landlords would take the view that it would add to the value of their property that it should come under the supervision of the courts five years after it is built.  The only thing which I regard as remarkable about the amendment is that it is a very big extension of the principle of State interference and State control.  I can well imagine a builder or a property owner who would welcome such a provision, as there is not a single condition in Section 27 that could be regarded as penalising the landlord or lessening the value of his property.  I hold that it could well be argued that the provisions of Section 27 would operate to the appreciation of house property. Deputy O'Connor, I notice, talked about the danger of landlords selling their houses the moment this Bill is passed and that henceforward all builders would seek to sell rather than to rent their houses.  If such property is not valuable I do not know how the builders are going to sell it.  Who is going to buy it?  If it is not valuable to one person it is not valuable to another.  Again, Deputy O'Connor, who should be in a position to do so, did not point to the provision that would penalise landlords in any way. Altogether, in my opinion, no case whatever has been made against the amendment and I trust that it will be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assist the Minister in clearing up certain doubts in his mind about this clause.  Landlords will take two things into consideration from a purely financial point of view.  If a landlord has a lease for 99 years and is about to let a house he will let it at a rent which will give him back his capital in 99 years, making a certain deduction for repairs and so forth, and giving him a fair return on his money.  That would correspond to what he would get in a fair trustee security, namely, about four or five per cent. in normal times.  Apart from that, he should get back what in 99 years would return him his capital when his property is gone.  That is the chief factor in the mind of anyone who wants to have property which he can sell at any time, because at any time, provided the <Col N="621" /> market for houses is not over-supplied &mdash;a contingency over which an Act of Parliament has no control, and on which you cannot calculate&mdash;a man should be able in normal times to sell his house at a price based on those figures, namely, the number of years in which he will get a return on his capital and the rate of interest as a solid and reasonable security.  Therefore he cannot have a flutter with the property and anything which leaves scope, such as this clause leaves, for playing fast and loose with tenants, turning out one tenant and putting in another, in the hope of having a flutter in the market, is dead against the spirit of the Bill itself.  The actual effect of this is to exclude tenants from the benefits of the principles which the Minister has established in other parts of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think in the last part of his speech Deputy Little rather damaged what he had been saying in his first speech, because if the landlord wishes merely to have a rent out of his house and wishes to have it for a term of years, then the natural thing he does is to lease it for a long term of years, and this question does not arise.  It is only when the landlord does not wish to give a lease and the tenancy is from year to year that this problem arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not understand my attitude.  The ordinary landlord buys property for 99 years, and sets out with the idea of letting his house from five years to five years.  It is with that type of landlord I was dealing.  I was not dealing with the landlord who simply wanted to dispose of the whole thing and only get the head rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the position of believing that five years is rather short, but yet I hold forty years is rather too long.  I appreciate the <Col N="622" /> way in which Deputy Geoghegan approached the amendment when he stated that he hoped that Deputies would discuss it in a calm atmosphere and not introduce any heat.  I think if that policy were pursued much oftener, much advantage would accrue to all parties concerned.  I am one of those who believe that the landlord has rights and the tenant has also rights. I know from experience that one bad landlord sometimes creates a great deal of trouble.  On the other hand, I know also that tenants sometimes are the means of causing trouble in a great many cases unnecessarily with their landlords.  That leads to the introduction of legislation that is perhaps not good for the landlord, the tenant, or the country generally.  I know that legislation dealing with houses as a rule has a very bad effect in preventing people from building houses to let. That is an aspect of the situation which should be borne in mind very carefully, that owing to the high cost of building it is very difficult to get anybody at the moment to invest in house-building.  It is a well-known fact that in pre-war days house-building was a very popular form of investment.  Large numbers of people in this country, as well as in other countries, invested their money in house-building, and the relations of landlord and tenant during all those years were of a most friendly character. I am sorry to say that sometimes those relations are not the same to-day as they were formerly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this amendment there will in the natural course of events arise cases of hardship.  I have knowledge of the case of a landlord who had occasion to sell his property, and sooner than sell the houses to tenants who paid the rent regularly for years, perhaps for a period of twenty-five years&mdash;perhaps during that period he had some altercation with certain of the tenants&mdash;he was known to sell the houses at a lesser price to outsiders.  I think it is with a view to safeguarding the position of such tenants that the amendment has been introduced.  If the Minister could hold out any hope that he would on the Report Stage bring in an amendment <Col N="623" /> that would meet the opinion of Deputies like myself and Deputy Byrne, and perhaps also the opinion of Deputy Lemass, he would be in a position to compromise, and it would be better for all concerned.  I am very anxious that the good relations of landlord and tenant should increase rather than diminish.  I know it is only by the preservation of such good relations that any advantage can come to both classes, and incidentally to the country in general.  I am opposed to the introduction of any legislation that will have a nasty effect on any section of the people.  It would be better if we could, like a sensible body of men, arrive at some agreement that would be acceptable to all Parties, and that would impose no hardship on anybody.  I ask the Minister to stretch a point, and come to some agreement that would be acceptable to all Parties.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should explain a curious anomaly that he has created under the Bill.  A person who is one year in possession of a house, simply because there has been an uninterrupted tenancy, with which he has nothing to do, has a right to a tenancy under the Bill, while his neighbour who had fifteen, twenty, thirty or thirty-five years in the house next door has not that right.  Is not that an extraordinary position which the Minister has created by the Bill? Surely it requires some explanation that a tenant, for no reason for which he has any responsibility, is going to have a privilege of that kind while his neighbour can be evicted, though he is thirty-five years in possession? A tenant who has occupied a house for thirty-five years can be evicted by the landlord, and has no claim for a new tenancy.  Surely that is the most extraordinary legislation ever proposed!</P>

      <P>This paragraph of the sub-section deals with the case of a landlord who has only three years' reversion and who consequently cannot give a new tenancy for longer than three years.  The Bill provides that a tenant who has been fifteen years in occupation can get a new tenancy for fifteen years, and the amendment proposes to reduce the fifteen years to three years.  It does not appear that any serious objection can be made to the amendment.  It is difficult to understand why fifteen years was decided on in the first instance. The Minister has apparently accepted the principle that where the reversion of the landlord is limited to three years the period of occupation required on the part of the tenant should be lower than where there is no such limitation.  Briefly, the proposal is that where the tenant has been in occupation for three years and his tenancy express he should be entitled to a new tenancy for three years where the landlord's reversion does not exceed that period.  Of course, the landlord cannot give a new tenancy for a period longer than his own lease.  It does not seem to me that any hardship would be done to the landlord if the amendment were carried.  The tenant must be a good tenant, paying his rent and observing the conditions of his contract.</P>

      <P>I move&mdash;&ldquo;In sub-section (1) (d), line 12, to delete the words `one-half' and substitute the words `one-third.'  Paragraph (d) of the sub-section proposes to give a tenant a statutory right to a new tenancy if he has effected improvements in the dwelling, which have increased the letting value by 100 per cent.  The amendment proposes to give the right to a new tenancy if the tenant has increased the letting value <Col N="629" /> by fifty per cent.  It seems to me that the percentage required by the Bill as drafted, is too high.  If a person is in occupation of a dwelling, and has made very substantial improvements, sufficient to increase the letting value on the termination of the tenancy by 50 per cent. he should be entitled to a new tenancy.  The alternative is to evict him, giving him compensation for the improvements, but no compensation for disturbance. It is reasonable to assume that, where a person incurs considerable expense in effecting improvements in a dwelling, he intends, if possible, to remain in permanent occupation, that he is not a tenant who is merely contemplating a short tenancy.  A person who incurs expenditure on improvements is obviously thinking of remaining there for the rest of his life, or for a very long period.  It is quite possible that if a very high percentage is fixed in the Bill considerable injustice may be done by a landlord who is anxious to avail of the scarcity of houses and to get a high price on the basis of vacant possession.  I think the Minister will see the justice of the proposal in the amendment, and that he will be inclined to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.  Of course, the principle which underlies this is that where a house is as much the tenant's as the landlord's, that then the tenant should have this fixity of tenure which is given over and above the other rights of fixity which he gets under other parts of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is that half the value of the house is his.  He is as substantially the owner of the bricks and mortar as the landlord is.  He should not be put out because he is, in effect, as much the owner as the nominal owner; as much of his capital is in it as the capital of his landlord.  If you depart from that you go on quite a different basis.  In every other case all the tenant could reasonably ask for it is that he will get the full letting value of his improvements when he goes out.  The increased letting value due to his improvements will be given to him.  The principle that lies here is <Col N="630" /> that if a person is as much the owner as the nominal owner, he should be entitled to stop on in possession; as a matter of fact, if his improvements were half the value of the house, he should pay half the old rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy O'Connor is not in the House, because he is zealous, perhaps overzealous, in defence of what he conceives to be the feudal rights of property. I think that even Deputy O'Connor would be reluctant to oppose this amendment and advance his reasons for opposing it.  I wonder would Deputy Dr. Hennessy oppose it on reflection?  Here is an amendment which is calculated to encourage the tenants to expend very considerable sums of money on the property of their landlord.  The tenant knows that unless he, or his predecessors in title, have been in occupation of a private house for forty years, he is not entitled to the right of renewal, but under the Bill as it stands he is told that if he expends so much money as will increase the letting value of the house 100 per cent. he will be put in a more favourable position.  Is it not vain to hold that out?  What tenant will expend such an enormous sum of money as will in the ordinary course increase the letting value of a private house by 100 per cent?  It would need to be something enormous.</P>
      <P>It is suggested by this amendment that the tenant should be tempted to improve his landlord's property, should be tempted to gild the security for the rent by spending such a large sum of money as will increase the letting value by one-third.  Presumably the landlord, in letting a house, is exacting, as is his right, the full letting value of the house.  That is not a gilt-edged security.  It is the ordinary security of a house let at a competitive rent.  The tenant comes along and by the expenditure on that house he increases its letting value by one-third.</P>

    <P>These are the terms of this amendment. Is the landlord so jealous of his sovereignty over this house that he will not give that tenant who has expended such a large sum of money in improving the property the right to <Col N="631" /> get continuity of tenure at a competitive rent?  That is all he is getting. Will the landlord go that far?  I have read of somebody who is astonished at his own moderation.  I think that Deputy Lemass has reason to reproach himself for his own moderation in putting in an amendment by which he merely seeks to alter &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; to &ldquo;one-third,&rdquo; because such an increase as one-third is very considerable.  Let the members of this House reflect what would need to be done in the way of improvement and extension of an ordinary private house in order to increase its letting value by one-third.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the community I would appeal to this House to encourage the tenants so to improve their houses as to bring themselves within this section, by passing this amendment.  Whom does it hurt?  It merely hurts those who have been described from the benches here, from the Labour Benches, and, I think, from the Government Benches, as those who are fortunate enough to own houses at a time when there may be a famine of houses, and who want to extract the last penny that under famine conditions they can get.  Somebody seems to be shocked here.  Deputy O'Connor seems to be shocked that the House should try to curb that. He seems to think it was a most unwarrantable interference with the rights of property.  He said there should be a distinction between property in houses and property in land. The whole spirit of the present time, not merely in this country but in other countries, is to curb profiteering. Attempts have been made to stop profiteering. A man is not even allowed to sell the goods in his shop sometimes unchallenged at whatever price he could get for them.</P>
    <P>The only person who can quarrel with the amendment is someone who says to himself: &ldquo;I have a house and the time may come, owing to famine, or the opportunity may arise, owing to the peculiar needs of the tenant who may have to reside in that particular district, when I can give him a squeeze and thereby make him pay a faney rent on the house upon which he has <Col N="632" /> spent so much by way of improvement.&rdquo; I think I am entitled to say that the amendment is an extremely moderate one, and I appeal to the House to accept it.  I do not know if there is any use in appealing to the Minister.  Perhaps he thinks that nothing good can come from these benches.  I hope it is not without avail to appeal to the Minister to accept the principle that is embedded in this amendment.  The Minister may say whatever fraction you have must be arbitrary.  One-half is an arbitrary fraction.</P>

      <P>Why not select nineteen-twentieths?  I merely say that the selection of a fraction of one-half is the selection of something arbitrary. No very great justification can be put forward for it, and certainly nothing like the justification that can be put forward for the figure of &ldquo;one-third,&rdquo; which is the figure that may work and that may encourage the tenants, as I have said before, to bring themselves within this favoured section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I only just want to say that &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; is not an arbitrary figure.  The reason why one-half is being taken is that when the tenant has taken a certain building and transformed that building, and, by transforming the building, has turned perhaps a small house into a house double its size, he is really as much the owner of the bricks and mortar as is the person who is the landlord.  If it is less than half, he is so much less the owner, and if it is more than half he is so much more the owner.  Deputy Geoghegan seems to think that before the landlord can take possession of a house from the tenant who had improved it he will have to pay down in hard cash to that tenant the value of those improvements.  He cannot, under this Bill, enrich himself <Col N="633" /> by the tenant's improvements, because he has to pay the full letting value of these improvements to the tenant when the tenant goes out.</P>
      <P>
        <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.]</i>
      </P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan also seems to labour under the delusion that this is a sort of compulsory eviction Bill; that in every case which is not provided for by this Bill the landlord is bound to evict.  Of course, that is not so.  If a landlord has a good tenant and yet has very good reasons for taking possession, you may be perfectly certain that he is not going to pay down a large sum out of sheer wantonness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was incorrect in one particular.  He said the tenant must have spent as much on a house as the landlord.  He may have to spend more, because he will have to double the letting value of the house, and the letting value of the improvements <Col N="634" /> would be likely to be less than the original letting value.  The landlord might build a house for £400 or £500.  The tenant may add a garage at a cost of £100, and probably not increase its letting value by one-fourth or one-fifth, as the case may be.  The law of diminishing returns operates in this case.  It is quite possible that even if the tenant's improvements equal the cost of the construction of the original building, nevertheless the letting value might not increase more than fifty per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell me whether it is quite clear that the section covers a person who has been in occupation under a building lease which expired two or three years ago and who is still in occupation as an ordinary tenant.  Is that person covered by this section of the Bill?  If the occupation is for forty years is he entitled to a new tenancy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various amendments dealing with the position of persons who are holding on under the Increase of Rent Acts or who are merely in occupation.  I am coming to these amendments later on. I have several amendments down, as the Deputy is aware, and they will cover this position.  So to speak, under the amendments his new interests will be a graft on his old interests.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f)  his tenancy is that of a corporate body not registered under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, in Saorstát Eireann and is situate in an urban district, a town or a village but not in a county or other borough.</P>
      <P>This is to meet a case where big companies such as banking companies or insurance companies are tenants to small landowners, people who have only one house.  These people are not resident within the State, and I think things should be left as they were before and that a rich corporation should not benefit by the Act.  That is my reason for moving this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  After all, the law must be the same whether the person is rich or poor.  You cannot alter it.  We cannot say that we will single out certain persons, classes of persons or houses and say that they should be exempt from the provisions of the Act.  I quite understand that a person who thinks he might be able to raise the rent unduly to a wealthy corporation may feel a little aggrieved, but, as I say, we cannot have a law for one person and a different law for another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that the law should be the same for both the rich and the poor.  I am glad the Minister said that.  It indicates a welcome <Col N="637" /> change in the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal, but it has nothing to do with this amendment.  The amendment relates to companies registered outside the country, and the law need not necessarily be the same for foreigners as for our own citizens.  The proposal is that companies registered outside Saorstát Eireann should be debarred from the right of new tenants under the Bill.  Of course there is a limitation in the amendment, which suggests that Deputy Reynolds is more concerned with a particular case in Co. Leitrim than with the general principle. I am more concerned with the general principle, and I would like to see what the policy is, and if it is the policy of the Government to discourage the operations of foreign companies here by depriving them of the right of security of tenure in any buildings in which they may have a tenancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Act deals with a question of right or wrong.  If it is right that persons who are citizens of our State, having done certain things, should have property here, I think exactly the same principle applies to persons who are foreigners.  Justice is justice, no matter who the person is, and if it is just for one of our citizens on certain occasions to acquire certain rights, then it appears to me it is equally just for persons who are not our citizens to acquire those rights equally, and differentiation such as Deputy Lemass pointed out would be, to my mind, extremely unfair.  As Deputy Lemass, after all those years, is so completely ignorant of Cumann na nGaedheal policy, I am not surprised at any arguments he puts forward here.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment, if carried, would be that a number of companies would proceed to register in Saorstát Eireann, which, I hope the Minister will agree with us, <Col N="638" /> would be a very excellent thing.  As to treating the citizens of this country and other countries with equal justice, I think that is a fair principle to establish; but would it be a fair thing or a just thing for a citizen of this country to register his company in England and to start his business here?  I do not think it would, and it would be against public policy.  The law should be the same for a citizen of this country as for any alien or stranger, and for that reason I think it is right that people running big business corporations or companies of all sorts should be registered in this country. The effect of this amendment would be to force a number of companies to register in this country where they are registered elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a completely different problem, but the Deputy must bear in mind that, say, these companies which are so registered in Northern Ireland or England and carry on business over here will not change their registration, because they may lose rights in one or two premises.  They have to look to their major business, and naturally their major business is carried on in the place where they are registered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

I think it is only fair that the poor man should not be jeopardised by this Bill.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree that it is a small amendment, and, as Deputy Little said, if passed it will bring revenue to the country because it will be the means of getting some of these companies to register here.  In all fairness, I think the Minister ought to accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(f)  in the case of a tenement <Col N="639" /> used as a residence the landlord owns or occupies but one premises used as a residence other than such tenement.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be more successful than my neighbour, Deputy Reynolds, in moving this amendment.  However, I am not over-optimistic, as I have heard peculiar ethics enunciated in connection with this Bill, especially from the Opposition, and I do not make much discrimination between the different sections of the Opposition.  Section 17 of this Bill particularly perpetuates the Rent Restrictions Act, in some respects at least, and especially in the case of the owners of houses with whom my amendment deals.  The object of my amendment is that people who bought a house before the passing of the Rent Restrictions Act with the idea of occupying it at a future date should be exempted.  These people belong to classes such as civil servants. Some of these civil servants were able to keep a better house while in the Civil Service, but when pensioned they were not able to live in their houses. They scraped as much money as they could and bought a smaller house than the one they were residing in with the idea that they would occupy it when they went out on pension.  Then we have widows of doctors, solicitors, and so on.  Deputy Lemass leers at all this. I do not expect much sympathy from Deputy Lemass from what he has already said, but this is a thing that should not be treated lightly.  It is a tragedy for those people.  If Deputy Lemass had the same human nature as I possess and was as accessible as I am, he would have been approached and would have heard something about those people.  They have come to me and put their case before me.  They bought those houses with the idea of occupying them so that they may be able to give cheap education to their children when they arrived at a certain age.  They let the houses temporarily, and in most cases before the Rent Restrictions Act was passed.  The result was that they could not get possession of these houses. I need not go into the different reasons why they could not get possession, but <Col N="640" /> it was obvious that the Rent Restrictions Act did not facilitate owners of houses in getting possession.  Some of them are in the position that they want to sell the houses.  It is a case of grim necessity with them to sell the houses to meet part of their debts.  They find that they cannot sell the houses, and even if they are optimistic enough to hope that the Rent Restrictions Act will be repealed they are caught under this Act and they still will not be able to sell the houses or get possession of them.  These are nearly all owners of one house.  They have been called landlords, but they are owners in the same sense that a tenant farmer in Ireland is the owner of his farm.  It has been said that the occupying tenant should be put in the same category as a tenant farmer.  He is not in the same category. The tenant of a house simply occupies a house and pays for the use of it.  The tenant farmer owns the house, because he has bought it or inherited it from those who went before him.  It is the same way with the people whose cases I am urging.  They also bought the houses, or perhaps inherited them from their forebears.  Of course I know cases of tenants of land who hold on the eleven months' system. They are graziers, and after five or forty years they cannot claim a renewal of the tenancy nor prevent the farmer who owns the land from selling it in the open market.  What I claim for these people is that they should be in a position, especially when it is a case of grim necessity with them, to sell the house in the same open market in which they bought it.  They are owners of one house, and they are very poor people.  I do not care what fixity of tenure you give a tenant so long as you give the owner of a house, especially the owner of a single house, the right to sell it when it becomes an absolute necessity for him, perhaps to pay debts which he is compelled by the law of this State to pay.  I do not care particularly for the morality of this Bill or the honesty of it, though Deputy Geoghegan gave me a little lecture about honesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard them before.  I am avoiding the necessity of repeating it.  However, I will be told that these people can sell the rent of the house.  Selling the rent of a house is a very different proposition from selling a house and giving possession of it to a purchaser who wants to occupy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that will be admitted, and I think the Minister will bear it in mind.  We have not the same scarcity of houses now as when the Rent Restrictions Act was passed.  That is mainly due to the fact that the Government have given very large grants for the building of houses, with the result that nobody has a difficulty in getting a house at present. My experience is that they have no real difficulty.  People want to get this fixity of tenure under this section simply because they want to get something to sell.  I have already told the House on another amendment of a case where an occupying tenant waived his rights under the Rent Restrictions Act for the sum of £300 and allowed the owner, a very poor woman, to sell the house.  That is what you are creating here, and I say that is dishonest.  I ask every Deputy to give this very sympathetic consideration. I think that these are cases in which there should be exceptions made.  I regard anybody who will vote against this amendment as fit simply to rob a little robin's nest. From the arguments I have heard, I am coming to believe that Deputies who, when considering many questions vote away other people's property, have lost any belief in such a place as Hades, where they will suffer for their sins.  I fear that very much.  I fear also that they think it is the easiest thing in the world to get into Heaven, and that no man is too great a blackguard <Col N="642" /> to be forgiven and find a ready acceptance in Heaven.  I do not agree with that.</P>

      <P>It must be a very good thing for a person in Deputy Dr. Hennessy's position to know that he possesses all the honesty, morality and justice that he contends he possesses.  If all the landlords go to Heaven I do not suppose Hell can be so bad a place after all. Deputy Dr. Hennessy said that there was no scarcity of houses and that nobody has any difficulty in getting a house.  I advise him to have a consultation with Deputy O'Connor who, half an hour ago, told us that no tenant will be accepted by any landlord now, and that it is practically impossible to get a house to let in Dublin. They cannot both be right.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy, of course, being honest, moral, just, and everything else, must be right and Deputy O'Connor must be wrong.  As Deputy Dr. Hennessy is so anxious to start out on a new crusade, let him start with his colleague, Deputy O'Connor.  He is likely to have more success there than anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the amendment I thought it was Deputy Dr. Hennessy's purpose to provide that nobody should get a new tenancy unless the landlord occupies two premises for dwelling purposes.  From his speech I take it that is not his aim.  His aim is to provide that if the owner of a house is a poor man, then he can do all the injustice he wants and can be released from all his obligations under the Bill.  He can evict a tenant, no matter how long he has been in occupation. He can charge any rent he can get, no matter how exorbitant. He can force up the price in any way he likes, provided he is poor.  That is Deputy Dr. Hennessy's proposal.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has just voted for a section of the Bill which provides that a person who has been in occupation of a house for forty years is to be given security of tenure.  We tried to reduce that period, but despite our efforts that forty years stands.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy even thinks that forty years is too short a period, provided the house is owned by a poor man who has only one other house in which he resides.  If he is a poor man, he is entitled to do anything he likes. He is to be given every facility to squeeze his tenant, to charge whatever rent he likes, and to evict him for any cause, or even without cause, provided he is a poor man&mdash;not necessarily a poor widow.  He talked about a widow, but the owner need not be a widow. There is nothing in this amendment about widows.  It only refers to a landlord who owns one house besides the house he lives in, and he is to be allowed to do anything he likes. Where is the justice in that?  What about the honesty, the morality and all the rest of it which the Deputy talks about?  Do they only apply to the rich, not to the poor at all?  If Deputy Dr. Hennessy is half as honest or moral or just as he pretends to be, he will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I may be, but I do not think it is for anything which is done in this Bill.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy should bear in mind that this Bill is the outcome of the report of the Town Tenants Commission, which was composed of men of standing in the country who were not out to rob anybody. They were simply out to do justice between two sections of the community, whose interests very seriously clash.  If I may say so.  I would think that my chances of getting to Heaven were increased rather than diminished by the introduction of this measure, but that is a matter of opinion.  Now to get down to the serious thing here.  This amendment simply means that if a person is going to take a house one of the first things he has to do is to examine into the financial condition of his landlord.  A house will be of a different value if you discover that your landlord has only another house.  Then you may be in a very bad position also, because you may take a house which you think will come under the Act because the landlord has got four houses.  But he promptly goes away and sells two, and you are completely done.  I, personally, do not think, apart from considerations even of that nature, that you can have a law differentiating between persons according to the length of their purse.</P>

In this Bill there is an attempt made to define the expression &ldquo;good and sufficient reason&rdquo; by sub-section (2), but it is not at all clear whether that ruling of the court that I referred to is now excluded or not.  If it were here we might have a word or two to say upon that subject.

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the court decides under paragraphs (a) or (b) of the foregoing sub-section that a tenant is not entitled to a new tenancy and the landlord fails to commence the pulling down and rebuilding or reconstruction of the buildings or the carrying out of the scheme of development within six months of the date of the order of the court, such tenant shall be deemed to be the tenant of such tenement and entitled to all the rights of a tenant under this Act, without regard to any compensation which may have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment 52 is to provide some limit of time in which the rebuilding and reconstruction <Col N="648" /> of the dwellings or the building as mentioned in the paragraph will be commenced.  In a subsequent amendment standing in my name, certain penalties are provided in the event of failure to carry out the rebuilding or reconstruction.  The big fault of the section as it stands is that there is no penalty whatever provided, and a tenant might be deprived of a new tenancy on the grounds that a landlord was able successfully to contend in court that he intended to pull down or reconstruct the dwellings even though he subsequently failed to carry out such pulling down, or reconstructing or rebuilding, as he had undertaken to do when before the court.</P>
      <P>I realise there are many loopholes in my amendment and that it is not water-tight.  The size of the operation which may be described as the commencement of the pulling down and the rebuilding would be a matter of considerable doubt, but I do think that there should be some provision here inserted to insure that a landlord who deprived a tenant of the right of a new tenancy on the ground that he intended to rebuild or reconstruct should commence and be compelled to rebuild or reconstruct within a definite time, failure in which would restore to the tenant his original right of a new tenancy as otherwise guaranteed under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment 53 proposed to insert a similar provision in respect of paragraph 3, which relates to the carrying out of a scheme of penalties and to provide that if the landlord deprives a tenant of a new tenancy on the grounds that he is carrying out a scheme of improvement on the property he should be under an obligation to commence that scheme in a period of six months, and that failure to do so would restore the tenant to his right to a new tenancy.  Amendment 54 provides that where the court has decided the tenant is not entitled to a new tenancy under paragraph (a) or (b) on the ground that the landlord intends to carry out reconstruction or rebuilding or a scheme of development, if the landlord fails to commence his rebuilding scheme in six months the <Col N="649" /> tenant would be deemed to be the tenant of the tenement and would be entitled to all rights under the Act regardless of whether compensation for improvements or disturbance had been paid.  The Minister may criticise the particular proposals I am making.  I realise they are not perfect.  I found it extremely difficult to draft an amendment embodying my ideas, but I think that there should be inserted in the Bill some safeguard of this nature to prevent tenants being deprived of their rights either by fraudulent misrepresentation to the court or representations that ultimately were departed from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Lemass has said.  His particular amendments, however, do not commend themselves to me, because I think the landlord might require possession of a premises for the purposes of a genuine reconstruction scheme and that he may get possession of this house to-day and possibly may not be able to get possession of the neighbouring house for another year.</P>
      <P>He cannot really start a reconstruction scheme economically until such time as he would be prepared to carry out the whole scheme together.  To put a time limit, irrespective of what the circumstances might be, would, I think, be practically impossible.  So far as the two first amendments are concerned, namely, 52 and 53, I will undertake to bring in, on Report, some amendments which, in my view, would be workable.  They would probably be on the lines that a court would fix a definite period and that the work would have to be carried out within that period.  The other question, as to what the remedy would be, is a very doubtful one, because if the landlord were given two years to carry out something and did not do it, the tenant, having been declared to be the tenant, would have to pay over the whole year for what he did not enjoy at all.  The tenant, in all probability, in the meantime would have made other arrangements and gone elsewhere.  I will bring forward amendments on the lines I have indicated on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 55 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where it appears to the court that it is equitable and practicable that the tenant of a tenement who is held not to be entitled to a new tenancy on the ground that the landlord bona-fide intends to reconstruct the buildings, should receive a tenancy in such reconstructed buildings, the court, in lieu of compensation under the next following sub-section may order the granting of such tenancy on such terms as in the opinion of the court, justice may require.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to deal with the case of a tenant who is held not to be entitled to a new tenancy on the ground that the landlord, bona fide, intends to reconstruct the building. It is intended in this amendment to provide, where it is practicable and where the court thinks it is equitable to do so, that the tenant should be given the right to a tenancy in the reconstructed building.  In a number of cases it will not be practicable to do that.  A shop may be reconstructed into two, or two shops may be reconstructed into one, but where reconstruction is of such a nature that the reconstructed building would be suitable to the same business as carried on before, and where the building is one which the tenant would like to occupy, we think that he should have a right, in lieu of compensation for disturbance, to a tenancy of the building when reconstructed, if he desires.  If he finds that the building on reconstruction was unsuitable to his business, or for any other reason that he cannot occupy it, he could take the alternative of compensation for disturbance.  We think that he should be given the right of exchanging compensation for disturbance for the right of a tenancy.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment. <Col N="651" /> I think that when the landlord, bona fide, for the purposes of the development of a district, decides to change the character of the buildings there, and where he himself prefers to pay the very substantial sum which he would have to pay to the tenant of a business premises when he is removed should be given a free hand as to how he is to reconstruct.  If the landlord and tenant come to agreement, well and good, but I think if he is going to the expense of improving the whole place he should be given a completely free hand as to how he is going to deal with the reconstructed premises.  In practice, I do not think that the amendment would work, because if the landlord and tenant wished to resume their business in the newly-constructed premises and if they are suitable, they would, of course, come to an agreement, but if the landlord does not want the tenant he would probably change the character of the newly-constructed building in order to keep the tenant out.  When the landlord is bona fide improving the neighbourhood I think that the tenant should be satisfied with compensation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 56 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The amount of compensation payable under this section shall be a charge on the estate or interest of the landlord in the tenement in priority to all other charges, mortgages, or encumbrances thereon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the amount of compensation payable under the section shall be a charge on the estate, or interest of the landlord in the tenement, in priority to all other charges, mortgages or encumbrances thereon.  Although I realise that there is a considerable difference between the circumstances under which compensation is payable under this Part of the Bill and that payable under Part II, I think there is a case for this amendment.  It is possible that the landlord would have mortgaged his interest in the premises <Col N="652" /> and would be otherwise without resources and that the tenant, who has been deprived of the right of a new tenancy and awarded compensation for disturbance, might not be able to collect that compensation.  The proposal is to make the compensation a charge against the tenement instead of a personal charge against the landlord. That secures for the tenant the certainty of the payment of compensation, if it is awarded.  The circumstances under which it is awarded, under this Part of the Bill, are, we must bear in mind, that the tenant's business, to which he devoted his energy and in which he created substantial good-will, has been taken from him.  He can suffer considerable loss, even his whole life's work, and there is no doubt that he should get whatever compensation the court awards him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  Amendment No. 11 stood on quite a different footing because it referred to cases where the premises had been improved and then the mortgagees, or other persons interested in the premises, would get the increased security because the value of the premises had been increased by that amount.  Here, however, quite a different consideration arises.  It is proposed that the tenant is entitled, not for anything he had done to improve the premises, but to compensation for the loss of his good-will, which really is a thing which could not be assessed, as far as the improvement of the security which the mortgage has got, is concerned.  I admit that there will be hardship in certain cases, but it will probably be a very odd case in which a tenant will discover that though he has got a decree the man against whom he has got it is insolvent.  I am afraid that cases of that kind always have to occur.  It is only a question when a man becomes insolvent as to which class of person is to suffer.  If you are, unfortunately, run down by a motor car you may, in the circumstances, be fortunate enough to be run down by a person who is insured, or you may be unfortunate enough to be run down by a person who is not insured and who is not <Col N="653" /> worth a penny.  Sometimes you have writs against persons to recover damages which may not be worth the paper they are written on.  These things, however, will happen.  In this case, however, if people advance considerable sums of money on houses and are not guilty of negligence in any way and find themselves suddenly in altered financial circumstances, a thing which they could not possibly foresee, it would not be fair to adopt this method of recovery.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that the amendment of Deputy Lemass might be met in this way.  I think there is a good deal to be said in support of the general principle at the back of the amendment. That is, that a tenant who finds himself dispossessed in pursuance of the provisions of the section, might subsequently find that the landlord, against whom the order for compensation had been made, was not in a position to pay it.  I would suggest that sub-section 2 of the section might be amended, by providing that the court would have power to specify the time within which the compensation shall be paid, and that in the event of the compensation not being paid within the time specified, then the order excluding the tenant from the right to obtain a new tenancy under the general provisions of the Act would be inoperative and void.</P>

This is a case that I think practically will not arise, because the case in which it would become really a practical question would be a case in which the landlord is pulling down the premises for the purpose of rebuilding and reconstructing the property.  I do not think that you would ever find in practice that a landlord who is improving his property would be bankrupt. I think it is really a very theoretical question.  I will consider it, but I will not pledge myself to bring in an amendment.  I will consider what the Deputy has stated.</P>

If, as the Minister indicates, the landlord who contemplates rebuilding and reconstruction on a fairly large scale is genuine in his intention, and has at his command resources which will enable him to carry out that scheme, it is no hardship upon him to impose the condition that Deputy Finlay suggested &mdash;that it should be made a condition of his obtaining an order for vacant possession, that he should within such time as the court should consider reasonable&mdash;it could be left fairly flexible&mdash;pay or secure the compensation which has been adjudged to the tenant.  If he has these resources at his command, it will be really no burden on him, and it will give the tenant an easier night's rest if he knows that he has at least some slight measure of security for the money.</P>

      <P>In line 31, to delete the word &ldquo;direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section deals with the measure of compensation for disturbance and provides that the measure shall be the pecuniary loss, damage or expense which the tenant sustains as a direct consequence of his quitting the holding. It is not clear what is the exact consequence of the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; or what interpretation the court is likely to put on it.  If there is any doubt what the interpretation is to be, I do not think we should pass it, because it is quite possible that we might find, in respect of the Bill when it becomes an Act, as was found in respect of previous Acts, that the intention of the Oireachtas would be reversed by a judicial decision based upon faulty or ambiguous phrasing.  It is our view that the measure of compensation should be the loss, damage or expense which the tenant has suffered as a consequence, direct or indirect, of his having quitted the holding.  I would, of course, limit the phrase &ldquo;indirect.&rdquo; I would not put it in the Bill, but I think the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; should not be in the Bill either, because it narrows the meaning very much.  It might result in a very restricted interpretation which would involve hardships on tenants deprived of tenancies under this section or the previous section, and it might make it necessary for the Minister to acquire the bad habit of the Minister for Local Government and come along with another Bill to remove doubts.</P>

      <P>I think the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; is necessary and that what the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; means is a natural consequence of the removal. If you do not stick to the natural consequences, you would have, as the Deputy himself says, to go and inquire what was an indirect consequence, and the most far-fetched thing might be put forward as a consequence of the removal.  It is only the direct and immediate consequence for which the landlord should be liable.  For instance, suppose a man came forward after being removed from a house and <Col N="656" /> that the measure of compensation was to be an indirect consequence of his loss, he might say: &ldquo;Oh, I went into another house and the house was damp.  My wife got a cold and I had to pay £40 in doctors' bills,&rdquo; or something of that kind.  That would be, in a way, a consequence of his moving, but obviously not a direct consequence of his moving.  If you take an indirect consequence, it would be a subject of compensation.</P>

      <P>It is perfectly obvious that an indirect consequence of that nature is not what we contemplate as being the measure. You have to put in the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; in order that these claims should not be brought forward.  I have mentioned only one case, but there might be many other similar cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will the Minister, on reconsideration, repeat or endorse some of the statements that have fallen from him now?  Will the Minister deny that the law, as it stands, excludes remote damage or remote compensation of the kind that the Minister indicated as necessary to be excluded?  The law already excludes that, and it surely does without the use of the word &ldquo;direct,&rdquo; whereas if you introduce the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; to the statute the court must seek to give some meaning and effect to it. The court must assume that this Legislature did not lightly put in the word there, and the court must give it a limiting effect.</P>
      <P>The effect of the word &ldquo;direct,&rdquo; if left there, is that compensation which, according to the ordinary rules of the law for the ascertainment of damage or the ascertainment of compensation, is to be cut down owing to the effort that the court must necessarily make to give some meaning and force to the word.  Subject to correction by the Minister, I suggest that the law of the land already excludes remote damages and remote compensation such as would be unfitting to be paid.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the measure of damages <Col N="657" /> in an action for tort is the natural and probable consequences of the result. If it were not the result of probable consequences then the damage is too remote.  I do not know that in a section of this nature precisely the same principles of interpretation would apply.  I think it is safer to have the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; inserted in order to make it plain that it is to be the natural and probable consequences.</P>

      <P>This is an entirely new definition, and is largely borrowed from the definition in the <Col N="658" /> Report of the Town Tenants Commission. It makes the measure of damages for compensation far and away wider than the old measure of damages.  If the Deputy reads the Report of the Commission he will see that the Commission expressed the view that one of the failures of the old Act was that the measure of damages awarded by the court was too narrow, and that adequate compensation was not given.  To counteract that, it was suggested that an amendment of the law should be made and that damages should be measured according to this definition practically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the definition of the Town Tenants Commission at all.  The Minister on previous amendments has taken shelter behind the recommendations of the Commission. The Commission did not recommend the word &ldquo;direct.&rdquo;  The Minister is inserting that word himself.  In paragraph 16 the Commission recommend that the compensation should be for the loss, damage or expense which the tenant sustains or incurs or will sustain and incur by reason of quitting the holding.  That is a different definition from what the Minister proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 59:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (2) the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(d) where the tenancy is deemed by this Act to terminate immediately after the passing of this Act, within one month after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the amendment arises because under sub-section (2) of the section notice to claim relief shall be served in the case of a tenancy terminated by notice to quit by not more than one month after the service of such notice; in the case of a tenancy terminated by the expiration of a term of years, not less than three months before the termination of the tenancy, and in the case of a tenancy terminated by the fall of a life on that event happening.  There is no provision made for the case of the person added to the Bill by a previous amendment who holds on under the provisions of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Act. The term in this amendment is within one month after the passing of the Act. I would like to have the views of the House on that period, because since the amendment was drafted it has occurred to me that possibly the term one month is too short.  I fancy that the provisions of this Act will become fairly widely known, but they may not be known to everybody in the country who might like to take advantage of <Col N="661" /> them, and in consequence I am rather inclined to alter the period of one month to six months.  It is my intention to bring in a further amendment to make that alteration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between this sub-section and the other rather similar subsections to which the Deputy is referring. These will be Section 28 (5) and also Section 44 (5).  There is this difference, that under Section 24 (5) <Col N="665" /> it is obligatory upon the Court to refer to the Valuation Office, whereas under the other two sections it is only &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;if so requested shall.&rdquo; That makes, I think, a considerable difference between this and the other amendments here.  The Valuation Office is brought in as a matter of necessity.  Their report is to be binding.</P>
      <P>In other words, the real thing is that we want to keep all appeals to the Court as limited as we possibly can.  If the parties on this question of valuation and improvement come to the conclusion that unless there has been some very great mistake made by the Valuation Department, they will simply take the Valuation Department as being final, it will save a tremendous amount of going to the Courts.  That is the reason why we have made it so much more definite here than elsewhere.  Claims under this improvement section of the Bill or this part of the Bill dealing with improvements will be more numerous than any other claims, and both in the interests of the parties themselves that they may not have to spend very large sums in litigation, and also, to a lesser extent that the Courts may not be clogged by a huge amount of litigation, it is desirable that the Valuation Commissioners' report should be made as nearly binding as possible upon the parties.  That is the reason why we made the differentiation between this and other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. All the same I do not think that the Minister is correct in saying that the use of these words &ldquo;be bound by&rdquo; is necessary to avoid this litigation. Some loophole may remain.  So far as the decision of the Valuation Department is concerned the insertion of the words &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; would leave it just as before.  It is more the form of the words, taking out of the Court its decision, and saying in effect that the valuator is to be the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister might use the same words as are used in other subsections to which reference has been made.  If there is any mistake in law or in fact, then you can make use of <Col N="666" /> the loophole left by the words &ldquo;have regard to.&rdquo;  When coming to a decision, the Court, in fixing the amount of the compensation for improvements, would have regard to the figures given by the valuator.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5), line 61, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;and the several estimates and statements submitted by any interested parties: Provided that in no case shall the compensation awarded by the court exceed the amount expended by the tenant upon the improvements in respect of which compensation is claimed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will admit that this is a fair and necessary proviso.  It simply puts in specifically that the tenant is not to recover more for compensation for improvements than the actual amount he has expended.  I do not think anybody would suggest that the tenant ought to make a profit out of these improvements.  If the major limit of compensation awarded is the actual sum that he has expended, he cannot complain that he is being treated unfairly.</P>

      <P>Why should there be any limitation?  Is not the tenant entitled to compensation for the increased letting value?  Why should the landlord and not the tenant get the benefit of the improvements?  If the landlord has to pay the increased <Col N="667" /> letting value consequent upon the tenant's improvements, he is not subjected to any hardship and the tenant is merely getting what he is entitled to get.  We must take into account the cost of building and how the value of money fluctuates.  The tenant who effected improvements in 1913, which increased the letting value of the premises, might find the amount of compensation to-day would be a very poor return for what he expended in 1913, even though the actual amount is the same, measured in cash.  The main point is that there is an increased letting value now if the tenant vacates, and there is a considerable difference in regard to the money value now as compared with 1913.</P>

      <P>That argument lost its value and met with very little success when it was urged in the interest of the landlord.  The very same case as the Deputy has now submitted might just as well apply to the landlord, who has to meet the fluctuations in the money market just as well as the tenant.  Surely Deputy Lemass does not suggest it is just that the tenant should be allowed to make a profit out of what does not belong to him?  He expends money on repairs. All this proviso suggests is that at most he should not get more than he has actually expended.  If that is not accepted, then something unfair is being sought.  The suggestion is that the tenant should get back all his money; he would have the advantage of the improvements during the time he was in occupation and he would not lose a penny.  I do not think that that could be considered fair.</P>

      <P>I think the increased letting value is the test that you must take, and, just as I thought the amount which the tenant had expended should not be the measure of damages, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out when I opposed the amendment proposed by him a few days ago, I equally think that what he receives in compensation should not be limited to the actual amount which he has expended. Look at it from the landlord's point of view.  He gets a certain increased letting value, and that is what he has to pay for.  It really does not matter twopence to the landlord what it cost the tenant.  The tenant may have done the work very expeditiously and cheaply, and may get actually more than he has paid, but I think that is very unlikely.  The tenant will in most cases get less than he has expended, because he will have enjoyed, for a considerable period of time in most instances, the improvements which he has made.</P>
      <P>Look at it from another point of view.  Suppose this was an improvement which would add very considerably to the letting value of the premises; in other words, the tenant thinks that by making this improvement he is adding very considerably to the letting value of the house and is making a very good investment of his money.  Under this Bill it is always open to the landlord to come in and say: &ldquo;I will make those improvements myself.&rdquo;  He may think that here is an improvement, the cost of making which will be comparatively small, while the resultant advantage to the property will be very large.  In that case he may decide to carry out the improvements himself.  He always has got his option.  I do not think I could accept the proposal now submitted.</P>

If he has not the capital and cannot carry out the improvements, he is very fortunate to have a tenant who has the necessary <Col N="669" /> capital and who will improve his premises for him.  I do not think he can complain if he is not in a position to improve the premises and he has a tenant who is prepared to improve them.  I do not think he can complain if the tenant adds to the letting value of the premises.</P>

      <P>I have given considerable thought to this amendment of Deputy O'Connell's, because it is perfectly plain to me that a practical minimum would be a very great advantage to the landlord, and it is not as plain to me that it might be of equal advantage to the tenant.  If a landlord is going to have a fair rent fixed in respect of these premises, it is obviously very much to his advantage that the term should be long rather than it should be short, that he would have a tenant there fixed for a very considerable time, and my difficulty is rather that from the tenant's point of view, if there is a minimum fixed, though the tenant may say &ldquo;I do not want it for this length of time,&rdquo; the landlord will come along and say you will have to take it for that length of time.  You will probably find when the duration of a term is being fixed in Court that the tenant is more often anxious not to be burdened with the house for a tremendously long term rather than that the landlord is not anxious to have his house let for a very long term.  It may be that the tenant may consent to the term being less than fifty years.  Unless he so consented, it must be, but it does not say, and I do not think it can be fairly made to say, that it shall be only such term as the tenant wishes.  I am inclined to accept, subject to an alteration, this amendment.  I do so with just some little hesitation; it may work <Col N="674" /> out a little bit hard on tenants in practice.</P>

There are two people who would have to be considered.  As I say I am willing to accept this, but it can only be that the duration of a new tenancy, without the consent of the tenant, shall not be less than fifty years; possibly on rare occasions the landlord may force the term on him.</P>

      <P>We can discuss on 70 the general definition of fair rent.  I move amendment 70, &ldquo;to delete paragraph (e).&rdquo;  This section again raises one of the main principles of the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to paragraphs (f) and (g), the question of whether or not that is a fair basis upon which to calculate the rent to be paid by a tenant who is deemed by the Dáil to have a statutory right to a new tenancy is the issue before us.  It is proposed that a tenant who has been in occupation of a dwelling-house for forty years, or who has been in occupation of a business house and established a goodwill in the business in that house for three years, or who has doubled the letting value of the dwelling in consequence of his own improvements, should be given a new tenancy only on this condition, that he would agree to pay the landlord the rent which that landlord would get on the basis of taking possession in the circumstances of normal competition&mdash;in other words, the full competitive rent of the dwelling or shop, as the case may be.  Is it fair that such a tenant, possessing such an equity to a new tenancy, should be required to pay the full competitive rent, and, if not, what rent should he be asked to pay?  There are various proposals on the Paper before us. There is a proposal in the name of Deputy O'Connell that if the building was let in 1914 the rent payable should be the rent actually paid in that year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's amendment is: &ldquo;In respect to houses built prior to the 4th of August, 1914, shall not be more than the rent permitted by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, and in respect to houses built after the 4th of August, 1914.&rdquo;  There are other proposals in the name of Deputy Byrne, and there is an amendment to this definition in the name of the Minister. We considered this question most carefully. We were attracted originally by the proposal which Deputy O'Connell is submitting, that is, in respect of houses which were let on the 4th of August, 1914, the rent should be the rent now permitted under the Increase of Rent Act.  The big difficulty in that connection is, however, in the first place it omits from the scope of the Bill a large number of houses which have been constructed since the 4th of August, 1914, and, secondly, that this Bill, unlike the Increase of Rent Act, is a permanent measure, and it seems very undesirable to have the circumstances of 1914 as a standard in a Bill which may be in operation in ten or twenty years' time in circumstances that we cannot possibly foresee.  The view which we took was that some method of computation of the rent should be arrived at which would be easily operated and applicable in all circumstances.  We could say that the rent to be reserved under the new tenancy should not exceed the rent to be reserved under the old tenancy. But that also would leave out of account certain important factors.  The letting value of the tenancy might have gone down considerably, or, alternatively, it might have gone up in consequence of action by the tenant, by the landlord, or by the local authority.  In the majority of cases which are likely to arise in the immediate future, it will be found that the rent as defined in paragraph (f) of this section is likely to exceed the rent reserved under the old tenancy, particularly, of course, if that old rent be regulated by the Increase of Rent Acts.  The question is whether the difference between the new increased letting value and the old rent should go to the tenant or to the landlord. We may say that the rent shall be the <Col N="677" /> rent under the Increase of Rent Act or under any circumstances shall be the old rent.  In fact, we are giving to the tenant the full benefit of the increase in the letting value that has taken place.</P>

        <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.]</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on the other hand, we say, as the Minister proposes we should say, that the landlord is entitled to get the full competitive rent of the building, we mean that the full benefit of that increased letting value is to go to the landlord as against the tenant.  The proposal which we are submitting to the Dáil is in the nature of a compromise, a proposal that in effect the difference should be divided between the landlord and the tenant.  That difference may, as I have said, be due neither to the action of the landlord nor the tenant.  It may be due to a variety of causes, not the least of which might be the expenditure and enterprise of the local authority in the area.  If there were a local council which carried out considerable improvement schemes in the neighbourhood of the dwelling, which installed a water supply, sewerage and other services of that kind, the increase in the letting value of the dwelling should properly go to the persons who paid for those improvements&mdash;that is the ratepayers in the area.  We considered very carefully whether it could not be possible to devise some means by which that increased letting value could be secured for the ratepayers, but we found ourselves up against considerable difficulties, difficulties in which any Party in opposition must find themselves when attempting to frame intricate amendments to a Bill of this kind.  We could not do it.  So we arrive at this proposal&mdash;that the increase in the letting value should be divided as between the landlord and the tenant in the proportion of fifty-fifty. Where it is found that the gross rent, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f), exceeds the old rent, then the rent to be reserved under the new tenancy shall not be in excess of the old rent by more than half the difference between <Col N="678" /> the gross rent as calculated in accordance with paragraph (f) and the old rent.  On the other hand, where it is found that the gross rent, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (f), is less than the old rent, we propose that the new rent should be the rent as it is calculated.  There is another proposal to split the difference. In that case, when the letting value of the premises has decreased, we do not propose that the tenant should be asked to pay more than its letting value.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>A new precedent is, apparently, being set up in preventing a Bill going to its Second Reading when the principle of it can be discussed.  If that means that the Government are going to contest the right that the Opposition have to get Bills discussed, two can play at that game.  What is the object of allowing even the limited amount of Private Members' time that is allowed when a Bill of this kind, which is of first-class importance to the farming community, is to be thrown <Col N="679" /> out without discussion?  Private interests of all kinds can have Bills brought in here to protect their interests and the Government provide time for them, but when a Bill in the interests of the farming community is brought in it is immediately opposed and not allowed to be discussed even. I consider that the objection of the Parliamentary Secretary to the introduction of the Bill is a deliberate attack on the rights of private members. The Bill has the support of the members of the Opposition Party in this House, and I think that it should have the support of every farmer in the House.  It has been brought in at the instance, as I hope to prove, of farmers' organisations all over the country, Farmer Deputies were looking for this amendment of the Land Acts in 1923, when Deputy Gorey introduced an amendment on these lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out the position of affairs in regard to the Bill.  The Bill introduced in 1923 was definitely meant to cover the whole question.  Farmers at that time were satisfied, or apparently were bluffed into being satisfied, with an amendment put in by Deputy Hennessy to Section 22 (3) &ldquo;save that any question as to whether an agreement for an abated rent was, in fact, an agreement for a new rent or any question as to the amount from which the deduction of 25 per cent. is to be made in ascertaining compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent shall be determined by the Judicial Commissioner, whose decision shall be final.&rdquo; That was the amendment introduced by Deputy Hennessy to cover this.  It was taken as against an amendment moved by Deputy Gorey.  Unfortunately what is happening is a very extraordinary state of affairs altogether. The enormous legal costs involved precludes the unfortunate tenants from bringing these cases before any court or having them tried by any court, and that is an injustice <Col N="680" /> which should be remedied.  I hope to show the House that the benefits supposed to be granted by this clause in the 1923 Act were not granted.  Instead of getting any advantage that the abatement of rent entitled them to, they are not going to get any reduction once they are vested.  They have to pay more when they are vested than they are paying at present under decisions of the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I have before me a decision given by Mr. Justice Wylie on 16th July, 1924. This definite clause in the Bill states that any question as to whether an agreement for an abated rent was, in fact, an agreement for a new rent, or any question as to the amount from which the deduction of 25 per cent is to be made, is to be determined by the Judicial Commissioner.  The Judicial Commissioner is to determine whether the abatement was an abatement for a new rent or not, or merely a temporary abatement.  That was the question to be decided by the Judicial Commissioner. This was the decision given: &ldquo;That for the purposes of compounded arrears of rent and interest in lieu of rent the abated rent shall be the basis, but for the purpose of fixing the standard purchase annuity the old unabated rent shall stand.&rdquo;  That is the decision given by Mr. Justice Wylie on 16th July, 1924.  Under that decision we will take one definite case where the old rent the tenant was paying was £20.  He got an abatement of 40 per cent., reducing it to £12.  Mr. Justice Wylie's decision stated that for the purpose of compounded arrears of rent and interest in lieu of rent, that is, from 1923 until such time as the land would be vested, the rent would be further reduced to £9, but on vesting the tenant would have to go back and pay £13.  That is one of the decisions given by the Judicial Commissioner. That means that the tenant would be paying £1 more per year rent for his land than he was paying in 1920 or 1921 when he would be vested, and he would be paying £4 per year more for his land than he is paying at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had statements made here some time ago when the 1931 Land Act was brought in.  On 11th March the Parliamentary <Col N="681" /> Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Roddy) made the following statement in this House: &ldquo;It is quite possible that an agile lawyer might make it appear that the wording of the present section of the Act of 1929 would not mean what it was undoubtedly intended to mean.&rdquo; I hold that that is what has happened in respect of the amendment inserted in the 1923 Act for the benefit of the tenants&mdash;that an agile gentleman has given decisions which completely override the intentions of this Dáil.  I should like to quote in respect to that a statement made here by the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a question of mine, as reported in Volume 28 of the Official Debates. Col. 760.  This was my statement on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My case is that a large number of tenants in my district, in which are included about five estates, had a voluntary reduction from the landlord on their judicial rents of 35 per cent.  Under the 1923 Land Act these tenants were compelled to purchase, and had to accept 25 per cent. reduction instead of the 35 per cent.  I can give receipts proving this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is sheer nonsense.  The 25 per cent. is based on the abated rent the tenant was paying at the passing of the 1923 Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark these words.  My Bill is only seeking to carry out what the Parliamentary Secretary evidently thought was incorporated in the Act of 1923. The Parliamentary Secretary has definitely stated that the abated rent the tenant was paying at the passing of the 1923 Act was to be the basis of purchase.  Now, as you will see by this decision of Mr. Justice Wylie, given on 16th July, 1924, he has absolutely over-ridden what were the intentions of the Dáil in that matter. The Parliamentary Secretary neither knew the 1923 Act nor the decisions given by the Judicial Commissioner in this case.  If he did he would not have made that statement.  What was the interpretation put by the Judicial Commissioner on Section 22 of the Act <Col N="682" /> of 1923 when he gave that decision? We are now in the position that whatever chance a tenant had of getting an allowance on his abated rent before vesting, he is going to get no chance after vesting&mdash;he will have to pay more.  The decision is that for 68½ years the tenant will have to pay £4 a year more than he is paying at present, or 65 per cent. increase in his rent for the next 68½ years.</P>
    <P>I consider this a scandalous procedure. If the landlord is not getting an advantage before vesting, why should he get it after vesting?  Still that is the result of one of the decisions. Does anyone contend that the present depressed condition of the farmers should not be taken into account?  What is our position?  The tenant has, in the first place, his right to object.  The landlord's list is taken. The tenant has to go to the whole expense.  He has to object to the returns given by the landlord.  Then the case is brought before the Land Commission Court.  The tenant has to go to the expense of attending, of bringing up his witnesses, of briefing counsel and all the rest.  Then the case is tried by the Land Commission Court. The Land Commission Court gives a unanimous decision by its three Commissioners in favour of the tenant. The landlord then appeals to the last Court of Appeal in this country, as between landlord and tenant, namely, the Judicial Commissioner, and the Judicial Commissioner gives his decision in favour of the landlord, and the tenant finds himself put to very considerable expense, and, notwithstanding the intentions of this Dáil, which they had put into the 1923 Act, the tenant finds himself with a load of expense heaped upon his shoulders and no satisfaction whatever to get.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which the Parliamentary Secretary refuses to allow discussion upon, would remedy that.  I consider that a scandalous procedure, and I consider that the rights of private members are absolutely over-ridden. In order to keep this functionary, the Judicial Commissioner here, this last appeal and last word between landlord and tenant, and in order to secure that the intentions of this Dáil <Col N="683" /> should be completely over-ridden by that court, discussion here is stifled. I consider that is procedure that should not be allowed in this Dáil.  We might be told&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have receipts here marked &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; going back 34 long years.  I have receipts here showing <Col N="684" /> temporary abatements from 1887, and the same temporary abatements are continued up to 20th May, 1921.

      <P>Temporary special abatements, if you like.  But in spite of all these temporary abatements, we have the decision of this House, and the Acts passed through this House set aside not by agile lawyers, but by wily judges.  That is a position of affairs that I think should not be allowed.  I appeal to this House to end here to-night in the only way it can be ended this state of affairs by passing the First Reading of this Bill, and of at least giving the House an opportunity of discussing the Bill afterwards.</P>
      <P>That is the only appeal I make.  If there are any sections in the Bill afterwards which the Parliamentary Secretary may wish to amend, he can amend them.  I make that appeal to the House not to put the fate of these unfortunate tenants in the hands of this Court of Appeal which, in the words of an unfortunate tenant who happened to be in that place last week was like going to law with the devil in the court of hell.  I think he gave a very straight and honest opinion, which is the opinion of the farmers throughout the country of this Judicial Commissioner's Court which has been set up.  As the last word for the tenants, I appeal to Deputies here to consider that nine-tenths, nay more, ninety-nine out of every hundred landlords that come before that court are members of the Masonic Order and the Judge is another.  I ask you to consider that and do what you like afterwards.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in the course of his statement, perhaps unconsciously, revealed the real reason for the introduction of this Bill.  A certain number of tenants, acting on the advice of Deputy Corry, brought a case before the Land Commission Court.  A certain decision was given. The case was appealed before the <Col N="685" /> Judicial Commissioner, and additional evidence was brought forward by the agent on behalf of the landlord.  The decision was adverse to the tenants in whom Deputy Corry is interested, and hence this Bill.</P>

      <P>If Deputies are to introduce Bills on every occasion on which an adverse decision is given in cases in which they are interested it is going to make a mockery of legislation, and reduce this Dáil to a farce.  The Deputy did not attempt to explain his Bill.  He has referred to a certain decision given, and rightly given, by the Judicial Commissioner under the Act of 1923 and the succeeding Land Acts.</P>
      <P>I will just explain briefly what this Bill means.  It seeks to make agreements between landlord and tenant for temporary abatement of rent to operate as agreements for permanent reductions, upon which figure the reduced purchase money of the holding is to be calculated.  The Bill is wide enough in its scope to cover every type of abatement and every type of agreement entered into between landlord and tenant.  Take the case of a benevolent landlord&mdash;after all, there were many benevolent landlords or, at least, landlords who acted in a benevolent way prior to the Land Act of 1923&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, take the case of such a landlord who, by reason of sickness in a tenant's household, loss of crops owing to bad season, or through an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or some other cause, gave an abatement of rent for that one season or one gale.  Such landlord will find the abatement by this Bill converted into a permanent reduction of rent.  I think that the injustice of that proposal is quite apparent and that it is unnecessary for me to labour it further. An agreement made some years ago is perfectly clear in its terms and <Col N="686" /> is perfectly understood by both parties to be intended to operate for a temporary period either for one gale or for one year, but by this Bill it is to be given the effect of a permanent abatement, an effect which was not contemplated as likely to result by either party to the agreement at the time.  The Bill would upset the whole basis of contract entered into by landlord and tenant on that occasion and in that sense it is entirely unjust.</P>
      <P>It was quite a customary thing, as Deputies are aware, for landlords to give temporary abatements for one reason or another.  As I say, they gave abatements for one year or for one gale but it was never intended and the tenants never expected that they would assume anything in the nature of a permanent character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill affects and causes injuries to parties who are not parties to these agreements.  The landlord in many cases, being only a tenant for life, had consequently no right to bind his successors by any agreement entered into with the tenant, but he had a right in law, as it then existed, to give abatement to tenants during his lifetime, but, as I say, he had no right to bind his successors.  Consequently those people who would be entitled to the rent or to their particular share of the purchase money&mdash;they may be mortgagees, trustees or others&mdash;would be naturally affected by an arrangement of that kind.  This Bill cuts at the very foundation of the Act of 1923.  Certain prices were then agreed on as to the purchase price of a holding.  Certain reductions on rent payable by the tenants were to be the standard purchase annuities.  It was on these rents that these reductions were to be calculated, and, in case of any obscurity or ambiguity as to what the rents were in fact, the court, as I have just said, had power to investigate and decide. They had power to call witnesses, to examine documents, to examine the nature of the contract entered into between the landlord and the tenant, on the occasion of the agreement for the reduction of the rent.  They had a right to call evidence, to hear evidence in court, to investigate fully the facts of the case, and having investigated <Col N="687" /> fully the facts of the case, a decision was given.  The Bill, however, seeks to enact that the purchase prices are to be calculated not on the rents, for everybody must admit that temporary abatements are not rents, but on the annual payment which the landlord for a special reason may have agreed to accept for a specially limited period.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say anything further on this Bill.  There is in the present land code ample provision to ascertain what the intention and the effect of the agreement made between landlords and tenants were and to carry out such intentions.  The only use that can be made of the Bill is to enact that agreements shall have an effect quite different from that intended by the parties, both by the tenants and the landlords when the agreements were drawn up. The Bill, in my opinion, is ridiculous, it is absurd, and it is quite unnecessary, because within the scope of the present land code, the Land Commission has ample power to deal with cases of dispute between landlord and tenant.  In the Land Courts every day of the week such cases are heard, and the tenants are thoroughly satisfied with the manner in which the cases are decided.  I might further add that a big number of cases have been dealt with in the Land Commission Courts and, in the overwhelming majority of these cases <Col N="688" /> the decisions have been in the tenants' favour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question. On the 28th February, 1929, I asked him a question, and when I pointed out that the landlord had returned the old rent as the rent, the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;That is sheer nonsense. The twenty-five per cent. is based on the abated rent the tenant was paying at the passing of the 1923 Act.&rdquo;  When he made that statement to me, and when that decision was upheld by three of his Land Commissioners with several years' experience, who tried it in the Court of the Land Commission, it was rather strange that Mr. Justice Wylie upset it.  Does he now absolutely draw back?  The present Bill is based on the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary as to what the intentions of the 1923 Land Act were.  Does he deny that the Bill is based on his statement, that I am not going beyond his statement in the Bill?  That is the point at issue. If I find out that he is going to give way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is a Bill to safeguard and develop the potato trade that has grown to considerable dimensions in this country since the year 1922.  Up to that year we were importing seed potatoes.  The present position is that our imports of seed potatoes are extremely small.  They are only of rare varieties, not produced or raised here, whereas we have developed quite a considerable export trade.  The export of seed potatoes has grown from 81 tons in 1924 to 1,419 tons in 1930, while in the same period the import of seed potatoes has shrunk from 1,830 tons in 1924 to about 580 tons in 1930.  This Bill deals not only with seed potatoes, but with ware potatoes.  The seed potato trade, in the nature of things, never reached anything like huge dimensions, but at the same time it is very valuable.  It is essentially a trade for small holdings, on which family labour is used and absorbed to a great extent. There is no doubt whatever that we should do everything in our power to develop the production of seed potatoes in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, however, deals not only with seed potatoes, but with ware potatoes.  The purpose of the Bill is to control the grading and packing and, generally, the export of both ware and seed potatoes.  The Bill is divided into six parts.  Part 2 provides that every premises in the country, from which either seed or ware potatoes are exported, shall be registered, and that every exporter shall be licensed.  It also provides the fees to be paid by exporters.  There are really three sorts of licences, including two main classes.  There is <Col N="691" /> the exporter's general licence and the exporter's (grower's) licence.  An exporter's general licence, as the name implies, applies to any exporter who for trade purposes exports potatoes, whereas the other licence is confined to growers.</P>
    <P>So far as the growers are concerned, licences will only be given on certain conditions, which are set out in Section 6.  Sub-section (3) of the section provides that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may grant a licence (in this Act referred to as an exporter's (grower's) licence) to export potatoes from particular registered premises to any person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) is the registered proprietor of such premises, and</P>
    <P>(b) is a grower of potatoes, and</P>
    <P>(c) was at any time before the commencement of this Act an exporter of potatoes grown by himself, and</P>
    <P>(d) applies in the prescribed form and manner....</P>
    <P>and so on.  There are certain conditions attached to the exporter's (grower's) licence.  The most important of them are found in paragraph (c) (ii), sub-section (5) of Section 6:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(ii) That the holder thereof of the grower's licence shall not export thereunder in any one calendar year more than one hundred tons of potatoes.</P>
    <P>I may say there are very few growers who export their own potatoes.  As there were a few, however, we thought it well to provide for them.  This Bill has been drafted in consultation with the principal growers; in fact, I think with practically all the growers who export.  The provisions set out have received the approval of these growers. The important provision is that the growers shall not export in any one calendar year more than one hundred tons of potatoes.  The point of that provision is to make sure that there shall be nothing in the way of fraud. If a grower holding an exporter's (grower's) licence, which costs far less than the other, could export potatoes <Col N="692" /> in unlimited quantities, it would be very difficult to control him.  It would be very difficult to make certain that he was exporting not only his own potatoes but the potatoes of other people.  The maximum provided here makes it quite certain that he is not doing an illegitimate trade of that sort.  It is no hardship on him because, as far as we know, no grower is likely to export anything like a hundred tons of potatoes per annum.</P>
    <P>I said there were three sorts of licences.  There is also a special licence provided to be used on special occasions in case any person wishes to export for any peculiar reason or for any reason peculiar to a particular consignment of one special lot of potatoes.  Sections 7, 8 and 9 deal with fees.  There is no fee on the registration of premises.  All premises are registered free.  The fees are paid on the issue of a licence to export to a grower for a grower's licence and to a general exporter for a general exporter's licence.  The fees for the general exporter's licence are set out in Section 7.  Sub-section (1) of the section provides that on every application for an exporter's general licence there shall be paid to the Minister by the applicant a fee of £2 10s. 0d., returnable to the applicant if his application be refused.  Sub-section (3) of the same section provides that in the event of the application being granted, that is to say, of the licence being issued, there shall be a further additional fee of £22 10s. 0d. paid.  Therefore, the initial fee for a general exporter's licence is £2 10s. and £22 10s., making a total of £25.  The application for the grower's licence is made in much the same way.  The fee amounts to £5. At first 10/- is paid down.  That is returnable if the application is not granted, while the balance, £4 10s., is paid if the application is granted.  The total is £5.</P>
    <P>These are the initial fees.  They have been discussed with the trade.  Speaking generally, the trade is in agreement with those fees.  Curiously enough, most of the representations made to the Department while we were drafting the Bill have been on the lines of increasing the fees.  That is under- <Col N="693" /> standable enough when one comes to consider it.  There are certain merchants doing an export trade in potatoes in this country.  Some of them do things well.  They are reliable and export their potatoes in a way that is a credit to themselves and the country. On the other hand, there are other merchants who are not quite up to that standard.  The general point of view, with which I personally agree and with which the Department agree, is that you could suffer perhaps more from too many exporters than from too few. We have deliberately, with the agreement of the trade, imposed a general fee in this Bill which will make it a somewhat serious consideration for a man to enter into the trade.  It is certainly big enough to ensure that a person who goes into the trade is fairly substantial, that he is in a position to provide suitable premises and the amount of equipment and plant necessary for the grading, packing and export of potatoes.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there will be objection made to that on the lines that this is tending towards monopoly. Of course, it is not.  We will have quite sufficient exporters in this country even under this regulation, and the competition between them will be ample.  A surplus of very small exporters does not bring about extra competition.  It merely increases the overhead expenses which the farmer has to pay, and, in fact, a very big surplus might result in the long run in lessening the amount which goes back to the farmer.  Ten good strong exporters will bring about far more efficient competition than a hundred small and inefficient exporters.  In addition to these fees there are annual fees provided in Section 9 which again deals with the case of the general exporters. It provides in paragraph (b) that the rate for ware potatoes shall be 6d.. and in the case of seed potatoes such fee &ldquo;as may be prescribed,&rdquo; not being more than 1/- per ton.  I may say that for any potatoes, except seed potatoes, these are the only fees that have to be paid for the export of potatoes from the premises of the registered proprietor</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) deals with the case <Col N="694" />&ldquo;where potatoes in such consignment are graded and packed in registered premises of which such exporter is not the registered proprietor, the rate shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if such potatoes (whether ware potatoes or seed potatoes) are submitted for examination at a railway station or a wharf, such rate (not exceeding one shilling for every ton) as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>(ii)  if such potatoes (whether ware potatoes or seed potatoes) are submitted for examination at any other place, such rate (not exceeding one shilling and sixpence for every ton) as may be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that there are a number of contingencies provided for. There is the case where the potatoes are graded, packed and inspected on the premises of the registered proprietor. In the case of an exporter of ware potatoes the rate is 6d., and in the case of seed potatoes not more than one shilling.  In a case where they are graded and packed on other premises, such as a wharf or railway station, the fee is not more than 1/- for both, but in a case where they are graded, packed, or exported on premises not being a railway station or wharf, the fee shall not be more than 1/6.  In Donegal especially there is a system amongst exporters of making arrangements that the grower shall not consign them to the exporter's premises but shall send them to the railway station.  It is in order to facilitate the trade that we make provision so that the potatoes shall be graded, packed and examined at the railway station or on the premises of the grower, even though he is not a registered grower.  Where we have to examine at the premises of the grower, or at a railway station, we have to charge more, because the expense of examination will be more.  If that system spread largely through the country it would mean that a very large number of inspectors would need to be employed in order to examine and check the potatoes, and also to deal with a larger number of premises. If we could have all the potatoes graded, packed and exported from the premises of registered exporters these <Col N="695" /> premises would not be so many, a small number of inspectors would do, and the expenses generally would be light.</P>
    <P>That would be a hardship on the growers, and we are providing that the grading, packing and inspection may take place, not only on the premises of the exporter but, if necessary, at the railway station or on the premises of a grower who may not have an exporter's licence.  When we do that we have to make the fee somewhat bigger.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with regulations as to the grading and packing of potatoes, the marking of packages and the conveyance of potatoes.  The provisions in Sections 18 and 19 speak for themselves and are the same as those in the Dairy Produce Act and the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act.  They make regulations as to the method of grading potatoes, the conditions of the potatoes, packing, etc.; that certain marks must be placed on the packages to indicate whether they are seed or ware potatoes, to indicate that they are a special variety, or that they come from black soil or alternatively red soil.  It provides penalties for placing unauthorised marks on the packages. Part 4 deals with the examination of consignments of potatoes.  Section 22 (1) provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any person who desires to sell as seed potatoes the whole or any part of a crop of potatoes grown by him may request the Minister to have such crop inspected while growing, and on such request being made the Minister may, if he thinks fit, cause such crop to be inspected by an inspector.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that our trade in seed potatoes is developing, and it is to control that trade that this part of the Bill is inserted.  This section deals with the first steps a grower of seed potatoes must take.  A grower of seed potatoes may apply to the Department to have the crop examined while it is growing.  It is inspected by an inspector and, if he passes it as pure, he issues a certificate to that effect. Anyone who holds that certificate may have his potatoes inspected later by an inspector of the Department, who <Col N="696" /> will examine each consignment and issue a certificate again to the grower, who will have the advantage then of selling potatoes in England certified as pure without rogues or foreign matter.  On the other hand, the fact that they have been examined by the inspector, not only when growing but afterwards in packages and actually sealed, will make it fairly certain that the consignee in England is getting exactly the goods described in the package.  Section 26 deals with the period of exemption:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister may from time to time by order declare that the period between the 1st day of June and the 31st day of August, both days inclusive, or such part of the said period as may be specified in such order, shall in such year or years as may be specified in such order be a time of exemption for the purposes of this Part of this Act, and whenever such an order is made and in force the period declared by such order to be a time of exemption for the purposes of this Part of this Act shall in every year specified in such order be a time of exemption for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>That enables us to specify three months as the time of exemption.  The point of that is that within that time of every year&mdash;other than new potatoes or odd lots of old potatoes, which are practically negligible&mdash;we do not want to have the trouble of controlling the export of small lots of new potatoes or small lots of old potatoes, sold as such, and hence we make that period or any smaller period the period of exemption during which the Act does not apply.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the export of potatoes and what is being done already, and provides certain exceptions in sub-section (6) which are rather important. This section shall not apply to any potatoes which are exported in one lot or consignment and do not exceed in weight five hundredweights. That is to say, anybody may export 5 cwt. anywhere he likes without conforming to any of these regulations. That is to facilitate people <Col N="697" /> who occasionally export small quantities. Sub-section (6) (c) (i) of Section 27 deals with potatoes exported into Northern Ireland, and provides that the Bill shall not apply to potatoes which are exported in one lot or consignment to Northern Ireland by the grower thereof in his own vehicle, and which do not, with the packages (if any) containing the same, exceed in weight one ton. That is so as not to interfere with the ordinary carrying of potatoes backward and forward over the Border. That provision is essential.  Otherwise farmers could not take potatoes from one market town to another.  Section 28 provides for special licences to export potatoes.</P>
    <P>These are, for the purposes of Second Reading, the main sections in the Bill.  I have only to add that this particular Bill is on the same lines as the Dairy Produce Act or the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, and it is to ensure that the growing trade which has been developed to a great extent by the efforts of the Department of Agriculture during the last five years shall not only be maintained but extended. Unfortunately, there are many cases where exporters and growers have not been as careful or as scrupulous as they might be.  I will not say that we have numerous cases, but we have too many cases where exporters export seed potatoes describing them as of one variety whereas they are not of that variety.  We have other cases where potatoes are exported and wrong weights are indicated.  Potatoes are exported in other cases with considerable quantities of clay attached to them.  Sharp practice of that sort take place.  That has always been a source of trouble in this country.  It is regarded as smart and clever.  In the past it did considerable harm, not only to the potato industry, but also to other agricultural produce.  The aim of this Bill is to bring potatoes in line with the butter and egg exports and to ensure that the reputation for growing first class seed and ware potatoes which have been won by the general run of farmers in the country shall not be filched from them by the mistake or by the deliberate wrong-doing of a certain number.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> This Bill will not cost a very big sum&mdash;not more than £3,000 or £4,000. Considerable sums will come in in fees, and it will not cost the country very much.  I have no doubt it will give good value.  The potato trade is an important trade.  It exists in the country and it does not need a subsidy. It is resting on its merits; it has always been here.  Potatoes vary in price from year to year.  In a good year you have big world supplies, and as a consequence small prices.  Two years ago you had good supplies and small prices, whereas immediately afterwards you had average crops and good prices.  These things are inevitable.</P>
    <P>I do not profess in this Bill to get better prices than the best prices in the market, but it is in order to enable us to get the best prices in the market that this Bill is introduced. The potato produced in this country is a crop which gives considerable labour, a crop that is very suitable to the small farmers and gives labour to the farmers' families.  It is being maintained and developed in the country without any subsidy or any of the artificial aids which are required for other crops that are more exotic.</P>
    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine from the speech just delivered by the Minister for Agriculture that we were asked here in this Bill to deal with the whole potato crop grown in this country, but, in fact, we are only asked to deal with an infinitesimal part of that crop.  When introducing this measure the Minister explained that the export of seed potatoes had gone up very much from 1922 to 1930.  But the amount exported even in the year 1930 is hardly worth speaking about. We have to go back to the year 1926 in order to have any idea of what the volume of potatoes exported is compared with the total volume of potatoes produced in this country. We find that in that year about 1.5 per cent. of the total potato crop was exported.  Now we are presented with a Bill here, containing over 20 pages and 37 sections, to deal with that small part of our potato crop. <Col N="699" /> It is, of course, true as the Minister said that the Bill is in line with the other Agricultural Produce Acts that were brought in here before.  But whatever might be said for the Dairy Produce Bill, or the Eggs Bill, surely there is not the same necessity for a Bill for this particular export and especially when we come to recognise that our imports of potatoes in this country are greater than our exports.  Seeing that we are not as a matter of fact supplying our own needs in potatoes one would imagine it would be more fitting for the Minister to bring in legislation here to see that we supply our own needs, to supply what we want for ourselves in our own towns before we talk about exports of potatoes which are so very small.  If we go back over the years since 1922 we will find that in every year except in the year 1927-28 our exports were smaller than our imports. In 1927-28 it looked as if we were going to develop an export trade in potatoes in this country, but in the two following years our production of potatoes evidently went down again and we had to import more than we exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is taking powers in this Bill which he has also taken in some other Bills.  I did not have time to look up the other Bills, but I am not sure if the Minister is not going a little further here.  Even if he is not I think it is hardly fair that the Department should be the sole judge as to whether people who export potatoes at present are to be allowed to continue to export them and whether the premises where the potatoes are allowed to be collected before being exported are fit and suitable premises for carrying on the trade.  I think it is hardly fair that the Minister's Department should be the sole judge as to whether these premises are fit for the grading and packing of potatoes.  In the Bill there is no appeal from the Minister's decision.  It is definitely stated in the Bill that if the Minister chooses to refuse a licence for premises and if, later on, there is a re-application for the licence for the same premises, he <Col N="700" /> may, without inspection, refuse the licence.  Such powers are dictatorial, and I think that the Minister will have on the Committee Stage to give good reasons why he should seek such drastic powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained what the fees are.  They vary from 6d. to 1/6 in most cases, and in special cases to 6/- per ton.  In addition, there is a fee paid for licensing in the case of the general exporter.  That licence is £25. In the case of the grower-exporter the licence is £5.  Taking all these fees together, it is reasonable to assume that there will be an average fee on the exportation of potatoes of about 1/- per ton.  That is rather high.  The Minister has said that the exporters themselves have asked that such a fee be fixed.  That may be.  Perhaps the Minister made a good case why some small exporters should be cut out and only the big ones allowed to remain. There is always a great danger when the number of people in any trade or business gets very small that there may be a ring formed, and there is a very great danger that the producer of the article may suffer.</P>
    <P>It would be very undesirable to have the number of exporters cut down; it would not be well to have too small a number.  Naturally, when they get a price for their produce from Great Britain or whatever country they export to the exporters will pass on the cost of inspection&mdash;one shilling per ton &mdash;to the producer, so that the producer will be getting one shilling per ton less for his produce.  There are regulations for the packing, marketing and transport of potatoes with which we can deal in more detail on the Committee Stage.  There are also regulations in regard to seed potatoes.  There is one thing which is as important, if not more important, than the export of potatoes, and that is the import of new potatoes.  New potatoes are imported here some two months before the new potatoes can be produced at home.  It is the practice in Dublin and, I expect, in other cities and towns in the Free State, that from some time towards the end of April to the middle of June it is possible to get imported new potatoes in practically all the hotels.  That <Col N="701" /> deprives home-growers of new potatoes from getting a good price, because by the time the home-grown produce can be put on the market the price of imported new potatoes has gone down to such an extent that for the last few years people in the trade have told me &mdash;I do not know if it is the experience of other Deputies&mdash;that it does not pay any longer to cultivate new potatoes in this country.</P>
    <P>We are paying a very big price for imported new potatoes.  I am sure it would be justifiable, from the point of view of our own producers, to prohibit the importation of those potatoes. Those people who have a craving for new potatoes should be made wait until June for the home produce, and I believe they will like them just as well as the potatoes they are accustomed to get in April.  If the Minister will examine the output of agriculture as recorded by the Statistics Department he will find, in the matter of the disposal of potatoes, that by far a larger quantity was sold to the people in the Free State towns than was exported. Seeing that we imported more than we exported, I think it would be much more desirable that the people in our towns should get their potatoes properly graded and packed.  We have a good market here for potatoes, a market sufficient to absorb all our home produce.  We should look after that market and see that it is properly supplied.</P>
    <P>The export of potatoes has fallen very considerably during the last three or four years.  The imports have also fallen.  To such an extent have the exports fallen, that in 1930 the total sum realised amounted to only £18,000.  One would imagine it is hardly worth while to bring in a Bill of the dimensions of this measure for the sake of £18,000.  I was looking up the statistics in regard to potatoes and I came across other things in respect of which we would not dream of legislating, and yet, from the point of view of the amount involved, they are more important.  For instance, we exported periwinkles to a much greater extent than we exported potatoes in 1930.  The export value of <Col N="702" /> waste paper was much greater than was the export value of potatoes.  We got more for woollen rags than we did for potatoes.  Nobody would think of bringing in a Bill to deal with the grading and packing of waste paper or to see that the people in Great Britain got true samples.  We got more for old hens and for eels, and we got twice as much for rabbit skins as we did for potatoes.  These examples will show the relative importance of potatoes for which we are now legislating.</P>
    <P>There is a provision that the exporter must send at least 500 tons of potatoes in the year.  That means that if our exports do not increase we will not have more than eighteen exporters in the whole Free State.  That is based on the volume of export in 1930.  The number is very small and represents about one exporter for each maritime county in the Free State.  It does not allow for any competition whatsoever. If one man exports 3,000 tons, that will reduce the number of eighteen by at least five, and if other exporters begin to deal in large quantities you may eventually have only five or six exporters.  That brings us to the position where the number of exporters will be so small that it will be quite easy for them to form a ring and the growers will be at their mercy.  As the amount of potatoes exported is so very small, I do not think that the Bill is of any great importance and, as far as I am concerned, I suggest it should get a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of this Bill; it is a very good principle, and I think we should encourage such measures as this.  On the question of fees, I think the amount set out in the Bill is rather large.  I am just wondering if it would be possible to extract, first, a sum of £25, and then this figure of 6d. a ton which is mentioned.  It seems a very large sum, and I am sure it will reduce the number of exporters.  If we take the tillage counties, it will leave very few, if any, in the other areas of the Free State.  With regard to potato merchants, I would like to know from the Minister if those merchants will <Col N="703" /> have to have separate stores if they happen to supply in different places. Sometimes a merchant might supply the cities of the Free State, and sometimes he might export potatoes.  Let us say that Deputy White supplies potatoes in Dublin and he also supplies to Derry and to outside places through the port of Derry.</P>

We have imports, and that shows how complicated a thing commerce is.  We have imports of potatoes to the extent of 20,000, 17,000, 22,000 and 14,000 tons.  Put that at 5 tons to the acre.  It is rather high; 4,000 acres give 20,000 tons of potatoes. How many thousand acres do we grow at home?  I presume Deputy Dr. Ryan knows the figure.

      <P>Just imagine that we grow 300,000 acres of potatoes in the country, and all we import is the produce of about two or three thousand acres.  The mere fluctuations year by year in our acreage would amount to 40,000 or 50,000 tons.  The mere fluctuations from one year to another are far more important than the total of our imports, so that for all practical purposes we have the home market, and no one can take it from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That position is stationary.  The imports of potatoes have not increased. They go up one year and they go down another, but we have the home market. <Col N="705" /> What we want is to extend our export trade, and the purpose of this Bill is to enable us to extend it.  There is no possibility of extension in the home market.  The most we can get in that way is 20,000 or 30,000 acres.  What market have we in England?  The import of seed potatoes alone to England amount to 200,000 tons.  If we are looking for a new market, there is the place where you have room not for 2,000 or 3,000 acres, but for 140,000 or 150,000 or 200,000 more acres.  It is to effect that purpose that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan should take his courage in his hands and vote against this Bill and not adopt the mean tactics of criticising it in detail and then letting it go through.  I am asked if we want to control the home supply of potatoes.  Of course we do not.  I am thinking not of the consumer. This Bill is quite frankly in the interests of the producer.  That is all it can do.  The producer has the home market and let the buyer at home protect himself.  That is my attitude for the moment.  At the moment I am endeavouring to protect the producer. Moreover, it would be utterly impossible to control the home market.  I will sell potatoes to my neighbour, and my neighbour will sell potatoes to me. I will sell potatoes in the town of Loughrea.  Every man sells in the nearest town.  How many men will be required to control the sale of potatoes in all the towns in Ireland?  To my mind, considering the large number, that is impossible, and not only is it impossible even at an enormous cost, but it is unnecesary, because we farmers have the home market in potatoes.  This Bill has for its object the development of the potato trade, and the only direction in which we can develop it is in the English market. That is the only place where it is possible for us to find an extra market for our potatoes, and it is with a view to encouraging that that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>I am going with the times, because taking one year with another, and taking the exports, we were down last year because of the extraordinarily low prices.  There is an increase in our <Col N="706" /> exports of seed and ware potatoes. There is certainly an increase in seed potatoes, so this Bill is going with the tendency that already exists, and I hope that in my small way the control exercised through this Bill will improve the reputation of our potatoes in England and thereby give us a bigger market.  Of course Deputies across the House will scoff at an increase of 30,000 or 40,000 tons.  It sounds small to them when they hear of the immense amount of tobacco and wheat that they want to grow, but remember this acreage is established in a country and it does not require any subsidy.  It is steady, and is not unlikely to incur loss.  It will not depend on the whims of a Cumann na nGaedheal, a Republican, a Labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer which I received here to a question addressed to the Minister for Justice with regard to the treatment of Messrs. Seán McGuinness and George Mooney in Mountjoy in consequence of the hunger-strike in which they indulged, has left me so dissatisfied that I take this opportunity of seeking further information on it and of registering a protest against the answer given to me by the Minister.  In order to refresh Deputies' minds on the subject of why hospital treatment is necessary, it is well to go back to the answer to a question addressed by me to the Minister for Justice in which he said that George Mooney's health had suffered from his long period of confinement.  That fact was admitted without any qualification. <Col N="707" /> On 11th June, in the Dáil, the Minister admitted that the cell doors of Mooney and McGuinness were left open during certain hours.  He further admitted that later, on his instructions, or on the instructions of an officer of his Department, that that privilege was withdrawn and the cell doors were closed.  As a consequence these prisoners were compelled, when they could not get fresh air any other way, to destroy the cell windows in order to secure ventilation.  The result of that action on their part was that they were put in strait-jackets.  Each of these prisoners at that time, it is well to remind members of the Dáil, was in delicate health, particularly Mooney, who had been in what you might call solitary confinement for a period of nearly seventeen months.  The Minister, of course, will say that it was of his own volition, but that is neither here nor there.  The fact is that he was confined, and that that was bound to have an effect upon his health. McGuinness did not suffer from the solitary confinement, but he suffered from the excessive brutality which resulted in his spitting up blood, as was testified in a sworn affidavit of a prisoner who was released last week.</P>
      <P>The consequence of this brutality and of the persecution indulged in in that prison was that the prisoners felt that they were not being treated as human beings, and feeling that some more desperate action was necessary to force their case on the attention of the Minister for Justice, and on the attention of the authorities of this Dáil, resolved to make the only protest that remained within their power, the desperate and, if I might so describe it from my own experience, the inhuman protest of a hunger-strike. The hunger-strike followed and lasted for eleven days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a discussion here last week, and the Minister's attitude might best be stated in one sentence which he uttered in the course of his reply&mdash;&ldquo;If these men choose to injure their health it is their look-out&rdquo;&mdash; merely a repetition nine years later of the doctrine&mdash;&ldquo;Let them rot; it does not matter.&rdquo;  The Adjutant-General <Col N="708" /> of the Republican Army called that hunger-strike off after eleven days on Saturday, and one would imagine that even sentiments of justice and charity, of which we hear so much from the Government side of the House, would have induced the Minister at least to take cognizance of the fact that the long period of solitary confinement which was endured by Mooney, and the excessive brutality which undoubtedly was inflicted on McGuinness, would have been sufficient cause for immediate attention after the effects of that hunger-strike.  Evidently the Minister's heart has become a piece of granite. He is dead to all human appeal.  His ears have been stuffed, and are incapable of hearing anything except the doctrine, &ldquo;Let them rot.&rdquo;  It is pure cussedness on his part, a refusal, in the way in which another Minister was described last night, to recognise a mistake.</P>
    <P>We find him, in reply to the question addressed to him to-day, as to whether he had issued instructions to the prison authorities to provide adequate hospital treatment to prevent serious after-effects from this strike, stating that no special instructions have been issued in this case.  The Minister for Justice, of course, never having had the experience of the horrors of a hunger-strike, fails to realise what exactly it means.  He fails to realise that eleven days' hunger-strike, small period though it is, following upon a period of solitary confinement in the one case, and excessive physical torture in the other, must be met by medical attention over a period of not less than three weeks.  We find him stating definitely and cold-bloodedly that no special instructions have been issued.  We may take it for granted from that phrase, &ldquo;no special instructions,&rdquo; that the ordinary prison diet is probably available for these two men.  The ordinary prison diet, of course, is a thing which the Minister never has had experience of either. If he had he would be very slow about issuing instructions that men who had endured a hunger-strike for eleven days would secure nothing but the ordinary prison diet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> It is well to anticipate him in this. He will state that the medical authorities in the prison are giving due attention and will undoubtedly give the requisite medical supplies to these men.  I have had some experience of prison doctors under the Free State Government and of what the prisoner who endures a hunger-strike receives in the line of medical attention, and I want to tell the Minister that unless special instructions are issued to the medical authorities in Mountjoy it is quite likely that these men will be allowed merely the ordinary routine food of the prison.  If that is so after eleven days' hunger-strike it is quite possible that their health will be permanently injured, and if their health is permanently injured, despite what the Minister says here that it is their own look-out.  I charge him with the responsibility, and if they die I charge the Minister for Justice in this Dáil with the moral murder of these two men.  It is no use getting away from the fact by drawing red herrings across the trail and introducing side issues as to the type of criminals these men are.  The Minister for Justice knows very well that those men are not criminals.  He has learned nothing, his ears being stuffed and his heart being dead to the appeal of human sentiment from the long struggle of Irish political prisoners in British jails for political treatment.  He has not learned the fundamental fact that all these struggles in the years that have passed have left something which prisoners can go on, and if he does not desire, as I said the other night, to lay up a heritage of bitterness and animosity which may result in calamity, I would suggest to him to take a more human and more broad-minded view of this. I would suggest to him, apart from anything but pure Christian humanity that men who have endured suffering deserve something more than the cold-blooded, granite-like reply that was given to me to-day.  The Minister probably will gloss over these facts, but I would put it to him that if his prison medical authorities are of the same calibre and of the same mentality as the Governor of Mountjoy and as the prison warder, Sugrue, have <Col N="710" /> proved themselves to be, then there is little hope that there will be any result from the medical authorities in Mountjoy.  These two officers in Mountjoy have proved themselves to be &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to show that the Minister has issued no special instructions to the medical authorities in Mountjoy, and if their mentality is anything like the mentality of the Governor and of the chief warder, then these prisoners have very little hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he does not like the idea of bending the knee just a little by conceding even medical treatment to these men, it is far better to concede that treatment and humble his superior pride just a little bit than to be faced in a week or maybe two weeks&mdash;one never knows&mdash; with probably the death of one or two of these men.  I am not trying to make the case more serious than it is.  I have seen men driven mad in Mountjoy from a hunger-strike.  I have seen men who came out of that strike in 1923 with their health ruined.  I do not want the same thing to happen the two types of Irishmen such as Seán McGuinness and George Mooney are.  I put it to the Minister that if he wants to avoid the responsibility for being classed in history as being just as guilty of insane persecution as those who persecuted the Fenian prisoners&mdash;if he does not want to be classed in history as just as guilty as those men he cannot continue this policy.  But if he does not, and if he wants to give some semblance of justice to the type of office which he bears, then I put it to him that his duty is at once to give a different answer to the question which I asked from the answer given to-day.  I put it to him that if anything happens these men, if they die as a result of the treatment which they are getting, and if the medical attention which is required is not given to them, no matter how he tries to dodge responsibility, he is guilty.  I put it to him further, that <Col N="711" /> even if they do not die, but if their health is permanently injured or impaired, and they become wrecks, just as many Fenian prisoners became wrecks under the British system of persecution, the responsibility will not be theirs; the responsibility will be that of James Fitzgerald-Kenney, Minister for Justice.  On him the guilt will rest, and on him the responsibility for whatever consequences may occur will fall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer which the Minister has given to this question is an insult to the House.  The position of the Minister is that he is the servant of the House in respect of a particular Department, and is bound, when asked by any representative of this House for details upon any question of such importance as this, to give the full details, and to tell exactly what the position now is as regards these prisoners.  Instead of that, he only tells us in a few brief words that he has given no special instructions in reference to these two men who, so far as the public generally know, may be upon the verge either of insanity or death.  We are entitled to have the full details with reference to these two men, no matter what their actions have been.  We are entitled to know from the Minister what has occurred between him and the Visiting Committee. The Visiting Committee, as the Minister knows, have under the prison rules a very large measure of power.  They must visit every week, and when any punishment is proposed to be meted out to any prisoners they must be consulted in the matter.  All we hear from the Minister is that no special instructions have been issued in the case of these two men.  They have been on hunger-strike.  They have gone through a very severe period, which must have injured their health, as we know from the experience of others who have gone through the same kind of treatment, and whose health has been very severely injured.  A large number of the general public are anxious about them.  Another section are extremely anxious about the condition of these two men and they are exasperated.  It is the duty of the Minister to let us <Col N="712" /> know the full facts as to how these men are getting on.</P>
      <P>If there are no special instructions we must assume that they are getting ordinary prison diet.  To give men coming off hunger-strike ordinary prison diet is to commit murder, either slow or fast.  These men may survive, but their health will be permanently injured and they will wither away afterwards, but in either case the responsibility of the Minister is that these men should receive special hospital treatment after they have come off hunger-strike. They have, of their own volition, come off hunger-strike, and if the Minister had any scrap of humanity or statesmanship he would have done the large thing in this matter, and he would not merely have seen that they were given hospital treatment, but he would have reinstated all the privileges which they have claimed as honourable men. These men are making a struggle for special treatment, not to be considered as low-down criminals, and in the course of that struggle they have suffered severely.  In view of that suffering, if the Minister had any largeness about him, he would certainly have granted these privileges to these men, and not taken up an attitude which is cruel so far as they are concerned, which is exasperating to the outside public, and which is insulting to the members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot claim to have any inside knowledge regarding the present physical condition of the two men concerned, but if there is anything in the statement made by Deputy Mullins and others, and some of the statements we have seen published, namely, that these men have been on hunger-strike for eleven days, I can say from information which has been given to me, as well as from what I know, that McGuinness is not the type of man who can stand the strain of eleven days' hunger-strike without some kind of special treatment at the end of it.  All I wish to say is this, and I believe I can say it on behalf of all parties in the Offaly area, that taking into consideration the circumstances <Col N="713" /> in which McGuinness was originally arrested and the charge upon which he was tried and found guilty, and what happened during the intervening period, the Minister will be well advised in the interests of peace in that area to release McGuinness. If he was generous enough to make a gesture like that he would find that the unnecessarily provocative action which McGuinness adopted, and which led up to his re-arrest on a recent occasion, would not be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather curious debate.  We had, of course, all the usual rhetoric.  We had it from Deputy Mullins, and &ldquo;the echo echoed softly the sounds that fell.&rdquo;  We had Deputy Mullins' rhetoric reproduced in more gentle terms by Deputy Little.  The curious thing is that they all proceeded upon a completely baseless assumption.  Before I come to the definite and specific facts of this case, I should like to remind Deputy Mullins that if some people have learned nothing, he seems to be essentially the person who has learned nothing.  The Deputy does not seem to know that there is an Oireachtas in this country. He does not happen to know that the Oireachtas rules this country, and that all the jails and prisons are under the Oireachtas.  Why he talks about British jails I fail completely to understand, except the Deputy&mdash;I am sure against his own better judgment, because the Deputy is not wanting generally, at any rate, in average ability, &mdash;wants to try and get a little cheap notoriety&mdash;very cheap notoriety indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get down to the specific facts of the case, to use Deputy Mullins' own phrase, these men did indulge in a hunger-strike.  They deliberately chose to go on hunger-strike.  We debated the other night the matters which preceded that hunger-strike.  I placed the accurate facts before the House.  Of course, Deputy Mullins has to repeat a completely inaccurate statement that the men could not get fresh air and had to break their windows.  The men had the ordinary ventilation in their cells and broke the windows simply because <Col N="714" /> a privilege which they had received, and which they had violated and abused, was withdrawn from them. That any brutality was used towards them by the Governor or chief warder or anybody else is an unfounded calumny.  It is very easy for Deputy Mullins, or any other Deputy who desires cheap notoriety, to get up and make baseless statements against men who do their duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is based on a sworn affidavit, and there is no use trying to get out of it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy for him to get up and make charges against men who do their duty to the State.  That is the cheapest method, I suppose, of ingratiating himself with a body of persons that it is no credit to anybody to be associated with.  It is said I have done a most shocking and awful thing.  I do not know how hard my heart is, how deaf my ears are, but in this particular case no special instructions were given.  Why should special instructions be given?  We have a perfectly competent medical staff in Mountjoy to deal with the case of every single prisoner.  These men went on hunger-strike, and after a certain time they came off hunger-strike.  As a matter of fact, prior to the conclusion of the hunger-strike Mooney was removed to hospital&mdash;I think the day before he came off hunger-strike&mdash;and he has been in hospital and is receiving hospital diet.  The other man, McGuinness, when he came off hunger-strike was not put on ordinary prison diet.  He was given diet suitable to a man in his condition, commencing with liquid diet, and was then gradually brought on to diet suitable to a man who has not taken solid food for a considerable number of days.  These men have been perfectly competently and correctly treated.  There is another thing, and that is that in the case of such men as these there was no need, there never will be any need, for any instructions to be issued.  The prison authorities, and especially the prison doctors, know their work and carry it out admirably, and there is no need for anybody to give special instructions to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> As far as the present health of the prisoners is concerned, McGuinness is completely recovered and is in his normal health. Mooney is in hospital and still receiving special diet.  Of course, Mooney is a man who refused to take exercise for a very considerable time. If you confine yourself in a cell and practically never leave that cell your health will most undoubtedly suffer, and Mooney has run himself down, and on top of that he has proceeded, to use Deputy Mullins's phrase, to indulge in hunger-strike.  If he does so, naturally you cannot expect his health will be completely unimpaired, but he is not in danger or anything of the kind, and he is not confined to bed. I really have nothing further to say on this matter.  The treatment that is given to these men by the medical officers in Mountjoy Prison has been correct and proper, and if these men wish to go on further, if they wish to make fools of themselves by refusing to take exercise, that is their own look-out.</P>
    <P>This refusal to take exercise, as I have already told the House, has had a very strange origin.  There were a couple of men who called themselves, I think, &ldquo;social war prisoners or class-warfare prisoners.&rdquo;  A couple of these men had just about a fortnight of their sentences to do.  They got in touch with Sweeney and McGuinness &mdash;not the McGuinness in this instance, but another who was in prison at the time&mdash;and these fellows succeeded in getting Sweeney and McGuinness to join them in a refusal to take exercise. They were out of prison at the end of a fortnight and Sweeney and McGuinness then found themselves in the position that they had long terms to do, and by following the example of others they have put themselves in this position.  I should have thought that if Deputies had sympathy with these particular individuals or the two men who have now taken up the running from Sweeney and McGuinness, that is, Mooney and the other, they would urge upon them to take the commonsense point of view and to make their prison life as easy as <Col N="716" /> possible for themselves.  If they wish to make prison life difficult for themselves, that is entirely their own look-out.</P>
    <P>As far as Mooney is concerned, I intend to adopt precisely the same attitude in his case as I did in the case of Sweeney and McGuinness. In the case of Sweeney and McGuinness they were let out before their time; that is to say, they had earned no remission marks, and could have been kept in for the entire period of their sentence.  They were not kept in for the entire period of their sentence, and were allowed out at the expiration of the period at which they would have been let out if they had conducted themselves properly in prison.  I intend to take the same attitude in this case, because I think these persons have made prison life so unnecessarily hard for themselves that they may be fairly given the same remission of sentence as they would have got in the ordinary course if they had been properly conducted prisoners, but it does not follow that the precedent which I have set in the case of Sweeney and McGuinness, and which I intend to follow in Mooney's case, is a precedent that will be followed in every case if people insist on following up the course they did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that a continuation of the incarceration of Mooney in a cell without allowing him access to the open air for exercise will not have a detrimental effect on Mooney's health? As I understand it, this prisoner has never been a very strong man, and if the Minister has seen his way to extend what he considers consideration to the prisoner in the matter of the remission, I think he might at least allow him to get exercise during the remainder of his period.  After all the remaining period is not so long that it matters one way or the other, and it is not worth the Minister's while fighting for anything more.</P>

Has he never listened to a single debate upon this question, or was he asleep while Deputy Mullins was speaking&mdash;and it <Col N="717" /> must be rather difficult to sleep while Deputy Mullins is speaking, for otherwise I cannot understand the particular question the Deputy has put. Everybody knows except Deputy Derrig that Mooney is not only free to exercise, but it has been urged upon him to take this exercise, and he has been told that he is very foolish not to take this exercise.  He has not been confined in his cell.  At the time that he should take exercise he deliberately keeps himself in his cell and refuses to take exercise, and if he wishes to take that line it is his own look-out.  But for Deputy Derrig to get up here and ask why this man is not allowed to take exercise, when everybody in the House knows he is free to take exercise, and when I believe Deputy Derrig himself knows it, however innocent he may appear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
