    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Drill Field, Fethard, County Tipperary, consisting of about 13½ statute acres, which was let to the Town Commissioners prior to 1929, was then let, at a lower price than the townspeople were prepared to give, to a private individual, an extensive land owner and shopkeeper in Fethard; and if he is aware that the latter sub-let it to the young people of the town at a substantial price; further, if he is aware that this field is urgently required for a town park and sports field by the young people who, while it was held by the Town Commissioners, gave months of voluntary labour to cleaning, levelling and rendering it suitable for such purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is that for some years past this field has been advertised by the Commissioners of Public Works for grazing at the beginning of each grazing season. The Fethard Town Commissioners applied for the grazing for the 1929 season, but their application could not be entertained in view of a statement by the Department of Local Government that they were not aware of any statutory authority which would enable the Town Commissioners to acquire land for grazing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, no representations have been made to the Commissioners of Public Works since 1929, in the matter, and they have not been notified of the <Col N="2738" /> subletting referred to.  They would be prepared to consider, on its merits, an offer from the Town Commissioners for a lease of the field for the purpose mentioned, with any other offers received.  Any such offer should be made early, as offers for grazing are due in on 21st instant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the policy of the Commissioners of Public Works in this connection is at variance with the policy of the Land Commission? In reply to a question I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Land Commission some time ago the answer was that they would provide a playing field whenever possible in County Tipperary and every other county.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are two prominent athletic clubs in Fethard, one a G.A.A. and the other a Rugby club?  Preference has been given to Mr. Henehan, who, I understand, after attending a meeting stated that clubs could use the field as far as possible, but at the same time he charged one of these clubs £30 for the use of the field, besides charging another individual £45 for grazing, so that in all he made a profit of £75 out of the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Town Commissioners using the field as a town park, but they cannot use it for grazing purposes and cannot sublet it for grazing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary justify the action of a public department in giving preference to an individual in a case like this?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that as a result of the recent British tariffs, serious difficulties have arisen in connection with the dispatch of handkerchiefs and other embroidered linen goods to Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and what steps, if any, does the Minister propose to take, in order to remove this restriction on an important Free State industry.</P>

      <P>I am aware that difficulties of the kind referred to by the Deputy have arisen. I have taken steps to have these difficulties removed, and so far as I am aware they have been practically surmounted. I am anxious, however, to issue a complete statement for the guidance of Free State exporters which will avert the possibility of any similar difficulties in the future.

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that outside a radius of approximately 50 miles broadcasting from the Dublin Station cannot be picked up by listeners, and if he is further aware that it is expected that residents and visitors will be anxious to take advantage of broadcasting from the Dublin Station during Eucharistic Congress Week, and if he can state when he hopes the new high-power station will be available, and if it will be functioning before June of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan) Michael Richard Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probable that general conditions for reception of the Dublin Station's programmes in places outside a range of about 50 miles have <Col N="2740" /> disimproved of late owing to the lower power of the station as compared with the numerous British and foreign high power stations now in operation, and the overcrowding of broadcasting wave-lengths in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government has set up a special committee to deal with matters concerning the Eucharistic Congress and matters relating to broadcasting arrangements in connection with the Congress will, consequently, fall for consideration between that committee and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary state whether the high-power station will be functioning at that time, whether the programmes are arranged or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of the question seems to relate to the possibilities of broadcasting from the new station during the Eucharistic Congress. As I stated, the arrangements for broadcasting in connection with the Congress are to be considered by a special committee which has been set up to deal with it.  I do not know if the Deputy has any authorisation to seek information on behalf of the special committee or anybody interested in it.  If he has, I suggest that he put the question to the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is evading a direct answer to the question.  For a number of years, arising out of the Vote passed in the Dáil providing funds for the erection of a new high-power station, the public have been expecting month after month that this station would be erected to enable listeners outside a radius of fifty miles from Dublin to hear the broadcasting programme.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary answer yes or no as to whether the new station will be in operation before June of next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, arising out of his reply, what distinction he makes in his reference to British and foreign stations? Does he draw any particular distinction, and, if so, what?</P>

    <Col N="2741" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second question, I am sure, is not in order.  With regard to Deputy Briscoe's supplementary question, clearly, the second part refers to the first.  Whatever information the Deputy has in mind it is clear that what he wants is the position of the broadcasting undertaking and what position we will be in in regard to broadcasting when the Eucharistic Congress takes place.  I have said that the arrangements in connection with broadcasting for the Eucharistic Congress are a matter for consideration by a special committee which has been set up to deal with all matters concerning the Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary state how it will be possible, no matter what way the committee may arrange their programme, to enable listeners outside a radius of 50 miles from Dublin to hear when it is not possible to hear now?  How can people outside a 50 miles radius hear a programme broadcasted from Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard Dublin 200 miles outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking information about the broadcasting apart from the Eucharistic Congress, and I suggest that is a separate question and is not in order.  If he is asking a general question with regard to the possibility of hearing, and when a high-power station is erected, I will answer him if he puts down a separate question.  Clearly this deals with the possibility of broadcasting in connection with the Eucharistic Congress. The arrangements in connection with the broadcasting for the Eucharistic Congress are in the hands of a special committee, and they have not yet been settled.</P>

      <P>From the information at the Minister's disposal it appears that the collection of share capital has in most of the cases referred to been completed for this year.

      <P>A proposal for a sewerage scheme for Kenmare was under consideration by the board of health in May, 1930.

There has been no outbreak of fever in the town which would be referable to a sewerage scheme as is suggested in the question.  It is open to interested parties locally to make to the commissioner representing the board of health any representations they may wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have quite understood my answer. <Col N="2746" /> Even though the districts were entirely Irish-speaking, the Act provides that three-fifths of the total money is to be allocated to certain areas which are extremely poor.  The districts to which the Deputy refers do not come within the three-fifths, but as I stated in my reply, the order of urgency will probably bring them within a category which will be reached at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that of the £250,000 originally granted two-fifths were to be expended in the breac-Ghaeltacht and that no consideration has been given to claims from the areas I have mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinterpreting the Act.  While three-fifths must be allocated to the fior-Ghaeltacht with a certain low valuation, the Act does not say that the five-fifths shall not be allocated to it. The provision in the Act does not mean that two-fifths are to be allocated to the breac-Ghaeltacht.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the Deputy's two questions together.</P>
      <P>(1)  Where an Order is made by the Land Commission under the provisions of Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, declaring that a parcel of untenanted land shall vest in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day as if it were tenanted land, any arrears of rent which accrued prior to the first gale day in the year 1928 and are unpaid on the Appointed Day are cancelled.  But pending the making of an Order the Land Commission have no power to restrain the grantor from exercising his rights to sue for and recover his rent.  Where the rent has been paid in full by an applicant before the Appointed Day, there is no provision in the Act for repayment by the landlord of any part of it. The section deals with arrears unpaid on the Appointed Day and the Land Commission cannot declare the Appointed Day until they hear the application and decide to grant it.</P>
      <P>(2)  The period during which 25 per cent. may be deducted is fixed by sub-section (c) of Section 44, the provisions of which come into effect on the making of an Order and the fixing of the Appointed Day.</P>
      <P>(3)  The amount of compounded arrears that may be added to the purchase money is defined by sub-section (3) (d) of Section 44 as &ldquo;seventy-five per cent. of the arrears of rent and apportioned gale of rent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The method of determining the purchase price is similar to that <Col N="2753" /> provided for non-judicial tenancies under Section 2 of Land Act, 1929.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £575 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original amount asked for under sub-head E was £300, to provide scholarships for certain Gaeltacht students in university colleges.  It has for a long time been apparent, in view of the work that requires to be done and the number of expert people with a complete mastery of Irish required, that some steps were necessary in order to enable clever <Col N="2755" /> young people from Irish-speaking homes in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht to take advantage of university education. This year it was proposed to give a number of scholarships to children who had been brought up in Irish-speaking homes in the Fior-Ghaeltacht who had been through primary and secondary schools, where teaching was done through the medium of Irish, and who had succeeded in passing the Leaving Certificate examination with honours. When the Estimate was framed, although it was intended, if possible, to give five scholarships, there was some doubt as to whether as many as five candidates would qualify.  It was thought that we could hardly get so many in the first year.  As it turned out, we got five and it is necessary, therefore, to ask for a Supplementary Vote.  Four boys and one girl got scholarships, two boys being from Kerry, one from Galway and one from Donegal.  The girl was also from Donegal.  The students are in attendance at University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head E 1, it has been felt that, with the approaching completion of the new municipal gallery at Charlemont House, a new effort should be made to obtain the return of the Lane pictures to Dublin. It is believed that important support for the claim of this country to the pictures might be obtained if a volume such as is contemplated were issued, a volume which will contain reproductions of certain of the pictures and descriptions of Sir Hugh Lane's life and works.  It will show his desire to establish a gallery of modern art in Dublin, and will indicate the steps he had in mind to give effect to that, as well as various matters dealing with the bequests of the pictures now in dispute.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E 2 deals with the provision prescribed by Section 20 (1) of the Veterinary Surgeons Act to be made to the Veterinary Council set up by that Act to discharge the functions assigned to it.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for the expense of providing Stationery, Printing, Paper, Binding, and Printed Books for the Public Service; to pay the Salaries and Expenses of the Stationery Office; and for Sundry Miscellaneous Services, including Reports of Oireachtas Debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-head G G 2 for the production of a volume illustrating early Christian art in Ireland covers a <Col N="2757" /> proposal which has been put forward in connection with the forthcoming Eucharistic Congress.  The proposal was made by the Council of the Royal Irish Academy, which thought that a volume of this sort showing the wealth and variety of early Christian Art in Ireland would be very acceptable to a great number of visitors during the Eucharistic Congress.  The Academy applied for an advance in order to produce the volume, but after a discussion it was decided that the volume could be produced satisfactorily by the Stationery Office and the Ordnance Survey.  As Deputies may be aware, equipment was provided in connection with the work of the Irish Manuscripts Commission at the Ordnance Survey, which will enable extremely good reproductions of photographs of these various objects which are in the museum to be printed here.  We find that the work can be done substantially cheaper than it can be done outside, and specimen pages, which have been prepared and examined by the representatives of the Academy, are regarded as fully equal if not superior to any work done elsewhere.  It is anticipated that the sales of this particular volume will easily recoup the expenses of its production.</P>
    <P>With regard to the next sub-head, GG (3), Publication of Irish Translation of the New Testament, Father O'Leary's translation of the Bible and particularly of the New Testament has been set up in type for a considerable time.  I do not know that the whole of the Old Testament has been set up. Portion of it has been.  The whole of the New Testament has been set up in type for six or seven years.  Father O'Leary's literary executor has spent a great deal of money on it.  For some time he has felt unable to expend any more, with the result that the work has been held up and the New Testament, as translated by Father O'Leary, is not available to the public.  It is proposed to advance this sum to Father O'Leary's literary executor.  Out of it he will defray the costs of certain revisions and corrections if necessary, including the correction of various printers' errors and the cost of printing <Col N="2758" /> and binding.  In this case, the amount advanced can be recovered from the sales of the volume.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will see by looking at the Estimate which has been circulated, this is a grant in order to provide help for certain pupils from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht for a preliminary course.  It is felt that owing to the economic conditions prevailing there it is necessary to give this help.  Deputies will remember that last July I moved a supplementary estimate to provide scholarships for this particular class. It is felt that in order to enable people <Col N="2759" /> from this district to compete successfully for the preparatory colleges and scholarships referred to, a certain number of pupils could be taken with advantage from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and given a year's preparation.  It is in order to provide the necessary fees for the schools in that course, and in some cases the necessary equipment, that the present Vote is asked for.  The conditions will be that an account will be taken of the number of places reserved for the different districts in the preparatory colleges.  Account is also taken of the requirements of the Gaeltacht in question, so that pupils will be called in the order of merit. This is really in order to give a preliminary training for such pupils as otherwise might not have an opportunity of getting it.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head H there is an amount of £36,705 asked for in order to provide interest and sinking fund on the bonds issued in respect of the State contribution to the purchase price and also in respect of the contribution to the Costs Fund.  In the Estimate last year I asked for a sum of £34,000 in order to cover the interest and sinking fund on the land bonds issued in respect of this contribution.  Since the passing of the Act of 1931 £14,000,000 worth of land bonds have been issued, and naturally the figure asked for in the Estimate this year has been increased considerably in consequence.  The additional sum of £36,705 now asked for is intended to cover additional amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head I&mdash;Improvement of Estates &mdash;is a token Vote for £10.  Under the Land Act of 1931 the Land Commission was given certain additional powers to spend money; under Section 38 of that <Col N="2764" /> Act rights of way can be provided to turbary areas and turbary plots, and the section gives us power to pay the expenses of migrants from various parts of the country.  I do not anticipate that any additional expenditure will be incurred in this financial year in connection with the administration of these particular sections, but in order to keep ourselves right legally with the Accountant and with the Comptroller and Auditor-General I have been advised that it is necessary to obtain a token vote of £10 additional.</P>
    <P>Sub-head P is for £79,403 for advances in respect of additional sums payable by purchasers.  This is intended to cover the period of two months between the gale day and the dividend day.  Under the Act of 1931 the payment of that sum has been extended over a period of three years.  In other words, it has been extended over six half-yearly instalments.  Hitherto it was the practice of the Land Commission to collect that in one instalment, but I felt when the Act of 1931 was being passed that it would be unfair to ask the tenant to pay the whole amount in one instalment.  For that reason it was spread over six half-yearly instalments. This money will be fully recouped at the end of the three years period.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O is for a sum of £2,000 for payment under various sections of the Land Act of 1931.  This is a purely approximate Estimate.  No expenditure has so far been incurred under any of these sections, and it is doubtful if any will be incurred before the end of the financial year.  However, in order to provide against such an eventuality I am asking for this sum.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R is £500 for the maintenance of embankments and other works.  That is the provision of a capital sum to cover certain works of repair and maintenance in various parts of the country  That amount will also be returned to the State in the form of annuities to be fixed on the tenants who will benefit by improvements to be carried out by the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is very much to be said on this Estimate. <Col N="2765" /> The additional sums required seem to arise from the operation of the Land Commission in connection with the recent Land Act.  It seems to be necessary to pass these moneys.  Sub-head H is well understood by everybody. It is in connection with the costs that have to be paid on estates. The only question that seems to arise is whether the Land Commission have in sight the end of this paying out to a point, and whether the whole transactions are likely to be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>I think that is one question that arises or whether we will later on be presented with further supplementary estimates.  Can we take it from the Parliamentary Secretary that this Estimate will complete the financial responsibility of the State in connection with operations under that Act?</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head I, Improvement of Estates, is it proposed to make any segregation between the amounts that will be allocated for special works under recent Land Acts, such as were mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, turbary and migrants' expenses, or will the whole thing simply appear under one sub-head? The general question of the improvement of estates is one of those matters that can be discussed on this Estimate.  I do not propose to go into it except to say that we are not satisfied at all that sufficient work is being done, particularly in counties like Kildare, Tipperary and Meath, the chief ranching counties, where it is known that large areas of ranch land have been the subject of agitation for many years and where there is urgent need for a forward policy.  It seems to me that the Land Commission are not doing what they should have done at all in dividing this land.  I quite realise that in the appropriation of money the congested districts must have first consideration, but it seems extraordinary if the Land Commission is going to allow these huge ranches to continue solely, as I have often stated, for the production of beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to sub-heads P.Q. and R. these are new sub-heads which have <Col N="2766" /> not appeared before in the Land Commission Vote.  Before voting them, I am sure the Dáil would like to know whether these sub-heads are likely to occur in future years or whether they are simply temporary.  The Parliamentary Secretary has assured us that under sub-head P the amount of almost £80,000 which it is proposed to vote will be repaid in half-yearly instalments. In connection with this whole question of the collection of arrears and of unexpected sums, while they are legally due by the tenants, the tenants are not very well acquainted with the law, and they naturally cannot be expected to have foreseen that under the different Acts they would have to pay these sums, sums both of this kind and the compounded arrears of rent.  I think that in asking the tenants to pay up these additional sums the Land Commission should exercise every leniency.  It is a pity, I think, in connection with the sum payable under this particular section that the Parliamentary Secretary would not take the same powers for the compounded arrears of rent.  Then, as regards sub-head Q, it seems to be necessary to meet certain proceedings which are being dismissed or where the purchase prices are redeemed.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R naturally raises the question of embankments.  Are we to take it that £500 is to be taken as the sum that the Land Commission is really thinking of as sufficient to deal with the question of embankments?  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, in my own constituency there is a single case where I feel quite certain £500 would not cover the expenditure that is necessary. In fact, it is doubtful, as he himself knows, if anything can be done with the embankments in this particular case.  If it simply means providing money in order to fulfil certain statutory obligations, or to place certain sums at the disposal of the Public Trustee to enable him to carry out certain statutory obligations, if that is why £500 is voted, we can understand it, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary might take the opportunity to let the House know when and how soon he intends to take steps to deal with <Col N="2767" /> this whole question of embankments and lands rendered derelict by flooding.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand that this money to be spent on embankments has to be borne by the tenants? I was under the impression that where formerly an embankment was maintained by the landlord the Land Commission would undertake the maintenance of it and debit the State with the cost.  From what the Parliamentary Secretary stated, it would seem that the cost of maintaining embankments is to be passed on to the tenants and added to the annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the improvement of estates, I understand that whatever is advanced to tenants who are allotted land is added on afterwards to their annuities.  I consider that very unfair, because most of those ranches which are being divided at present and which have been used for grazing for the past seventy or eighty years have deteriorated to a very considerable extent.  In fact, they have gone wild.  I know many ranches that have been divided, and before the land is of any use to the tenant, if he intends to cultivate it, he has to clear the hedges and trees that have grown over the land.  In those big tracts of land also drains have been allowed to fill up, or they have been walked in by cattle.  As far as I have seen, there has been no improvement in the way of drainage, so that even if money is advanced to the tenant who receives an allotment of land, I think it is very unfair that he has to pay for the neglect of past generations.  The tenants have to clear watercourses and ditches and re-make the whole place.  It is a terrible handicap when we consider that even farmers who have kept their land up to date for generations past, and kept their hedges trimmed, are unable to do it now.  These farmers are unable to keep it in that condition now, and how are people who have lately received their land from the Land Commission able to do it?  It is impossible for them to do so.  I think they cannot carry on under these conditions.  It is too much for them, along with the ordinary annuity, to bear the burden <Col N="2768" /> of these improvements.  I think the Government should put the land into condition for them before putting them there, so that they will be able to carry on.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary thinks he is getting a proper service from those responsible for this maintenance, and particularly those engaged on the engineering side.  It is a very poor tribute to the capacity of our engineers if breaches have occurred in the embankments that were originally made, and it is a very poor tribute to our capacity to do things here if these breaches cannot be re-made.  It is a confession that we are a thousand years behind any other country in dealing with this question of embankments. It is not a tribute to our engineering staffs or a tribute to the assistance which the Parliamentary Secretary is getting from those who are entrusted with that duty.  There may be other circumstances, of course, of which I am unaware, but the tide is at the very same level at which it was several years ago, and the level of the land has not gone down.  I cannot see why as good a job cannot be done to-day as formerly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not thinking about embankments on the Shannon, but of the embankments on a small river&mdash; the lands adjoining which have been flooded for seven or eight months of the year and in the case of which representations have been made to the Land Commission repeatedly.  The Land Commission have adopted the easygoing attitude of ignoring these representations, and their only action seems to be to send communications asking for the annuities.  I know this place. <Col N="2769" /> It is practically a sea.  You could scarcely walk there.  There is one tullachan, as we call it, one elevation in which you could probably build a house, but the rest is practically a sea. In the case of the farms there, applications for the rates and annuities come regularly.  In the matter of other improvements, I have drawn attention on several occasions to some of the roads which are in such a condition that people, in order to negotiate them, have to put on rubber boots.  The Land Commission has also ignored that matter.  These are a few of the things that I think ought to be raised on an estimate of this kind.</P>
      <P>I wish also to refer to the habit of the Land Commission of allowing people to come in and buy a portion of an estate.  An estate is not in commission, perhaps, for a period.  Somebody comes along and buys a large portion of it from the landlord, such a person happening to have a couple of thousand pounds.  Or two or three people happen to buy a large portion of it.  The Land Commission, in order to make things easy for themselves, do not proceed to acquire the portion which has been bought, but they proceed to buy the worst portion for division amongst uneconomic holders. The best portion is assuredly bought by the two or three people who come in and purchase for a couple of thousand pounds, and the worst portion is left for the uneconomic holders.  I have in my mind two or three cases, and I cannot induce the Land Commission to take any steps in the matter.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take some cognisance of these grievances and make some attempt in the near future to redress them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the amount in the Estimate for the improvement of estates, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some definition of what the improvement of estates means exactly.  I think that the figures for the past few years show that the amount that has been voted for the improvement of estates has been, to a certain extent, considerable. Could the Parliamentary <Col N="2770" /> Secretary give us any outline of the work that has been done in any general way in that respect?  Can he claim that there has been a full return for the amount of money that has been spent?  I fear that in cases where improvements of estates have been carried out by the Land Commission that the schemes have been gone on with in a more or less haphazard way, and that no results have been achieved worth talking about.  I think that the methods employed years ago by the Congested Districts Board were very much more complete and better than the methods employed by the Land Commission.  When the Congested Districts Board took over ranches, for instance, there was a great deal of money expended on new roads, on drainage and fencing, and even small plantations and shelter belts used to be planted by the Congested Districts Board.  No scheme of that kind has been carried out by the Land Commission on estates which they have recently taken over.  The estates that have been taken over were more or less in a derelict condition, and the tenants in many instances have had to make the fences themselves, and even drainage work had to be carried out by the tenants.  I should like that an explanation of that method and of the charges that are being made for lands should be given by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of rent levied on the land.  To my mind the amount of the rent fixed on the lands nowadays is greater than the rent that used to be fixed by the Congested Districts Board for small holdings on estates, and in addition works of improvement used to be carried out by the Congested Districts Board at their own expense, whereas in the present cases improvements have been carried out by the tenants.  Is no allowance made for the work of the tenant in making roads and doing drainage work?  I think there is a lapse there and that the Land Commission have not made an effort to give sufficient allowance for the work which the tenant does in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2771" /> Then there is the question of tenants who have been for twenty years paying interest in lieu of rent on estates that were taken over twenty years ago by the Congested Districts Board and not vested until quite recently.  You have that huge amount of money being paid during that period by the tenants.  Is it not possible for the Land Commission to make some compensation to the tenants for the losses they have thus incurred?  If their holdings had been vested, as should have been done years ago, that amount of money would be saved to the tenants.  Would the Land Commission not consider it advisable and just that some method should be adopted so that improvements should be carried out on the holdings or facilities given to those tenants for building?  I understand that a housing scheme is being carried on by the Land Commission on certain estates.  Offers were recently made by the Land Commission officials to the tenants on a certain estate in County Mayo of a grant for the purpose of building houses and building out-offices. I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us full particulars of that scheme.  People seem to know very little about that scheme or they seem not to know whether the scheme is in existence at all.  Deputies find it very hard to get information about that scheme.  I think that we should have a little more knowledge about that.  In the case of tenants on estates who have been left for a number of years without anything being done to them, and who have been paying interest in lieu of rent, I suggest that it is only just to them that some scheme of that kind for improving their houses, giving loans or grants, or a general scheme for the improvement of the land should be undertaken at the present time.  The tenants certainly require something of that kind to compensate them for the methods that have been employed by the Land Commission, which resulted in leaving them in that state for some time.  With regard to the progress that is being made by the Land Commission, we are not satisfied that the best has been done.  I still cannot <Col N="2772" /> come to the conclusion that the Parliamentary Secretary has in any way succeeded in speeding up the division of ranches or the re-arrangement of holdings.  I cannot see that there is anything in the claim of the Land Commission that they are so overpowered with work that they can do nothing.  That seems to be the position of the Land Commission for quite a number of years.  I would prefer that they would put aside a lot of estates and take a few at a time and do them, as the position at present seems to be that they have so much in hand they can do nothing.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what portion of the money voted in any year for the improvement of estates goes to tenanted land.  As far as this Vote is concerned for untenanted land, it does not affect my constituency very much. There are a number of estates on which the tenants have been agitating since the vesting of the land for certain improvements, such as the improvement of bog passes, the improvement of rights of way and matters of that kind. I understand that under a former Act the landlord always set aside certain sums of money for the doing of this work.  For the last two or three years the Land Commission have more or less set their face against carrying out these improvements, and I think it is most unfair.  The tenants on these estates, who have been paying enormous rents for a long time, are entitled to their share of this Vote, just the same as those who receive portions of untenanted land.  As far as we are concerned, we have not been treated very satisfactorily in that way, and I should like to know what is going to be the attitude of the Land Commission in future.</P>

      <P>With regard to the improvement of estates, I have seen very little done in South Kerry. Nothing has been done in the way of repairs to embankments or by way of drainage.  By drainage I mean small streams which have filled up and in time of flood overflow their banks and destroy meadows on both sides.  I have <Col N="2773" /> seen very little done also in regard to turbary roads, although I have repeatedly brought the matter before the Land Commission and have been promised that it would receive attention when the lands were vested.  The lands have been vested, and still nothing has been done in the way of making turbary roads.  With regard to embankments, I know of lands vested twenty or thirty years ago, and the Land Commission have refused to do anything in the way of repairs.  Before lands are vested the Land Commission send down inspectors to see that they are value for the money to be advanced. It was the duty of the Land Commission, therefore, before they advanced the money to see that proper provision was made for the maintenance of the banks, and a certain amount had a right to be kept back from the landlords.  If the Land Commission did not do that at the time, they should now bear the expense of repairing the banks.  I hope that in the coming summer the Land Commission will see that the turbary roads are put in such a condition that vehicles can pass over them, so as not to have donkeys carrying turf on their backs for half a mile or more.</P>

      <P>I want information as to the attitude of the Land Commission in the case of estates which are flooded. The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of a number of estates in Wexford which have been flooded for a number of years.  The Land Commission, about six years ago, promised to take some steps to relieve the flooding.  While one section of this Department are out for their pound of flesh in collecting annuities, the other section, which has the distribution of such Votes as this, do nothing to relieve the flooding by repairing the embankments.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of what I am referring to.  Another matter is the question of coast erosion. Will any portion of this money be spent to prevent coast erosion?  What are the Land Commission going to do in a case where ten or twenty acres of a particular holding have been washed away by the sea and the tenant has got no relief in his annuity and no relief in his rates?  I remember the Parliamentary <Col N="2774" /> Secretary stating that he was waiting for the report of the Coast Erosion Committee, and I wonder has that Committee reported yet, or when we are likely to have any information in the matter of coast erosion.  I know one particular farmer in Wexford who has lost about eighteen acres of his land in this way, and he is still paying rent and rates for land which is under water.  That case was mentioned in the House before, but nothing has been done in the matter.  I hope that when this money comes to be spent the Parliamentary Secretary will look after the flooded estates.  The Land Commission are getting annuities for these lands, and it is up to them to keep them in order.  They cannot expect tenants to pay annuities for land that is under water the whole year round. In my constituency there are several hundreds of acres of land under water even in the month of June, and the Land Commission still continue to collect annuities for these lands.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up his officials and see that something is done to relieve these farmers.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that in my constituency the C.D.B. divided up a lot of farms in their time.  In many of these cases there are bog roads and drainage work left unfinished, even on some of the first farms handled by the C.D.B.  Appeals have been made repeatedly in this Parliament as well as in the British Parliament to have these works finished, but they are still unfinished.  I have repeatedly asked questions on the matter since I came here in 1927.  In some cases works have been carried out, but in many instances the works are yet incomplete, both in connection with bog roads and the drainage of very small holdings.  It is important that this drainage work should be carried out, especially during the winter, when the unemployment grant will be available.  If the Land Commission cannot get the work done out of their own funds, I understand that the Unemployment Grant will be largely in the hands of the Land Commission engineers as on other occasions. I trust, therefore, that a lot of <Col N="2775" /> this work will be done during the coming winter.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have a lot of things on hand, and one cannot, of course, expect miracles or having things done in a sudden, but I think, where they have lands on hands for a long time, it is not unreasonable to expect that they should do their best to see that the drainage of these lands is kept in order.  There is a case that I once or twice brought forward, that of an extremely industrious farmer. The land about him was taken up by the Land Commission and the drains have not been attended to.  The consequence is that the water all comes down on this man's land.  No matter what he does his land is flooded.  The other tenants lower down are not in such a bad position, but this man suffered a great deal, particularly during the abnormally wet season which we have just had.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take notice of this particular case; it is an extremely hard one.  I have frequently spoken about it, but I have not heard that anything has been done in the way of improvement. I also think that in cases where the Land Commission acquire turbary it is advisable that they should put the roads leading to the bogs in such a state that they could be used. In many cases that is not so.  While turbary and lands are controlled by the Land Commission, before they are divided up and given over, the roads should be repaired and the drainage put in such a state that flooding will not interfere with people who have to make a living out of these lands or have to get turbary from certain bogs. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into these matters.</P>

      <P>In connection with the improvement of estates, three-fourths of the amount of the so-called improvements made by the Land Commission in my constituency are not improvements at all.  They do actually far more harm than good.  I called attention some time ago to the manner in which a house on the Mount Uniacke Estate was being wrecked, and there has been no improvement in that direction since.  As a matter of fact, the wreck was finished by their own inspector. An unfortunate man got over portion of the estate, including the dwelling-house; the fact is that he was left with this huge wreck on his hands and had to pay a large amount of rates on it.  The position was such that he might as well have cleared out and left it there.  I do not consider that improvements of that description are any benefit to anyone.  There were 15 steps leading to the hall-door of this house, but they were taken away, so that the man has to get a ladder in order to gain an entrance.  That is one of the improvements that was carried out on the Mount Uniacke Estate.  Surely the money spent on these so-called improvements could be put to better use and could be spent on giving some employment in the areas concerned. There are a whole lot of estates in my neighbourhood that the Land Commission is making no attempt whatever to divide up.  I suggest that the assistance of the Department of Agriculture should be sought, and perhaps they would call in the members of the Derating Commission, who told us of 13 <Col N="2777" /> different ways of making money out of farms.  If the Land Commission is not able to divide up these estates, perhaps they could ask those dealing with unemployment the way to do it.  They could call in the experts who told us that the farmers needed no de-rating, and give them charge, and they would tell the way to make money out of the estates.  It would be a far better way of dealing with them than handing them over to tenants with four different annuities clapped on top of them.  They parcel them out in 20 or 40 acres to unfortunate tenants at rents that the tenants are entirely unable to pay.  The estates in my constituency, divided in this manner, are going back to the old system of 11 months' grazing.  Tenants are unable to pay, and the Land Commission is coming down upon them for the annuities.  I personally take the view that the less number of these estates that are taken over between now and the general election, when a National Government will come in that will be able to deal with the question of estates, and the amount that tenants should pay in rent, the better, and that day is not far off.</P>

      <P>It is on the Estimate. Tibb's Eve is not on the Estimate, of course, but that is the Minister's interruption. That is the position.  After all, when we are discussing a Vote on the Land Commission, and the Vote to improve estates, we have to consider the kind of improvement carried out. There is no use giving lands to unfortunate tenants with an accumulation of four or five rents clapped on to them by landlord-inspired Acts.  We all know the anxiety of people to get a bit of land.  They take it over, never dreaming they will have to walk out of it again leaving whatever few pounds they had behind them.  That is what is happening.  I do not believe the money spent in the improvement of estates is spent well.  I believe it is <Col N="2778" /> spent badly and in a wretched manner, and I am taking advantage of this Vote to call attention to the manner in which it is spent.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been close on two years considering the position in regard to the Mount Uniacke estate.  I never saw such a wreck made of any place as has been made of it.  I consider that the Land Commission should take steps with a view to giving employment on the estates which they hold.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>The former owners of these estates gave employment, some of them keeping twenty or thirty men working.  The land is now let on the eleven months' system, and, with the exception of one man to mind the bullocks, no one is employed, so that the last state is worse than the first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should get some of the well-paid agricultural experts on his staff and put them on a farm in order to show us how to make money out of the land.  Apparently the farmers in the Free State, if we are to believe the Minister and the Executive Council, do not know how to make money out of the land.  The De-rating Commission told the farmers that they did not know how to make money.  Let them take a few of the experts who signed the majority report on that Commission and put them in charge of farms so that we may see how they would get on.  Under the circumstances the less money spent by the Land Commission in this way the better until we know where we are, and until we have someone in power who will be able to let the land at a fair rent.  The policy of taking over thousands of acres, paying the loot to the landlord and letting him go and spend the money elsewhere, is not going to get us anywhere, especially when these estates are being let on the eleven months' system.  Estates have been taken over on which twenty and thirty men were employed formerly and set on the eleven months' system. That has been going on from five to ten years, with no one on the lands except a caretaker to mind the bullocks.  To my mind, that is not the way to improve estates.  Unfortunately that has <Col N="2779" /> been the policy of the Land Commission in the Twenty-Six Counties for some years.  If that is the improvement work that is being done I think we should not pay £218,000 for it.</P>

      <P>What I wish to say is that there is one class of tenants who are calling out for attention on the part of the Land Commission and calling eagerly for it and in absolute need. These are the sub-tenants who have not been affected by the recent reductions.  I must say that some of the tenants who have got the reduction are behaving very badly towards the sub-tenants.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that at a very early stage the needs of sub-tenants will be looked after and the necessary steps taken to vest these sub-tenants.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Land Commission cannot do impossibilities, but speaking with some knowledge of Land Commission practice and procedure I am bound to say that the work of the Land Commission during the year 1931 has been a credit not merely to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the staff&mdash;the head of whom I am glad to say is a Corkman, as is naturally to be expected&mdash;but a credit to the country. I make the further appeal that notwithstanding the superhuman efforts that have been made to deal speedily and in an expeditious way with the work that sub-tenants should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. Something should be done to give sub-tenants some relief from their <Col N="2781" /> immediate landlords, and the procedure should not be allowed to continue whereby the immediate landlords get the reductions which the Act gives, and do not pass these reductions on to the sub-tenants.</P>

      <P>Before passing this Estimate I would like the House to be given some undertaking that the money asked for here will be expended in the fair and above-board manner in which all public money should be expended.  I have not the same experience in connection with the Land Commission that Deputy J. T. Wolfe had.  I am not aware that the Land Commission have done things in the magnificent efficient way he tells us they have.  My experience is just the opposite.  As this Vote will mean passing money through the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary I would ask him to give an undertaking to this House that that money will not be spent as the moneys have been spent in the past by the Land Commission for the purpose of advocating the advancement of the members of Cumann na nGaedheal in the various parts of the country.  That is quite opposed to the manner in which State moneys should be administered and the purposes to which they could be devoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give to this House an explanation of that case in Grange, in his own constituency, where the Land Commission have taken over land.  In that case, having taken over a farm they subdivided it, but subsequent pressure was brought to bear from the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation in the district. Pressure was brought to bear upon the individual who had been allotted a certain portion of the estate.  The Land Commission Inspectors, backed by the assistance of the Civic Guards, called upon the man and compelled him to sign a document surrendering his right to the property given to him.  Before this Vote passes through the House I want the Parliamentary Secretary to give an explanation of that case.  I want to say that the ordinary administration of the Land Act, and the decision of the court in Sligo, was a decision that would not justify confidence in the <Col N="2782" /> Land Commission nor in their administration of the public money voted by this House.  I would like to have an explanation from the Secretary on that matter and an undertaking from him that the money in future under this Vote will be spent in a different manner to that in which it has been spent in the past.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Drumshambo, at which the Parliamentary Secretary for Lands and Fisheries was present, another Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. J. N. Dolan, was on the platform, and speaking there he stated that the road work undertaken by the Land Commission in the area was in this position: that the grant was definitely secured by the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation in the district.  In view of this important occasion in which two Parliamentary Secretaries are involved, this House will, and must, have an undertaking that that sort of work shall cease and that the funds that we are asked to vote this evening, which represent money to be secured from the entire taxpayers of the country, will be spent in the general interest of the community and that it will not be spent in the interest of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation in the constituency. That is all I wish to say.</P>
    <P>I refer to this because though this case and others in which the Land Commission are concerned are so glaring that I am afraid I cannot hope for any general improvement, I at least will insist on making my protest here and asking the Parliamentary Secretary responsible to give an undertaking that the money will be honestly spent and that it will be devoted to the purposes for which the House is voting it. The Parliamentary Secretary and his Executive might as well secure public money without ever asking the consent of this House for it, as to get money in the manner in which they are now conducting business.  It is merely a sham coming to this House asking for a grant of money towards the development of Land Commission schemes when the money voted is not spent in an above-board and equitable manner. It is spent through a secret society and a secret organisation inside and outside controls the administration of <Col N="2783" /> these funds.  The money voted to the Land Commission is spent in a manner that is a public scandal, and it has undoubtedly created a very bad impression throughout the country.  I would ask again from the Parliamentary Secretary an explanation as to the spending of that money before this Vote is passed.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question with regard to the drainage of the Little Boyne.  I understand that the inspectors have reported and that the drainage of this river has been engaging the attention of the Land Commission for some time past.  The situation there is very serious, because in its present state this river is causing serious flooding by which a large tract of land is made unworkable.  All parties in the district are in favour of having this relief work carried out.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take that into consideration and expedite the matter so that failing a favourable decision they might look in another direction for relief if the Land Commission does not see its way to carry out the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputies do not expect me to carry the details of all estates in the country in my head and to be in a position to supply information with regard to all State lands anywhere, at any moment.  I am quite prepared to give the Deputies any information I possibly can, but if they want detailed information about estates or the particular work with which the Land Commission has been dealing, then I suggest that they should put down a question on the Order Paper, and I would be in a position to give information.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Derrig, I really cannot indicate to him at the moment the time when the payments under Section 11 of the Land Act of 1923 will cease.  This payment not only covers tenanted land but also governs another class of land which we succeeded in bringing under the Land Act of 1931, namely, lands subject to fee-farm grants or long leases.  What amount will be required for the purpose of paying interest and sinking fund on the bonds issued in respect of the transfer of that class of land I am not in the position to estimate.  But the amount which will fall this year under Section 28 will be reduced very considerably next year, because at the end of the next financial year we will have dealt with practically all the tenanted land in the country.  I can assure the Deputy that in future this amount will be reduced very substantially.  Next year, I am sure the amount ought not to exceed £3,000 or £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the improvement of estates, I want to say that in every estate divided by the Land Commission certain improvement works are undertaken&mdash;works which in the opinion of the Land Commission are considered necessary for the development of that particular estate.  The greater portion of the money advanced for the purpose of carrying out these improvements is by way of free grant and the tenants are only asked to pay back to the Land Commission a relatively small proportion of the money advanced in that way.  It depends entirely on a variety of circumstances <Col N="2785" /> whether they are asked to pay back this money.  The paying back of this money depends on a great many circumstances.  The paying back of this money depends on ability to repay some of the money advanced.  It depends on the annuity fixed instead of the rents, and it depends, perhaps, to a lesser extent on the nature of the improvements which it is proposed to carry out.  In the West of Ireland in the poorer counties this money is advanced almost wholly by way of free grants and only in very exceptional circumstances are the tenants asked to repay any portion of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clery asked me was it proposed to make any compensation to tenants who had been making payment in lieu of rent for a long period of years.  We have in all these cases spent a certain amount of money in improving estates and on homesteads. In some cases we have actually built new houses and before these estates are disposed of finally we propose to spend further moneys so as to still further develop them.</P>
    <P>Then so far as the estates coming under the Act of 1923 are concerned I could not at the moment give Deputy Allen any information of the actual amount of money spent on the tenanted land as distinct from the untenanted land.  I presume it will be possible to get that information. If he wants it I can give it to him at a later date.  We have undoubtedly spent considerable sums of money on the development of untenanted land, much more so than on tenanted land. For that there are two or three reasons.  One is that we cannot spend money on tenanted land until we are in a position to vest that land in the tenants.  Under the recent Land Act, land has been vested in the Land Commission and in the interregnum between the vesting of the land in the Land Commission and the vesting of the fee simple in the tenants it will be possible for the Land Commission to spend a considerable amount of money on the improvement of estates.  We have, as a matter of fact already commenced to spend money on the improvement <Col N="2786" /> of numbers of estates and that procedure will be continued until we have dealt with all the estates under the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Land Commission undertaking such expenditure of money a very exhaustive and a very thorough examination is made of the different estates, and every improvement considered necessary for the purpose of utilising and developing these estates fully is reported upon by the inspectors in charge.  The work of course will naturally occupy a great many years.  I could not say even now, although I was pressed to say when the Land Bill of 1929 was going through the Dáil, how many years it will take to complete that work and I do not think anybody is in a position to form even an approximate estimate of how long the work will take.</P>
    <P>The embankment question is an exceptionally difficult question, and on account of the abnormally wet seasons we have had during the past few years it has become more difficult. There has been flooding in areas during the past four years where there never was flooding previously. At the moment an examination of the whole embankment question is being made by the Land Commission and certain steps are being taken in certain areas in order to repair breaches in certain embankments and where embankments have been weak to strengthen them in many ways, but the money set aside by the Land Commission in days gone by for the purpose of carrying out improvements on many of these embankments is entirely inadequate nowadays for that purpose.  The value of money has changed enormously, wages have increased enormously and the price of materials is considerably higher to-day than in the days when money was set aside for this particular purpose. For that reason in many instances it is necessary for the Land Commission out of the improvement fund, to supplement the amount set aside in the trustee fund for this particular purpose.  We are carrying out a number of improvements to embankments <Col N="2787" /> at present.  We have carried out a number of these improvements during the last year and we propose to carry out even a greater number next year than last year.  I am fully acquainted with the conditions in the area to which Deputy Allen referred.  I told the Deputy a few weeks ago what we proposed to do in that area.</P>

      <P>I admit that the trouble has been in existence for a number of years, but I think the Deputy will realise that it is quite impossible to deal with work on an estate that has not been reached and when there is no money available for this purpose.  Now that the purchase money has been set aside it will be possible to deal with the matter, and a sum will shortly be set aside in order to carry out the work.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to embankments in Kerry, but I am afraid the Deputy is not aware of the conditions in that area.  Otherwise he must have known that an enormous amount of money has been spent on embankments there, not alone in maintaining existing embankments, but in constructing new ones.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to ask for detailed information, but to deal with the question of estates generally. I know some estates that have been acquired by the Land Commission, and for some reason or another they did not divide them immediately after they acquired them.  To give an example, the Lyons Estate has been acquired for more than twelve months, and the Land Commission has set the land for grazing for eleven or twelve months.  Could improvements not be carried out on those estates now as there is so much to be done?  If the Land Commission decide to allot this land in spring, the people to whom it is allotted will have to drain the land and make fences before they are in a position to till it.  Could that work not be carried out pending a division of the estate?</P>

      <P>This question was discussed some few months ago when the Bill was going through the Dáil.

As a matter of fact, I think the Land Commission requested the agent on the Stewart estate to make a report.  On raising the matter again I got a reply to the effect that a report was received and that consideration was being given to the matter.  The position is that these tenants, while a lot has been said about the benefits conferred by the Land Acts of 1923 to 1931, have got no benefit.  They are paying the old rent to the landlord, and I think it is time now that some consideration should be given to the question.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities and sundry Grants-in-Aid, and the Expenses of the Office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is simply a token Vote.  In dealing with the Vote at the beginning of the year, a new item was introduced for the purpose of creating facilities for the training of Irish-speaking nurses and midwives.  The idea was that in the development of the public health services of the Irish-speaking districts we had to have Irish-speaking nurses and midwives.  The idea was that we should take young native Irish speakers from these Irish-speaking districts and give them a period of training as nurses.  It was also the purpose that we should get Irish-speaking nurses already trained and get them trained as midwives, and give them a public health course.  The phrasing in the <Col N="2792" /> Estimate is found to be too restricted to allow us to take nurses who are actually trained and give them a course of training in public health and in midwifery. We have already taken four fully trained Irish-speaking nurses and arranged for their being trained in midwifery and in public health.  To wait until we had trained nurses and then give them a midwifery training would mean that four years would elapse.  That is the system which has been arranged.  This resolution is simply to widen the scope of the estimate in order to fulfil our purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended that this scheme should be confined to native speakers?  Could not a nurse who was a qualified Irish speaker, irrespective of the fact that she belonged to the Gaeltacht area, be entitled to consideration if she had a good knowledge of Irish?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the limited number of places that will be available, if otherwise suitable, preference will be given to native Irish speakers coming from Irish-speaking districts.  But in so far as it is not from Irish-speaking districts having the necessary qualifications and education to take advantage of that training, then persons with an acquired knowledge of Irish will be taken.  But the Deputy will understand the desirability in the first place of giving an opening in this particular way to persons actually in Irish-speaking districts, and the desirability of having nurses and midwives in these districts who have a perfect command of the language and who have an intimate knowledge of the conditions in the area in which they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that persons who would not, in the ordinary event, go forward will now be entitled to go forward for training?  If you have two nurses, one of whom belongs to the Gaeltacht and has a good knowledge of Irish and the other who has a good education and also a good knowledge of Irish, but who has not been brought up in the Gaeltacht, I should not like to see the latter class excluded from any advantage that they might get to enable them to make up for the <Col N="2793" /> loss that they have had owing to failure to practise.  There are cases which the Minister knows of where you have nurses of many years' experience brought into competition with young native-speaking nurses who might not be so good as nurses.  I am simply anxious that all nurses should get a chance if they have a knowledge of Irish to go forward for posts in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I am always disinclined to lay down general principles, but it seems to me that there is something in what Deputy de Valera has said, that if it is in order to make a statement it must be in order to have other statements of a similar character on the same topic.  As to how that can be done is a matter for arrangement. I have given consideration to it, and I can see very great difficulty in the way of a Ministerial statement on matters over which the Electricity Supply Board would seem to have complete power.  The question is one that cannot be very well settled in the House, but, from the point of view of the Chair and the House, the position of independent boards, such as the Electricity Supply Board and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, is of great importance, and we must establish our precedents in the expectation that that kind of board will remain in existence. Consequently, we must have some scheme for discussion in the House which will not impinge on the independence, or upon any of the functions of the Board.  It is difficult to find a half-way house between making a Minister completely responsible and making a board completely responsible.  There is the difficulty. Possibly it can be solved.</P>

      <P>If the affairs of the Electricity Supply Board are to be discussed at all, then we have to determine how they may be discussed. It seems clear that they must be discussed on a motion and not in a casual fashion.  I cannot conceive a worse procedure than a casual discussion on any aspect of the work of a board like the Electricity Supply Board.  That would, it seems to me, create a very bad precedent.  I think we must have <Col N="2800" /> a motion, but I am unable to see how we can have a motion which does not have reference to the Minister.

      <P>I think the motion will have to make some reference to the Board if it is to bring in a discussion of the Board's policy.  A motion of censure upon a Minister should be directed towards a particular matter for which he is responsible.  In any event a discussion in the House on matters of this kind never really leads up to a solution.  I am only stating the view of the Chair, which is that the Chair views with concern the creating of any precedent with regard to the discussion of the affairs of a Board set up by Statute and entrusted with certain functions by Statute.  Deputies can see for themselves where that leads to.  There may be a way of discussing the affairs of the Board, but I should like to have that way put to me.  I should like anyone who wants a discussion on the affairs of the Board to be quite sure before he puts down a motion as to what the scope of the motion is and what the scope of the debate on the motion will be.</P>

      <P>Two months ago, <Col N="2802" /> when a Bill in connection with the Board was before the House, a good deal of stress was laid on the importance of getting, at the earliest possible date, a discussion as to the position revealed by the Board's accounts, as soon as the accounts were available. It was, I think, agreed to by the Minister that in so far as he was concerned he would attempt to give that opportunity for a discussion on these accounts.  The position has altered since then to this extent, that the accounts for one year have been published.  It seems to me to be a matter of importance, as was suggested by the Minister, that the Dáil should be in a position to discuss the position as revealed to them by these accounts in so far as they have been published.  That discussion does not necessarily mean any criticism of the Minister.  It is a position of importance to the country because it shows how we stand when the accounts reveal, as they have done, a certain state of affairs.  I suggest that it should be quite possible on a matter of such importance to have a general discussion on the position from the country's point of view and that the easiest way to bring that about is for the Minister to tell us how he understands the position at present in so far as he has information from these accounts.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It would appear to me that there is actually a particular provision in the Act.  I have not the Act by me as I did not think this matter was coming up.  I have, however, been consulting the Electricity Supply Act and there is a provision in it which makes it incumbent upon the Minister to lay the accounts of the Board before the Dáil. <Col N="2803" /> It would seem to be a reasonable deduction from that that some motion might be taken in the Dáil, but it should be put down in connection with the accounts for 1929-30.  Surely the debate can only refer to the affairs of the year with which the accounts deal. It might be a motion similar to the motion put down with regard to the Report of the Committee on Public Accounts &ldquo;That the Report be now considered.&rdquo;  It would need to be discussed in a particular way and would in the nature of things not be pressed to a division.  That is one kind of discussion on the accounts.  It may be argued that not only would it be in order, but that that was clearly intended by the Oireachtas when passing the Statute.</P>

Questions which may be raised are questions for which Ministers or the Parliamentary Secretaries have responsibility and about which they can take administrative action.  If the Deputy is raising the position of tenants who have had their annuities fixed judicially, then I think the Parliamentary Secretary has no power by administrative action to alter that.  If that is so we are wasting our time in asking him to do it and the Deputy is forcing me into a decision upon a comment he made yesterday, that although you cannot discuss a judicial decision you can discuss the effects of it.  That is a very subtle difference, but I would not agree with that proposition.</P>

I assumed yesterday, reading the question, that there were some cases in which certain persons were in occupation of land and that some action which the Parliamentary Secretary could take, would reduce the rents they were paying, rents more than they ought to pay owing to some action of the Land Commission which the Parliamentary Secretary could remedy.

The Land Commission have to set up annuities in respect of the other seven and I assume that when they do these tenants will also be satisfied.

The landlord in his rental, which he is compelled or required to provide under the 1923 Act, did not return that 40 per cent. reduction.  Now the cases of those seven tenants come up for consideration to have their standard purchase annuities fixed.  Will <Col N="2809" /> that 40 per cent. be calculated or is it the basis on which the standard purchase annuity will be calculated?  If not why?  If it has been calculated in the case of the seven non-judicial tenants whose annuities have been determined, why is it not to be calculated in the case of the others?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary deny that any negotiations were entered into in 1919 or 1920?  In 1919 certain negotiations took place between the tenants who were seeking a reduction in rent and the landlord. The landlord's representative met the tenants and these tenants included the non-judicial tenants.  A reduction of 40 per cent. or 8s. in the £ was given all round.  The reduction was not given on the basis of a bad year.  It was not given on the basis of loss of crops or anything of that kind.  It was given on the basis of land value.  If these people had gone into the Land Court they would probably have got the same reduction.  At any rate it was a suitable time for the re-examination of what these people had to pay.  The land value has not gone up since.  The value of land has been gradually deteriorating down to the present.  In returning his rental the landlord did not give any account of that 40 per cent. and I have here a demand from <Col N="2810" /> the landlord to some of those tenants who happened to be in the non-judicial portion of the estate, and it clearly sets out 40 per cent as the reduction. It does not call it a temporary abatement if there was a temporary abatement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been the practice in this Dáil not to give the names of people who are not here to make a statement on the case.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the names of all the tenants.  If he will pick out the case of any person which he doubts, whether non-judicial or judicial, we will discuss it on that basis.  In the case of an agreement, where one side disputes the authenticity of the agreement, surely the <i>status quo ante</i> prevails.  These people are entitled to go back to the old position and demand the reduction that the landlord had given them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise in so far as the non-judicial tenants are concerned.  The accuracy, or otherwise, of the particulars supplied by the owner has to be decided by the Judicial Commissioner, before considering the question of fixing the annuity at all, and that point having been decided, first of all, I hold that the judicial decision has been already given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

All I can do in conclusion is to ask him whether the 40 per cent. reduction, which it cannot be denied was given by the landlord to these people in the case of the non-judicial tenants, will be taken into account when their standard purchase annuities will be calculated.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether in the case of the other non-judicial tenants whose annuities have been fixed the 40 per cent. reduction has been taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say whether the 40 per cent. was taken into consideration. <Col N="2811" /> In any event from the Land Commission point of view that point is really immaterial.  The rental of the non-judicial tenants was fixed in accordance with the Act of 1929, which provides an arbitrary reduction of 25 per cent.  The tenants objected to that reduction on the basis that it was not adequate.  The Land Commission then revalued all their holdings.  I think the holdings of the fourteen tenants have now been revalued and an annuity has been placed on them in proportion <Col N="2812" /> to their valuation.  In the course of a few months annuities will be placed on the other holdings.  The question of the 40 per cent. does not arise at all as far as the non-judicial holdings are concerned.  The point is that the seven judicial tenants in respect of whose holdings annuities have been already fixed are thoroughly satisfied and these annuities are less as it so happens, than the payment in lieu of rent.</P>
