      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be as well for me to give the Dáil some account of the present position at Haulbowline.  On the 26th June, 1929, I gave a general statement of events since the Saorstát Government took over the island in 1923, and explained that we proposed to let the dockyard if possible, but that whether we could let it or not we had decided to close it down and reduce our staff to a small maintenance party.  On the 8th May, 1930, I stated to the Committee that we had made a temporary letting of the dockyard to the contractors for the breaking up of the &ldquo;Celtic,&rdquo; which went aground in Cork Harbour in 1929.  Although the letting was for this special purpose, the firm (Messrs. Peterson and Albeck) hope to be able to extend their operations and set up a permanent business of ship-breaking in Cork Harbour, and to do some ship-repairing also if that proves practicable; and we are very willing to facilitate them by giving them a long lease of the dockyard if we could agree on suitable terms, and if no better use for it turned up in the meantime.  No better use has turned up; the prospects of shipbuilding <Col N="1252" /> and ship-repairing firms are rather worse now than were in 1929. We have had no offer for the dockyard, though we had inquiries which came to-nothing.</P>
      <P>Rushbrooke and Passage dockyards are now definitely closed down and are selling off their plant.  The Queenstown Dry Dock Company have gone into liquidation.  We have succeeded in making a fair agreement with Messrs. Peterson and Albeck, who have formed a company in the Saorstát (Haulbowline Industries, Ltd.) to work the place. The agreement has been embodied in a draft lease, which will be discussed with the lessees and completed when the Oireáchtas has given its general approval to the transaction in accordance with the terms of the State Lands Act, 1924.  One consequence of the agreement is that a great part of the plant and buildings in the dockyard will have to be scrapped.  This is necessary because they are not required for the business of ship-breaking; but it is also necessary because much of the plant is obsolete or redundant even for the purpose of ship repairing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dockyard was designed for the purpose of repairing ironclads and other large war vessels, and even for that purpose it was not well designed, because it was made up of many additions. It was still less well designed for the purpose of repairing ordinary merchant vessels, and a large part of the plant was either obsolete in design or nearly worn out.  During the last few years we have sold a good deal of scrap from the island.  We were fortunate enough to sell some copper during the boom of that metal, but the present is a bad time to sell scrap or anything else, and we may very probably keep what is left for better times.  We shall act as seems best at the moment.  That part of the plant which is essential for the ship-breaking business is included in the lease to our tenants, and they will be bound to maintain it.  Another part which is useful, but not in good enough condition for leasing, is being sold to them at an agreed price.  The remainder will be disposed of in the open market when the market is more favourable. It is not of great value, and the buildings <Col N="1253" /> which have been abandoned have, roughly speaking, no value at all.  The materials are not worth the cost of demolition.</P>
    <P>All that I have been saying refers to the dockyard only; that is, the eastern part of the island.  The western part contains stone store-houses, a hospital, some 60 houses, some barrack buildings and five oil tanks, three of them large and two small, with a total capacity of 17,000 tons of heavy oil or 14,000 tons of petrol.  We have always hoped to be able to let these oil tanks which are clearly a valuable property if they can be used, but their capacity far exceeds what is needed for the supply of Cork and the neighbourhood. The principal ports for the import and distribution of oil and petrol in Ireland are Belfast, Dublin, and Foynes on the Shannon, and there is no reason to expect that this state of things will change.  We have now negotiated an agreement with a newly-formed firm, the Cork Harbour Oil Wharves, Ltd., which proposes to import oil and petrol in bulk to Haulbowline and deliver it from there in smaller ships to ports in Ireland and Great Britain. This being an entrepot or transit trade depends upon a large turnover and cannot bear heavy charges and at our suggestion the Cork Harbour Board has agreed to a specially low scale of harbour dues on oil and petrol thus tran-shipped. We have every hope that this venture will succeed and will be profitable to the new firm, to the Harbour Board, and to the Government.</P>
    <P>When both these new firms are established and in working order we shall have to take up the consideration of the question what is to be done with the rest of the island, and especially with the houses and their inhabitants. I do not know what the best course will prove to be, but I anticipate that the Government will not continue much longer to manage all this rather troublesome house property on the present philanthropic lines.</P>
    <P>When these leases are made the Government will be relieved of the maintenance of the greater part of the buildings on the island but will have to carry out certain works of restoration which will be properly chargeable <Col N="1254" /> to the maintenance sub-head A.  The total vote is £5,800 as against £4,150 in 1930-31.  In sub-head A, dockyard maintenance, the amount is £4,000, showing an increase of £900, due to the necessity for heavy repairs on the coaling jetty to be included in the lease of the oil tank installation.  Sub-head B, fuel, light and water, amounts to £400. There is a reduction of £250 due to the leasing of the greater part of the island.  Sub-head C deals with alterations to plant and buildings.  The increase of £1,000 is due to the necessity for providing for expenditure that may arise in connection with the disposal of certain surplus buildings and plant in view of the revised arrangements for the leasing of the eastern part of the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would inform the House if portion of the dockyard has been let.  It is difficult to understand if an income is received by reason of the letting, why there should be an increase in the amount of the Estimate. Possibly he can give some information as to the letting and how it was arrived at.  I think some further information is desirable in connection with this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard strange complaints about Haulbowline during the last twelve months, particularly in regard to the machinery which we were told at one period was very valuable. I understand that a large portion of the machinery has been handed over as scrap to people who took the dockyard, and that it has been taken away.  I would like to hear what price was paid for machinery that was supposed to be scrapped.  There is also a reduction in the Estimate for fuel, light and water.  How many people are living on the island to whom we are supplying fuel, light and water?  Who are these people?  Are they employed in Haulbowline or are they people who are residing there without paying rates and taxes?  I would like to know how the maintenance of the dockyard has increased from £3,400 to £4,000, considering the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that portion of the place has been let and that a firm <Col N="1255" /> is working there.  What are the people who are paid salaries doing there?  I notice that £2,900 appears on the Estimate for wages of staff.  What are the staff doing?  I would like to hear what they are employed at.  I would also like to know if a fair wages clause was inserted when Haulbowline was handed over to the people who are using it at present.  What arrangement was come to with that firm? Were they to pay anything whatever for the use of Haulbowline and, if so, was a fair wages clause inserted in the agreement?  I have received several complaints about the wages paid by this firm on the island, and I would like to have some explanation with regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but lest a misconception might arise in the minds of Deputies owing to Deputy Corry's statement I would like to say that Haulbowline has been for many years a white elephant on the hands of the present administration.  Various suggestions have been thrown out from time to time as to how the dockyard ought to be made use of. Attempts were made to interest Irish financiers and others in the possibilities of the dockyard and it was pointed out that it was eminently suitable for at least two or three industries.  Now a firm has taken over the place for the purposes of the oil industry and for oil tankers and they have been considerably facilitated by Cork Harbour Commissioners because it was felt that it was better to have some industry going on there than none at all.  The dockyard was taken over for a period by a ship-breaking firm that was engaged in the breaking up of the &ldquo;Celtic.&rdquo;  That firm went into bankruptcy as a result of the attempts to break up the &ldquo;Celtic,&rdquo; and it was considered a stroke of luck indeed when the oil firm came along and took over the dockyard.  I rose to correct any false impression that might be made lest obstacle or handicap of any character would be placed in the way of persons now paying a fairly decent rental&mdash;I understand something like £650 a year at the beginning&mdash;for the <Col N="1256" /> dockyard.  That rental, I understand, will be increased to £1,500 in a very short space of time.  After all, that is some achievement and it brings in some kind of revenue to the State as well as giving employment.  In dues alone the company which has the dockyard paid something like £600 on one steamer that entered Cork harbour within the last few weeks.  That is some contribution made by an outside firm to the revenue of the port of Cork.  This matter should be handled very gingerly and very delicately. Personally, I did not care to intervene in the debate with regard to Haulbowline because I know the position is very delicate.  We were for a long time looking for some tenant to take the dockyard and we did not care where one came from.  Persons of enterprise have come along and have rented the dockyard and have taken what was a white elephant off the hands of the State.  I welcome the appearance of these people.  I do not know anyone connected with the company, but I know they are an asset &mdash;perhaps not a very considerable asset, but, at least, some asset&mdash;to the State, and they relieved it of a tremendous amount of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. M.J. Hennessy Mr. M.J. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been discussing this item every year since Haulbowline was taken over in 1923.  I am as well aware as other Deputies of the difficulty of getting a suitable tenant for this dockyard.  Now, as Deputy Anthony has pointed out, such tenants have come forward and I think it should be a source of congratulation to the Dáil that the place has been disposed of.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners met this firm that is concerned with the oil tanks very generously and its coming will be a source of very great revenue to the port.  It will further, it is hoped, be the means of inducing shipping to use the port of Cork.  I do not know the firm that has taken the lease either of the oil tanks or of the dock but I presume that the papers will be laid on the Table of the House in the ordinary course.  We should certainly encourage these people to bring business there and they should not be hampered in any way. It is essential for shipping in the port <Col N="1257" /> of Cork that there should be an efficient repairing yard there.  The yard at Rushbrooke is unfortunately in liquidation, so that the only place available now for repair work is at Haulbowline.  I am quite satisfied that the Board of Works will encourage this firm, as far as possible, to deal with repairing work.  I do not know in what stage of efficiency the machinery is but I presume it is able to cope with any work that may require attention at the port.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department to see that there is sufficient machinery in Haulbowline to cope with any repair work that may arise in the future.  It should not go out to the shipping world that the port of Cork is not now in a position to handle repair work.  A statement has been circulated that the only repair dock in the port&mdash;the one at Rushbrooke&mdash;has been closed down.  That statement got wide circulation, so that I think the Department concerned should circularise the shipping world and let it be known that there is an efficient repair yard at Haulbowline.  Now that we have leased the island I think we ought to take serious cognisance of the amount of money we are spending on the maintenance of the place.  I notice an item of £2,900 for wages of the staff.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that there should not be any need in the near future for that item in the Vote. I have not been there recently, but I am afraid very little maintenance work is being done there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there will be any justification in the near future for expenditure of this nature if the company that has taken over the docks, buildings, and machinery are, under the terms of their lease, to be responsible for the maintenance of that property.  The oil company, which has taken over the major portion of the yard, are, I presume, under their lease to be responsible for maintenance of that portion, and I do not think there is any justification now for this expenditure.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would go into this matter and see to what extent he could reduce the Vote.  It is quite possible that there are other buildings <Col N="1258" /> and machinery there which require to be attended to.  Personally, I am not aware that there is.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would deal with that when replying.  I am informed that there was a boat or barge submerged between the basin and the dock entrance.  If that is so, it will be a serious menace to shipping using the dock, and I think the matter should be attended to without delay. The longer the boat lies at the bottom the more difficult it will be to remove it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I was not alluding to the company which has taken over the oil tanks or to the new company which has come in.  I was alluding to the ship-breaking firm which took over portion of Haulbowline twelve months ago, and which have been working there since. If I understand aright, that firm has now transferred its operations elsewhere. I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether or not there was anybody in charge of the machinery in Haulbowline while that ship-breaking firm was there.  I have got very reliable information that some of the machinery which was the property of the State in Haulbowline was removed, and more of it broken up by that ship-breaking firm.  Was it the job of that ship-breaking firm, coming into Haulbowline and taking over portion of the property of the State, for twelve months, to remove out of it some of the property of the State while they were working there? I wonder is Deputy Anthony aware of the conditions there.  Does he approve of a wage being paid by that ship-breaking firm of from 4d. to 7d. per hour?</P>

      <P>I was not talking about any oil company.  I am talking of the ship-breaking firm which has been operating there for the last twelve months.  I notice that £2,900 was paid in wages of staff during the last twelve months.  Was any member of that staff responsible for the machinery? Has the Parliamentary Secretary gone into the amount of machinery that was <Col N="1259" /> there when the ship-breaking firm took over and the amount of machinery there at present, or will he look into that matter and let us have some information?</P>

      <P>Deputy Good referred to two points which, I think, I answered in my opening statement. They had to do with the increase in the cost of maintenance.  We had to increase the amount under this sub-head in order to lease the property. In a letter regarding the letting, it was stated on behalf of the Minister for Finance that &ldquo;he is prepared to approve of the proposed lease of the oil tank installation, together with certain adjoining land, six houses and a wooden jetty at Haulbowline dockyard to the Cork Harbour Oil Wharves Ltd., at a rent of £2,000 a year for a term of forty-two years with power to the lessees to surrender at the end of each seven years; the State to be responsible for initial reconditioning of the premises to the extent of paying the cost (£200-£300) of cleaning and whitewashing the tanks; paying (within a limit of £200) half the cost of painting the tanks and paying up to £1,000 towards the cost of putting in condition and improving the jetty; and the lessees to be responsible for paying rates and maintaining the premises, as reconditioned, in the respects mentioned above and to have an option for five years to lease an additional <Col N="1260" /> piece of land with store houses, etc., at the additional rent of £500 a year.&rdquo;  That accounts for the increase in the maintenance and repair charge.  Deputy Corry asked what the staff are doing there.  As the Deputy is aware, we have reduced that staff very considerably within the last few years.  We still have a considerable amount of machinery and property to look after there and we are looking after it very carefully.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £958,041 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1932, chun Costas an Airm, maraon le Cúltaca an Airm.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £958,041 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for the cost of the Army, including Army Reserve.</P>
      <P>This Estimate shows a slight decrease on that of last year, but it is not significant, and it merely represents the natural variation from year to year.  The Estimate is framed on the policy which I outlined here quite frequently&mdash;that is, a moderate-sized standing army with various reserve forces.  At the beginning of April this year the Army consisted of 529 officers including medical officers, cadets and chaplains; 108 N.C.O.'s and 4,014 privates.  The reserves of the various branches grew steadily.  In April last year there were in &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve 3,500 and at the moment the figure is 4,200.  In the estimate we calculate on an average during the year of 4,800.  We think that that will more or less represent the number we will have during the year.  The &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve has grown from 2,300 to 3,500, but we are calculating on an average during the year of about 4,000 and in regard to the reserve of officers we are calculating on an average of 230 during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far the Volunteer Reserve has been confined to Dublin, but we hope to extend it during the year to other centres.  The O.T.C. has also developed in new quarters since I spoke <Col N="1263" /> last.  It is one of the most striking things in the country at the moment. We have now rather more than 500 members of the O.T.C., and in the various educational institutions where we started that body I think we may say that we have practically got all the members we can expect to get&mdash;that is, eliminating clerical students and people who are temperamentally or physically unsuited.  We have got practically the maximum number that we could expect to get from these bodies. We hope to extend the corps to other institutions during the year.  I signalise that particularly, because I think it is a very hopeful sign to see young students in the country realising their duty to the State, realising to the full their duty as citizens, and also their duty as Irishmen to be submissive to discipline.  That is one of the most splendid responses which we could have anticipated on that side, and it augurs very well for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>As for the financial variation in the Estimate, there is a slight increase in the heading &ldquo;Marriage Allowances&rdquo; of £3,578.  That is due to natural variation. The increase in the pay of civilians attached to military units is about £9,000, and that is due to our policy of largely confining military men to military work.  We find it often more economical to employ civilians in the maintenance and construction of buildings.  The increase of £8,020 in lodging and subsistence allowance is to some extent due to natural changes, and also to the extra allowance of 2/- made to officers living out of barracks. &ldquo;Mechanical transport, petrol, and oils&rdquo; show an increase of £3,785, and that is due to the new arrangements for the transport of Reservists, and it is also reflected in the decrease in subheads H and I.  In the clothing and equipment sub-head there is an increase of £13,633, which is attributable to the increased number of reservists who have to be clothed and equipped. The sub-head &ldquo;Stores&rdquo; shows an increase of £4,561, which is due to natural requirements, the replenishment of stocks, and extending the number of battalions which are being completely equipped.  Barrack services <Col N="1264" /> show an increase of £1,500, due to an increase in a number of things that require replenishment.  There is a considerable increase in the sub-head for the Army Reserve, which is due to the fact that the Reserve is growing steadily.  These are the chief headings under which there is an increase. Otherwise it will be found that the Estimate is almost the same as that of last year.  The difference between this year and last year only represents the normal variation from year to year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The speech of the Minister for Defence, to which we have just listened, introducing this Estimate, left me cold, and I am sure it left the majority of Deputies also cold.  It gave us no information as to the relations existing between the State and the Army, and it omitted any reference to the events which occurred in this country about November, 1930. Surely we are entitled to expect that what practically became an Army crisis&mdash;although that was denied by the Minister at the time&mdash;would have received some attention from the Minister in his introductory speech on this Estimate.  No reference was made except the bare details given of the increases and decreases in the Estimate. No reference was made to Army policy, if any.  No reference was made to the statement issued by Army officers in November last year.  Surely the Dáil, which the Minister claims to be the sovereign assembly of the people in this State, is entitled to some explanation as to why that document was issued and the circumstances under which it was issued.  The Dáil is entitled to a more detailed statement on the introduction of this Estimate than that which was given by the Minister to-day.  There must be something wrong somewhere in the attitude of the Department towards this matter.</P>
      <P>Either it is a lack of policy or a deliberate withholding from the Dáil of information which the Minister believes is absolutely essential for a proper consideration of the Estimates by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the Army Estimate can be realised by going back <Col N="1265" /> to that statement which was issued in 1930.  This is the first opportunity since the statement was issued by the Army officers which has been given to Deputies to consider it, and to consider it in relation to the policy of the Department of Defence.  I propose, therefore, making reference to it to-day.  As I said, a statement of that nature, which was the most damning and the gravest indictment that could be issued by any responsible body of men, in relation to a Department of State, was passed over to-day by the Minister without reference to it.  To refresh the memories of Deputies as to the contents of that document, I have summarised the statement issued by the Cumann Cosanta Naisiunta or the National Council of Defence, which was established on August 28th, 1929, with the approval of the Department of Defence, and with the approval of the Minister, and destroyed in November, 1930.  We have yet to hear a reason from the Minister in respect of that destruction.</P>
    <P>The charges made in the statement issued by the Army officers can be summarised under nine main headings. That document was issued over the signatures of Lieut.-Gen.  Seán MacEoin, Colonel T. Fitzpatrick, Colonel T.E. Gay (retired), Major Roger McCorley (retired).  The first charge over the signatures of those responsible Army officers was that the Department of Defence was incompetent and futile.  In £14,000,000 of public money since 1924. No. 3 charge was that of victimisation of officers and mal-administration in the Army.  No 4 charge was that of flagrant illegal attempts to poison the wells of justice by villainous interference with courtsmartial.  No. 5 charge was that the organisation and system upon which it was administered are so defective that it is doubtful whether it is capable of acting in any circumstances as a useful instrument of national defence.  No. 6 charge was that of having no considered policy for the Army and of making no attempt by the Government to improve its effectiveness.  No. 7 charge was that <Col N="1266" /> no proper steps have been taken to make use of the technical training acquired by officers of the Army who attended courses in military colleges abroad.  No. 8 charge was that no attempt was made to co-ordinate the organisation and training of special corps such as artillery and air.  No. 9 charge was that the cost and the number of civilians in this steadily decreasing Army have continually grown and still continue to do so.</P>
    <P>These are the charges made against the Department of Defence and against the Minister responsible for its administration by four responsible executive officers of the Irish Free State Army, acting for the Cumann Cosanta Naisiunta on the 28th October, 1930.  The matter was glossed over here in the Dáil on a few occasions when a cursory reference was made to it and I, for one, had looked forward to some statement being made by the Minister when he introduced the Estimate to-day to deal with these charges.  In any other country in the world, were a responsible Minister indicted in the deadly and damning manner, in which the Minister was indicted in that document, he would not hold office for 48 hours.  Here with all this talk of a sovereign State and control of the Army by the people, and all this talk of the efficiency of the machine at our disposal, no action is taken.  It is glossed over and ignored and when any reference was made to it, the reference and those who made it were sneered at.  It is time that this question was gone into and it is time that these charges were refuted definitely by the Minister if they can be refuted.</P>
    <P>Further, it is time that the country and the House should know that the charges made by these responsible officers were based on facts.  If those charges were based on facts, no self respecting Government, no self respecting Executive Council would have stood for the administration of the Army under its present control. Surely the Minister for Defence realises that an indictment of that nature calls for a reply.  Surely he is not going to attempt to bluff the Dáil and the country by introducing an <Col N="1267" /> Estimate in which he glosses over the increases and the decreases in transport, warlike stores and staff, whilst a damaging document of that nature is allowed to go without contradiction. Surely he realises that unless some action is taken in regard to it and unless some committee of inquiry or investigation is set up, to find out whether there is any foundation for the statement, there can be no confidence in his administration or no respect for it by the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Estimate introduced here only bears out the statements made by the officers of the National Army, who signed that document last November.  Taking it item by item we come to sub-head No. 1, A.1&mdash;Military and Educational Courses Abroad.  A sum of £2,500 is being voted for that this year.  We find that in the document issued by the Army officers it is stated that &ldquo;large sums of public money have been spent on the professional and technical training of officers, numbers of whom were sent abroad from time to time for this purpose.  No practical steps have been taken to make practical use of the knowledge thus acquired.  In fact it may be said that the methods of administration pursued in regard to the Army, have been such as to nullify the usefulness of this knowledge to the Army as a whole.  Considerable sums have been expended on the equipment of special corps by the provision of guns, aircraft and other military material, but no attempt has been made to co-ordinate the organisation and training of these corps as elements of a properly organised Defence Force.&rdquo;  Yet, members of the House are asked to provide £2,500 for military educational courses for officers abroad.  We find that since 1927 25 officers have been sent abroad and have attended military courses in colleges in the United States of America, in general science, infantry, field artillery, coast artillery and tanks.</P>
    <P>Officers have also been sent to military schools and colleges in England, <Col N="1268" /> and have there attended courses in chemical warfare, military engineering, small arms, anti-aircraft defence, army co-operation, artillery, military science, ordnance administration and army service corps.  We find, according to the statement issued by the army officers at that time, that no attempt was made to utilise the technical training or professional knowledge gained by these twenty-five officers who were sent at the expense of this State to study military sytems abroad.  We find further in looking through the Estimates presented to us that the item for the Irish military college and its equipment has disappeared.  We find that there is no provision whatever made at this late stage to utilise the knowledge gained by these men in a properly centralised educational centre. Coming down along the list we find the same story in practically every sub-head of the Vote.</P>
    <P>In order that the Dáil may realise the manner in which the Army is run, I propose to take the sub-heads one by one and comment on each.  Sub-head A (2) deals with resignations, retirements and discharge gratuities, the amount being £8,040.  We are presented under that sub-head with a demand for that amount, but we find that the Public Accounts Committee discovered that £216,000 was spent in the last year on resignations, retirements and gratuities without the sanction of the Dáil.  We find in the minutes of evidence of the Public Accounts Committee that by direction of the Minister for Finance, this amount was spent, and that by the same Minister's direction also it was decided that it would not be public policy to allow this matter to come before the Dáil.  Have we any guarantee that the £8,040 which we are now asked to vote under this sub-head is going to be the limit of this expenditure in this financial year, or that the Minister for Finance will not come along in a few months' time and vote privately on his own authority a sum far in excess of the amount which we are asked for under this sub-head for resignations, retirements and discharge gratuities?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The contrast between the treatment given to retired, discharged and demobilised officers and N.C.O.'s and the treatment given to the ordinary private soldier strikes one very foreibly when one goes through this Estimate, or makes an investigation into the matter outside.  Everything in the way of consideration was given to the officers and the N.C.O.'s who retired.  Perhaps I should not include the N.C.O.'s, because they did not get very much consideration either.  When one comes to the case of the ordinary soldier who put this State in the position in which it is to-day and smashed resistance to the Treaty in 1922, we find that he was given £1 for each year of service and told to get out.  He was not even given a stamped insurance card.  The Minister has imitated the British military system in many ways, but surely it would not have been too much to expect that, in connection with the ordinary, unfortunate man who joined the Army, not because he loved this State or believed in the Treaty, but because it was a question of economic necessity with him, even though it might cost the State a little more or involve a deduction from the gratuities given to officers, some system would have been arrived at whereby his insurance card at least would be stamped for him on his discharge.  No attempt whatever was made to do anything human in that respect.</P>
    <P>I now come to subhead A3&mdash;Equitation teams at horse shows, £3,200. That is the sum spent on sending Army teams to foreign horse shows.  Surely the Minister could find some better use for that money.  If the Royal Dublin Society, of which we hear so much, is doing the magnificent work for the Irish horse-breeding industry about which the President tells us so often, there should be no need to send teams of jumpers from the Irish Free State Army at the expense of the taxpayer for the purpose of popularising the Irish horse and Irish horse-breeding. The reputation of the Irish horse and of Irish horse-breeding was known the world over before the Irish Free State ever appeared on the map, and will continue to be known long after the Irish Free State has disappeared off the map.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> I now take Sub-head B&mdash;Marriage Allowances, £69,050.  The Minister made a slight reference to that.  I wonder is the Minister aware that there is grave dissatisfaction amongst the ordinary rank and file of the Free State Army in connection with this question of marriage allowances?  Is he aware that a man may have served in the National Army since 1922, and may have expressed a desire to get married, and yet has to wait a long time before it is possible for him to do so?  I suggest to the Minister that he should devote some little attention to this question and find out what the ordinary private soldier in the Army thinks of the quota system on which these allowances are administered.  I come now to Sub-head C&mdash;Civilian employees attached to Army Units, £76,202.  This represents an increase of £9,071 on last year's Estimate.  We find that in the air services sixteen civilians account for £4,642.  Coming back to the statement issued by the Army officers, I find it stated that:</P>
    <P>While the military strength of the Army has been steadily reduced with the desirable object of securing economy in national expenditure, the achievement of that object has been prevented by waste in other directions, and by lack of plans for any considered policy of defence.  At the same time the cost and numbers of civilians employed in the administration of this steadily decreasing Army have continually grown, and continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he found it more economical to employ civilian tradesmen in respect of certain works. The Army has got an engineering corps, and I am perfectly certain that a tremendous amount of the work which these civilian employees are doing could, if that engineering corps were efficient, be undertaken by them. It is a confession of failure and of absolute inefficiency on the part of the Minister's administration to say that he finds it more economical to get that work done by civilian employees, and particularly in regard to engineering works.  Surely, if we have an Army corps of engineers, it ought to be able to reduce that figure of £76,000 by at <Col N="1271" /> least £40,000.  The Minister evidently does not regard the statement issued by the Army Officers in that respect as worthy of any consideration.  There is one strange little item that we find in this Estimate.  The number of chaplains and of officiating clergymen has decreased by three, but that has only resulted in a saving of £10.  That would seem to suggest that some of these clergymen are not getting even a trade union wage.</P>
    <P>Under the heading E and F, Medical Services, Medicines and Instruments&mdash;£22,893&mdash;work out at about £4 10s. per man.  Now, for an Army of 5,000 men it surely is surprising that the Medical Service, even including the provision of instruments and all that, should cost £22,893.  The Army itself, taking the figures given by the Minister, works out at about one officer for each 100 men, or about 500 officers for the total.  But even in spite of that apparent lack of co-ordination and the extraordinary number of officers, the sum of £22,893 for an Estimate for an Army of young men who have seen no service abroad and could not have developed any tropical disease, seems to be a very high figure indeed.  There are also soldiers of the Reserve who are denied the privilege of medical treatment in military hospitals. The Minister should inquire into that case.  If we are paying £22,893, and also if we are subsidising military hospitals, and have an organised National Reserve, surely the soldiers of that Reserve ought, at least, to be entitled to some consideration in the same respect as the ordinary private soldier of the Army is while still in the service.</P>
    <P>Items H and G form very interesting sub-heads.  They deal with the transport of troops and the conveyance of stores.  This is put down at £15,052, while under Sub-head J we are spending on mechanical transport this year £8,807, showing an increase of £3,000. We are supposed to have an efficient Army Transport.  I have seen quite a number of their Crossley tenders and Lancia cars, and particularly Crossley tenders and lorries, and I think they are pretty good.  I have had a ride in <Col N="1272" /> a few of them during war days, and found them all right.  But surely this item of £15,052 could be very considerably reduced if more of the transport of troops were done by Army transport and less by rail.  There is no doubt that in manaeuvres and transference of troops from one place to another excessive use is made of the railways of the country, and the Minister should inquire into the possibility of reducing the amount paid for transport and transference of troops by utilising the Army Transport that is available.  We pay in petrol and oil £5,165, an increase of £363 this year.  That sum is exclusive of the sum paid for petrol and oils for the Air Force.  Surely we could get a better return and more satisfaction for this money than the mere statement that it was spent for the transport and transference of troops.  Most of that work is now done by rail.  That must be obviated if there is to be any commercial or business management in connection with this branch of the Army Department.</P>
    <P>Item O&mdash;General Stores&mdash;£32,224. Under this head of General Stores comes the question in regard to camp equipment, put down at £10,000 this year, showing an increase of £7,050.  It is not surprising that camp equipment this year is going to cost the amount of money it is, because from inquiries I have pursued in connection with this whole matter, I find that the camp equipment used by the Army last year and in the year 1929, was absolutely useless.  Many of the tents were not waterproof, and were not even good canvas, and wherever they were got or bought from, the Minister should make inquiries in connection with his purchasing and disposal board, and should exact a stricter standard of intelligence and business acumen from those who are sent to purchase these tents, and see that they get the goods, and not the dud stuff that they used in 1929.  We find under this head also of general stores &ldquo;books and manuals.&rdquo;  We are paying a nice tidy sum for them.  I hope that if this Vote is passed, and sent to the Department of Defence, the Minister will make it his business to see that no blunder or display of inefficiency <Col N="1273" /> such as characterised the issue of the manual on Military Hygiene last year, as revealed by the Public Accounts Committee, will be displayed this year in the issue of any books or manuals.  The Department of Defence exhibited a desperate lack of efficiency and absolute culpable negligence on the part of the higher Executive and Administrative Officers in connection with that book on Hygiene, which was set in type at a cost of £26.  After it was set in type we were informed that questions of change of policy and copyright prevented its issue.  Surely before any Department of this State, not alone the Department of Defence, but any Department, proceeds to issue a manual of that description, care should be taken before an order is given to the printer to put it into type, to see at least that the policy the manual is supposed to expound is definitely decided upon by the Department concerned. That did not occur in this case, and we have no guarantee that it will be done in future.  There was certainly inefficiency on the part of some Executive Officer in the Department who was directly concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item of importance is the question of warlike stores&mdash;£87,523&mdash;or an increase of £14,561.  Looking through that item for warlike stores, we find a very big increase in certain items, which leads me to believe that the Department of Defence is preparing to spring a surprise on somebody or other, and that they are preparing for war.  I hope not.  We come to the question of guns and carriages £28,728. I would like to know from the Minister for Defence when concluding the debate <Col N="1274" /> whether these materials purchased by the Army are A1 stuff or secondhand stuff, that is, cast off stuff from Woolwich Arsenal.  I would like to know whether the artillery is absolutely brand-new turned out from the factory, or whether it is re-conditioned stuff issued by the British Army Deposits Board at Woolwich.  It would be very interesting to know that, because the percentage of replacements seems to be extremely high in connection with these items.  On 26th March of this year I put the following question to the Minister for Defence:</P>
    <P>Whether there is an Anti-Aircraft Gunnery Unit attached to the Artillery Corps of the Army, and, if so, will he state its strength in personnel and pieces.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me the following reply:</P>
    <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  It is not considered in the public interest to give the information asked for in the second part of the question.</P>
    <P>I think that this Dáil is entitled to know from the Minister for Defence, or if the Minister for Finance is the Director-General of the Army at the moment, then, from him, what it is paying for.</P>
    <P>It is entitled to know where exactly this Army stands and what its strength is and whether it is efficient or whether it is not.  In regard to this business of saying that it would not be in the public interest to answer the second part of the question why would it not?  Surely the Minister does not mean to insinuate that the British Government, who are the only people concerned with our strength, do not know how many pieces of artillery or anti-aircraft gunnery we have.  Surely he does not mean to tell us that he has purchased them surreptitiously from Soviet Russia, the United States or somewhere else.  The British know the number of field pieces we have obviously because we purchased them from them.  Therefore why should not this Dáil and the people of this State be entitled to know?  Why should the Deputies of this House, who are elected to represent the ratepayers of <Col N="1275" /> this State, when they ask what is the exact strength and in what way progress is being made, be denied that information as if it were going to matter whether the people of Ireland knew whether we had one battery of anti-aircraft guns or three?  The Minister should give a more comprehensive statement than that when introducing an Estimate of this type, because as far as I can see, judging from the statements he made in the past two years when reading through the debates, the two services in the State about which no one knows anything are the Army and the Secret Service.  When Deputies endeavour to elicit from the responsible Minister some information with regard to the strength and personnel of the various units of the Army they are met with a hedging reply or a point blank refusal.</P>
    <P>Deputies are entitled to have and the Minister for Defence is not playing square with the Dáil when he refuses that information.  If Deputies do not get the information here in this House it puts them to the trouble and inconvenience of going to other sources for it.  When I could not get the information I wanted here I had to go to other sources.  One of the sources to which I went gave me information which I afterwards verified to the effect that up in a shed in Islandbridge Barracks for the last eight years there was a battery of anti-aircraft guns with the breach locks removed.  That statement is based on fact and I challenge the Minister to deny it.  Those anti-aircraft guns were never used.  We bought another battery.  There is something about it here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.  I will show them to you if you turn me loose on Islandbridge.  The Department of Finance on the 19th December, 1927, sanctioned expenditure of £10,900 for the purchase of a battery of anti-aircraft guns.  Then we find that although the battery of anti-aircraft guns arrived no attempt was made to put them to the obvious use for which anti-aircraft guns would, in any normal country under any normal administration, be put, to wit the defence of the country and particularly of its aerodromes.  We find from the inspection of Baldonnel Aerodrome, which is the central air port of the Irish Free State, that there is absolutely no ground defence whatever.  We find here in this Estimate that even the item for night lighting is erased, meaning in effect that there is not going to be any night flying.  Surely the Minister is aware of this and if he is aware of the anti-aircraft guns in Islandbridge he should be aware that Baldonnel has no ground defence.  It is useless to talk of air services when utilisation is not made of things at our disposal.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head P&mdash;Ammunition&mdash; there is an amount of £32,320, that is an increase of £20,425.  Deputy Gorey had better beware.  It seems to me that this increase in ammunition points to something and the Dáil would be very anxious to know what exactly it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fact I elicited, and which I challenge the Minister to deny, was to the effect that there is a tremendous waste of ammunition in the National Army, particularly during manoeuvres and training.  A certain amount of ball ammunition is given to troops for firing.  They are told to get out and shoot, &ldquo;let it go and do not come back with a round.&rdquo;  These rounds cost money and this training is a wash out.  It seems to me £20,425 of an increase in this year's Estimate for ammunition is too tall an order for this Dáil and the Minister ought to give some explanation as to how it is proposed to use it.  We remember of course and make allowance for the difficulties of the Civil War.  When Army officers got married there were 40,000 or 50,000 rounds expended in a <Col N="1277" /> general salute when they left the church on their honeymoon.  We allow for that and understand it.  That was in excited times and people were anxious to fire off a lot of steam who do not want to do it now.  Nowadays when there is peace, when &ldquo;we have restored law and order and established the people's State on a solid basis,&rdquo; surely we do not want to spend £20,425 of an increase this year on 303 ammunition.</P>
    <P>In connection with that I would like to know whether the Lee-Enfield rifle has been standardised as the official and accepted rifle of the National Army, because there has been a development in connection with rifles, notably in the United States and France, and lately in Britain.  A new type of rifle has been evolved, of which, I am sure, the Minister is aware, as a result of his attendance at the Imperial Conference in London.  I would like to know, when he is concluding this debate, whether he has definitely standardised for all time this Lee-Enfield rifle which the Army possesses at present, or has he decided to get in touch with modern developments in the improvement and progress of rifles, not alone in England but elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would like to know, also, whether the stocks of rifles which the Army possesses at present are brand new, and whether the rifles this State spent a big amount on for the past seven or eight years are new.  I do not mind the Civil War years.  Then things had to be done in a hurry.  We had to be suppressed, and any old gun was good enough to do it.  Nowadays it is different; we want to see, if we are going to have this Army and this expensive establishment, that we are going to have value.  I would like to know from the Minister for Defence whether the rifles in use by the National Army at present are brand new Lee-Enfield rifles, or reconditioned British rifles whose term of life is about 2,000 rounds.  If he makes inquiries he will find something to astonish him, as I found.</P>
    <P>There is another item&mdash;Small Arms, £3,500.  That is an increase of £2,800. If small arms can be taken to mean revolvers, I do not see what is the <Col N="1278" /> need at all for purchasing that number or for spending any money whatsoever on them, because the Minister knows as any Deputy who has any experience of the National Army knows that every officer and ex-officer has about half a dozen of them, and could rig up an arsenal without very much trouble.  Why throw away £3,000 on small arms now?  There is no need unless, of course, they have been doing such a tremendous amount of shooting that the guns they have are of no use. Yet we have not heard very many shots in this part of Ireland in recent months.</P>
    <P>There is another little item that puzzles me on looking through these Estimates&mdash;that is, the question of armoured cars.  I know that we got a lot of them in 1922 with a very unenviable reputation.  I would like to know something about the armoured cars that we purchased since 1922, whether they were brand-new from the factory or whether they were reconditioned British ones, whose engines were not A1, and whose Vickers equipment were not A1.  These are items that occurred to me on running through the Estimates as deserving of more attention than has been given to them to-day.  I think this Dáil is entitled to the information.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-head P we have an item, &ldquo;Miscellaneous Warlike Stores.&rdquo;  In connection with that item there is quite an assortment of complaints against the Department of Defence. We entered into a contract in 1927-28 for the supply of a tank.  According to the Public Services Account, the tank was to be complete with engine and gun at a cost of £14,630, and for spare parts to the value of £4,000. Provision for the whole expenditure was made in the Estimate for 1928-29, and £13,972 10s., or 75 per cent. of the contract price was charged in the accounts for that year.  Delivery was made in March, 1929, and subsequent examination disclosed defects in the tank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>Appropriation Accounts 1929-30, Saorstát Eireann.  Ordered by Dáil Eireann to be printed 18th <Col N="1279" /> February, 1931.  Page 19, paragraph 52.  &ldquo;Delivery of this tank was made in March, 1929, and subsequent examination disclosed defects in the tank, the engine and the gun.  The tank complete was not reported as satisfactory until the 6th August, 1930.&rdquo; We had an absolutely useless tank attached to the Army, a tank which I have reason to believe was not in a position to be worked by any officer then attached to the Engineering Corps or the Mechanical Transport Corps of the Army.  The Minister for Defence may deny that, but we find that in the list of schools which were given here as being the schools attended by officers of the National Army, the Army Tank School, Wyoming, U.S.A., was the school to which our officers went to acquire a tank training.  For the sake of the Department's efficiency, and any little bit of reputation that is left to it as an administrative unit, the Minister ought to take steps to inquire into the statement which was circulated around this State, and particularly around this city, that there was no man in the National Army who could work that tank because of the fact that it was a British tank.  That is not saying that there were men in the National Army who could not work British machines of all descriptions.  It was because of the technical training of the officers who were trained to use American tank machinery.  But we have in the Army an engineering corps who are supposed to be efficient.  We are supposed to have acquired all the essentials of a small but very effective defence force here.  We had a tank twelve months some place in Dublin; nobody could fix it.  For twelve months it was lying there, a white elephant, and then when it was fixed and ready for action we find that no training was given in tank warfare to any special corps of the Army.  Why invest in articles of military warfare of that nature without the slightest intention of making any possible effective use of them afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why put the people of this State to an expense of £14,800 for a machine which, if this Army is to be a home defence army, is absolutely ineffective <Col N="1280" /> and useless as an instrument of warfare in this country.  If the Minister maintains that the Army must have a tank training that means the Army is going abroad, and the people of this State will want to know something more about that before they allow the Minister to get away with it.  Another thing that strikes me in connection with that tank transaction is that it reveals a state of as hopeless inefficiency and absolutely ineffective business methods, as did the purchase of reconditioned rifles, bad bell tents and defective aeroplanes.  When the Minister is sending anyone of his Department to purchase any of these articles of war surely he ought to send somebody who knows something about it. He ought to send somebody who has had practical experience of testing and of purchase.  Supposing this State had to face a tremendous rebellion to-day or in twelve months time and that tank was idle, what would happen?  Lost!</P>
    <P>Then we come to another aspect of Army administration.  There is a sum of £22,000 in this Estimate for battalion equipment.  I confess that I am dead on that.  I do not know what it is, but I would like to know.  I hope the Minister will enlighten the House before he concludes the debate as to what exactly battalion equipment means and how this £22,000 is going to be spent.  Assuming for a moment that this is a modern army, that we have an effective defence force, a force capable of maintaining its own against any other force, for instance of equal size; assuming this Army is being given a proper military training, one of the chief essentials of modern wars is steel helmets.  I have made some inquiry into the type of steel helmet used by the National Army.  I have inspected some of them.  I find that an ordinary sharp stone that the Minister might pick up on any road in the Saorstát, if fired with any little bit of force, will put a dinge in the steel helmet.  That means that the steel helmets are absolutely dud so far as sharpnel is concerned.  It means that the steel helmets are no use whatever, and that if the balance of the helmets are like the specimens I inspected, then they are not alone absolutely ineffective, but they are positively <Col N="1281" /> dangerous for any soldier to use.  It seems to be the old trench pattern used in the early days, slipping down under the chin and over the eyes.  The Minister ought to inquire into that item to see exactly how it stands.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective and essential weapons for modern warfare is the gas mask.  As I said, since we could not get any information in the House, we have had to go elsewhere, and we find on investigation that in the National Army up to quite recently there was no supply of gas masks, except about a half a dozen per battalion for training purposes, and even the half-dozen they had for training purposes were useless. I have seen a couple of them.  I have had them explained to me by a competent expert on gas masks, and he explained that they were absolutely useless because of the fact that breathing destroyed vision.  In an O.K. gas mask breathing should clear oxidised gas.</P>
    <P>The National Army gas masks are absolutely useless, and the training which the troops got in these gas masks is equally as ineffective as the administration of the Army in other ways.  We find down here in the Estimate that there is no money for anti-gas stores this year.  Why?  If this Army is supposed to be a modern unit and up-to-date fighting machine, surely the Minister, if he has any considered policy of defence, must realise that one of the weapons in modern warfare is gas, and he must realise that, whether he signed fifteen or twenty Covenants on Disarmament in Geneva or Kellogg Pacts.</P>
    <P>A little item which appeared in the journal of the American Engineering Society of December might give the Minister's Department cause to think if they could only realise its bearing on this State of ours and on its Army. Since the signing of the Kellogg Pact more money has been spent on gas and on the production of new poison gas, and more money has been voted by the different States in the race for premier place in armaments on the provision of modern gas protective devices than had been voted during the four years previous to the signing of the <Col N="1282" /> Kellogg Pact.  Yet here in this State we have no money whatsoever provided for anti-gas training.</P>
    <P>Going back to the gas training which the Army received, certainly a few men were put through the field with gas masks on.  But that is not a training in gas warfare.  Gas warfare training is not given to the National Army, and I want definitely to tell the Deputies here that not only is no effective gas warfare training given, but not even is there training given in the smoke clouds used for giving the troops an idea of what gas warfare would be like in modern circumstances.</P>
    <P>In other words, so far as we have gone in these Estimates, we find that whereas there have been increases in items of a non-essential character, there have been consistent decreases in the amount of money asked for in the only effective weapons of modern warfare&mdash;gas, mechanical transport and air.  Another little item in connecnection with the training of the Army with which I have great fault to find is this: Not alone is the Army receiving no training in gas warfare, but as a whole they are being given no training whatsoever in modern trench warfare, and modern trench warfare, as the Minister knows, is one of the items which is very likely to be useful to this country in the case of hostilities, because, as he says, he has to get an Army which can stand up and fight, not an Army which is a small collection of toy soldiers.  We have been sending men abroad for training in America and England, and we also afford the soldiers here an opportunity for engaging in mimic warfare.  That has not been done.  Playing at war, playing at being soldiers is all it is. Certainly they have got instruction in how to shoot, they have got instruction in how to fix bayonets, and how to round up Republicans, but the Army should have a greater object than that. The object of the Army should be the defence of the State against all external enemies, and it has not got the training necessary for that.</P>
    <P>We come now to the sub-head, barrack maintenance.  We find here £19,410. That is an increase of £110 for kit and rifle racks.  We were told <Col N="1283" /> that the Minister was gradually reducing the Army through reasons of economy, and that many posts had been evacuated.  It seems, therefore, to me that the money spent on kit and rifle racks in the few barracks we have left is out of all proportion.  It must be that some of the Army have got out of hand somewhere and wrecked the barracks and the racks. Surely on no grounds could this figure of £19,410 be substantiated unless there had been a considerable number of breakages.  Kit and rifle racks are things that could not break unless there had been pressure and unless there had been deliberate destruction. I would like to hear some more from the Minister about kit and rifle racks before he concludes the debate.</P>
    <P>We find that a sum of £3,000 is put down for furniture.  That is an increase of £1,000.  We had a pretty big Army here for the last nine years, and, particularly, for two of the nine years, and during the time that that Army was in process of formation there was no stint and no economy practised.  There was no definite attempt to save money on anything so long as the objects were achieved.  I am perfectly certain from a visit to a few places that the barracks which we still maintain are quite well enough equipped at present with furniture and there ought to be in the Army supply stores sufficient bedding to do the 5,000 troops we have left in the standing Army at the present moment.  That is a very unsatisfactory item and I do not think that the Dáil should pass it without hearing some more information on this matter from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In sub-head X, there is an item of £100 asked for training for civilian occupation. That is another little item about which I would like to hear something. Where is that training given, how is it given and to whom is it given?  We know nothing at all about these matters.  The Dáil is kept in ignorance the same as if it were a group of children or of wild people who had no right to know what is done with the money.  The Dáil and the country have a right to know and <Col N="1284" /> the Minister must give a satisfactory explanation of these items if he is to satisfy the people of this State that they are getting the value he says they are getting out of this Army and out of this Estimate which runs into close on two millions a year.</P>
    <P>Coming to sub-head Y, the office of the Minister, I find there is a staff there of 223 costing £53,640, to run an Army of 5,000 men and a reserve of about 16,000.  I have never had an opportunity except on one occasion to get a look at the inside of the Parkgate Street headquarters, but I am perfectly satisfied that that staff of 223 could not be substantiated on inquiry. It is a staff for which there is absolutely no need.  At the very least a cut of fifty per cent. could be made in that staff and the Army would lose none of its efficiency.  The Minister ought to make some inquiry as to the possibility of reducing this staff.  Take that staff in comparison with the General Headquarters Staff in other armies and in other countries, in their Departments of Defence, and it must be admitted that it is quite absurd.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Y.2 deals with Army reserves.  We find on examination of the military strength of the Irish Free State that 8 of the population are included in the Army and reserve.  We find that we have about 23,000 of those. I remember reading at one time a statement by Field Marshal Earl Roberts of the British Army&mdash;and we have a great admiration for the British Army in many respects.  On his authority it was stated that reserves of the type that we have in this State, and on which we are spending a lot of money, can never produce soldiers trained to stand the strain of modern war.  Before the Minister embarked on this question of an Army reserve he should have taken more time to inquire into the advisability of spending money on a type of force which, to my mind, will be absolutely ineffective.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the standing Army we have, which is there to prevent rebellion and all that stuff, and let us consider also that that Army is not getting a modern military training in the strict sense of the word.  Surely <Col N="1285" /> thirty days a year could not be sufficient to train any man into being an effective or efficient soldier?  He may have had previous experience of the Army.  That experience, so far as we can judge by the figures relating to demobilisation, was confined to the Civil War period, when guerilla fighting was the modus operandi. That, probably, will not be the case in the future, and the Minister should take a little more time before he embarks on a scheme of Army reserves and a volunteer corps.</P>
    <P>In Cork City we are to have a reserve of artillery.  The posters are fine, and the appearance of the soldier on the poster is very nice.  The advertising campaign is very effective so far as appearances go.  I wonder would it be possible to find out what percentage of the money expended on this volunteer reserve and the Officers' Training Corps went in advertising? This advertsing campaign seems to have cost a lot of money, and I do not think it is worth it.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Estimate we find a refund of £500 in respect of civil aviation.  At the very top of the Estimate we find that there was £10 granted by way of assistance to civil aviation.  We are going to get £500 back for an expenditure of £10.  The Minister should give us some information as to the assistance given to civil aviation.  What assistance could £10 bring about?  Is that sum a measure of the Minister's appreciation of the development which civil aviation should make in this country?</P>
    <P>On a prior occasion I was told, when I asked a question with regard to pilots' licences, that it was a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Surely the Minister should have some interest in this matter, and he should be able to inform the House how and in what way civil aviation is being assisted?  What could be done for £10 that would be worth anything at all?  If the Minister could run other services at a cost in proportion to the assistance which he is giving to civil aviation the people of the State would indeed be very grateful to him.</P>
    <P>There is one item in connection with Army administration with which I have not dealt, and that is the Air Force. <Col N="1286" /> For about two months I have been endeavouring to elicit information with regard to our air service.  Any student of modern history or modern warfare will admit that the most effective and efficient system of warfare is that carried on in the air.  The Minister may smile, but this is an important matter. He may not smile some day if a British bombing plane comes over here and blows him up.  The air service is the most efficient and effective method of warfare.  All foreign countries that find it necessary to join in the race of armaments have increased their air votes since the Kellogg Pact was signed.</P>
    <P>In the Irish Free State we find the air service, which has been in existence since 1922, is composed of seventeen pilots, five observers and ninety-one mechanics.  We have twenty-one planes, of which fourteen are effective.  That was the position on 26th March.  The fact is that we have not a complete crew for the planes we possess.  We have not got sufficiently trained pilots to man each one of the planes we have. Surely, after nine years of effort, there should be something more gratifying to record than the fact that we have more planes than pilots.  In a small State like this every plane should be made use of, and every pilot should be made an effective instrument of war.  If the Air Force is to be taken seriously as a unit of national defence that should be the position.  We have on the reserve one pilot, one observer and seven fitters.  If, to-morrow morning, there was an international conflict we would have exactly eighteen pilots for our planes, and only fourteen of the planes can fight.  That is a very disgraceful state of affairs for the only effective instrument of war in our possession.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the planes, we have very little information in regard to them; that is why I am so anxious about them.  The only type of plane I have seen advertised as having been purchased by the Free State was a heavy bombing plane.  The only one I have seen photographed on its arrival here was a heavy bombing plane. Even one with an elementary knowledge of war and aerial defence will realise that bombing planes in the Irish Free State air force are absolutely a farce.  If the Minister intends <Col N="1287" /> to make the Air Force effective he should realise that single-seater fighters, which can rise quickly at the enemy and demoralise and destroy him, are more effective than the heavy machines which cost twice as much. The people are entitled to know what the bombing planes are for.  Are they to be used for the purpose of bombing towns and villages in the State or are they to be used for the purpose of invading England?  We are entitled to get some definite information about this unit of the Army around which there has been such a cloak of secrecy for the last eight years.  The only way we can get information is by questions and we do not often get an opportunity of hearing satisfactory answers.</P>
    <P>We find in connection with the air force that the number of crashes during the last seven years has been considerable.  There were sixteen crashes involving the total destruction of the planes and in about the same number of cases the crashes resulted in partial destruction.  The figure seems to me to be abnormally high.  There were sixteen crashes and five fatalities in connection with an air force of eighteen men.  The Minister ought to take some steps to abolish the Air Force altogether and not put the people of the State to the expense of buying planes.  If an attack were made on this country our Air Force would be absolutely ineffective for the purpose of defence.  The Air Force that we have is all right for toying round with and crashing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had listened carefully, as I am sure he did, at the Imperial War Council in London, he should have heard something about fairy planes and fairy fox planes, small scout machines which are a million times more effective and much less expensive than the big bombing type of planes now used in the Free State.  As the army officers stated in their manifesto last November there seems to be no considered policy whatever in defence.  It strikes me that since we have ceded the maritime defence of this State and ceded also the air defence of this State to Great <Col N="1288" /> Britain, we might as well cede the ground defence and save £1,400,000, which could be used for purposes for which it is badly needed, to provide employment in industrial undertakings or something of that nature, and not continue this farce, because it is a farce.  Again, in connection with the administration of the Air Force, we find that in the purchase of planes since 1922 the amount expended has been something like £85,000 on new planes and £55,000 on spare parts.  Does the Minister not see something absurd in that?  Does his Department not see something absolutely ridiculous in spending £55,000 on parts to £85,000 on brand new planes, most of which are gone, and that the number of effective fighting machines of all types in the service in March, 1931, is 14?  With the amount of spare parts purchased for this Army Air Defence Force since 1922 there should be enough spare parts in Baldonnel to manufacture new planes without going to England for any more.  It is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of the efficiency of the Air Force, and whether it is recognised as a service of the Army at all.  We had public recruiting appeals for University Officers' Training Corps; we had public recruiting appeals for the ordinary type of service in the Army, but for this one effective method that we have of defending these shores and the one effective unit of a modern war on which we should concentrate all available attention, we find that the officer commanding the Air Force is permitted to attest such suitable applicants as present themselves for enlistment, and in addition power is given to transfer to the corps men from other units whose qualifications would seem to make them suitable for it.  That is the only way in which this little Air Force of 18 pilots and six observers can be brought to anything like a decent strength.</P>
    <P>There was no public recruiting campaign for suitable types of men, and no attempt even in the Army for the past seven or eight years to get men for that service who might be considered suitable, so that it might be <Col N="1289" /> made an efficient unit and not the laughing stock that it is.  I asked a question on the 26th March as to whether any scheme to recruit mechanics and boy apprentices was under consideration. We have been for eight years with an Air Force as a unit of the Army, and that force has been without mechanics.  The Minister may attempt to gloss over these points.  Out of the total Vote for the Army only about one-fiftieth of the amount is spent on the Air Service.  If the Minister's Department and if the Council of National Defence cannot see something wrong with that, then they are absolutely unfit to be in charge of this State, and the Executive Council should sit up and take notice of it.</P>
    <P>Another little item, but a very significant one, was the answer given to a question I asked on the 26th March as to what steps, if any, had been taken to implement Article 7 of the Treaty of 1921 in respect of annex I.E. and 3. The answer was: &ldquo;No steps have been taken to implement Article 7 of the Treaty in respect of annex I.E. or 3 thereof.&rdquo;  No steps have been taken yet in that connection, and we find aviation in this country in the retrograde position in which it is, the absolute laughing stock of every civilised nation in Europe, the absolute limit in inefficiency on the part of the Department supposed to be in control. No attempt whatsoever has been made since this Treaty of 1921 was signed to clarify the position with regard to the proposed air convention between the British and the Irish Free State Governments.  How long is the Minister going to allow that to continue before he wakes up?  The people of this State, after nine years, do not know where they stand in relation to that Treaty of 1921.  The people of the State are entitled to know where they stand and before any more war-like speeches are made, and before any more propagandist appeals to the people are made, the Minister ought to explain to the people what their future commitments will be.  We want to know where we stand in regard to this air convention.  We want to know, after nine years, what arrangements will be made whereby the Free <Col N="1290" /> State Government will have control over the air.  We want to know if that is not possible, why it is not possible? We want to know that before any further attempt is made to delude the people into believing that we are a sovereign and independent State.  We have a Treaty signed in 1921 not yet clarified, with portions of it not yet elucidated and with arrangements in it not yet made.  Surely, it is time that some action was taken in that connection.</P>
    <P>I have gone through this Estimate, and I have attempted to show the Minister that in many respects the Army of this State is sadly lacking.  It is either an Army or it is not.  It is either intended for serious defensive purposes or it is not.  It is either intended for serious offensive purposes or it is not.  The sooner we know whether it is or not the better.  The sooner the Minister answers this challenge in the statement of the Army officers&mdash;that there is no considered policy of national defence&mdash;the better, not alone for the people of this State, but also for the people outside this State, for the people in England, for the people in control of British war administration at the present moment, because we find a very serious and very disquieting article, entitled &ldquo;The Politician's View of the Problem of Defence,&rdquo; in the current issue of &ldquo;An t-Oglach,&rdquo; the official organ of the Free State Army.  Various reasons have been given, and various insinuations have been made, as to the identity of the author of this article.  Some have put it down to the Minister for Finance, and some have suggested that it was written by the Minister for Defence.  Whoever wrote it, it appears in the quarterly official publication of the National Army, &ldquo;An t-Oglach,&rdquo; and it was evidently written by somebody responsible.  The terms of that article are very serious and disquieting for the people of this State.  The article says that &ldquo;the Army must be prepared in the last resort to fight for their rights, even when a military struggle may in itself be hopeless.&rdquo;  That is quite right.  I hope that if there is a military struggle of this type and if the Army has to fight for its rights, that the Minister will not succumb, in the <Col N="1291" /> face of hopeless military odds, as he did once before.  I hope the Minister's mind and the mind of the Executive Council will be made up.  I shall quote the next paragraph of this article at length because of its importance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some people in this country are unable to think of any assailant of the Saorstát other than England.  But so long at least as the British Commonwealth holds together, we have no reason whatever to fear an unprovoked British attack.  On the other hand, our membership of the Commonwealth, as well as our proximity to Great Britain, ensures that no outside country which is not either already at war with Great Britain or seeking a pretext for war with Great Britain will attack the Saorstát.  The position, therefore, is that we shall be faced with a war situation here only if, and when. Great Britain is engaged in a conflict with another State or States&mdash;I might even say with a European State or States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the only war situation which can be visualised by the writer of this article is a situation in which England would be involved in conflict with a European State or States.  The writer goes on to deal with the possibility of war with the United States of America.  He rules that out, and says that the only war we need fear is a war between our Eastern neighbour and a European enemy.  He proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are possibilities in the situation on the Continent which most students of international affairs regard as disturbing, and if war broke out between certain European combinations the British might become involved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a statement made in recent times, it was laid down that in the event of these islands being attacked, this country would, of course, have to get into the conflict&mdash;in other words, if Britain were involved in a war, this country would become involved.  The article goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If England were at war with a European State, whether singly or <Col N="1292" /> in alliance with others, nothing could enable the Saorstát to escape the consequences of the struggle. In that case Ireland might be subject to air raids of a serious kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have an Air Force of 21 planes, 14 of which are effective, and only about 3 of which were efficient for repelling attack.  Here, in the official journal of the Army, is absolute confirmation of the statement issued by the Army officers last November, in which they charged that the Minister had no policy of national defence.  Here it is definitely stated in an article which is ascribed to the Minister for Defence or to the Minister for Finance, that in the event of Britain being involved in war we could not escape the consequences and might be subject to serious air raids.  It is not a question of &ldquo;might be.&rdquo;  It is a definite certainty, and we have nothing to prevent these air raids&mdash;absolutely nothing. Then the justification for the Army follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we had no Army, or only a very small Army, it is certain that large numbers of British troops of various kinds would be thrown into the Saorstát.  Their commander would be the real ruler of this country for the duration of the war, and neither the people not the Government would be able to make any effective stand for national rights. On the other hand, if our Army were sufficient in size, or capable of sufficiently rapid expansion, there would most probably be no influx of British troops at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Army or no army it is only a probability that there would be no influx of British troops.  Under the Treaty, the British have a right to come in here in time of war or strained relations and to demand facilities.  We may be sure that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is not before that word &ldquo;facilities.&rdquo;  They will get those facilities.  The article proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Equipment in addition to any that we should have in stock might have to be provided but, doubtless, the British would be willing to supply it if assured that there was no danger of our using it against them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Those are significant words.  Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we had no adequate defence force of our own, the result would in such a juncture be that Ireland would be held and ruled by British forces as if it were part of England and if the continental powers were victorious, they would treat the Saorstát worse than they would treat England.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That article presupposes that we have a defence force here, an efficient defence force, and it takes it for granted that that force is capable of rapid development and extension in any eventuality that might arise.  Yet we have no munition factory, and we have to import any supplies we want from Britain.  We have not even made any attempt in the engineering line to train our troops in the art of pontoon bridge building.  We have not made any attempt to train on a national scale the Army in the art of barbed wire entanglements which can be run up in five minutes.  We have not made any attempt to make the air force an effective unit of national defence.  We have given no gas training to the soldiers.  We have not supplied effective steel helmets in case of war.  The article presupposes that we have a national defence force which is efficient.  We have not, and the statement issued by the Army officers last November, that the organisation and system upon which it is administered, are so defective that it is doubtful whether it is capable of being made in any circumstances a useful instrument of national defence, is borne out by the experience we have had when looking through the Estimates, the statements made in this article, and the answers of the Minister for Defence to the questions I put to him with regard to the Air Force.  It is time we knew where we were in regard to this Estimate.  It is time this £1,400,000 to be expended on the creation of an efficient Defence Force was scrapped.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, one way or another, if the British desire to utilise this country in time of war they can do so.  Since we are co-equal members of the British Commonwealth <Col N="1294" /> of Nations, since we proceed with heads up, hands up and all the rest, into the British Empire, why pass this Estimate for £1,400,000 for an Army which is ineffective?  It is ineffective, and I challenge the Minister for Defence to deny it.  As an instrument of modern warfare this Army is absolutely useless.  These officers of the National Army&mdash;Seán McEoin, T. Fitzpatrick, T. E. Gay and R. E. McCorley&mdash;knew what they were talking about when they issued that statement last November.  They were not amateurs.  They were not fellows who play around with the question.  They had made a study of it and they knew what they were talking about when they stated that the organisation and system on which the National Defence Force was based was ineffective.  No reply has been made to that, and no attempt has been made to explain why that statement was made.  No attempt was made when introducing the Vote to give any idea of what the Imperial Defence Conference in London decided. Are we not entitled to that?  Are the people of this State not entitled to know what they are committed to? Is the Dáil not entitled to know if there is any considered policy of national defence, whether an Air Force with eighteen machines, fourteen of which are effective, is the only instrument we have of national defence under this Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, or whether there is some secret Treaty between the Irish Free State and the British Government with regard to air defence, by which squadrons of British planes will be at our disposal in time of war?  The Dáil is entitled to know that and to know what the country is paying for.  The men who signed that statement have not withdrawn it, and the Minister has only feebly contradicted it.  He has not dealt with the points in extenso as they should be dealt with, and as they deserve to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I think that anyone who reads the statement of the Army officers, who gets a copy of &ldquo;An t-Óglách,&rdquo; the official publication of the National Army, and who takes it in conjunction with the statement of the Army officers issued last November, cannot help <Col N="1295" /> admitting that we will be inevitably involved in any war in which Britain may find herself involved.  Our interests are so entwined with British interests at present, that if a worldwide campaign of aggression, led by the British Government, were directed against, for instance, the most likely State to be attacked, namely, the Soviet Union&mdash;is there any way in which we could have a guarantee that this State of ours could be saved from the consequences of that action on the part of the British War Department? There is not.  We are told that in time of war this State must give reasonable facilities to the British troops and navy.  I suggested that since we have ceded our naval and air rights of national defence, we should also cede our ground rights.  There were men in this country who defended it long before a regular Army was established, and there will be men who will do it again against any foreign aggression, and who will not need a regular Army to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably gloss over these points, but the people will ask themselves why they are being taxed to maintain an Army which is ineffective, and which, if we are to judge by the contradictory statements of members of the Executive Council, is, on the one hand, not intended to fight anyone, and, on the other hand, is intended to participate in any war in which Britain may find itself involved. It is not a remote possibility that Britain may be involved in a war.  In that regard, one of the most significant signs is the reorganisation of the Rumanian fleet and naval bases by a British admiral.  Another significant sign is the secret mobilisation order sent to veterinary surgeons all over Great Britain asking, whether in the event of war, they would be prepared for service abroad.  Another sign is the secret treaty between Britain and the Little Entente in the East.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will not say that my statement to the effect that there is a possibility of war between Britain and another State is not based on fact?  The Minister, however, as Deputies know, does not keep himself <Col N="1296" /> abreast of the times.  If there is a possibility of war between Britain and another power the Free State comes into it and has got to bear the consequences.  This army journal has stated definitely that in the event of war we may be faced with air raids. I challenge the Minister to deal with the points I have mentioned and to prove, if he can, to the satisfaction of the Dáil that we have an effective fighting unit in the Army at present under his control.  I declare that we have not and that he is guilty of culpable neglect in regard to the only effective weapon of modern war which this army could use I declare that he is guilty of neglect in not ensuring that a national policy of defence was embarked on by the State.  I state definitely that if this army were the army of any other country and if this statement were made by a group of officers of the responsibility of the officers who signed it, the Minister for Defence would be arraigned for high treason in any State in any corner of the globe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the unavoidable absence of Deputy MacEoin, I wish to second this amendment.  I think that the majority of Deputies will agree that Deputy Mullins has been expressing the views not alone of the nationally-minded people of the country but of every nationally-minded officer and ex-officer of the Free State Army.  Time and again we have accused the Minister of neglect of his duties in regard to the army, both as a Minister and as an Irishman.  We have pointed out that the army has been hopelessly mismanaged for many years past from a national point of view, and also from a purely military point of view.  Our criticisms have been well borne out but up to the last year or so very little evidence was forthcoming from inside the army.  The people who were in it were effectively closed up, but in last October a few men had the courage to come out and openly condemn the Government for their criminal neglect of the army from a national and military point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mullins went pretty closely through the Estimate, but I condemn <Col N="1297" /> him for neglecting one point, namely, to point out that a sum of £120 is necessary to spend on the winding of clocks.  I do not know anything else to which he neglected to call attention, but he certainly deserves censure for neglecting that item.  Why did he not ask the Minister why that amount of money had to be spent on the winding of clocks?  I think that there should be a sufficient number of persons among the officers and men in the National Army to wind the clocks without asking the State to pay £120 for it.  The statement of the army officers was signed by Deputy MacEoin and others on behalf of an organisation which represents 70 per cent. of the ex-officers and roughly 89 per cent. of the serving officers.  The Minister denied that there was anything in that statement when we drew attention to it on the Army Bill.  Deputy Lemass and I dealt with it in detail, but the Minister brushed our statements aside, and also brushed aside the accusations made by the officers on behalf of the National Defence Association.</P>
    <P>Other evidence has been forthcoming since to support the accusations made by Deputy MacEoin and others, to the effect that fourteen millions of the taxpayers' money have been wasted during the last nine years on the Army, that fourteen million pounds were spent for which the taxpayer got no adequate return.  The Committee on Public Accounts, which has the privilege of bringing before it the accounting officers of the various departments and examining them, went into the Army accounts pretty fully for the financial year 1929-30, and at the end of its investigations said, in relation to army expenditure&mdash;&ldquo;Public funds were expended without regard to economy or the actual needs of the service.&rdquo; That bears out what Deputy MacEoin and other officers said when they accused the Government of misspending fourteen millions of the people's money.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Public Accounts affords very concrete and definite evidence to support their conclusions.  For instance, the Committee point out that there was five shillings a day given to certain medical <Col N="1298" /> officers.  It was granted to a certain set of them, but when they left it was continued to their successors without any sanction whatsoever.  An officer in another case got £262 17s. 6d. for three years, although he was entitled to only £53.  In the Contracts Department there was a tender altered after the tender had been accepted, and there was a payment in excess of the contract price.  Another point they discovered was that there was an excess quantity of clothing issued to cadets.  They found also that there were saddles purchased without sanction, and not through the proper channels.  They found that owing to the loose organisation and the way in which the Minister carried out his work, that these things were liable to continue.  In one case sanction had been obtained for a sum of £134 for bolts for bedsteads.  There were others bought for £224, and then they were not used, but carefully put away into store.  The Minister asked Deputy Mullins in which particular shed were the anti-aircraft guns that were bought a few years ago.  If the Minister would look around the sheds he might find them covered up with the bedstead bolts which were not used, or under the submarines which were ordered and not used.  No wonder the Minister should ask Deputy Mullins where these things are, because the Public Accounts Committee found that there was no effective stocktaking in the Army from the year 1923 to 1928. There was no effective stocktaking, and the Minister might find anything from bed bolts to old anti-aircraft guns and submarines amongst the stock in these stores if he has a look round somewhere.  He will find somewhere in the sheds four telegraph sets which cost £2,698.  They were bought in March, 1927, but up to September, 1929&mdash;two and a half years afterwards &mdash;only one was used, and then it was found unsatisfactory.  A sum of £2,698 of the taxpayers' money was wasted in that little item alone.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee found also that the extravagance in the transport department was enormous.  For one particular type of engine, £463 was spent for parts and in four years, only <Col N="1299" /> £47 worth of those parts was used. Over £400 worth at least are buried among the anti-aircraft guns whose whereabouts the Minister does not know.  Deputy Mullins alluded to the air service.  No wonder the air service is ineffective and badly organised when there is no means to get up-to-date craft.  The Public Accounts Committee discovered that there were eight engines purchased for one obsolescent plant.  Although there were eight engines covered up amongst these anti-aircraft guns in some places or another, they bought for this obsolescent plant a lot of spare parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This report has been published quite recently, and in criticising the Minister's administration of the Department we have quoted a few points from it.  There are just a few points to which I want to draw attention.  Deputy Mullins alluded to the fact that a sum of £100 was provided for civilian training. At the same time, 53 additional civilians have been brought into the Army to do technical work in the last year.  An additional sum of £9,000 has been spent in paying these.  At the end of their service a number of soldiers are thrown out, and nothing has been done to fit them to take up technical work in civilian life.  I think it is a frightful mistake that only £100 is to be spent in training them for a future livelihood.  Of course, when the Minister's pets go out they get big gratuities, but the ordinary soldier who leaves the Army has to look to the unemployment grant for the rest of the lifetime of Cumann na nGaedheal, and, as Deputy Mullins pointed out, he has not even got his card stamped to enable him to draw that unemployment benefit.  I think that a greater effort should be made to train these young soldiers who are thrown out, to give them some training for civilian life.  Certainly that money would be much better spent than the sum of £76,000 which was spent in paying civilians to do technical work in the Army.  If some of that were spent in training soldiers who have to leave the Army within the next four or five years, to fill some niche in the industrial life of the country, it would be much better spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to spend £10,000 on tents and camp equipment.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has ever estimated the number of soldiers that could be accommodated in the barracks under the control of his Department.  It seems to me that anything from 50,000 to 100,000 could be accommodated at a pinch.  We have 5,000 men occupying them, with a few thousand reservists coming up once a year.  Still, we are spending £10,000 on canvas which will last only a couple <Col N="1301" /> of years.  What future does the Minister envisage for all the barracks under his control?  Is he going to continue to spend money on their maintenance, keeping them up as military establishments, particularly at a time when a great need for housing is felt throughout the country? I think the money that is spent in keeping up these buildings would be much better spent in converting them into houses for ordinary civilians, and for soldiers when they go back into civilian life and get married.</P>
    <P>I also want to find out from the Minister if any definite scale of salaries has been laid down for the service.  We find such cases as this: that when Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was controlling the medical department he got a salary of £1,400 a year, while the man who was put in his job has £1,100.  Are there any more of the Minister's pets getting larger salaries than their successors will be entitled to?  We would like to find out the number of large salaries paid to officers in the Army.  We think they should be paid according to what is right, but if there are many more people in the Army like Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, getting £300 a year more than their successors are getting and more than the duties of the posts involve, I think it would be a good thing if someone would find out how many of them there are.</P>
    <P>On the question of gratuities, will the Minister give us any definite assurance that there is not going to be anything more than £18,000 spent in the coming year?  Deputy Clery discovered the names of people who are getting some of the £212,000 which was not voted by the Dáil in 1928-29. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, who got £300 more than his successor is getting in the same job for carrying out the same work, got £3,034 4s. 2d. according to this list which I have before me, and that was not voted by the Dáil. A number of other officers got vast sums.  One got £3,300, another £1,834, another £1,347 and so on. There are 20 such on a list filling 26 pages.  We think it a disgrace that the Minister should come and ask the Dáil for £12,000&mdash;although we voted against it he carried the motion <Col N="1302" />&mdash;and then spend £228,000 on the same vote.  The Minister sent a list of the officers to whom he gave gratuities. In sending it his secretary added: &ldquo;As regards N.C.O.'s and men, I am to state that no gratuities were paid in the financial year 1928-29.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the position is that you have officers clearing out with these vast sums of £3,300, £3,034 4s. 2d., and so on, while N.C.O.'s and men were thrown out without even their cards being stamped.  In addition to that nothing was done for them while they were in the Army to fit them for civilian life.  I think it was a terrible waste of these young men's lives that they should spend five, six or eight years polishing their leggings, with nothing being done to fit them for civilian life when they left the Army. That is how they were treated, although the Minister must have known that these men would have to face civilian life in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disgrace that this sum of over £220,000 should have been spent on these officers&mdash;giving them two years' salary&mdash;while nothing was done for the N.C.O.'s and the men.  It is not proposed this year, either, to do anything for them.  It is estimated that a sum of £100 will be spent on training them for civilian life.  I would like the Minister to state if he intends to fix a scale of salary for the principal officers in the Army for the future. Would he also state what he intends doing with all the military barracks that he has?  Is he going to spend money keeping up barracks for 100,000 men when he only requires barracks, at the most, for 10,000 men?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mullins occupied a great deal of the time of the House. He began by complaining that what I said at the beginning left him cold, and in spite of that he proceeded to get very hot.  One may say at the beginning&mdash;it applies to practically everything the Deputy said&mdash;that he made an enormous show of erudition which might take in anybody who knew nothing about the Deputy.  He referred to the anti-aircraft guns that the Army had eight years ago.  The Army had no anti-aircraft guns eight years <Col N="1303" /> ago.  The Deputy talked mysteriously about his wonderful sources of information. He may have wonderful sources of information.  It may be that, roughly, he was rightly informed on one or two points, but certainly the information that he purported to give was ludicrously and grotesquely inaccurate. In fact, it mostly had no reference whatever to fact.  He talked about our having bought bell-tents which were unserviceable.  We have never bought bell-tents.  He talked about lorries going about the country, and particularly Crossley tenders.  We have no Crossley tenders on the road. He talked about our foolish purchase of armoured cars.  We have only bought one since the State came into being.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about a crisis. He complained that I made no reference &ldquo;to this crisis in the statement issued by the Army officers.&rdquo;  In spite of my stating on a previous occasion that no statement was issued on behalf of officers in the Army, the Deputy repeated that.  So did Deputy Aiken.  It is true that on this occasion Deputy Aiken tried to make some infantile remarks that one can afford to overlook.  He also gets up and says a statement was issued on behalf of officers in the Army.  I permitted officers to form an association called Cumann Cosanta Náisiúnta.  I permitted that to take place.  The body was to be controlled by officers in the standing Army, officers subject to discipline throughout the year.  I was requested to permit such an organised body, so that it would be able to get certain discount in shops and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it became evident that a body, having a name indicating that it represented officers in the Army, but whose activities would be in the hands of men not in the standing Army but of ordinary civilians or men on the reserve subject to military discipline during one month out of the twelve, I at once saw that it was the sort of thing that might lead to a misunderstanding and might even have a bad effect.  I gave orders that members of the standing Army were not to belong to it.  After that the officers who were <Col N="1304" /> members of the standing Army and of the Reserve requested a meeting to be called.  There was no executive at the time and they decided unanimously that the thing should be stopped.  I wish it to be understood that there was no document issued on behalf of any organised body of men associated with the Army.  A document may come out and it may be said of it that it is issued by an executive body, but if there is no such executive body obviously that is false.  A body of men without any authority whatever may say that they are an executive authority, they may say that they belong to an organisation and that the organisation represents 89 per cent. of one class and 79 per cent. of another class. Without having consulted the 89 per cent. they simply arrogate to themselves functions which they do not possess.</P>
    <P>We find Deputy Mullins getting up and saying that in any country in the world if such a thing happened you would have the Minister court-martialled and all sorts of things happening. I can tell the Deputy that I can get more than two reserve officers from the British Army to denounce the way the British Army is administered. I can get more than two reserve officers in the armies of other countries in the world to do the same. That happens in every country.  But in no other country, except this, will you find people who are supposed to be responsible prepared to get up and take an unsubstantiated statement representing what I may call an unbalanced or an ill-regulated point of view, and at once assume that that is an authoritative statement on which the Government must act.  In no other country in the world would that happen.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister state that if the same thing happened in England&mdash;where, suppose two officers of the reserve who came through the Great War issued over their names a statement purporting to be issued on behalf of a large body of officers of the British Army&mdash;that action would not be taken either by the executive authority or by the Parliament in England?</P>

      <P>Purporting to be issued on behalf of a large number of officers.  If that were so, I suppose that in the interests of the discipline of the British Army the British Government would assure themselves whether it was issued on behalf of a body of men, and whether that body was authorised to issue it or not.  If they found that it was issued only on behalf of certain signatories they would consider their relation to the document, whether it merely indicated the point of view of the parties to it. As a matter of fact, the Deputy knows certain things which would follow from that.  He went through a great many things.  I made an amused note of his opinion in reference to this document, &ldquo;deliberate withholding of information from the Dáil.&rdquo;  He called that &ldquo;damning indictment by a responsible body of men.&rdquo;  There was no indictment whatever by any body of men.</P>

      <P>If we were to put everyone in jail for slander who said things about us, then the Deputy and most of the Party to which he formerly belonged would be in jail.  Does the Deputy think that we have to get up and refute every silly statement made by people, sometimes maliciously and sometimes with evil intent?  We are not going to do that.</P>
      <P>I went abroad a short time ago to see some members of my family.  I came back from the Continent through London, and immediately the official organ of Fianna Fáil, seeing a reference in the daily &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; that Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald arrived in Dublin this morning, at once declared that there was an enormous intrigue on foot about the naval conference. I had been simply in Switzerland to see my family.  Similarly, when the Minister for Finance went, the year before last, to Wales for a few days prior to getting on with the preparations of his Budget, Deputy de Valera's paper came out at once and said: &ldquo;We now know what has happened. The Minister for Finance has been over in England selling Ireland as he always has done.&rdquo;  We expect these things and we are never disappointed. It is only stupid, distorted minds that think of these things.  If a man goes to see his family the Party opposite says he is away selling Ireland, but we do not bother about these things.  Deputy Mullins asked what was the reason for the abolition of An Cumann Cosanta Náisiúnta.  It was abolished by its members.  My function was to tell members of the standing Army that they should not belong to it. That was because the vast body controlling it were not subject to military discipline.</P>

      <P>I agreed to its being set up on the understanding that it would be composed and controlled by members of the Army subject to discipline.  When I saw it was not subject to discipline I advised the officers of the standing Army that they should not belong to it.  That was my function in the matter.</P>
      <P>Then Deputy Mullins talks of &ldquo;gross waste of fourteen millions since 1924.&rdquo; That was one charge.  Well, I have only been Minister for Defence since the latter end of 1927.  The Deputy says this was issued on behalf of the officers who, presumably, were better able than I to speak of the details of the Army before 1927.  Then he talks about the victimisation of officers. Here is a definite charge.  What does the Deputy mean when he talks about the victimisation of officers?  He says he saw something in a paper which asserted certain things, and he comes along with his charge about the victimisation of officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responsible whether a man stays in the Army or not.  Since 1924 I can speak with authority, and I say that anybody who asserts that men were fired out of the Army in my time because they were members of the I.R.A. in pre-Truce times knows well that what he is saying is not true.  To that statement I give the lie direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Organisation useless for national defence; no considered policy; no proper steps taken to make use of the foreign training gained by officers.&rdquo; The Deputy says that twenty-five men were sent abroad in order to gain information, and that they are not being used.  I think there are twenty-four out of the twenty-five directly engaged in instruction at the present moment, and the twenty-fifth is engaged <Col N="1308" /> in analogous work.  I would not guarantee my correctness as regards the figures, but I think they are right. Somewhat associated with this was the matter of the Military College.  The Deputy said that last year there was an estimate for equipment for the Military College, and now there is nothing.  The reason was that last year the Military College, was coming into being, and equipment had to be provided, and this year it is working and operating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">

      <P>Knowledge of organisation of the Army cannot be possessed by men who left the Army in 1922 or men who are in the Army reserve.  There is no considered policy. It is men who are undoubtedly working twelve months in the year on matters of policy who are in a position to pronounce on it.  The Deputy might go and argue with some of his friends as to the exact number of atoms in the sun and if he gave a wrong figure we might as well say that he was a deliberate liar.  We would say in that as in other cases that he is assuming a knowledge that he has not got and that he naturally goes wrong.  The Deputy referred to £8,000 for a gratuity, and said that it was entirely for officers and that nothing was done for the poor men. Deputy Aiken went even a bit more wrong than Deputy Mullins.  He called it £18,000 and also asserted that it was all for officers and none for men.  Those figures are of course purely speculative.  They consist of £5,000 in relation to men and £3,000 in relation to officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A new regulation was brought in.  I brought in a regulation two years ago permitting it. Deputy Mullins, seeing on the Estimate sixteen civilians, talked about their being employed in administration. I think he went back to the document about the excessive cost of administration.  The sixteen civilians are men taken on for technical work. They have nothing whatsoever to do with any aspect of the administration of the Army.  They are merely certain specialists brought in to provide for the safety of aeroplanes and for instruction.</P>
      <P>Constantly all through this debate a reference to medical services for 5,000 men has been made.  It must be remembered that medical services and all other things, not only give service to these 5,000 men but to the Reserve Forces when they are up.  Deputy Mullins proposed that all soldiers on the reserve should be entitled to medical service.  That is not going to be done here, and that is not done in any other country.  A soldier on the Reserve will be at home eleven months in the year.  We have reservists in West Cork and West Kerry and it is only when they are up that they receive medical attention.  It must be remembered when calculating the number of men receiving medical attention that that includes not merely the standing Army but also the various battalions up for reserve training.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, having said that he saw these Crossley tenders which we do not possess on the streets, was complaining of an increase of £9,000 on the Estimate in one matter and then said that there should be more travelling by tender and less by rail.  The extra £9,000 is, because under the new arrangements they travel more by tender and less by rail.  Any considerable number of men in the Army travel now by tender and it is only in the more isolated and very small bodies that they travel by rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy was quoting the celebrated document about co-ordination <Col N="1310" /> of corps&mdash;artillery and air.  A very fundamental principle of the teaching of the military college is the co-ordination of corps.  &ldquo;The Minister would not hold office for forty-eight hours in any other country if he was so indicted.&rdquo;  I should say that in any other country, a man who made a statement such as Deputy Mullins has made would not hold his Deputyship long.</P>

The reason is that we were installing night lighting then; the money was paid, and there is no need to pay it over again.  The Deputy does not understand these Estimates.</P>

The stamping of cards for soldiers was discontinued under the Act of 1926.  Battalion equipment means everything necessary to a battalion to enable a battalion to operate successfully under active service conditions.

As far as the standardised rifle is concerned, we retain the present rifle until it is established that there is another variety available superior to it.  We have purchased no rifles since 1922. Small arms are not confined to revolvers. They include other types of lethal weapons.  Night flying has already been provided for during the past financial year.  Stores purchased in all cases, unless in an imperative case, are new and not second-hand.  I told the Deputy that we have not purchased any since we took over.  Only one new armoured car has been bought since the Army came into existence. The Deputy was quite misinformed when he said that the tank was not capable of being operated by any Army <Col N="1312" /> officer.

      <P>I think there is some misconception.  Deputy Mullins was quoting from the Appropriation Accounts which have been submitted to the Public Accounts Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee are at present considering these accounts.  I do not think it is possible to discuss here what the Committee will have to discuss and report on in the next few months.  It is not a Public Accounts Committee report that the Deputy quoted, but the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

      <P>The Deputy having heard the thank was defective, with that lack of ratiocinative power, presumed a whole lot further, and presumed the tank was not capable of being operated.  A tank can be defective and still be operative.  Deputy Mullins spoke about the £10 token Vote for assistance to civil aviation. It is merely to let the Dáil know that the Department of Defence is rendering services to civil aviation which falls <Col N="1313" /> to be borne upon the normal sub-heads of the Army Vote.  We give, I think, certain services of much more value than £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The Deputy was complaining that we only gave £10 and made such a lot out of it.  The Deputy said we were buying only heavy bombing planes.  The planes most recently bought were co-operation planes, not heavy bombing planes.  The Deputy talked about the relative amount of spare parts to aeroplanes.  The explanation of the apparently high relation of spares is that during 1925 to 1929 no expenditure of consequence was made by way of capital expenditure. Large sums were spent on spare parts for repairs of machines handed over by the British.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken was very concerned about the neglect in regard to the Army.  I would very much like to know whether Deputy Aiken is anxious for the welfare of the Army and for its efficiency, or whether, on the other hand, he is not very anxious for its inefficiency.  The Deputy quoted some document stating that there was no effective stocktaking between 1923 and 1928, during the time of the Minister's administration.  The Minister was not administering during the period he referred to.  The Minister and the effective stocktaking both date from the same time.  The Deputy talked about telephones for tenders in March, 1927.  I could not be expected to go into details about items that occurred in a period before I was Minister. Certain training is being undertaken for soldiers going into civilian life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather not at the moment.  A great many of these things require negotiations with outside organisations and I am not quite sure how they stand.  Deputy Aiken asked about bell-tents and then talked about barracks.  Most of the barracks in this country were destroyed <Col N="1314" /> in a certain criminal outbreak in 1922 and 1923.  Bell-tents are used for occasions, for instance when the men go for artillery training down to Glen Imaal.  We do not maintain barracks that are not going to be used. In many cases I think barracks have been handed over to public bodies. In other cases, barracks that we do not use we hand over to the Board of Works.  There are the remains of many barracks that would be very useful, but were burned down in 1922-23.  Deputy Aiken, I think, last year, complained that I had not adverted sufficiently to the number of new buildings that were being built for the Army under the Board of Works Vote. These new buildings were necessitated, as I say, by the criminals who burned those barracks in 1922-23.  I think it would be advisable for people whose consciences are not so easy not to refer too closely to certain matters.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the change under the heading of G.M.S. from £1,400 to £1,100.  He must remember that the Army and consequently the medical side of the Army, was, a few years ago, more than twice as big as at present, and the whole position of the G.M.S. changed considerably during the period from 1928 to 1930. The Deputy will also notice that in a number of cases the position is asterisked with a note saying: &ldquo;It is personal to the present holder.&rdquo; There are quite a number of such cases.  In cases where there is no asterisk it may be assumed that the salary indicated is the salary generally appropriate to the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy talked about gratuities given in 1929.  The Estimate was for £12,000, and a sum considerably in advance of that was spent.  We might as well be quite clear about that.  If in the beginning of 1929 I had in mind the action that was taken afterwards, namely, encouraging officers to resign, the Deputy would surely understand that if I had down £216,000 as gratuities to officers resigning, it would have been completely misunderstood.  Nobody would have known how that was going to act.  It was much better to draw up a regulation encouraging to a certain extent resignation on those conditions.  The Deputy will also <Col N="1315" /> understand that it was really a substitution of gratuities for pay, that the money spent under the sub-head &ldquo;Gratuities,&rdquo; if not spent in that year, would certainly be spent in the succeeding year, and it was completely recovered by economies under the sub-head for salaries.  Deputy Mullins <Col N="1316" /> touched on a tremendous lot, but most of his information was on a parallel with the information he had about Crossley tenders, bell-tents and armoured cars, and with the buying of only bombing planes when we were only buying co-operation planes.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £126,439 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1932, chun Pinsin Chréachta agus Mhí-ábaltachta, Pinsin Fhear Pósta, Liúntaisí agus Aiscí (Uimh. 26 de 1923 agus Uimh. 12 de 1927) agus chun síntiúisí agus costaisí iolardha ina dtaobh san agus chun Pinsin Seirbhíse Mileata d'íoc (Uimh. 48 de 1924).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £126,439 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923 and No. 12 of 1927) and for sundry contributions and expenses in respect there of and to pay Military Service Pensions (No. 48 of 1924).</P>
      <P>This Vote covers the activities of the various Pensions Acts from 1923 to 1927.  With regard to the Military Service Pensions Acts, the only operation I have now to deal with is to make certain alterations in the way of knocking names out when the recipient of a pension dies or incurs the penalty of having the pension forfeited.  There is in that case no further issue of such pension.  The only positive change would be in the case of a man to whom a pension had been allotted when he was in the Army and who had left the Army.  In the case of wounds and disability pensions, that work is almost finished now.  Practically every case has been dealt with, and the arrangement is that the Board shall meet once a month.</P>
      <P>There is one new sub-head in connection with which I do not think there will be much discussion.  We make provision under sub-head I for a grant in exceptional circumstances to a person who is the son of a signatory of the Proclamation issued on Easter Monday, 1916, and who has passed the statutory age limit for the receipt of allowances under the Army Pensions Act.  There is very little variation in the amount.  There is a decrease of £7,777 as compared with last year. That comes mostly under sub-heads A, B and J.  The numbers provided under sub-heads A and B show an increase compared with the previous year, but it was not found necessary, with the exception of £304 under sub-head B, to make provision for arrears as in former years.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be reduced by £92,000 in respect of item H.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item H provides for £145,590 in respect of military service pensions. Our attitude has been stated time and again on these military service pensions. We have no objection to wound pensions, but we have every objection to young, able-bodied men with very little service being provided with service pensions, particularly when Ministers claim that they have not enough money for people whom we consider are much better entitled to pensions. The Ministry turned down the proposition to spend some additional funds in providing for the comfort of people who have reached the age of 70 years. There would be no use now in going into this debate at length.  We went into it at great length on several occasions in former years.  We simply, <Col N="1319" /> by calling for this reduction, which represents the sum which one might take to be yet unexpended in respect of military service pensions, want to effect an economy of money which might be spent more usefully.  We intend to vote for the reduction and the wiping out of any sums outstanding against that sub-head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say is that the Dáil passed the Military Service <Col N="1320" /> Pensions Act in 1924.  A Board was set up to consider applications. That Board considered those applications, made awards, and this sum here is just in accordance with the legislation passed by the Dáil.  It seems to me that Deputy Aiken's amendment here to reduce this Vote by £92,000 is, in effect, a request to the Dáil by voting on that point to cancel the legislation passed here in 1924.</P>

This has reference to a case that I think the officials of the Minister's Department will probably remember.  It is the case of the children of one of the signatories to the Proclamation of 1916. The guardians were anxious to send his boy to a university.  Had his parents lived, this boy would, in the ordinary course, have been sent to a university.  The answer I got when I wrote to the Department was that the law did not permit of an allowance in the case of these two children.  I would like to know if it would be possible, under a heading such as this, to arrange for a grant for the upkeep of these children.  I am informed by their guardians that there probably is money enough in their funds at present&mdash;their funds have been well invested&mdash;to pay their fees, but there is not money enough to provide for their maintenance during the four or five years necessary.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission Estimate for the financial year 1931-32 shows a net increase of £8,920 on the preceding year, after allowance has been made for the transfer of the administration of operations under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, from the Land Commission to the Gaeltacht Services Branch of the Department of Fisheries as from the 1st April, 1931. It was at first considered that these operations could be best administered as a special branch of the Land Commission, as the housing work under the Act is analogous to that on the late Congested Districts Board's estates and has to be co-ordinated therewith. Experience has shown, however, that <Col N="1323" /> the operations under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act fall more naturally under the administration of Gaeltacht Services.  The total amount included in respect of these operations in last year's Estimate for the Land Commission was £66,000, leaving £569,981 for the Land Commission proper, as against £578,901 for the coming year. As copies of the detailed Estimate are in the hands of Deputies, and as I have fully explained the scope of the various sub-heads on previous occasions I need not go separately into the figures of the particular minor increases or decreases, and I propose to confine my comments to the more important items.</P>
      <P>Under Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;there is an increase of £5,963.  This is mainly due to an increase in the inspectorate staff, which is being reorganised in a manner which will, I hope, enable the Land Commission to deal more expeditiously with the purchase and re-sale of both tenanted and untenanted land.  In consonance with the increase in the number of inspectors, the number of Land Commissioners (other than the Judicial Commissioner) has been increased from two to four, but, on the other hand, the post of Assistant Commissioner has been abolished and one of the Commissioners acts also as chief inspector, while another acts as Secretary of the Land Commission.  There has also been a slight increase in the staff of the Purchase and Resales Branch, sufficient to enable the Headquarters staff to handle the work thrown up by the increased inspectorate. I may mention, in this connection, that during the last few months the Land Commission staff had to administer a considerable portion of the grant for the relief of unemployment and distress and, for this purpose, officers had to be detached for a period from ordinary land purchase work.</P>
      <P>Under Sub-head B, there is a decrease of £1,000 in travelling expenses, notwithstanding the increase in the number of inspectors, owing to improved arrangements for stationing inspectors locally.</P>

    <P>Under Sub-head H&mdash;Payments under Section 11, sub-section (7) of the Land Act, 1923&mdash;there is an increase of <Col N="1324" /> £7,400, mainly due to the normal increase expected in the amount of Land Bonds to be advanced in respect of the State contribution to the standard price of tenanted land.  This Estimate is without reference to the recent enactment of the Land Bill, 1931.  Following on the greatly increased issue of Land Bonds during the coming year provided for in that measure, the Estimate under this sub-head must be correspondingly increased, but I cannot budget for this, and the increased amount necessary under this sub-head must be the subject of a supplementary estimate later.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-head I&mdash;Improvement of Estates, etc.&mdash;the Estimate is practically the same as last year.  This expenditure is regulated for the most part, not altogether, of course, by the distribution of untenanted land acquired by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-head J&mdash;Advances to meet deficiency of income from untenanted land purchased under the Land Acts, 1923-9&mdash;there is an increase of £2,000, having regard to the increase in the amount of advances for the purchase of untenanted land. But, on the other hand, there is a decrease of £2,000 under Sub-head X&mdash; Payments under Sections 42 and 46 of the Land Act, 1927&mdash;consequent on the winding-up of the Land Bank estates and Committee estates.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid show an increase of £3,020, which is mainly due to greater receipts from &ldquo;Excess Annuities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the whole Deputies will perceive that the Estimate is very much on the lines of last year, so that there is little need for special comment.</P>
    <P>As regards the general work of the Land Commission during the past year, of which a review is expected on an occasion like this, I may say that the standard of progress has been well maintained.  But as the Land Commission and all its works have been so exhaustively discussed during the recent debates on the Land Bill, I shall confine myself now to a brief statement of the most important features.  As regards the vesting of tenanted land under the Land Acts, 1923-9, 4,625 holdings were vested during the past year, showing a slight increase on the <Col N="1325" /> figure for the previous year, and the total of tenanted land vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-9, up to the 31st March last is 15,971 holdings, comprising an area of 578,210 acres and representing a total price of £5,143,148.  In view of the provisions of the new Land Act, however, these figures are no criterion of what will be achieved during the coming year, when we expect to deal with all the remaining tenanted land coming under the 1923 Act either by way of putting the tenants on an annuity basis or vesting their holdings in them.  The same may be said of the re-sale of holdings on Congested Districts Board estates.  On these and on the old Estates Commissioners estates (which are now nearly completed), the Land Commission vested during the past year 3,212 holdings or parcels. The total of these resales vested by the Land Commission since 1923 amounts to nearly 30,000 holdings or parcels comprising 912,000 acres and representing a resale price of £5,305,000.  Adding to these vestings the holdings vested by the Land Commission since 1923 in respect of direct sales between landlord and tenant instituted under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909, and also the vestings under Sections 38 and 39 of the Land Act, 1923, and the vestings of parcels of untenanted land allotted under the 1923-9 Acts, brings the total number of holdings and parcels vested by the Land Commission during the eight years from 1923 to 1931 to over 61,000, comprising 1,977,000 acres and representing a total price of £14,700,000.</P>
    <P>As regards the acquisition and division of untenanted land under the Land Acts, 1923-9, a total of approximately 379,000 acres has been acquired by the Land Commission, and offers have been made or the lands gazetted for acquisition in respect of a further area of 139,000 acres, while, in addition, some 232,000 acres have been inspected with a view to their suitability for acquisition.  Of the untenanted land actually acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-9, nearly 300,000 acres have been divided among some 15,000 allottees.  In addition, the Land Commission have divided, since 1923, some 160,000 acres of untenanted land on <Col N="1326" /> estates which had been purchased by the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board, bringing the total of untenanted land divided since 1923 to approximately 460,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The total amount expended by the Land Commission since 1923 on the benefit and improvement of estates acquired under all the Land Acts is approximately £1,547,000, but in addition the Land Commission have expended approximately £428,000 on special improvement works out of funds for the relief of unemployment and distress, bringing the total improvement expenditure by the Land Commission since 1923 to about £1,975,000.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given cover the main activities of the Land Commission since its transfer to the Saorstát Government in 1923, and I think Deputies will agree that they amount to an impressive total.  During the coming year every effort will be made to cope not only with the tenanted land remaining to be vested under the Land Act, 1923, but also with the holdings on the Congested Districts Board estates which have not yet been resold. At the same time, the work of acquiring and dividing untenanted land for the relief of congestion will not be neglected, and also the allottees of parcels of untenanted land already divided will be put on an annuity basis.</P>
    <P>As regards the working of the new Land Act, I may say that arrangements have been made that no less than 70,000 holdings will be included in the lists to be published, fixing the 1st May as the Appointed Day, and the remaining holdings coming under the 1923 Act will be vested as from the 1st November next.  Deputies will realise the immense amount of clerical work and calculations that this involves. During the last few months a large proportion of the staff of the Land Commission have been working exclusively on tenanted land estates in order to give immediate effect to the new Act.  It was necessary to review the particulars of every holding as furnished by the landlord, to reconcile the conflicting claims of landlords and tenants to rents and compounded arrears of rents to be added to the <Col N="1327" /> purchase money, and to calculate to the nearest penny the capital sums payable in Land Bonds to the owners, and the amounts of the annuities by which the tenant purchasers will repay the purchase price of their holdings.</P>
    <P>The new Act will not be an easy one to administer.  The vesting in the Land Commission of a great number of holdings without the antecedent full checking and investigation of the particulars furnished by owners that has hitherto been deemed necessary for the vesting of any land, will necessarily involve a certain amount of errors and omissions in the lists of vested holdings, the rectification of which will mean a good deal of trouble for the accounting and collection branches of the Land Commission. The case of the Congested Districts Board estates, where many of the holdings are held on an involved rundale system, will be especially difficult. But all this was taken into account in the drafting of the Act, and the special provisions included for the rectification of errors subsequent to vesting will help to smooth the difficulties. The Land Commission staff are working vigorously and wholeheartedly to make the Act a complete success, and I have no doubt that the promise I have already made will be amply fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, &ldquo;That this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; In moving that amendment I have not, of course, in mind the question of the vesting of land which now seems to be in a fair way towards satisfactory completion.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his statement that 70,000 holdings will be vested on 1st May, and that he hopes that the remainder will be completed on 1st November. So far as vesting is concerned, it is obvious that that is a very big step forward. and no one is more pleased than I that the Parliamentary Secretary has given such a good account of his Department in this matter.  In regard to the Estimate, I do not think that he has attempted to justify the increase <Col N="1328" /> under the heading &ldquo;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&rdquo; of nearly £6,000.  I notice that the number of Commissioners has been increased from four to five, but though the office of Assistant Commissioner has been abolished, it does not seem to have resulted in any economy to the State because, whereas last year we paid £5,200 for these Commissioners, this year, apart from the Judicial Commissioner, whose remuneration is charged against the Central Fund, we are paying £6,378, an increase of nearly £1,200.</P>
      <P>The changes in the inspectorate staff would also seem to demand some explanation.  Last year there were fifteen inspectors in Grade IV., apparently the lowest grade, and which has now been abolished.  I take it that all the inspectors who were in that grade have been pushed upwards. Instead of fifteen temporary inspectors who were employed last year there are now thirty-eight, so that the total inspectorate which last year comprised sixty-eight has now been increased to ninety-five while the increase in the cost of the inspectorate staff has gone up by £8,400.  If the reorganisation of the Land Commission is to take place solely on the basis of promotions and additional remuneration to those concerned, I think it is very questionable whether the changes are going to work out for the benefit of the taxpayer.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary when replying will be able to go into greater detail in explaining why this extra staff was necessary, what work they are going to do that has not been done before by the ordinary staff, and, further, what is the scale of remuneration of these temporary inspectors, and are they paid higher than those who were in Grade IV, the grade which has now been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Sub-head K, which deals with payments in respect of Land Bank and Land Committee cases, I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary last year that he hoped that a considerable reduction would be evident in this sub-head.  Last year the amount voted in respect of Land Bank cases was £14,000.  This year the <Col N="1329" /> Parliamentary Secretary anticipated that we would only require £8,000, a reduction of £6,000, but I find that there is only a reduction of £2,000. Last year there were only seven Land Bank cases outstanding.  We would be glad to know whether it is hoped to get rid of these cases during the current year.  Another matter which seems to require mention is that in connection with appropriations-in-aid where we find that there is an estimated appropriation for costs recovered from delinquent annuitants of £4,000 as against £3,400 last year. Have the Land Commission been able to devise any system of cheapening the legal costs where decrees are got against defaulting annuitants?  I understand that some attention has been paid to that matter.  It seems a great pity that the present system should be allowed to continue whereby an unfortunate widow can have her cow seized and find afterwards that she owes the Land Commission more than she did before the animal was seized and sold.</P>
    <P>The particular matter to which I would like to call the attention of the House in connection with the administrative policy of the Land Commission is that of the division of land. The House knows that we had a very long debate here some three years ago with reference to the Government policy in the Gaeltacht areas, and a White Paper was submitted by the Government embodying their proposals.  In reply to the recommendation of the Gaeltacht Commission that all the grass lands of the western counties be broken up and that in the re-settlement of land, especially in the Gaeltacht, none but Irish-speaking families be re-settled and that English-speaking families with claims to land should have their claims satisfied outside the Gaeltacht, the Government stated that the division of land was being expedited to the utmost.  On the other hand, they called special attention to the proposals which they were carrying out for the reclamation and local migration in these congested areas.  The statement in the White Paper seemed to indicate that the Government had great hopes that this <Col N="1330" /> policy of reclamation and local migration would considerably help to solve the problem of acute congestion in those areas.  It is stated:</P>
    <P>There is at present in progress a large migratory scheme which, when completed, is expected to contribute largely towards the relief of the existing chronic state of congestion amongst the mainly Irish-speaking population in a part of Connemara. This scheme, although of a much more extensive character, is in accordance with settled practice in dealing with migration problems which long experience has proved to be the best way in which such problems can be faced satisfactorily.  The area within a line along the coast from Costello to Mannin Bay, with an average breadth of three miles, is inhabited by some 15,000 persons distributed among some 3,000 holdings.</P>
    <P>It is further stated that:</P>
    <P>As there is no suitable untenanted land within 15 or 20 miles of this district which can be used for relieving the area, it has been decided to acquire, under the compulsory clauses of the 1923 Land Act, about a dozen extensive tenanted holdings in the Maam and Cloosh valleys. The valleys are adjacent to this thickly-populated district, and the area to be acquired is expected to be sufficient to enable the Government to settle from 50 to 70 of these families.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Land Commission Report, I find, in my opinion, at any rate, that the reclamation scheme as carried out, while undoubtedly it has been very costly and has probably given a good deal of employment locally, is not calculated to solve the problem of congestion in these areas.  I venture to say that, no matter how long the present scheme is in operation and how far it is extended, it will not, in the long run, greatly improve the situation. The amount which is being spent on such schemes is very large.  For example, in the Cloosh valley, about which we hear extraordinary accounts from those who reside in the neighbourhood&mdash;that snipe, for instance, let alone human beings, cannot live in that area&mdash;portion of the land has been reclaimed <Col N="1331" /> at a cost of £4,000, and six holdings are being made out of it.  In a neighbouring district seven holdings are being made out of the reclaimed land, and that scheme also cost £4,000. That is to say, thirteen holdings are in process of being made, manufactured if you like at a cost of some £8,000 as far as the actual work of reclamation is concerned.  That is a cost of some £615 per holding.</P>
    <P>If you are going to charge the incoming tenants the full value and make them repay the full expenditure on this reclamation, you will have to make them pay an annuity well over £20, and perhaps £30.  You are not, however, at the end of your troubles when you have reclaimed the land which cost £8,000 for thirteen holdings. You have, in addition to that, to provide houses and out-offices.  According to the Land Commission Report, in the case of a small migrant who is changed into the reclaimed area, the cost of a house and out-offices may be anything from £350 to £700.  It will be seen, therefore, that even if the State does not expect more than half the expenditure on reclamation and the building of houses, etc., to be recoverable, nevertheless a very heavy annuity will have to be fixed on the incoming tenant to enable him to pay off the amount.  There is, in addition, I understand, a further expenditure. There is the buying out of the outgoing tenant's interests.  These interests have to be paid for.  I understand that arrangements have been made to provide the tenants with stock and to give a subsidy for tillage. I have no details of these holdings, but I simply mention them in order to show that the reclamation scheme is very expensive and that, furthermore, the number of people actually going to benefit seems to be small.</P>
    <P>While it was anticipated in the White Paper that at least 60 or 70 families would be migrated and would get the benefit of these schemes, it seems that up to the present only something like 20 allottees have been placed on the reclaimed land.  I understand some of these have surrendered their holdings, at least in one case, and have gone back to their original congested holdings. It was anticipated that these <Col N="1332" /> tenants would be able to live more easily upon these reclaimed holdings than if they were changed outside the Gaeltacht area, to the rich lands in the midlands, for example.</P>
    <P>It was said that the conditions would be more favourable, that they would be more accustomed to them and, furthermore, that the annuity which they would have to pay would not be greatly in excess of what they had been paying before.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is able to assure the House that all this work is being done, that so much is a State grant as would enable the annuity in these cases to be fixed at £10 or under, then there is a good case that the incoming tenants may be able to pay that annuity; but if the annuity is fixed at a higher figure than £10 I do not see that there is a possibility of its being an economic proposition for the tenant.</P>
    <P>There is no information to show what exactly the return to the State is going to be from all this expenditure. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to state what the total expenditure has been up to the present, the number of tenants which it is expected to benefit, and the amount which he estimates would be eventually recoverable.</P>
    <P>The reason I bring this matter before the House is that it was the settled policy of the State before the present régime to make special provision for those congested areas.  A special Board was brought into being, and that Board got a certain annual grant-in-aid.  The money had not to run the gauntlet of the Estimates, or had not to be discussed and critically examined at the Public Accounts Committee, and so on.  It was recognised, as I stated before, that in these areas the British Government had something to make up for, something to atone for, and they gave a substantial annual grant, not alone for the purpose of re-settlement on the land, but for the purpose of providing and establishing ancillary industries which might be suitable in these areas.  The position now is that any scheme or any programme that has to be carried into operation in these areas <Col N="1333" /> does not seem to be the responsibility of any definite Department.  It is only arranged at a conference which meets fortnightly, and which is representative of the Local Government Department, the Fishery Department, the Land Commission, and any other Departments concerned.  It seems to me, as has been stated in the Minority Report of the Gaeltacht Commission, that you can never, on such a basis as that &mdash;fortnightly conferences of Departmental chiefs&mdash;get a programme that would meet the situation as it exists in those areas.  Even if you do get a programme you are going to have divided responsibility.  You are not going to have that personal supervision and knowledge which are required, and which, in my opinion, can only be got by putting the whole thing in charge of one responsible Department, and, if necessary, creating a special Department to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The argument against transferring these people out of the Gaeltacht areas is the expense.  It was stated in the House by the Minister for Agriculture that it would cost £700 or £800 to migrate a family, but under the present reclamation scheme you are expending £700 or £800 per family.  You are probably expending a good deal more, and you have no guarantee in the end that the scheme will be economic.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to show the House whether it will work, whether he is going to stake his reputation that this reclamation scheme is going to solve the situation.</P>
    <P>I admit that there is no easy solution for the problem, but, at any rate, I think the old Congested Districts Board was proceeding on very good lines.  They stated that their policy was to create the maximum number of economic holdings in these areas.  They simply declared that the man over £100 valuation had no right to exist in these areas. They went further and declared that the pasture farm had no right to exist there, no matter what size it was. They also said that the non-residential holding, no matter what its size might be, had no right to exist in these areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he can assure the House, in regard to the land that is about to be vested in the <Col N="1334" /> tenants, that no land is going to be vested in these areas in people whose valuation is over £100, that land which is not giving any employment, that is of no benefit to the community in these areas, and which is simply used as pasture, is not going to be vested in fee simple in the tenants at present. I would like him, furthermore, to say in the case of people who have two or more farms, upon one of which, at least, they do not live, they are not going to be allowed to pretend to work them or to continue to hold them while we have hundreds or thousands living under conditions in the same areas which are only comparable to the worst conditions in the slums of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I say that in this matter we require a bold policy and an imaginative policy.  I will be told that there is not enough of land to go around.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated two years ago in this House that there is roughly only one million acres of land available for distribution, of which some 650,000 acres were, at that time, the subject of inquiry.  In the congested areas, however, the position is very much worse because all untenanted land seems to have been already divided.  In the annual report of the Land Commission for the present year it seems that there are now only 78,000 acres of untenanted land available, which in the words of the report is practically altogether mountain and waste land, and, therefore, is not of great value so far as this question of re-settlement is concerned.</P>
    <P>I notice in the valuable appendices to the De-rating Commission Report that there seem to be holdings of high valuation still in the congested areas.  One-quarter of the Co. Galway roughly, one-fifth of the Co. Kerry, one-fifth of the Co. Donegal and one-fifth of the Co. Kerry are in farms of over two hundred acres.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can show the House that it is necessary that these farms of two hundred acres should exist in these areas, very well.  If he can show the House that it is not the policy of the Land Commission to break up these lands and can give reasons why these farms of two hundred acres should be allowed <Col N="1335" /> to exist side by side with conditions as he knows them we should be glad to hear his explanations.  But, even if he proves to the House that there is insufficient land and even if all these two-hundred-acre farms were taken up&mdash;I admit that the valuations of some of them is very small&mdash;nevertheless a total which gives almost one million acres is considerable.  If the Parliamentary Secretary goes outside the congested areas he will find plenty of land.  He will find that in the Co. Kildare something like forty-three per cent. of the land is comprised in holdings of over two hundred acres; in Tipperary about twenty-two and a half per cent.; in Westmeath nearly thirty per cent., and in Meath nearly forty per cent.  If we take these four typical ranching counties and put them against the four congested counties that I have referred to, we will find that there are three-quarters of a million acres of land in these four counties in holdings that are over two hundred acres in extent.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary state to the House that so long as these two-hundred-acre farms are no longer residential, so long as they are farms that are absentee farms on which the owners do not even reside, and so long as they are farms of over £150 valuation, or grass farms, it is the definite policy of the Land Commission to acquire these lands and distribute them among uneconomic holders and, if necessary, amongst congests in the West of Ireland?</P>

      <P>If the alternative is to continue with such schemes as we have in respect to reclamation and so on, and if the country is going to be faced with the problem of maintaining a considerable proportion of its population on such schemes, and on temporary relief measures, I do not know how the problem can ever be solved.  My opinion is that no decent experiment has been made to do the other thing. Assuming that there is not enough untenanted land to go around, if you look at the area which has been resumed by the Land Commission consider the <Col N="1336" /> cases of people who admittedly are not entitled to hold land because they are not giving value to the country while land is required by congests, you will find that the amount of land resumed is very small.</P>
      <P>I was extremely surprised when I looked up the figures at the end of the Land Commission report to find that since the Land Commission was taken over by a native Government that up to the 31st March, 1930, only five holdings have been resumed in County Galway, with an acerage of 2,400.  In County Clare only three holdings have been resumed with an acreage of something over 1,000 and in the Counties of Mayo, Roscommon and Cork, according to the table, only one holding has been definitely resumed in each County.  In table A there is no record of any holdings having been resumed in Sligo, Leitrim, Kerry and Donegal.  It seems to me that so long as you have the situation that is described in the appendices to the Report of the De-rating Commission, where there are huge tracts of land varying from one quarter to one half of the area in practically all the counties in the Free State, that that is ample evidence to prove that the Land Commission will have this House and the country behind them in dealing with this matter of solving the problem if they go out and tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the County Tipperary, which does not particularly appertain to my present themes, there is an extensive agitation going on for the division of ranch land.  That is of particular interest, because those who are trying to get the land there are the people who fought for the country.  Although the vast majority of them have now left, those who remain deserve some consideration.  Where you have a whole county looking for a livelihood upon the land that was taken from their fathers, and that gradually relapsed into the hands of graziers and ranchers, it is an extraordinary thing that the only policy the Parliamentary Secretary had to adumbrate in connection with that problem is that so long as land is required for fattening purposes, it apparently is not the policy of the Land Commission to take <Col N="1337" /> it over.  Accordingly you find that only something like 2,000 acres were divided in the County Tipperary in the last year as recorded in the official report of the Land Commission.  In the County Kildare, which is well-known as a ranching county, only three hundred acres were divided, although, in all these midland counties, there seems to be, on examination of the question, plenty of opportunity and plenty of room for the Land Commission to carry out a bolder policy than it has been doing.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will, during the coming year, if his predictions come true, be in the position that he will have relief from the greater task of vesting land.  As he comes from the congested areas himself, he knows the problem.  He has had experience within the last five years of this work, and has certainly made great advances.  I would ask him to go further and do the work that I think lies nearest to his heart&mdash;that is, to concentrate on a strong active policy when conditions are favourable for dividing up ranches, no matter where they may be, whether in the congested areas or outside them.  He has a staff that is well versed in the whole question.  As I have already mentioned, he has full powers, and I am sure that the House will grant him any finances that are necessary, provided that a policy is put before it and the country which will show that a really serious effort is to be made to deal with the problem and to complete it within a certain number of years.</P>

      <P>I think perhaps the most notable incident that has occurred in this House for some time was to hear Deputy Derrig, in moving the reduction of this Vote, congratulating Deputy Roddy on the case he just put forward as regards the general policy and work of the Land Commission. This, of course, is a time for stocktaking, but it certainly is refreshing to hear an intelligent Deputy on the other side being broadminded enough to give credit where credit is due.  I would like to add my congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary, because I <Col N="1338" /> entirely agree with the remarks that Deputy Derrig made that Deputy Roddy has been a distinct and outstanding success in his position as a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into details with regard to the working of the Land Commission in Westmeath and Longford. I have repeatedly done so and given details of the good work done there, but I would add this: that the Land Commission and the Land Commission officials have given all-round satisfaction there.  They have not, of course, pleased everybody.  That would be impossible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig advocated taking migrants from the West of Ireland and setting them up in the County of Westmeath, and he mentioned that there was a very large acreage available there.  I do not agree with him at all in regard to that.  There is little enough land there to go round for the people looking for it for a long time past.  I remember hearing Deputy Derrig at the by-election in Westmeath-Longford, and he did not advocate that policy.  There have been 18,000 acres divided in Westmeath among 700 people.  They received on an average 20 acres each.  I believe the estates were divided fairly and have given general satisfaction, and so far as I am concerned, anyhow, I am quite pleased with the work of the Land Commission.  The division of land is one thing.  They have dealt with a huge number of Committee cases and have relieved a very great number of people that were very seriously burdened, and in that way they have done very valuable work. They also spent a considerable amount of money.  I do not mean relief money but ordinary money allocated by the Land Commission for the improvement of estates.  They have done invaluable work on these 18,000 acres of land and they have given much employment. I shall not go into details and shall not detain the House any longer, but I join with Deputy Derrig in congratulating the Land Commission on its work and I suggest that in all the circumstances the best thing would be to withdraw this motion forthwith.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I had occasion in this House to say a word in praise of the Land Commission, in regard to the manner in which their improvement works were executed.  I regret now, after recent experience, that that statement was entirely premature and that I should not have made it, and if it is necessary to withdraw it I think I had better do so at the outset of my statement.  I want to express my very keen disappointment at the manner in which the Land Commission has dealt with portion of the relief grant that passed into their hands some months ago.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that shortly before Christmas £300,000 was allocated for the relief of unemployment. A substantial portion of that money passed through the Land Commission and there has been a general demand in the House for a speedy arrangement for the release of that money or a substantial portion of it for the execution of necessary work. I think it was nothing short of a public scandal that three or four months after that money was voted certain works were not initiated.  I challenge contradiction of the fact that in some instances works approved of have not yet been started.  If there was any advantage of the handing over of a substantial portion of that money to the Land Commission it was in the realisation that the Land Commission could deal with it quickly and consequently get the benefit of the expenditure of that money to the people of the country who needed it.</P>
      <P>After repeated visits by inspectors&mdash; I am speaking now with particular reference to my own constituency&mdash;and after repeated representations were made to the Department, a certain number of works were approved of, and I shall give, at a later period in this statement, an account of the method by which this money was allocated in that particular constituency.  I again say that it was a keen disappointment and an altogether unjustifiable delay on the part of the Land Commission to allow three or four months and, without any exaggeration, three or four months at the hardest time of the year, to pass without releasing that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> The time immediately after Christmas would be a very difficult time for the people waiting for their opportunity to earn portion of that money. And it was a very unsatisfactory position for disappointed people that they were unable to earn a share of that money at the time when it was very keenly needed.  I consider that delay defeated to a great extent the wishes of the House and the decision to make that money available for particular purposes.  The wish was expressed, when that matter was being dealt with here, that the Land Commission would not delay the expenditure of the money by having particular points raised about the nature of the holdings on which the money was to be expended, or, to put the matter more clearly, wishes were expressed that the Land Commission might get over, as I have no doubt they could get over, the difficulties that would arise, and did arise in previous years, in connection with the necessary works where certain lands were purchased under certain Acts and where, in fact, vesting had taken place on some estates. Nothing whatever was done in regard to that work so far as I know.  The intention of the Land Commission was that certain works of improvement that had been partially carried out in recent years would be completed.  There are quite a number of such works in the constituency that I come from that have not been completed, and I complain of the very inadequate amount of money made available for that kind of work in my constituency.  I point to the fact that we have, I think, a very important claim upon the Land Commission. The complaint of the Land Commission has been, in some instances that work of that kind that was carried out was allowed to go to waste by reason of the fact that the roads, when they were made, were not maintained afterwards, and became in a short time simply overgrown tracks. In West Cork, at any rate, the local authorities have in practically every instance where the Land Commission made an accommodation road, where useful work of that kind was carried out, taken over that particular work and allocated a certain amount for the maintenance of that particular work <Col N="1341" /> afterwards.  In other words, they made sure, so far as the powers conferred upon the local authorities go, that the best results would be got for the expenditure.  I consider that that was a policy that would entitle a particular county where the local authorities do pursue that policy to special claims upon the Land Commission for the completion of works of that kind.</P>
    <P>I point to the fact also, that certain important works, about the merits of which there can be no question&mdash;a claim that cannot be advanced all round, even in regard to the constituency I come from&mdash;were approved of in some instances some years ago. They were submitted to the Land Commission annually since.  They were formally inspected, and forgotten immediately afterwards.  I want to ask whether it is considered good policy to incur the expense of having certain proposals examined and reported on more than once, if there is no intention or opportunity or funds to carry out such works.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is the intention of the Land Commission, out of the amount allocated for the improvement of Estates, £211,250, for the coming year, to undertake works of that kind.  I assume that a considerable amount of work will have to be done by reason of the legislation recently passed in this House, but even where the operation of the recent Land Act will not be concerned, and where there is a strong case for works of this kind, I want to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary will give any indication that it is the policy of the Land Commission to consider, on the merits, works of the particular kind I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is grave dissatisfaction in certain parts of the country, at the method by which this money was allocated. Having regard to the position in the district I come from, I consider also, that there is some mystery attached to the whole matter. A report was submitted shortly after the allocation of the amount I have referred to in regard to the completion of works, and an examination of proposals generally submitted was made <Col N="1342" /> afterwards.  Beyond the execution of a comparatively small number of works, nothing of any consequence was done, and even to-day, in the question answered by the Parliamentary Secretary, a confession was made that it was found impossible to provide funds for the execution of any work of a number that was necessary in one of the islands off West Cork.  I do not want to repeat what I have often said about conditions in cases of that kind.  They must always be difficult.  That needs no argument. They must be extremely difficult in places where much, if not everything, depends on the success of the fishing industry, which is the mainstay of the people on the island.  It is not over-stating the case to say, that in an island like Cape Clear, conditions during the past winter were pretty hard.  I believe it was gross neglect on the part of the Inspector who was dealing with the district to have failed to consider the claims of people on the island, and of necessity the unhappy position the people of that place were in.</P>
    <P>I want to make another complaint about the general policy of the Land Commission.  I have personal experience on more than one occasion of the great difficulty in getting replies from the Land Commission in regard to matters submitted to them.  One branch is an outstanding exception to that statement.  That is the collecting branch.  My experience, and I think that of most Deputies, of the collection branch is that the work is expeditiously done and that the administration is generally satisfactory, and one might say sympathetic.  That does not obtain in other branches of the Land Commission. I have a distinct recollection of instances where I ultimately gave up hope of getting any decision whatever on matters submitted to them. There were two methods, one by written communication and the other by personal interview.  I gather that for some time the method of reaching the Land Commission through personal interview with the officers of that Department is not encouraged.  One can see restrictions mounting up fairly steadily in that particular Department <Col N="1343" /> and one can sense elsewhere a policy, that seems to be more apparent as time goes on, of discouraging Deputies in this House from interesting themselves in matters affecting their constituents at all.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not unfair to the Land Commission when I say that, because I want to be fair on the matter.  I have been definitely forced to the conclusion that there is a desire to show that Deputies, by using the method of personal interviews with officers of the Department, need not hope for very satisfactory results.  I do not know why that should be so in any Department of State, and I avail of this opportunity of drawing attention to it and of making a request, which I think is a reasonable one, that members of this House who submit matters affecting their constituents to the Land Commission ought to have speedy replies and ought to be put in a position of being able to transmit to their constituents decisions of the Land Commission dealing with certain matters within a reasonable time.</P>

Leaving that matter and dealing with the delay that surrounds the administration of the Land Commission generally, I have in mind at least one instance that would serve to illustrate what I am arguing.  I understand, and I do not want to take any advantage of the Land Commission in this matter, that questions affecting the division of land and involving examination of title and other questions of that kind must be slow, and cannot be dealt with in a very short time, but there are limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the case of a farmer on the Mitchel estate, near Inchegeela, Co. Cork.  His holding, as well as the holding of some of his neighbours, was the subject of law proceedings some three or four years ago in connection with a turbary dispute.  The Circuit Court Judge adjourned the case in order to give the Land Commission an <Col N="1344" /> opportunity of dealing with it.  Beyond the occasional visit of an inspector since, no very great progress has been made.  This is not the fault of the tenant concerned.  He made many representations by letter to the Land Commission.  Representations were made also by members of this House on more than one occasion.  This was really a matter of life and death for the unfortunate person concerned.  The Circuit Court Judge could not wait indefinitely for the decision of the Land Commission, and ultimately he dealt with the case to the disadvantage of the person concerned, who in defence of his rights had to bring the matter to the High Court at a time when appeals were dealt with very slowly.  He subsequently took the matter to the Supreme Court.  His claim was actually vindicated in the Supreme Court, but the decision, strangely enough, did not carry costs, with the result that that man has been practically beggared. No big principle was involved to prevent a decision being reached.  Inspectors of the Department who visited the estate from time to time found that there was no dispute whatever in regard to the facts.  It simply meant making a decision in regard to the regulations affecting turbary on the estate.  The man has been mulcted to the tune of £300 or £400, and the responsibility for that must inevitably come back to the Land Commission, whose officers have been very slow in dealing with the matter.  I realise that it would take some time, but at least one might hope for the completion of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I put that case as an instance of the undue delay that is taking place in comparatively small matters, and I complain again&mdash;I will return to it on another occasion&mdash;about the unfair delay and the disappointment experienced in regard to the allocation of moneys that should have been put in the course of expenditure within a reasonable time.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to make provision at least for the completion of unfinished works out of the Improvement Vote for the Land Commission during <Col N="1346" /> the coming year, and to give us some indication as to whether he is prepared to consider, with a view to execution, certain works that have long ago been reported on by his Department, and the need for the execution of which there is no question about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to a matter which is very important, at least in our county.  Under the 1923 Act various estates came under the Land Commission.  There was no opportunity given, either to the landlord or the tenant, to make any arrangements regarding drainage, which was in very many cases being carried out by the landlord.  Three cases at least have been brought to my notice, and I am sure that there are ten times as many in the county where the landlord was in the habit of having his estate in these particular localities drained every second or third year. In 1923 those lands came under the Land Commission, and since that time no drainage whatever has been done, with the result that in a few of the districts the tenants are badly swamped out at the moment.  A clause was inserted in the recent Land Acts which gives the Land Commission the right to recoup themselves out of certain moneys retained by them for the purpose of doing necessary improvements on estates in regard to embankments and, I understand, drainage. I would like that the Parliamentary Secretary would pay particular attention to applications under this heading. These people have been paying exorbitant rents quite long enough, and they have been long enough waiting for the lands to be vested without having further injury inflicted on them through not having the drainage done.</P>
      <P>With regard to special works, roads to turbary and all that, under the last unemployment grant a great deal of work was done in that direction, but there will be very grave danger now, I am afraid, if those estates become vested in the Land Commission where they have unfinished work, that they will disclaim all responsibility for carrying out the work.  I would like to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> With regard to delays I am afraid that, like Deputy Murphy, I cannot compliment the Land Commission that they have successfully carried out their duties in Roscommon.  There is one case in particular and that is the Potts Estate in South Roscommon where the landlord and the Land Commission agreed over two years ago on a certain price for the land.  Everything was in readiness but the people are still waiting for the land.  I had thought the matter was long since settled, but when I made inquiries recently I was told that there were difficulties about boundaries between tenanted and untenanted land.  Both the landlord and the tenants realise that there is no such difficulty.  That is the position after waiting over 18 months.  There are also the estates of Glover, Mapother and Fitzmaurice. All these things are not creditable to the Land Commission.  I think these things need to be speeded up, and I would direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to them in the hope that they will be attended to with the least possible delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Derrig I am glad to know from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement this evening that there is evidently a change of front on the part of the Land Commission.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement and as a result of recent legislation in this House they are evidently at last going to tackle, in a serious way, the problem of vesting land.  I hope the undertaking given by the Parliamentary Secretary this evening will bear fruition at an early date.  After all, it is one of the big problems of this State, and if the Parliamentary Secretary is true to his word and if the matter is tackled in the way he states it will, he will have the sympathy and co-operation of Deputies in every part of the House.  Despite the promises of the Parliamentary Secretary and the evident change of front on the part of the Land Commission I still state that it is quite proper for this House to refer back <Col N="1348" /> this Vote for reconsideration.  Even if we take Deputy Brennan's statement we must agree that things must be pretty bad with the Land Commission when he finds fault with a Government Department.  We have a statement now in which he expresses his dissatisfaction with the Land Commission. When that is the case, surely I, who have always been in a position to find fault with them on every occasion cannot be blamed now when I have the chance for saying that I too am dissatisfied with the Land Commission particularly as regards the division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I take the County Mayo, I can show the House that it is one of the worst as regards congestion.  What was said last year can be said this year again, and that is that the result of the Land Commission's work there is practically negligible when you consider the division of land in the whole country.  The Land Commission have been particularly slow in dividing estates.  It is admitted that this is such a very serious problem and that a large number of congests have been gravely wronged.  The sympathy of this House as a whole goes to these people.  When we have a body like the Land Commission, having authority to get down and tackle that question during the past six or seven years, and having not alone the authority to do it, but the money to do it, I cannot understand why we still have congestion such as we have.  I cannot understand why there are in certain localities grazing ranches still held by the landlord, or even in the hands of the Land Commission without being divided.  I cannot understand what hidden hand must be behind the scenes delaying the serious tackling and settling of these problems.  Some land has been divided in Mayo all right, but if you compare the number of people who have been placed on the land by the Land Commission, with the thousands of people who are in a very poor condition as congests, you will say that there is no appreciable change made in the county as a whole. It is simply deplorable to think that at the present day you have the rundale system in existence in portions of <Col N="1349" /> Mayo.  That system is a disgrace to civilisation.  You have still co-tenants living there without any boundary, and you have those estates in the hands of the Land Commission for a number of years.  You have within a short distance of undivided land, places that may be called land slums.  In their neighbourhood you have large tracts of land which have not yet been taken over by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in this House at times find fault with the graziers and landlords who have succeeded in holding on to their lands, but I think one cannot blame any grazier or landlord in such circumstances, when you have the Land Commission having compulsory powers for a number of years to acquire any land they wish for distribution amongst congests.  The Land Commission has not seriously tackled this question of acquiring the land, and planting the people on it.  It is for that reason that I wish that this Vote would be referred back.  In parts of the County Mayo, you have, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, especially in the eastern and northern areas, parishes where you have a very disgraceful rundale system existing. The question of these congests with large farms in the locality has been raised again and again by different Deputies here.  The only reply we can get from the Land Commission was that the question would receive attention.  I do not like that phrase &ldquo;receive attention.&rdquo;  I do not like to be pressing the Land Commission again and again, but if they give the slightest indication that the attention which they promised to give this matter would be given to it on some definite day I would give them some decent chance.  It should be realised here, that people are living in rundale holdings down the country, in small patches of land existing by tilling small farms part of the year, and going to England and Scotland every year to earn a few pounds in order to carry them through the winter season.</P>
    <P>It should be realised that these people have been very patient with the Land Commission, and very patient with the Government.  Their condition should be really changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> There is one matter with which I would like to charge the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am glad that certain Deputies are at the moment in this House, because I am sure they will bear me out in this matter.  That is, that the Parliamentary Secretary has allowed himself, despite his fervour&mdash; and I admit that he has given a good deal of attention to the work of the land problem in this country&mdash;to be made a political tool of by certain Deputies in this House on many occasions. There is a paper in the West of Ireland in which for the past two years we have read big long lists and letters written by the Parliamentary Secretary to a certain Deputy whom it is not necessary to name.  These letters stated that these estates about which the Mayo Deputy had written and the conditions existing there &ldquo;will be very specially considered by me and my Department, and every effort is going to be made at the earliest possible opportunity to settle this estate and tackle this question about which you have written.&rdquo;</P>

I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give care and attention to these estates.  I have watched those cases, and not one of these farms has yet been divided.  They did not carry the camouflage as far as sending down an inspector, but they did have letters written and published with the Parliamentary Secretary's name&mdash;letters he now repudiates&mdash;in the &ldquo;Western People,&rdquo; in order to fool the people. I do not think it is a decent thing to do.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has been so apologetic about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davis was quite enthusiastic over the progress that has been made in County Mayo, but I must say that I do not feel quite the same enthusiasm.  I think that much more progress could have been made and Deputy Davis should not be satisfied to stop now.  We have in Mayo a very considerable portion of the Gaeltacht. The Gaeltacht problem was gone into in great detail some years ago by the Land Commission, but little progress <Col N="1353" /> has been made because the people there are in the same unfortunate position as they were then; conditions have not altered much.  Two or three years ago there were very definite promises made to the dwellers on Inniskea Island.  I know that a certain amount of delay was bound to take place in migrating the islanders to the mainland.  I would like to see them brought to the mainland at the earliest opportunity and I am sure the Land Commission could do that if they tackled the question seriously.  They really ought to carry out the promise they made two years ago.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has talked about estate improvements.  I must say that the position in regard to estate improvements does not meet with my satisfaction.  One of the greatest wrongs the Land Commission did two years ago was to reduce the Vote for estate improvements by £150,000.  Last year a grant was given for a few hundred thousand pounds and that was talked about as if it were a great boon to the people.  That grant was given for the relief of distress. The fact of the matter is the Government were only giving back to the people the money they took from them two years ago when they reduced the amount that used to be given annually for the improvement of estates.</P>
      <P>The amount for estate improvement this year is not at all sufficient.  The improvement of estates is one of the most important features of Land Commission work and it should be adequately tackled.  You have the small farmers with no accommodation roads and you have mountain streams and streams through low-lying lands continually flooded adjoining areas and destroying the crops of the farmers. These are matters with which the Land Commission should deal.  If they have not sufficient money at their disposal to tackle these questions of accommodation roads and small drainage schemes I am sure the majority of Deputies would be quite prepared to agree to any Vote which would enable the Land Commission to proceed with that work.  Estate improvement is the one important thing, next to the division of land, that will aid congests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> With regard to the Relief Vote I, like Deputy Murphy and other Deputies, have every fault to find with the manner in which it was distributed and also the manner in which the work was done by the Land Commission. Why was it that one portion of County Mayo, the most thickly populated portion, East Mayo, was practically excluded from any of the work carried out under the relief vote?  You have in that area very lamentable conditions existing on estates that have been in the hands of the Land Commission for years.  I, and other people, sent in communications demanding that certain works should be done, particularly in the way of road-making. With one exception not a single scheme was carried out in that portion of the county.  Was there any particular reason for excluding that part of the county?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of housing. I understand that the Land Commission has power to construct houses for tenants and to charge them a little extra in their rents for the expenses incurred.  It would be a very laudable thing if that were done, because there are tenants who cannot afford, even with the housing grants, to build houses for themselves.  I think the Land Commission should go in more for building and improving houses and putting the cost involved on to the rents of the tenants.  This whole question is one that should be tackled in a big way.  Even with all the Land Acts that have been passed here, including the recent Act, regarding the vesting of estates, the Land Commission are not yet in a position, evidently, to tackle the problem in the proper way so that it can be settled once and for all.  I am convinced that this problem of congestion, where you have farmers trying to exist on small patches of waste land, is one of the biggest that confronts the State.  There are many cases of insanitary house conditions as a result of people trying to live on starved holdings.  Unless the Land Commission deals with this matter these lamentable conditions will go on year after year.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk about the success of the Shannon <Col N="1355" /> scheme.  Will any Deputy deny that if the six millions which was invested in the Shannon scheme a few years ago were applied instead to the land problem and were utilised in planting the people on the land, taking them out of congested and starved holdings and making them real farmers, that that would not be a much better proposition? You would have had a better peasantry, because the people who live in these small holdings are the best elements in the State.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland&mdash;and I am sure it is the same in other counties in which there is congestion&mdash;the farmers on small holdings are the best producers.  They rely on themselves and not upon State bounties, State salaries or State pensions.  As a rule, they rear large families and, thereby, are the largest taxpayers.  These are the people who should be dealt with first by the Land Commission.  If the Government had gone to the extent of floating a loan of five or six millions, or whatever it would have cost, to overhaul the question of congestion by dividing the ranches and planting the people on economic holdings there would be a very fine element in the State, existing under independent conditions, and they would be a credit to the country.  Small struggling farmers on small holdings should be allowed to expand.  The problem has never been seriously tackled by the Government. Until it is it will be a case of working against the grain and allowing the great evil of land slums to continue.  If the Government was serious about the matter they would have the co-operation of ever party in solving the problem. For the reason that it has not been tackled seriously I will vote for referring back this Estimate.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with those who have been congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on his stupendous work in getting a Land Bill passed which will, as far as one can see, complete land purchase in the Saorstát.  In the course of his speech Deputy Derrig labelled Kildare as one of the principal ranching counties.  It is not a tillage county in the sense that Wexford is; nevertheless, if the <Col N="1356" /> Deputy went to South Kildare he would find that a very large proportion of the land is tilled close to Athy, Castledermot, and up to the town of Kildare.  Even in North Kildare, where the land is not really suitable, a large proportion of it is tilled.  If the Deputy would like to make a journey down there with the intention of seeing the tillage I shall be glad to help him.</P>

      <P>A considerable portion of the land in North Kildare, although it is unsuitable, is under tillage.  For instance, there is a considerable amount of tillage near Naas.  A very progressive farmer who, unfortunately, has just died employed twenty men there, and there are others who had as much as fifty men employed at one time.  Unfortunately there are not so many employed on the land at present on account of deaths that occurred, and which brought about reductions in establishments.  An extensive amount of tillage is also done in other parts of the county, so that Kildare does not come under the heading of a ranching county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy recommended the bringing of uneconomic holders from the West to Kildare.  Three neighbours and I, when labour was very scarce in 1917, brought in forty labourers from Glenamaddy.  I am bound to say that they were the best workers I had ever had.  Nevertheless, they did not associate with the people of the district and were evidently not at home. They did their work in a way that no one could cavil at.  It was quite plain that they would never settle down and did not like the district.  I had them for a year, and, as far as their work was concerned, I was extremely sorry when they went away.  It is a different thing to migrate the large holders; that has been done by the Land Commission, and, as far as I can see, fairly successfully.  The Land <Col N="1357" /> Commission has already divided a considerable amount of land&mdash;certain other places suitable for division are under consideration&mdash;amongst uneconomic holders.  I think the work the Land Commission is doing is work that will be successful and lasting.  I congratulate the Land Commission on the work that has been done and on the way it has been done.  Migration is objected to, as a rule, but it has been done as well and with so little friction as it could be done in any country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not offer any serious objection to the demand put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary for an increase in the Estimate of £8,920 if I could get an assurance&mdash; I hope it will be forthcoming&mdash;that the work of the Land Commission will be done more expeditiously and more efficiently in the future than has been the case up to the present.  There is a demand for an increase of £8,920 and there is a consequent increase in the staff to be employed from 678 to 719.  We find that the increase of 41 in the staff is mainly confined to the Purchase Branch and to the inspectorate. These are the very people that I hold responsible for the uncalled for delays that have taken place during the past few years, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give an assurance that the increased staff that he is asking for and hopes to get will mean a corresponding increase in the efficiency of these branches.  There is an increase of 27 in the inspectorate staff and of 18 in the Purchase Branch.  I am not making any serious objection to the demand for these increases if we can have an assurance that the work will be better done in the future than it has been done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Murphy&mdash;and for very good reasons&mdash;in complaining about the manner in which money for improvements has been expended and the way in which the work has been done by the section of the Land Commission responsible for carrying out improvement works on estates about to be divided.  On at least two occasions recently I complained in this House&mdash;and I think justifiably&mdash;about <Col N="1358" /> the action of the Land Commission in carrying out division schemes without making roads which would enable the people who are getting portion of the land to get into it and work it to the best advantage.  I have had correspondence about the matter with the Parliamentary Secretary and with the Secretary of the Land Commission in the case of several estates during the past few years.  I can give the names of three estates in one county where I have forwarded these complaints within the last two or three years, where improvement work has not been finished.  I say that it is a scandalous state of affairs that the Commissioners should hand over land to people that cannot be worked because they cannot get the necessary roads or rights of way into the holdings.  If they had roads it would enable the owners to work the land properly.  No matter what the delay in the future may be the Parliamentary Secretary should endeavour to see that these roadways and ditches, where necessary, are made before the land is handed over.  I hope this will be the last occasion on which it will be necessary to make a complaint of this kind in the House.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected a Deputy seven or eight years ago I have made it a practice to forward in writing any complaints to any Department, when it is necessary to make representations to a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.  I have hardly ever sought an interview with a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, or an official of any Department, without having previously made written representations about the matter at issue.  There may have been exceptional cases where I sought assistance by way of an interview with officials, simply because the matter was urgent and might have to be dealt with immediately or not at all.  I want to join with Deputy Murphy in complaining at the manner in which correspondence forwarded by me to that Department has been dealt with.  A polite form of acknowledgement in Irish and English is sent out, and I believe the same thing is done by way of direct correspondence with people who complain about the work of the Department. A person writes two, three or perhaps <Col N="1359" /> four times, and no answer is received except the usual statement that the matter will receive immediate and sympathetic attention.  The branches, as far as I can ascertain, which are mainly responsible for the delay, and for carrying on this dilly-dallying sort of correspondence, are the branches responsible for dealing with applications for the acquisition of untenanted lands, and the division of those lands, following acquisition. I have a case in mind, in which I have been carrying on correspondence with the Secretary of the Land Commission for a period of four years, where the Land Commission inspectors have gone down time and again&mdash;I do not know what those visits would cost in this case&mdash;and where up to the present I have been unable to get a decision from the Commissioners as to whether or not they propose to acquire the untenanted lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Lord Castletown's estate of Ballacolla, County Laoighis.  The Deputy sitting beside the Parliamentary Secretary (Deputy Aird) will probably be able to bear me out if he is taking any interest in the acquisition of that estate.  Deputy Aird will be able to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that it is well over a year since he attended a meeting in that area at which the parish priest presided, and at which a complaint was made regarding the delay on the part of the Commissioners in dealing with the estate.  He and the other Deputies, including Deputy Gorry, were strongly urged to get a definite reply as to the intentions of the Commissioners. Nothing has been done up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on quoting other cases in which Deputies representing all parties in the constituency have been unable to get anything in the nature of a final or satisfactory reply from the Land Commission.  I should like a definite reply, one way or other.  If I got that kind of reply, although it might not be favourable to my own point of view, I would be satisfied.  It <Col N="1360" /> would also tend to show the people in the country who are called upon to pay the salaries of the officials in the Land Commission that these officials are giving some return for their money. We are told a great deal about this great business Government.  I would like Deputy Good, the leader of the so-called Business Party here, to go into the Land Commission, investigate the working of that Department and say whether there is any justification from the business man's point of view for the complaints made in this House, and repeated here this evening.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would furnish me, if I put the question, with the amount of money expended in investigations, reports and visits in connection with many of these estates for the last three or four years?  It is not much satisfaction to the people called upon to pay to know that inspectors visit these estates four, five or six times and that they cannot get any sort of satisfactory reply from the people responsible for dealing with the reports of the inspectors.</P>
    <P>I have reason to know that reports have been repeatedly made by inspectors recommending in some cases the acquisition of lands and that the failure to acquire those lands is due to the Commissioners and the people responsible for the conduct of the Department. I have reason to know&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary knows I know&mdash;that decisions were given to acquire lands and that some influence &mdash;landlord influence or representations by or on behalf of landlords&mdash;has had the effect of having these decisions reversed.  I have quoted cases in this House of that kind and the Parliamentary Secretary has endeavoured to the best of his ability&mdash;and he is a very able man&mdash;to give some plausible reason for the reversal of these decisions. I am referring now to the unnecessary expense incurred without showing any result for the work done. If Deputy Aird would like to say anything on this matter, I would ask him to say, in the most emphatic language, whether there is any justification in the case to which I refer or in other cases for the dilly-dallying policy of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> I join with Deputy Murphy in paying a well-deserved tribute to the people in charge of the troublesome work of the Collection Branch of the Land Commission for the manner in which they answer correspondence.  It would be a most unusual thing not to receive a reply of some kind or other from that branch inside a week or two, at the most.  Although I have not received favourable replies in all cases, I think the people in charge of that branch are to be congratulated on the businesslike and sympathetic manner in which they carry out their work.  The Collection Branch receives a considerable number of communications, mainly as a result of the depressed condition of the people who are called upon to pay annuities. They have to make the best case they can for asking the head of that Department, or the Commissioners as the case may be, not to send the sheriff to execute decrees until such time as they will be able to dispose of stock and find the necessary money.  The work is carried out in the most sympathetic and businesslike way. From my little experience of the work done by the Examiners' Branch in dealing with Land Committee cases, I can say the same thing.  I know of one or two Land Committee cases which I thought would be impossible to settle to the satisfaction of the parties concerned.  They were dealt with satisfactorily and in a most efficient manner by the Examiners' Branch of the Land Commission.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me&mdash;this might not apply to other Deputies&mdash;that the work of the Department would be more expeditiously done and that correspondence would be dealt with in a more businesslike way as a result of increasing the staff, I would be prepared to vote for the additional sum required.  I have never voted against a demand of the Land Commission or any other Department for increase of their Estimate.  I am giving my reasons in this case.  Deputy Shaw rightly said that, in the division of land, it is almost impossible to satisfy the claims of all those who make applications.  I wish to goodness that every perch of land in <Col N="1362" /> this country was divided, because the most troublesome kind of case that comes to the notice of a Deputy representing a rural constituency is the case which arises out of the acquisition or division of land.  I congratulate Deputy Lemass, the deputy-Leader of Fianna Fáil, because he represents a constituency in which Land Commission annuities are unknown and where there is no land to be divided.</P>
    <P>That, I believe, is why Deputy Lemass can give so much time and attention to the study of other questions. If he represented a rural constituency, as I do, he could not give that great attention to other work which he apparently gives to it at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the division of land, I want to say quite frankly that there have not been very many complaints of unfairness submitted to me.  I do not go round canvassing for complaints of this kind, particularly those of a character that would have to be dealt with by the Land Commission. I have a case in mind, and it is the second one that has been brought to my notice, in connection with an estate recently divided in Offaly, where certain uneconomic holders, some of them, to my knowledge, of a very desirable character, have been left out of the division scheme.  In one case, an ex-R.I.C. sergeant who is not a native of the area, but who is in receipt of a good pension as well as a supposed British service pension, got 25 acres.  I understand that he is alleged to have received a fat grant from what is called the Southern Loyalists' Fund.  I recommend the Parliamentary Secretary, when considering applications from individuals of that kind, to make up his mind in future to tell that type of man to go and buy land in the neighbourhood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same estate a man who was stated to be in possession of two farms and who is alleged to have sold a publichouse for £1,300, received another portion of 25 acres. I have received some very serious complaints from people residing in that particular area.  I think that such complaints are quite justified.  In one case there has been complaint regarding a very deserving uneconomic holder with a family of twelve, who has a small holding of five acres in the immediate vicinity of this estate.  That state of affairs requires to be closely looked into.  I am taking this opportunity of strongly protesting in this House, because I find that written protests are no use, against the policy of the Land Commission in giving land to such persons.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give a clear direction to his inspectors not to give land to such people while there are deserving uneconomic holders in the vicinity.  That case may not have finished yet, but I know that it has caused considerable dissatisfaction, and rightly so, in the immediate locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give me an assurance when replying that, so far as it is possible to do so in future, improvement works, where necessary, will be carried out before or very soon after the estates are divided.  Money spent on the improvement of estates that have been acquired and divided is well spent because it gives valuable employment and in all cases, so far as I know, has improved the land. It is, however, a monstrous state of affairs to find people in possession of land for two or three years, but unable to work it owing to the conditions in which it has been left.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will issue instructions to all officials concerned to have such work carried out more expeditiously in future.  In regard to the allocation and expenditure of that portion of the Relief Vote which has been handed over to the Land Commission I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether the money which has been, and is being, expended out of <Col N="1364" /> that particular Vote is being expended upon works which have been initiated by the inspectors in the counties concerned or whether they are being carried out as the result of representations made by Deputies.  Perhaps he will tell us from whom these recommendations generally come.  I have heard Deputies making complaints about the methods of allocation and the failure of the Department to carry out certain works recommended by themselves.  I am not going to make any complaint on that particular score but I would like to know whether works of this kind are supposed to be suggested by Deputies or whether it is the duty of inspectors to find out where useful work can be done.  I personally will be satisfied if the responsibility is placed on the inspectors and if it will be part of their duty in future to initiate work of this kind when money is available for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Davin that the Land Commission is to be condemned for the manner in which it leaves estates after they have been divided.  I raised the matter three years ago and was asked to give the names of estates.  I did so and was later informed that the matter was receiving attention, but the estates are still in the same condition. On many such estates people tell me that the land is all right but that they cannot get into it in the winter owing to unmade roads.  Another matter to which attention should be drawn is the fact that though 200 or 300 people get allotments of turbary they cannot get their turf away.  In some cases they have been paying rent for three or four years for turbary which they cannot use.  We are told that in some cases the allottees cannot be got to sign, and until they sign the roads cannot be made.  I know people who signed years ago and who have paid their rent but have not yet got their turf.  It would be only right that before people are asked to pay rent the turbary should be made accessible.  I think it is a bad state of affairs to give an increase of £7,000 or £8,000 under the heading of salaries and to <Col N="1365" /> have a big decrease in the grant for the improvement of estates.</P>
      <P>Formerly there used to be about £300,000 estimated for improvement of estates.  We agree with the members of the Labour Party who stated that this is a bad time to reduce this expenditure, and that it should not be reduced until these improvements are carried out.  Deputy Brennan mentioned what is happening in Roscommon on estates taken over by the Land Commission.  In cases where the landlord kept the drains on these estates clear, the Land Commission has done nothing.  Any time I visit Roscommon I receive complaints of that kind, and when I do not go down I get letters complaining that the land has been flooded owing to neglect of the drains. There is one place in the Athlone district called Drumlosh.  The Land Commission drained one estate, the Kelly estate.  The stream ran through this estate, and there were about three miles from the end of the estate to the Shannon.  They left the last three miles to the Shannon without clearing up, with the result that the village has been practically inundated, and the people there tell me that they cannot stop in it.  I think that is scandalous. If a private individual were to flood his neighbours, they would have a cause of action against him.  I do not know whether they have a cause of action in this case against the Land Commission for doing this thing.  In this case the people are isolated.  It is called the village of Drumlosh, and is near the Kelly estate, in the parish of Drum. The roads are also very bad.  I think that they should have made a way out for the water before they started their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On another estate, the Coote estate, the bog is inaccessible.  The tenants say that the landlord kept the drains clear.  I do not know that there is any case for reducing the Estimate for improvements when things like that can occur.  I think the work should be continued until all these matters are attended to.  Instead of increasing salaries the money should be spent on work of that kind.  There is another estate in Roscommon which ex-Deputy Finlay repeatedly brought up here <Col N="1366" /> until he resigned in 1924.  He got letters saying that the matter would receive attention.  I am getting letters to the same effect.  On my return I was told that they would receive attention, but the matter has not been attended to yet.</P>

      <P>It is being attended to. They have changed the language&mdash;that is all.  We get it all in Irish now.  I am glad there is an improvement even in that respect.  There is another estate in Kilteevan, and the people there are in a very bad way.  It is a very congested area, but when the Land Commission proposed to acquire an estate in the district they presented their case so badly that the judge disallowed the claim.  He would not allow them to acquire the estate because they did not bring forward any evidence that there was congestion in the district.  It is certainly one of the most congested areas in the county.  Perhaps the owner, Mr. Glover, was able to manage things in some way.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary himself.  He meant to have the land acquired, but he was beaten.  There is another estate which, it is expected, will be divided in the district, and I think these people should be considered in the distribution of that estate.  It is called the Killerney Farm, near Kilteevan. I think the people there should be considered when the division of that farm is taking place.  We all have had complaints in regard to the distribution of the relief grant.  Deputy Clery mentioned East Mayo, and I must say that in that part of East Mayo adjacent to Ballaghadereen the people were left in a deplorable state.  I have met people who told me that they were not able to bring their hay in, and they had to drive the cattle up to it.  I sent in many petitions from the district, and I got the usual reply.  I suppose nothing was done, but I think there was a good case for such a backward district.</P>

      <P>(Cork): I must say that this is one of the happiest nights of my life, when I find members of every section in the Dáil throwing <Col N="1367" /> bouquets at the Parliamentary Secretary for his splendid work in connection with the Land Commission and the vesting of land.  I congratulate the House on changing its atmosphere.  We were kept for three or four days on the debates on the Budget.  Volumes of talk came from the Fianna Fáil and Labour Benches, but behold, at the moment of coming to a division, all agreed that the only and the best policy for the Budget was the one advanced by the Minister for Finance. I congratulate the House for their unanimity on that.  It is a clear indication that we are all coming to our senses, and that we are determined in this grand old State to adopt a policy of good sound commonsense when we are up against the problems that affect people.  As far as administration is concerned, in connection with the figure of £350,000, over and over again Deputy Roddy has been placed in the pillory because it was alleged he did not give justice to every corner of the Twenty-Six Counties.  It is a very large problem, and the sum is somewhat small, but I think all Deputies will agree that in the distribution of that money he proved himself an honest man.  One Deputy who would join with me in that tribute is Deputy Murphy from Cork.  Although he criticised some aspects of the Estimate somewhat sharply, I am certain he is honest enough to realise that our little constituency has not been forgotten.  I am not in the habit of running over to the Land Commission or any other office, although I have been in the Dáil for three years, and I hope to get five more, please God, but I must say that whenever I did cross over to the different offices I was always knocking up against the followers of either Deputy de Valera or Deputy O'Connell, showing that they were all anxious to pull as many nuts out of the fire as they could over in these offices.  I hope that the conclusion of this debate will be as unanimous as was the conclusion of the debate on the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies waxed eloquent on the Budget.  They all took it to their hearts.  After all the debate there was on the Budget, the Minister for Finance <Col N="1368" /> showed that he was the most able man of the lot.  We would be showing a good headline to the nation if all of us members on this side, on the Labour Benches and on Fianna Fáil, and in every part of the House were unanimous in passing this Estimate. Remember there is the sum of £500,000 at stake.  There are hundreds and thousands out of employment.  The spending of the money voted to this Department will have a most welcome effect in relieving that situation.  I have been associated with every movement that was started in the country with the object of putting the people back on the land.  No matter how men at the present day may disagree about politics, they are all at one in agreeing that the movement which helped to put the people back on the land of their sires was a great one.  I ask the members of the House to be unanimous in agreeing to this Vote.  Their action in doing so will give heart to the people.  We should be unanimous on any matter that comes before this House which aims at improving and safeguarding the position of this great old country of ours and its people.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I am glad that the Deputy who has just sat down is happy.  I hope he will remain so. I would like to say that if some of the bouquets offered to the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary are examined, an occasional brick may be found in them.  I want to heave a bouquet and a brick at the same time at the Estimate that is before us. The outstanding feature of the administration of the Land Commission is the dispatch with which certain sections of it answer correspondence and the amount of valuable work they get through in a commendably short period of time, while, as regards other sections of the same Department, one gets very little attention for a protracted period.  In the case of the collection branch I am in the position that I am able to offer it a bouquet. It is one of the most sympathetic sections of the Land Commission. I have no fault to find with the way it <Col N="1369" /> treats representations when made to it, and I have had occasion to do so pretty often.  As regards other sections, the only change we find, as Deputy Boland has already said, is that where we get acknowledgements from them the correspondence is in Irish.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary, who, I am sure, is an earnest advocate of the Irish language, that a mere acknowledgement of a letter in Irish is not of any greater value than if one got it in English. When we make representations to the Department we expect some work to be done.  That exactly is what we want.</P>
      <P>I refer now to such things as the flooding of lands, broken banks and impassable roads.  When we make representations on these matters to the Department we simply get an acknowledgment. You send a reminder and you get another acknowledgment.  If your representations concern land you simply get a statement that the matter will receive attention when the estate is being vested and you are left waiting. In connection with some cases of genuine hardship I am waiting as long as three years for some consideration to be given to them.  I have, for instance, in mind a case at Carrigaholt where there is flooding. I went through the place myself and found it water-logged.  Even the house is damp because of the fact that the water encroaches up to it.  I thought that under the Relief Vote some of the money voted would have been expended in order to relieve the position of farmers suffering in that way.  That is probably one of the most Irish-speaking districts in that portion of the County Clare.  In my opinion, a certain amount of money could be usefully spent there in order to enable that poor farmer to carry on, to enable him to pay his annuities.  But the fact is that no money was spent in that district at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was taken to another district outside of Ennis which is flooded for many months of the year.  Some three or four years ago I made representations to the Department, and asked that an inspector be sent down and some consideration given to the fact <Col N="1370" /> that the two people who own that place have to pay annuities.  I know for a positive fact that they are making little or nothing out of the land they hold.  They could not do so because it is practically covered with water.  That land is situate at Dowra, outside of Ennis.  In these two instances that I have given the Department has failed to do anything.  The Department is not giving any real satisfaction in administration in these matters.</P>
    <P>As regards the relief schemes, my constituency certainly did not get its proportionate share of the money voted.  Of the share that it did get I have to make a serious complaint as to the way it was distributed in the county.  I may say that the entire eastern portion of the county was neglected.  Little or nothing was done there.  I am not blaming the officers in Dublin for that.  I do say that it was due in the main to the pronounced political prejudices of the outdoor staff of the Commission in dealing with these cases.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  I hope that under the Vote for the improvement of estates, and the amount of money allocated that something will be done to complete schemes begun under other relief Votes.  I know districts where a road was asked for under the Relief Vote of 1927, a certain amount of money was expended on it, something like £400 or £500.  The road, if completed, would prove very useful.  It would probably take six or seven miles off people going to important fairs, and would open up a huge stretch of country.  Yet, despite the fact that representations were made, and that £500 had been expended on portion of the road, it is still left there uncompleted. There were other works done in that district, but the road has been left there unfinished.</P>
    <P>As regards the division of estates, I think the Land Commission is very lax.  On several occasions I have brought to the notice of the Department, both by correspondence and question, in the Dáil one estate which was in their hands and which I was told would be acquired and distributed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> I passed the information to the Department that there were certain people who had acquired from the landlord portion of the estate.  I am reliably informed that two of them have large farms.  One of them who has got a portion of the estate, and is enjoying it at the moment, from the Land Commission, is 70 years of age and already has two farms of land.  There are at least 40 economic holders in that district. Yet we are told because the landlord has sold a certain portion of his land to these two particular individuals the Land Commission is not anxious to interfere.  Why, I do not know.  They have the same power to acquire the land from those two individuals as from the landlord, and because the landlord was slick enough to get away with the money and to put those two people into a difficulty I do not see why the Land Commission should not interfere.  If that is allowed to go on any person could dispose of any land he might have in that fashion and congests, and uneconomic holders, would get very little satisfaction. I have that case in mind, and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it, and I hope things of that kind will not be allowed to continue.  There are other large farms of two, three and four hundred acres that could be acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.  I have given particulars of a few of those to the Land Commission and I have got the stereotyped reply that the Land Commission does not propose to interfere.</P>
    <P>Clare at present is not all occupied by economic holders.  There are a large number of uneconomic holders there.  There is land in Clare that could be acquired at a reasonable price to relieve these people.  I do not know why the Land Commission should not interfere to relieve these people in those areas.  I think the Land Commission might extend its activities in the matter of the housing of the people who live outside the Gaeltacht and who are entitled to better houses.  The Land Commission has power either to improve houses there or to construct houses for the people.  It is no harm that it should be known that the Land <Col N="1372" /> Commission has that power.  We have frequently bombarded the Minister for Local Government because of his non-attention to the non-municipalised town.  Taking a purely rural district, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not curtail the activities of his Department in this direction, and that he will give more attention to the erection of houses and to the improvement of houses in these districts, outside the Gaeltacht, where he has power to do so, than he is giving at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears, according to the report of the Land Commission, that some 5,000 acres of land have been divided in the County Meath between 29 or 30 people.  Still I cannot say I am satisfied at all with the policy carried out in that county by the Land Commission.  First, I would like if consideration could be given to the method that is adopted in dividing up certain farms of land. They do not seem to be able to get away from an old tradition.  I think the term applied in dividing the land would be &ldquo;striking.&rdquo;  The Land Commission comes in and strikes good land in the County Meath and certainly succeeds in doing a lot of destruction. It lowers the value of that land and makes it nearly impossible for the tenant to meet his rent, because the rent is high and the land is good.  It all amounts to a confused idea as to whether it is to be divided up as a tillage farm or for grazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economic circumstances have forced us into the grazing system, and in the County Meath and in other counties the grazing system is carried on. There is no other means of working the land there, and even if a man is a poor man he has to do it.  The fact of the matter, when a good field is divided into stripes the excuse is sometimes given that it is for the purpose of putting stock upon it and getting them to water and that that can only be done by the long road.  After the cattle leave the shed in the morning they seem to dirty the land getting down to the water, and in a few days' time it is trodden and the cattle refuse to eat it, with the result that I have noticed that where, previous to the division, the land produced <Col N="1373" /> some of the best cattle, it is to-day becoming a kind of hide-bound.  I notice that not only in Meath but in Westmeath and, I think, on a few occasions in Kildare.  It is a pity that that should occur.  I know that the Land Commission would answer me that it is a question of getting access to water.  I think it would be more charitable towards the tenants if they devised some other means of getting to the water than striping the land.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would like to mention is the question of the consolidation of holdings.  I received a number of complaints about that.  There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the minds of the tenants about it. I noticed, on a few occasions recently, that one or two of them have been put to needless expense.  I take it that this is not compulsory at all and that the tenant need not agree to it.  In a particular case brought to my notice the tenant had to give good reasons for maintaining separate receivable orders.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he replies, to explain these points.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would like to mention is the question of migration in the County Meath.  I am not going to deal so much with the exact question of migration as with the abuse of that system.  Quite recently outside Navan, at Kilberry, a large farm of land was divided up, consisting of some of the best land in the County Meath, between three migrants.  About a year ago one was brought in from Louth, a house was built for him and he got land, and he promptly set the house and the land.  Another portion of this land was given to a gentleman who got a gratuity of some £3,000 for some Army service, or something else, and a pension of £90 or £100 a year, and another was a lady to whom there might not be much objection.  But the sum total is that the people of the County Meath are represented there by one man, who is a herd.  I have no objection to migration so long as it is not abused, but I object very strongly where those abuses occur.  I admit if the Parliamentary Secretary is able to give a satisfactory explanation and to prove that the information I have got <Col N="1374" /> is wrong there is something to be said for him.  But where one farm is divided between three migrants in a district and surrounding that land there are congested areas and uneconomic holders&mdash;men who are only making a living with the greatest possible difficulty and only because they have amassed some little money, they should get some encouragement.  The only other land available there at the moment is 50 acres of bad land.  This has gone so far that I received a resolution, passed by the Farmers' Union in the County Meath, a body which may not be wholly sympathetic with me or my Party, condemning the system in practice, altogether.</P>
    <P>Further, when a farm on one of the estates is divided, the people of that area ought to get due notice.  A lot of people from other counties imagine that there is no congestion in County Meath, that the people of County Meath do not need land, and that a farm of £5 valuation is quite sufficient to make a fortune.  Of course that idea is gradually disappearing, but it did exist.  The fact is that although 5,000 acres have been divided in Meath I cannot honestly say that I can see results; certainly from my correspondence and in passing through the county I do not see where it has been done.  Of course I might suggest how it has been done, but to say that the people are satisfied is not the case, and my correspondence proves that it is not the case.  Take the district of Dun-shaughlin; there are men there with 1½, 2 and 3 acres of land.  Take the district of Enfield and the district of Dunderry, and the district surrounding Ballinacrea on the other side of Oldcastle. These are highly congested districts. Then we come to the district of Beaupare.  Here we find a very peculiar state of affairs.  There are nine untenanted farms comprising 1,200 acres of land, and over forty small holders with less than forty acres of land.  In the parish of Yellow Furze there is not even a school plot to be got, although a migrant was settled in that particular area, with just a few uneconomic holders surrounding him. I have a memorandum sent to me by a committee of that area, countersigned <Col N="1375" /> by the priest of the area, who vouches that the items in it are perfectly correct. In what is known as the Ballinlough estate and the Green Hills estate there are 12 uneconomic holders and the highest valuation would seem to be £16 10s.  The lowest valuation is £1 15s.  That occurs in two different places.  Other valuations are £5, £3 10s., and £4 15s.  I think it would only be reasonable that they would get some show.  In the other area something more or less of the same position exists.  Perhaps the valuations are something higher; certainly there are two of £1 5s., one of £5 10s., one of £11, two of £13, and one of £15 15s. There are two or three herds.  In another area in that particular district, we find eleven people of £13 valuation. There is one of £16 5s., another man has 28 acres, another man lives on the estate with four sons, another man has £5 valuation, and so on.  There are several other areas like that, so it is not any wonder that people are dissatisfied. The majority of the people of County Meath are dissatisfied to see whole parcels of migrants put in on the richest land.  We have no objection to migrants getting portion of an estate, provided that a sufficient number of uneconomic holders of the county get lands surrounding them.  It is much better for the migrant, the Land Commission, and it leads to peace and contentment in the county.  County Meath has been planted several times over. They dread that kind of thing.  I do not think they ought to allow it to go on again, and I, for one, will not advise them to do so.  I have no objection to migrants provided the migration is done with justice and discretion.</P>
    <P>Another thing I would like to comment on is the question of drainage. Some two years ago a case occurred in the Oldcastle area where a landlord had maintained a drainage system for a number of years.  The property was sold to the Land Commission.  It seemed the Land Commission held a certain amount of money and invested it.  The interest on it was devoted to the upkeep of this particular river. Since that occurred there has been continued flooding, and a most inefficient <Col N="1376" /> attempt was made two years ago to put the river in order.  If the thing is not properly done this coming season, the only method that can be adopted is to demand this money from the Land Commission and put it into somebody's hands who can use it. Week after week I get complaints about that river.  I thought, a couple of years ago, some satisfaction would be given about it, but none has been given.  Those are my reasons for supporting Deputy Derrig's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter of importance that I would like to put forward for consideration.  Before I would enter into it, I would like to say in regard to the grant for the relief of unemployment given to the County of Longford that I do not think we have been fairly or equitably treated.  I regretted to hear the references of Deputy O'Reilly to migrants from the congested areas to Meath.  It was not the first time that I heard references made from the benches opposite to the activities of the Land Commission in this matter and their efforts on behalf of people living on small patches of waste land in the West of Ireland.  If that is the policy of the Party opposite, I think it should be so stated before the Parliamentary Secretary replies.  The lands of Meath, as everyone knows, are the best in Ireland, while the lands in the West of Ireland are not good and the holdings are small.  The Land Commission in taking the people from these barren lands and planting them on the lands in Meath are doing very essential work, and they should have the support of every Party in this House.  Fancy men holding farms of from 400 to 600 acres in the County Meath, where the land is the best in Europe.  Is it the policy that those lands should be devoted entirely to the fattening of stock, and that the people whose ancestors were banished from them be kept in Connacht?  It is strange at this stage in our history to find that mentality displayed on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I think this question of the transferring of migrants can bear the strictest investigation.  The Land <Col N="1377" /> Commission should make every effort to bring back the people from the barren mountains of Connacht and put them on the lands which are not a bit too good for them.  It is ridiculous to hear statements like those we have just listened to after the struggle that has been made for freedom in this country.</P>
      <P>I desire to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the hardships that people in Longford, Roscommon and Leitrim are suffering through the flooding of their lands.  It is the business of the Land Commission to find out how it can be remedied.  These tenants are paying rents and rates while they have the greatest difficulty in saving their crops each year, and a great part of their land is rendered useless.  We had evidence of the damage that is being done at a recent inquiry in Longford.  Mr. David Sheeran, who holds 117 acres of land, the valuation of which is £65, gave evidence that from November to May his land was flooded to the extent of 17 acres. He estimated his loss at £30, which is quite a reasonable figure.  Miss Brennan, of the same district, explained that her lands were flooded to the extent of 50 acres from November to May.  She estimated her losses at £100.  That is the loss that is caused while the land is submerged, but she suffers loss in addition, because young stock cannot be put on the land after the flooding as they would contract disease.  She has to purchase cattle in the early spring.  Mr. Joseph Maguire has land flooded to the extent of 15 acres each year.  He estimates his loss at £30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in this particular case they are collecting rent from a man who has 30 acres to the extent of £17 15s. 6d.  His valuation is £25.  He estimates his loss at about £10 a year.  These people are not in a position to make representations individually to the Land Commission.  It is very difficult for them to get anything done.  Now they have organised a committee and they have asked me to put their case before the Parliamentary Secretary and try to get something done.  Their only desire is to be relieved from the hardships they are suffering.  I believe that the Land Commission have the power to help them.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dennigan has 120 acres, with valuation £40 and rent £40.  He had 60 acres flooded from November to May, and estimates his loss at at least about £100.  He is in an impossible position.  He cannot stock his land for the season, nor can he procure young cattle, lest he might lose them through disease or fluke caused by the flooding of his lands.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would assist me in this matter I will not detain the House very long.  It may be a bit monotonous, but at the same time these men have certain rights. They want their grievance adjusted, and they want me to speak for them to the Irish Land Commission.  In doing so, I think I am merely discharging my duty as a representative of the people. This matter will have to be remedied in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to send down his inspectors to these lands.  I would like the inspectors to see the conditions under which these people live; to see the way their lands have been destroyed by floods each year.  The inspectors will see for themselves <Col N="1379" /> the pitiable plight in which the people have to live.  I have with me a sheaf of notes which it would take two hours or more to go through.  I will not burden the House with any quotations if I can get an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will do as I request.  There are 5,000 acres flooded there each year, almost half of the county.  Some action should be taken at once to relieve the people. It is not fair to be taking money from these people and giving them nothing in return.  It is just like taking money for goods out of which the people get no value.  These people are paying thousands annually to the Land Commission and to the county council and they get no return whatsoever.  Any crops they save are saved only after the greatest possible effort.  To-day they may save a splendid crop of hay and to-morrow morning they may see their cocks being swept away by the Shannon.</P>
    <P>A very small effort is all that is required in order to remedy the grievance. It is the duty of the Land Commission to make a through investigation and provide a remedy which will obviate future flooding.  The people will not be content until this is done. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, now that his attention has been drawn to it, will move in this matter immediately; it is a moral obligation upon him.</P>

      <P>I was rather impressed by the very forcible speech made by Deputy Connolly on this Vote.  I think that speech is about the strongest condemnation, if further condemnation is required, of the Land Commission.  He definitely told the Department that unless he gets certain guarantees that the very serious grievances suffered by the people of Longford, Westmeath and Leitrim will be set right, he is in complete disagreement with the action of the Land Commission.  I would be delighted if the Parliamentary Secretary would give such an undertaking as Deputy Connolly has asked for.  I am, however, very doubtful as to the sincerity of Deputy Connolly in the statement <Col N="1381" /> he has made.  I have a knowledge of the conditions that he has referred to&mdash; the flooding in Longford, Leitrim and Roscommon.  I know, and Deputy Connolly should know, that the cause of the flooding in the area he speaks about is due to the navigation of the Shannon.</P>
      <P>When the Vote dealing with that matter was on here last evening, Deputy Connolly voted in support of that Vote; in other words, voted for a continuance of flooding in the areas and counties referred to by him to-night. It may be that the Land Commission will now, in order to save the defeat they may incur, give the undertaking asked for by the Deputy to set right those matters that are due to the incompetence of the Board of Works. But Deputy Connolly should have been present when the Vote of the Department responsible for the flooding in the areas was being discussed and then put forward his grievance, and he should have gone into the Lobby against that Vote.  He should have voted specifically against it.  I would like to see something like honesty on the part of a Deputy in this House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has been down the country holding public meetings and making inquiries about this flooding, and he now comes here to justify a claim; and he is ignorant as to what particular Department should deal with this matter.  If Deputy Connolly came in last night and voted in favour of the grant, which means a continuation of the grievances, after three months' investigation of the matter down the country, and after four years' representation in the House, then there is nothing more to be said, and I leave the matter at that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly referred with a good deal of emphasis to the statement made by Deputy M. O'Reilly as to the utilisation of the ranch lands of Meath for the relief of congests from the West.  As far as I understood Deputy O'Reilly's references, what he said was quite consistent and was what any responsible man would say&mdash;that the landless men and the uneconomic holders should have the first claim on the ranches, and should be the first to be supplied with land.  That is what Deputy O'Reilly said, and Deputy O'Reilly and this Party do stand for the utilisation of the ranch lands for the people who most need land.</P>

      <P>I was here when Deputy O'Reilly made that statement. His statement was that it was the landless men and the uneconomic holders in Meath who should get preference in the distribution of the lands.  He specifically stated that he had no objection <Col N="1383" /> whatever to migrants coming in after the local men were supplied. That is the common-sense meaning of what Deputy O'Reilly said.</P>
      <P>While I am speaking on the Land Commission Vote I will read a few letters here that will very clearly illustrate the case I am making, and I will leave the matter at that without further comment of my own.  On the 13th September, 1929, I received this letter from the Land Commission.  It deals with the estate of the Earl of Granard, Co. Leitrim, Record No. L.C. 1050, and is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;With reference to your recent call at this office regarding the question of turbary in the townland of Rinnagouna, on the above estate, I am directed by the Land Commission to state that the matter is receiving attention.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was on the 13th September, 1929.  In reply to a question of mine during the last few weeks I was informed that the matter was under consideration, but no definite idea was given as to when the work would be completed.  Here is a letter of the 31st of May, 1928, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Land Commission to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing letter from Patrick Devaney, Corrycullen, Leckaun P.O., Co. Sligo, relative to erection of a gate, and to inform you that it will receive attention.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is still in that state.  The next letter is dated the 1st May, 1928, and deals with the estate of A.L. Tottenham, Co. Sligo, Record No. L. J. 33. The letter reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your inquiries in this office with regard to the cases of Mrs. Catherine McGovern, of Corracloona, and Mrs. Anne McDermott, of Loghtybarr, on the above estate, I am directed by the Land Commissioners to inform you that they have investigated both of these cases, and find that Mrs. McGovern was sanctioned and paid grants amounting to £35 for buildings, and for compensation for turbary and rights of way and drains.  Mrs. Anne McDermott was also sanctioned and <Col N="1384" /> paid grants amounting to £45 for repair to buildings and compensation for turbary and rights of way.  The Commissioners regret that they cannot see their way to take any further action in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sent a further letter pointing out the claims on which these people based their application for further compensation, in the same month of May, 1928, and got no reply.</P>
    <P>On the 17th of July, 1928, I got the following letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Land Commission to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing communication received by you from the tenants of Kiltyclogher regarding the flooding of their lands, which will receive consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are still receiving consideration as far as I know.  On 24th May, 1928, the following letter was written:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Land Commission to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 18th instant regarding the holdings of Mrs. Margaret McGoldrick, of Dromoo, and John McWeeney, of Derrywilliam, situate on the Harlick Estate, which will receive consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are still receiving attention. There are numbers of similar replies that I could quote, probably some of an earlier date and a some of more recent date.  I will make a few remarks with regard to the Harlick estate.  That estate was taken over under the 1923 Land Act, and was sub-divided amongst a number of tenants.  Two of the persons who received substantial allotments of that property and substantial mansions, included a colonel of the British Army, and a Scotchman who came to reside in this country in 1914.  Contrast their holdings with an allotment made to a small labourer, a resident in the locality.  I received a letter from him enclosing the report of the medical officer who inspected his house.  This is the medical officer's report:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">Ruskey, Dromod.</P>
    <P Just="Right">13th November, 1930.</P>
    <P>I inspected the dwelling-house occupied by P. Reilly, his wife and <Col N="1385" /> family.  The place is not fit for human habitation.  It requires extensive repairs.&mdash;M.J. Dillon.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from P. Reilly.  This is what he says:</P>
    <P>I got this letter some time ago from Dr. Dillon to give to Mr. Lynch, the State Solicitor, and I did so....  Our house is in a very bad condition.  I lost my fourteen-months fine baby inside twelve hours, as the house is in a terrible state, draughts everywhere....  The pass we have to walk on is terrible, and our rent is £2 14s. 2d. per year for a one-roomed house.  I have six in family, and I have to meet last May's rent, which I was summoned for, and they put 11s. costs along with the half-year's rent.  I cannot get a day's work....</P>
    <P>In reply to a question dealing with this estate the Land Commission promised to have the matter investigated and to send an inspector to make an examination.  That inspector's report should have been before the Land Commission over a year ago.  I have raised this matter often within the last four years; it is a sort of hardy annual. Nothing has occurred, apparently.  In reply to a question last week I was informed that nothing in a very big way would take place by way of an alteration of the allotments that had been made, but that a considerable portion of the land given to Colonel Kirkwood, who is in occupation of the principal residence on the property, had been by arrangement with him taken over and would be made available for re-distribution amongst the uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary state by what authority, in the first instance, this substantial amount of land was given to the owner of the mansion on this estate? Local tenants required that land for the purpose of enlarging their holdings, and they were prepared to pay the same price for it as that at which the Land Commission gave it to Colonel Kirkwood, who did not want it and who could do without it.  The land was given to Colonel Kirkwood, and he kept it for three years.  Now an inquiry <Col N="1386" /> has been held, and the Land Commission is taking it back.  I wonder will they give the landlord anything in the way of compensation for taking from him land that they had given him?</P>
    <P>Representations have been made again and again here by me and by others on behalf of the uneconomic holders in Co. Leitrim.  Not a single thing has been done in a practical way to deal with the problem of congestion in that county.  It stands in the position of being no man's land, being outside the scope of the Gaeltacht legislation, while it is one of the most congested and the poorest counties in the Saorstát.  When representations are made to the Land Commission to take over substantial holdings, in order to enlarge uneconomic holdings, in every instance they refuse to move, although the facts are such that any reasonable body that inquired into the matter would be forced to conclude that action was urgent and long delayed. If the conduct of the Land Commission in dealing with County Leitrim is any example of its efficiency, then I say that the Land Commission is a very poor substitute for the landlords in the worst days of their rule and ruin in the country.  There was some sort of personal touch in the old days with the landlord, and a tenant with a grievance could approach him, perhaps, through the bailiff, and some concessions were made.  It is like putting a letter into the dead-letter box to try to approach the Land Commission with a grievance.  No attempt is made to deal in a human way with the problem that exists in Co. Leitrim, and as long as the present state of affairs continues it is a disgrace, and this Department deserves the severest censure that public representatives in this House and outside can possibly give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a particular aspect of Land Commission policy.  I have alluded to the matter again and again in this House.  Since 1915 onwards the banks adopted the habit of sending representatives to auctions of land.  The banks would advance practically the full price of a farm to prospective buyers, with the <Col N="1387" /> result that the value of the land was greatly inflated.  In my constituency the Land Commission has developed the habit of succeeding the banks as owners of these farms.  First of all, the banks evict the tenants.  The Land Commission then comes along, takes over the farms and pays the banks the amounts due by the borrowers.  They clap the amount on to the annuities fixed on the land, and start parcelling it out amongst tenants.  I gave one instance to the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago, and he has probably had time to inquire into it.  The annuity on a farm at Killeagh, County Cork, was £74 yearly.  The tenant owed the bank £600 and was evicted. The Land Commission took over the farm, having presumably paid the bank, and the new rent was fixed at £120.  When the tenant who was on the farm found that he could not pay £104, which was the amount he had to pay the bank, allowing 6 per cent., it is very hard to see how an incoming tenant could pay £120.  I think the system is a very bad one.  The position is even worse than that, because the ratepayers are being mulcted in the matter.  The ratepayers are interested, because when banks take over a farm the local bodies can recover two years' arrears of rates.  The banks are pretty good marks for future rates.  When the Land Commission takes over land and hands it to an unfortunate tenant to go in at an increased rent of 75 per cent., then the ratepayers are in a very different position, because in a few years the tenant finds he is unable to pay.  He goes out of the farm and the ratepayers lose the rates.  I think that is a rotten position for the Land Commission to take up, that of grabbing holdings, because that is what it amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of influences that prevail in my constituency at present on these lines.  Deputy Davin gave an instance when he alluded to the gentleman with two pensions and a grant from the Southern Loyalists' Fund who got 25 acres in his constituency.  These are the individuals that we are going to have planted in different farms in County Cork, gentlemen with a couple of pensions who got lump sums from <Col N="1388" /> the Southern Loyalists' Fund.  I think that position should cease.  There are sufficient evicted tenants in the country for these holdings, if there are any going.  No land should be left for those who got grants from the Southern Loyalists' Fund.  It is time that that ended.  I consider this system of the Land Commission taking over farms from the banks, and providing an incentive for the banks to evict the unfortunate tenants, is a very bad one.</P>
    <P>Another rather extraordinary Land Commission case came to my notice recently on Sherkin Island, West Cork.  An unfortunate tenant there owed 25s. rent for a patch of land that he should be paid to live on.  It took half an hour in a boat to get out there. Bailiffs were sent in and they seized a cow and a calf, the only four-footed animals that this so-called farmer possessed, and only for a good neighbour on the mainland, who paid up the amount, the tenant's position would be a very hard one.  Although the amount of the debt was only 25s., the costs amounted to £4 15s., and they will come out of the price of the cow and the calf.</P>
    <P>In view of the legislation that has been, I might say, forced through this Dáil, I am in no hurry whatsoever to see land divided in this country, for by the time all the compensation is paid out of the land, the people who go into it would be better off begging. By the time you have compensation for the landlord's interest in the holding, compensation for the tenant's interest and compensation for disturbance clapped on, together with portion of the price of the house that will be erected on the new patch, with the out-offices, the tenant would be better off with a bag going round from door to door.  In view of that legislation, I am not going to press for land to be divided until a Government is put in who will see that there is a fair crack of the whip in these matters and that the tenants will get the land at a rent they will be able to pay. I, for one, am not anxious to see land divided in the present condition of affairs.  I can realise the position of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Land Commission in their anxiety not to give land to the men whom Deputy <Col N="1389" /> O'Reilly alluded to&mdash;the labourers who would be working on these estates, or people of that description. I realise their extraordinary anxiety to get in a man who would have a slice of a southern loyalist grant and a couple of pensions.  Men like that would be able to use the place as a rural dwelling&mdash;a place to which they would go in summer.  They might be able to pay the rent in that way, but an unfortunate tenant who would get 25 or 50 acres, with all this new compensation clapped down upon him, would be unable to live in the holding. It would be absolutely impossible for him to live in it, not to speak of earning a livelihood for a wife and family out of it.  I am not, therefore, anxious to see land divided in this manner.  The 1915 and 1918 standard is still the standard on which the Land Commission purchase these holdings.  If they were put up in the open market, they would not realise one-third of the price.  Any person who reads the appeal cases and sees the price given to the landlords will realise the position for himself.  He will realise that it would be impossible for any man to eke out a livelihood on one of these resumed holdings, when the new rent is clapped on.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but words of praise for the Collection Branch of the Land Commission, judging by my experience of it.  I like to give fair play, where fair play is due.  The Collection Branch is inclined to give every fair play, but in cases like this it is practically impossible for them to give fair play, because the tenant has no hope of recovery.  I have alluded here practically every year to the Condonstown Estate, Watergrasshill, Co. Cork. It is a hardy annual.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary has looked into the arrears on that estate?  It was only taken over by the Land Commission in 1924.  It was divided out amongst the tenants who found that they had to pay three times the rent their neighbours were paying after all this compensation had been clapped down upon them.  The new tenants will be worse off, because they will have to pay compensation for disturbance. I should like if the Parliamentary <Col N="1390" /> Secretary would enlighten us as to the present arrears of rent on this estate.  The information at my disposal is that though the tenants are only about five years in possession the best-off of the lot of them, who is an Army captain with a pension, owes two and a half years' rent.  If that amount is due after five years, you can figure out how much will be due after thirty years. You will then come nearer the mark as to what has been done by the valuers of the Land Commission in estimating the value of land.  You will realise that there is going to be a new problem and a difficult problem to be faced by a national Government later &mdash; the problem of taking out of the taxpayers' pockets the difference between the real value of the land, the amount a tenant can pay, and the amount of loot carelessly handed out to landlords.  If the facts are as I have stated in this case&mdash; and I have no reason to disbelieve them&mdash;tenants in possession for only five years, already owe two and a half years' rent.  That means that the land was purchased at double its value and parcelled out to those tenants.  We all know that tenants will take land no matter what the price is, in order to get into possession.  They hope for better days, but they find that they are unable to live on the land they have obtained, because the landlord has got two or three times its value.  That is a problem that a future national Government will have to face.  That is why I, for one, am not anxious to see these estates taken over and divided in the present position of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks with regard to the drainage of County Leitrim.  References have been made by Deputy Connolly, Deputy Maguire and others to the Shannon.  Certainly, the Shannon is a great source of trouble there, and causes an immense amount of loss to that part of the country.  But the Rynne River and the Blackwater, in the Carrickallen area, are doing far more damage.  That could be remedied by the Land Commission by means of small grants which could be given out of the Improvement of Estates Fund or any other fund set apart for such work by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make provision, or to see that provision is made, for such work.  As regards housing, I think that the problem should be partly solved by the Land Commission and not left entirely to the Department of Local Government. In our area the Land Commission have done something in that direction and have given free grants in several cases of £100 for the purpose of building houses.  They should proceed further on those lines, especially in areas where houses are badly needed, and give similar grants to help farmers to build houses in which they can live.  With regard to the collection of arrears of rent, I may say that is a difficult problem in our neighbourhood. I think that when a man gets deep into debt he is hardly ever able to recover, and in such cases I think that the collection of rent should be handed over to a responsible man, like an auctioneer, who would take charge of the land and give the man a living on it, but, at the same time, trying to pay off some, at least, of the arrears, instead of trying to make him pay the entire arrears in one sum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire made several statements with which I cannot agree. These statements are not fair to the Land Commission, to Deputy Maguire, or to the county.  He says that the Land Commission has done nothing to relieve congestion in Leitrim.  They have, to my knowledge, taken over the Lauderdale estate at Fenagh, the Murphy estate at Cloone, two estates at Leitrim village, one at Jamestown, and one at Carrick-on-Shannon, which have been divided amongst the uneconomic holders, and they are greatly satisfied with it.  The Land Commission also gave a grant of £100 each for the building of seven or eight houses in the townland of Stradrinan, and generally they have done more for the tenants in Leitrim than all the landlords who ever came before them. That statement goes without contradiction. They have also given, in connection with the Stoney River at Ballinaglera, a sum of over £300 in one case and £350 which I understand has been voted in the case of the Yellow <Col N="1392" /> River to repair the damage done to farmers' lands.  In some cases they gave compensation to the people who suffered damage owing to the loss of crops and other causes.  In justice and fair play we should tell the truth and not say that nothing is being done for the relief of congestion in those areas, that nothing has been done by the Land Commission, and that they are worse than the landlords of former days.  With all respect, I submit that that is not a fair way of conducting affairs.  It is not fair to the Land Commission, to Deputies, or to the people concerned.</P>

      <P>I might take the Parliamentary Secretary in a boat to the houses in Montiagh for four months of the year, or to Clonfert on the Shannon, or bring him to the Pollock estate where the tenants are paying annuities that are twice too high, or direct his attention to grievances in Pollough, near Ballindereen, but I shall not do so for the moment, and shall come to a problem which I think the Land Commission should consider.  We take it that the Parliamentary Secretary will carry out the undertaking which he has given regarding the vesting of land.  I think that the next problem to be dealt with is the repeopling of the grass lands, putting the people, as Deputy Sheehy said this evening in his most eloquent speech, back on the land of their sires.  It has not yet been done, unfortunately, and I will quote figures supplied by the Government, to prove that it has not been done.  In the first place, take the references made by Deputy Connolly. I do not know whether they were made owing to defective hearing, lack of understanding, or a deliberate perversion of what was said.</P>

Deputy O'Reilly is quite right in his statement concerning figures for Co. Meath showing that the congests there have first claim on that county when <Col N="1393" /> land comes to be divided.  I do not think that any representative, from Meath or anywhere else, will deny that.  Looking at the returns giving the number of agricultural holdings, county by county, we find that in Co. Meath there are 5,909 holdings of fifteen acres or under.  If we add to that number 2,153 holdings of from fifteen to thirty acres, we get 8,062 of thirty acres and under, having an average of nine acres each.  Would Deputy Connolly contend that these people are not entitled to first consideration if lands are to be divided in Meath?  There are 631 holdings of two hundred acres and over, with 234,575 acres between them.</P>

As a placard of a certain newspaper stated in reference to another matter recently, it is undoing the conquest, the evictions, the plantations and the confiscations to put people back on the land.  Unfortunately the figures are given on the basis of acreage and not on valuation.  I got them from the Department of Trade and Commerce before they were published, but they are now to be found in book form.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Board of Works that during the financial year ended 31st March, 1931, the quantity of coal supplied out of public funds to Gárda Síochána barracks in the Dublin metropolitan area and to the Depot was 1,780 tons, the cost of which was £2,781 5s. 6d.  Of this quantity 59 tons was Saorstát coal, the cost of which was £130 13s. 6d.  In addition 160 tons of Dublin-made coke, costing £248 8s. and 4 tons of foreign anthracite beans, costing £8 16s. were supplied in that area.</P>
      <P>No coal is supplied directly to barracks outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  In these cases an annual allowance in cash is made to the station units to meet the cost of fuel and light.  The allowance varies according to the number of public rooms in the barracks.</P>
