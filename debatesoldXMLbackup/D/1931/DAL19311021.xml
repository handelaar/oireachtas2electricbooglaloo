      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received representations on the subject of an announcement of a limited examination for clerical posts in the Civil Service open to Shorthand-typists and Writing Assistants; whether having regard to the fact that prospects of promotion to the Clerical Grade were amongst the stated conditions of these officers on entering the service, it is proposed to resume promotions by the normal method; and whether the Minister has given consideration to the fact that an examination of the nature proposed is an unsuitable test for officers of long service who have been a long time away from school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations on this subject have been made to me on behalf of the lower grades concerned.  The test now to be applied is intended to provide the promotions which the best members of the lower grades are entitled to expect.  Last year promotions were made by the ordinary means of recommendation and personal interview, but the results were not entirely satisfactory. In view of that, and owing to the large number of candidates eligible, it has been decided that, in fairness to the general body of the eligible candidates, and in order to surmount the difficulty of determining efficiently their relative merits, the test should be by means of a written examination by the Civil Service Commissioners. The Commissioners have <Col N="390" /> been informed, and will, no doubt, in setting the papers take cognisance of the fact that the candidates are persons who left school seven or more years ago.  I may add for the Deputy's information that it has now been decided that no entrance fee for the examination will be charged to candidates.</P>

      <P>Surely every person made an application at the time the tax was paid or immediately afterwards.  There is no reason why the Department should not have paid these refunds for the first and second quarters.  There may be some excuse for the half-year or for the last quarter.  In one case an application was made immediately after the tax was paid in the second quarter.  The Department did not even acknowledge that letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great deal of nonsense in regard to complaints made in this connection. Certain refunds are payable.  They are not necessarily payable until after the end of the period involved.  Upwards of 10,000 applications have been made, some for very small amounts.  I have set up what I consider reasonable machinery for dealing with this matter.  Nobody is inconvenienced in any very great way.  In justice to the other work of the Department, I have <Col N="395" /> set aside as large a staff as may reasonably be expected to deal with this work.  I have already given details as to the extent to which refunds have been made in the case of Sligo.

      <P>I was down there about a fortnight ago and I am well aware of the serious inconvenience caused to the unfortunate tenants through the lack of this road.  The people are unable to take away their hay or, for that matter, other crops.  They are obliged to pay their rates and taxes, but they receive no return in the way of a road. As they said to me, &ldquo;Where is the use in having land if we have not a way out?&rdquo; This matter has been the subject of agitation for at least fifteen or sixteen years and I think it is time that the Parliamentary Secretary interested himself in having the roadway completed.  The people have no way out.  I think it is a disgraceful condition of things that there is no roadway built there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion, which stands on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whereas it is provided by Section 5 of the Seanad Electoral Act, 1928, that before each election of members of Seanad Eireann a panel shall be formed consisting partly of persons nominated by Dáil Eireann, partly of persons nominated by Seanad Eireann, and that the method of proposal and selection for nomination shall be decided by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann respectively:</P>
      <P>Now, therefore, this Dáil doth hereby resolve and decide that the proposal and selection for nomination for so much of the panel as shall be nominated by Dáil Eireann for the purpose of the next election of members to Seanad Eireann shall be conducted in accordance with the following rules:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">RETURNING OFFICER.</P>
      <P>1.  The Ceann Comhairle, or in his absence the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, shall be the Returning Officer for the purpose of selection.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NOMINATION.</P>
      <P>2.  A candidate for selection shall be nominated in writing and such written nomination shall be subscribed by one Deputy as proposer, and by another Deputy as seconder, and shall include a statement subscribed by two other Deputies that the candidate whose name appears on the nomination paper is a person who has done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service or, because of special qualifications or attainments, represents important aspects of the Nation's life.</P>
      <P>3.  Each candidate shall be nominated by a separate nomination paper, and the nomination paper shall be in the form set out in Part II. of the Schedule hereto, and shall contain the particulars required thereby.</P>
      <P>4.  The Returning Officer shall cause nomination papers to be supplied to any Deputy requiring the same during the period commencing at the time of the passing of this Resolution and ending at 12 o'clock noon on the 10th day of November, 1931, which period is herein referred to as the &ldquo;time for selection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  Nomination papers shall be delivered to the Returning Officer or to such other person as he may appoint for the purpose by the proposer or seconder or either assenting Deputy during such hours, and at such places, during the time for selection, as the Returning <Col N="409" /> Officer may fix, but not after the expiration of the time for selection.</P>
    <P>The period referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1927, shall be the &ldquo;time for selection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>6.  The Returning Officer may reject as invalid any nomination paper which does not contain the particulars required by the form or which does not comply with the requirements of this Resolution, or which shows that the person nominated by such paper is a person who is not qualified to be elected as a member of Seanad Eireann, or is placed under disability or incapacity by the Constitution or by law, and the decision of the Returning Officer that a nomination paper is valid or is invalid shall be final for all purposes.</P>
    <P>7.  As soon as practicable after receiving a valid nomination paper, but not later than the 11th day of November, 1931, the Returning Officer shall cause a notice of such nomination to be issued to each Deputy, and such notice shall contain the name in full of the person nominated, his address, profession or occupation, and a statement of such person's useful public service or special qualifications or attainments in reference to important aspects of the Nation's life.</P>
    <P>8.  Any candidate duly nominated may by notice in writing, signed by him and delivered to the Returning Officer, withdraw his nomination at any time before the expiration of the time for selection, and in any such case the Returning Officer shall as soon as practicable cause notice of the withdrawal to be issued to each Deputy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VOTING.</P>
    <P>9.  The voting shall be by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>10.  The voting paper shall be in the form set out in Part II. of the <Col N="410" /> Schedule hereto, and the names of candidates nominated shall be arranged alphabetically in the order of their surnames.</P>
    <P>11.  The voting shall take place at the sitting of Dáil Eireann on the 11th day of November, 1931.</P>
    <P>12.  As soon as may be after the commencement of such sitting the Returning Officer shall cause one voting paper to be handed to each Deputy present at such sitting.</P>
    <P>13.&mdash;Any Deputy who may inadvertently spoil a voting paper may deliver it to the Returning Officer and obtain another voting paper.</P>
    <P>14.&mdash;At or before the adjournment of Dáil Eireann, but not later than 5.30 o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th day of November, 1931, each Deputy shall deliver his voting paper to the Returning Officer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">COUNTING THE VOTES.</P>
    <P>15.  (a) The Returning Officer shall cause the voting papers to be counted and the result of the selection determined in accordance with the Rules contained in Part I. of the Schedule hereto.</P>
    <P>(b) The counting of the votes shall take place in the presence of any Deputy who may desire to be present, and who was, either the proposer, seconder, or assentor to the nomination of a candidate. Not later than 5.30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 11th day of November, 1931, the Returning Officer shall announce to the Dáil the hour and place at which the counting of the votes will take place.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DECLARATION OF RESULT.</P>
    <P>16.  The Returning Officer shall give notice of the result of the selection by declaring to Dáil Eireann the names of the persons selected and the order of their selection.  He shall also cause to be displayed in some convenient place a statement giving the particulars required by Rule 12, in Part I. of the Schedule hereto.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> 17.  In this Resolution expressions referring to writing shall include printing, typewriting, and other modes of representing or reproducing words in visible form.</P>
    <P>18.  This Resolution may be cited as the Seanad Election Resolution, 1931.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Part 1.</P>
    <P>1.  The selection shall be conducted in accordance with the following Rules.</P>
    <P>2.  (1) Every elector shall have one transferable vote.</P>
    <P>(2)  An elector in giving his vote&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  must place on his voting paper the figure 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he votes;</P>
    <P>(b)  may in addition place on his voting paper the figure 2 or the figures 2 and 3, or 2, 3, and 4, and so on opposite the names of the other candidates in the order of his preference.</P>
    <P>3.  The forms contained in Part II. of this Schedule, or forms to the like effect, shall be used for the purposes to which they are expressed to be applicable.</P>
    <P>4.  A voting paper shall be invalid and not counted&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on which the figure 1 standing alone, indicating a First Preference for some one candidate, is not placed; or</P>
    <P>(b)  on which the figure 1 standing alone, indicating a First Preference is set opposite the name of more than one candidate; or</P>
    <P>(c)  on which the figure 1 standing alone, indicating a First Preference and some other number is set opposite the name of the same candidate; or</P>
    <P>(d)  which is unmarked, or void for uncertainty.</P>
    <P>5.  (1) The Returning Officer shall reject any voting papers that are invalid.  The Returning Officer shall then ascertain the <Col N="412" /> number of First Preferences recorded on the voting papers for each candidate, and shall then arrange the candidates on a list (hereinafter called &ldquo;the Order of Preference&rdquo;) in the order of the number of First Preferences recorded for each candidate, beginning with the candidate for whom the greatest number of First Preferences are recorded. If the number of First Preferences recorded for any two or more candidates (hereinafter called &ldquo;equal candidates&rdquo;) is equal, the Returning Officer shall ascertain the number of Second Preferences recorded on all the voting papers for each of the equal candidates, and shall arrange the equal candidates as amongst themselves on the Order of Preferences in the order of the Second Preferences recorded for each such candidate, beginning with the candidate for whom the greatest number of Second Preferences is recorded.  If the number of First and Second Preferences recorded for any two or more equal candidates is equal, the Returning Officer shall, in like manner, ascertain the number of Third Preferences recorded on all the voting papers for each of such equal candidates, and arrange such candidates on the Order of Preferences accordingly, and so on until all the candidates are arranged in order on the Order of Preferences.  If the number of First, Second, Third, and all other Preferences recorded for any two or more equal candidates is equal, the Returning Officer shall determine by lot the order in which such candidates are to be arranged on the Order of Preferences.</P>
    <P>The Returning Officer shall then cause the valid voting papers to be arranged in parcels, according to the First Preferences recorded for each candidate.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purpose of facilitating the processes prescribed by these Rules, each valid voting paper shall be deemed to be of the value of one thousand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> (3) The Returning Officer shall count the number of papers in each parcel, and in accordance with sub-section (2) of this Rule credit each candidate with the value of the valid papers on which a First Preference has been recorded for such candidate.</P>
    <P>6.  The Returning Officer shall then add together the values in all the parcels, and divide the full total value by a number exceeding by one the number of vacancies to be filled.  The result increased by one, any fractional remainder being disregarded, shall be the number sufficient to secure the return of the candidate.  This number is herein called the &ldquo;quota.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>7.  If at the end of any count or at the end of the transfer of any parcel or sub-parcel of an excluded candidate the value credited to a candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, that candidate shall be deemed to be selected.</P>
    <P>8.  (1) If the end of any count the value credited to a candidate is greater than the quota, the surplus shall be transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Rule to the continuing candidate or candidates indicated on the voting papers in the parcel or sub-parcel of the selected candidate, according to the next available preferences recorded thereon.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) If the value credited to a selected candidate arises out of original votes only, the Returning Officer shall examine all the papers in the parcel of the selected candidate, whose surplus is to be transferred, and shall arrange the transferable papers in sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon, and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the non-transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(b) If the value credited to a selected candidate arises out of original and transferred votes, or of transferred votes only, the Returning Officer shall examine the papers contained in the sub-parcel last received by the selected candidate, <Col N="414" /> and shall arrange the transferable papers therein in further sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the non-transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(c) In either of the cases referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) in this sub-section, the Returning Officer shall ascertain the number of papers and their total value in each sub-parcel of transferable papers and in the sub-parcel of non-transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(3) If the surplus is equal to or greater than the total value of the papers in the sub-parcels of transferable papers the Returning Officer shall transfer each sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference, each paper being transferred at the value at which it was received by the candidate whose surplus is being transferred.</P>
    <P>When the surplus is greater than the total value of the sub-parcels of transferable papers the non-transferable papers shall be set aside as not effective, at a value which is equal to the difference between the surplus and the value of the sub-parcels of transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(4) If the surplus is less than the total value of the transferable papers, the Returning Officer shall transfer each paper in such sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference, and the value at which each paper shall be transferred shall be ascertained by dividing the surplus by the total number of transferable papers, fractional remainders being disregarded, except that the consequential loss of value shall be noted on the Result Sheet.</P>
    <P>(5) A surplus which arises on the completion of any count shall be dealt with before a surplus which may arise at a subsequent count.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> When two or more surpluses arise out of the same count the largest shall be first dealt with and the others shall be dealt with in the order of their magnitude.</P>
    <P>If two or more candidates have an equal surplus arising out of the same count, the surplus of the candidate credited with the greatest value at the earliest count at which the values credited to these candidates were unequal shall be first dealt with.</P>
    <P>Where the values credited to such candidates were equal at all counts, the Returning Officer shall deal first with the surplus of the candidate recorded in the Order of Preferences as having received the greatest number of first preferences.</P>
    <P>9.  (1) If at the end of any count no candidate has a surplus and one or more vacancies remain unfilled, the Returning Officer shall exclude the candidate credited with the lowest value and shall transfer his papers to the continuing candidate or candidates indicated on the voting papers in the parcel or sub-parcels of the excluded candidate as the voter's next available preference, and shall credit the continuing candidate or candidates with the value of the papers transferred.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a) The parcel containing original votes shall first be transferred, the transfer value of each paper being one thousand.</P>
    <P>(b) The sub-parcels containing transferred votes shall then be transferred in the order in which and at the value of which the excluded candidate obtained them.</P>
    <P>(c) For the purpose of determining whether a candidate is a continuing candidate the transfer of each parcel or sub-parcel shall be regarded as a separate count.</P>
    <P>(3) In the transfer of each parcel or sub-parcel a separate sub-parcel shall be made of the non-transferable papers which shall be set aside at the value at which the <Col N="416" /> excluded candidates obtained them.</P>
    <P>(4) (a) If, when a candidate has to be excluded under this Rule, two or more candidates are each credited with the same value and are lowest, regard shall be had to the total value of original votes credited to each of those candidates, and the candidate with the smallest total value shall be excluded, and where the total values are equal, regard shall be had to the total value credited to those candidates at the earliest count at which they had unequal values, and the candidate with the smallest value at that count shall be excluded.</P>
    <P>(b) If two or more candidates are lowest and are each credited with the same value at all counts the Returning Officer shall exclude the candidate recorded on the Order of Preferences as having received the smallest number of First Preferences.</P>
    <P>10.  Whenever any transfer is made under any of these preceding Rules, each sub-parcel of papers transferred shall be placed on top of the parcel or sub-parcel, if any, of papers of the candidate to whom the transfer is made, and that candidate shall be credited with the value ascertained in pursuance of these Rules.</P>
    <P>11.  (1) If at the end of any count the number of selected candidates is equal to the number of vacancies to be filled, no further transfers shall be made.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) When the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of vacancies remaining unfilled, the continuing candidates shall thereupon be deemed to be selected.</P>
    <P>(b) When only one vacancy remains unfilled and the value credited to some one continuing candidate exceeds the total of the values credited to the other continuing candidates, together with any surplus not transferred, <Col N="417" /> that candidate shall thereupon be deemed to be selected.</P>
    <P>(3) When the last vacancies can be filled under this Rule, no further transfer shall be made.</P>
    <P>12.  The Returning Officer shall record the total of the values credited to each candidate at the end of every count.  Such record shall include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the value of the non-transferable papers not effective; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the loss of value owing to disregard of fractions, and may be in accordance with the form set out in Part II. of this Schedule, or in a form to the like effect.</P>
    <P>13.  The candidates shall be deemed to have been selected in the order in which their surpluses were transferred.</P>
    <P>A candidate credited at the end of a count with a value exactly equal to the quota shall be regarded as having the smallest surplus at that count for the purposes of this Rule.</P>
    <P>When two or more candidates are deemed to have been selected under Rule 11 (2) (a) such candidates shall be deemed to have been selected in the order of values credited to them respectively at that stage, the candidate credited at that stage with the greatest value being deemed to have been the first selected of such candidates, and so on, and if two or more candidates are credited with equal values at that stage the order of selection of such equal candidates shall be ascertained in the same way as the order of exclusion of such candidates would be ascertained under Rule 9 (4), with the difference that the candidates who would be the last to be excluded under that Rule shall be deemed to have been the first selected of such equal candidates, and the candidate who would have been the first to be excluded shall be deemed to have been the last selected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> 14.  In these Rules&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The expression &ldquo;continuing candidate&rdquo; means any candidate not deemed to be selected and not excluded.</P>
    <P>(2)  The expression &ldquo;first preference&rdquo; means the &ldquo;figure 1&rdquo; standing alone; the expression &ldquo;second preference&rdquo; means the &ldquo;figure 2&rdquo; standing alone in sucession to &ldquo;figure 1,&rdquo; and the expression &ldquo;third preference&rdquo; means the &ldquo;figure 3&rdquo; standing alone in sucession to the figures &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo; set opposite the name of any candidate, and so on.</P>
    <P>(3)  The expression &ldquo;next available preference&rdquo; means a second or subsequent preference recorded in consecutive numerical order for a continuing candidate, the preference next in order on the voting paper for candidates already deemed to be selected or excluded being ignored.</P>
    <P>(4)  The expression &ldquo;transferable paper&rdquo; means a voting paper on which following a first preference a second or subsequent preference is recorded in numerical order for a continuing candidate.</P>
    <P>(5)  The expression &ldquo;non-transferable paper&rdquo; means a voting paper on which no second or subsequent preference is recorded for a continuing candidate:</P>
    <P>Provided that a paper shall be deemed to have become a non-transferable paper whenever&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the names of two or more candidates (whether continuing or not) are marked with the same number, and are next in order of preference; or</P>
    <P>(b)  the name of the candidate next in order of preference (whether continuing or not) is marked&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by a number not following consecutively after some other number on the voting paper: or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> (ii)  by two or more numbers; or</P>
    <P>(c)  it is void for uncertainty.</P>
    <P>(6)  The expression &ldquo;original vote&rdquo; in regard to any candidate means a vote derived from a voting paper on which a first preference is recorded for that candidate.</P>
    <P>(7)  The expression &ldquo;transferred vote&rdquo; in regard to any candidate means a vote derived from a voting paper on which a second or subsequent preference is recorded for that candidate.</P>
    <P>(8)  The expression &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; means the number by which the total value of the votes, original and transferred, credited to any candidate exceeds the quota.</P>
    <P>(9)  The expression &ldquo;count&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  all the operations involved in the counting of the first preferences recorded for candidates; or</P>
    <P>(b)  all the operations involved in the transfer of the surplus of a selected candidate; or</P>
    <P>(c)  all the operations involved in the transfer of the votes of an excluded candidate.</P>
    <P>(10)  The expression &ldquo;deemed to be selected&rdquo; means deemed to be selected for the purpose of counting, but without prejudice to the declaration of the result of the selection.</P>
    <P>(11)  The expression &ldquo;determined by lot&rdquo; in Rule 5 means determined in accordance with the following directions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The names of the candidates concerned having been written on similar slips of paper, and the slips having been folded so as to prevent identification and mixed and drawn at random, the candidates concerned shall as amongst themselves be arranged on the Order of Preferences in the order in which the slips containing their names are drawn, beginning <Col N="420" /> with the candidate whose name is on the slip drawn first.</P>
    <P>The motion provides machinery for the panel for the next Seanad election. It will be necessary to provide a panel of 23 names, there being 23 vacancies. The resolution is on the same lines as on the last occasion, and provides that nomination papers will be available after the passing of this motion, and up to 12 noon on 10th November. Any voting that it may be necessary to take in connection with it will take place on 11th November; the voting papers will be distributed between the sitting of the Dáil and 5.30 p.m. on that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if on this motion I would be in order in submitting a suggestion to the House. As the Minister has told us 23 members of the Seanad are due to retire next month on the expiration of their period of office.  The introduction of this motion represents the first step in the filling of the vacancies that will thus be created.  I suggest that in the interests of economy these vacancies should not be filled at all.  It seems to me from reading the Seanad Electoral Act that if the Dáil declines to pass this motion, or to proceed with the nomination of candidates for inclusion in the panel, the election cannot take place, and as the Seanad is entitled to act despite vacancies in its membership, no constitutional difficulty would arise, and the body that would remain would be smaller in numbers, less costly to the taxpayers, and just as useful or as useless as the present body.  I think the Government that has declared through the Minister for Agriculture that its policy is economy at the top, in the middle, and at the bottom, should not fail to take this opportunity of commencing that economy at the top, which is the proper place.  In the past we have discussed the question of having a Seanad at all.  That is not at issue now, but there is a suitable opportunity afforded, by which we can reduce membership of the Seanad without difficulty, and I say that opportunity should not be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> If, however, the Dáil decides to proceed with the election, there is one point in connection with the procedure that I would like to have cleared up. It is stated that voting will take place at the sitting of the Dáil on 11th November, and that ballot papers will be distributed to Deputies present at that sitting as soon as may be after its commencement.  What exactly is going to happen?  Will ballot papers be distributed to Deputies present in the House at 3 o'clock, and will a ballot paper be declined to any Deputy who comes in afterwards; or will Deputies in the precincts of the House but not actually sitting on the benches be entitled to procure a ballot paper and vote?  Is it intended that only such Deputies as are actually present in the House as soon as may be after the commencement of the sitting&mdash; whatever time that is&mdash;will have the right to take part in the election?</P>
    <P>The impression I have received is that the particular method selected for the purposes of this election is probably the worst possible that could have been selected, knowing what the electorate is going to be, how many votes are going to be cast and who will have an opportunity of voting.  It seems to me that the proper procedure would have been that usually adopted in the case of a Seanad election&mdash;to supply each member through the post with a ballot paper and let him record his vote by post.  The method suggested here seems to be most unsuitable.  It is likely, I think, to cause a lot of confusion when an attempt is made to put it into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is out of order on the part of a Deputy to discuss a reduction of the Seanad on this motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I make is that if the Dáil declines to pass the motion a reduction takes place automatically. That surely arises on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction of the membership of the Seanad ought, I think, to be proceeded with in an orderly way.  That, I think, is the outlook we would have on it.  Any consideration of the membership of the <Col N="422" /> Seanad ought, I submit, only take place in conjunction with any consideration that will be given to the question of the membership of the Dáil.  That is a question that stands for consideration at an early date.  On the other matter, I think Deputies will remember that there was, in fact, no ballot necessary when the panel for the Dáil was set up on the last occasion. There are 23 vacancies to be filled.  The Seanad makes up a panel of 23 and the Dáil makes up a panel of 23.  The two will form the panel of persons who will afterwards be voted for in the election of Senators.  In the past I do not think that any exception was taken to the procedure that was adopted here.  The Deputy may at any time between 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 11th, and 5.30 p.m. receive a voting paper.  He may deposit that voting paper at any time between the hours set out.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Soarstát Eireann and the French Republic, signed at Dublin on the 23rd day of June, 1931, a copy of which was laid on the Table of Dáil Eireann on the 8th day of July, 1931, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Treaty became necessary because direct Treaty relations had to be established as between the Free State and the French Republic to take the place of the arrangements which had existed under the earlier Anglo-French Conventions.  This Treaty became necessary because, although in fact we were enjoying the most favoured nation treatment, there was a disposition on the part of the French Government to withdraw that particular type of treatment.  They felt that their interests were being prejudiced owing to the high duty on wines.  They claimed that if these duties were not the highest, that certainly they were amongst the highest in the world.  A continuance, therefore, of the good treatment that we enjoyed was very doubtful, and it became necessary to regularise the position at once.  The <Col N="424" /> result is in the Treaty that was laid on the table of the Dáil which grants us most favoured nation treatment: the minimum tariff on all goods not absolutely prohibited that we care to send into France.  In addition, we have got a specific exemption in favour of Irish whiskies from the prohibition which rules in France against the importation of spirits.  The net effect of the Treaty is that we are getting for every article minimum tariff treatment, a thing which very few countries enjoy at present in France.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Treaty was originally circulated to Deputies it was noticed that there was a conflict between the English and the French text in respect to Article 29.  In the English text it is stated: &ldquo;The present Treaty shall replace, in the matters of commerce and navigation as between France and the Irish Free State, the Franco-British Convention of 28th Frebruary, 1882.&rdquo;  Subsequently, however, a memorandum was circulated by the Department of External Affairs drawing attention to the conflict between the English text and the French text, stating that the French text was the correct one and that the words I have read should be deleted from the English text. What is the position now?  Is it that the Free State never was or is to remain bound by the terms of the Franco-British Convention of 1882 that has been referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on the Vote for External Affairs last July the Minister stated that, in accordance with what he described as the ordinary regulations in force as regards States which had emerged in consequence of the Peace Treaties, or which had come out through other States after a period of subjection, we had inherited a number of international agreements made by the United Kingdom before 1921.  I drew attention to the matter at the time because I regarded the statement made by the Minister as a serious one.  I asked him what exactly he meant to convey.  He made reference to a number of extradition Treaties which he said had been concluded <Col N="425" /> between Great Britain and other countries, which we had availed of and under which we considered ourselves bound by certain obligations to the other States concerned.  Now, what is the exact position?  Is the Free State, in fact, bound by the various international agreements made by the United Kingdom before 1921?  Is it that we are under certain international obligations which the Dáil does not know and in regard to which the Dáil was never given a chance of expressing its approval?</P>
    <P>Is this Anglo-French agreement referred to in Article 29 of the Treaty still in operation?  If so, I think it is the duty of the Minister to give the Dáil all the information in his possession, not merely concerning that particular convention but concerning all such conventions, treaties, and agreements to which he considers we are bound in consequence of this practice to which he referred in July last.</P>
    <P>On one or two minor points in connection with this Treaty, I would like to have some information.  Article 11 provides that: &ldquo;Products, natural or manufactured, originating in the territory of either of the High Contracting Parties, on importation into the territory of the other, from whatever place despatched, shall not be subjected to prohibitions or restrictions which do not equally extend to the importation of articles of the same kind the product or manufacture of any other country.&rdquo;  There is, however, an exception to that clause.  In fact, there are a number of exceptions to it.  One has reference to regulations brought into force for the protection of public health or for the protection of animals or plants against disease, insects, and harmful parasites.</P>
    <P>I am informed, I do not know whether correctly, that the importation of cattle to France from the Free State is prohibited in consequence of allegations that there is a danger of foot-and-mouth disease being brought in with the cattle.  Is that so?  Are there any special regulations in force in France against the importation of cattle from the Free State and if so, has the Minister taken any step to secure the modification <Col N="426" /> or the removal of these restrictions?</P>
    <P>There is another part, Article 14, which says: &ldquo;Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes to take all necessary steps to safeguard effectively natural or manufactured products originating in the territory of the other High Contracting Party against unfair competition in commercial transactions, in particular to suppress and prohibit by seizure or any other appropriate penalty in conformity with its laws, the import, bonding, sale or exposure for sale within the country, of any products which bear upon themselves or on their immediate containers or on their external packing, any marks, names, inscriptions or signs, whatsoever, conveying directly or indirectly false indications as to origin, kind, nature or specific qualities of such products or goods.&rdquo;  Has the Government here statutory authority to take such action, and, if not, is it the intention of the Minister to seek such statutory authority, and, if so, when?</P>
    <P>I would like also to know if, when the Minister was negotiating this Treaty, he made any representations to the French Government concerning the depredations of French trawlers in Irish territorial waters.  The Press has been full of complaints concerning the damage done by French trawlers, and I think the negotiating of this Treaty afforded a suitable opportunity for inducing the French Government to take action for restricting the activities of these trawlers.  I would be glad to know if the Minister has taken advantage of the opportunity, and, if so, with what results?</P>

      <P>Article 11 of this Treaty has been referred to specifically. As far as I understand, in the particular case to which the Deputy refers, an exception is made for the protection of public health or for the protection of animals or plants against disease, insects and harmful parasites, and if that had not been inserted, it would have led to an objection on the part of the Department of Agriculture here to the whole Treaty.  It is really regarded as a safeguard for us rather than the other way.  So far there has been no great cattle trade between the two <Col N="427" /> countries that would be affected by any prohibition under this Article or under any Article of a corresponding type under previous arrangements, because better terms and better prices were offered for the sale of cattle in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Not that I know of. If there were, they would necessarily be legal ones.  They would be ones which could be brought in under this Article.  Both nations reserve the right to make exceptions.  That is to say they allow themselves the privilege of prohibiting not from all countries but only from certain countries where danger is apprehended by reason of cattle disease of a particular type.  I do not know of any such prohibition that affects our cattle trade.  Under Article 14, the contracting parties take all necessary steps to do various things.  If there is not sufficient legislation to enable us to carry out what we have to carry out, we shall take the necessary steps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  Whether it is actually affected by legislation or not is a different matter.  There may, for instance, be such a matter as goods marketed in a particular way with a sign which would indicate that they were produced here and allowed into France when they were not as a matter of fact produced here.  If the Deputy will cast his mind back over recent history he will realise that there was a considerable fight in regard to a description which we thought ought to appertain to our goods, being applied to other goods.  That is an advantage we want ourselves, equally with the French Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of fisheries has been left out of the Treaty.  The Deputy feels that this was a suitable opportunity to make representations on that question. As a matter of fact, those negotiating on the part of France thought it an equally suitable opportunity to get certain concessions <Col N="428" /> granted to them, but these concessions were not granted and the matter of the fisheries does not arise under this Treaty at all.  The Article which has been amended&mdash;Article 29&mdash;has been made the subject of a general discussion. All Treaties are binding, but the position is a rather loose one.  I do not think I am speaking too generally when I say that any country emerging as this country did emerge, or any country on the Continent which achieved national status as a result of war conditions, has almost the right to say&mdash;it is certainly a matter for agreement as between itself and any other country&mdash;whether or not any arrangements made under the previous regime hold or do not hold.  I would not be able to answer at this moment as to how many conventions or Treaties made under the British regime are binding, but I say this: that we, like all the other parties to the old agreements, can operate on them as binding.  If there is an objection by either party, then it is quite possible that direct Treaty negotiations would have to be established.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me to give an indication of what Treaties are binding. When he considers the whole mass of Treaties that were established under the British regime he will realise that what he asks is a pretty tall order. We have a pretty good position in regard to these things.  No country has raised an objection yet to our acting, when the occasion demanded it, on any of the old Treaties.  It has been the policy of the Department to try to supersede the older Treaty system either by <i>modus vivendi</i> operations which we carry out ourselves or by specific Treaties.  The time most suitable to approach the matter is when some type of commercial activity seems to be urgent between the two countries.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Committee in the following Resolution:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1. That a customs duty of an <Col N="429" /> amount equal to 20 per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on all harness leather, whether dressed or undressed, of any of the following classes imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 17th day of July, 1931, and before the 17th day of July, 1936, that is to say:&mdash;Harness hides or parts thereof, harness sides or parts thereof, harness backs or parts thereof, harness bellies or parts thereof, harness shoulders or parts thereof.</P>
    <P>2.  That, notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution, the duty mentioned in that paragraph shall not be charged or levied on patent leather, chrome tanned leather, dressed collar hides or parts thereof, or dressed bridle butts or parts thereof.</P>
    <P>3.  That a customs duty of an amount equal to 20 per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 17th day of July, 1931, and before the 17th day of July, 1936, that is to say, all harness, whether completely or partially manufactured, and all parts of such harness other than parts which do not consist of or contain leather and at the time of importation are not attached to any harness, whether completely or partially manufactured, or to any part of such harness or consisting of leather.</P>
    <P>4.  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though articles chargeable with either of those duties were mentioned in the Second Schedule to that Act and were so mentioned as goods to which three-fourths of the full rate was thereby made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>5.  That the value of any article for the purposes of this Resolution shall be taken to be the price which an importer would give for the article if the article were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond at the place of importation, and duty shall be paid <Col N="430" /> on that value as fixed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>6.  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This is the Report of the Resolution imposing the duty on harness leather and on harness.  Since the motion was moved in the Dáil the Report of the Tariff Commission has been in the hands of Deputies and the case for the Tariff has doubtless been read by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to oppose this Resolution but to express considerable dissatisfaction at its very limited nature.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, the leather tanners of the Free State made application to the Tariff Commission for the imposition of a 25 per cent. ad valorem duty on imported sole and insole harness leather and also on manufactured harness.  The recommendation made by the Tariff Commission which is embodied in the resolution we are now discussing, was limited to the imposition of a 20 per cent. duty on harness leather and manufactured harness only.  It is apparently the conclusion of the Tariff Commission, a conclusion which has been accepted by the Government, that it is not possible to manufacture in this country all the varieties of leather required by boot-manufacturing and boot repairing trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not denied that the leather produced in the Free State is suitable for boot manufacturing purposes, but it is contended that all the varieties now in use in the boot manufacturing trade generally are not produced here and are not capable of being produced here.  That refers particularly to the inferior type of leather that is used for the cheap, heavy-nailed boot.  It is, apparently, the view of the Tariff Commission and of the Government that if the Free State tanneries cannot produce all the varieties of leather that are available in the world's markets at prices equal to or less than the prices which rule in those markets, then the protection necessary for the preservation <Col N="431" /> of the tanning industry here should not be given.  The applicants, in the course of the examination of their case, agreed to exempt from the scope of the proposed duty sole and insole leather required by the opposing boot factories and to confine their efforts to securing the market for leather used in the hand boot manufacturing and boot repairing trade. Even that reduced application was rejected and those who have read the report will, I am sure, agree with me that, however strong the case against the whole application may be considered, the case against the amended application is very weak indeed.</P>
    <P>The applicants admitted that certain factors give an advantage as regards the cost of production to British tanners, who are, of course, the chief competitors of the Free State tanneries, but they argued that that advantage would not be so pronounced if the tanneries here were working to capacity, that the increased output would enable the Free State tanners to purchase hides and other materials on more favourable terms and would result generally in a reduction in the cost of production.  The granting of the full application would have meant a small increase in the price of sole leather to boot manufacturers, but the Free State tanners maintain that once they were working to full capacity, with the decreased overhead charges that working to capacity would involve, they would be practically in a position to meet importers of that leather as regards price.  The tanners concerned in the application expressed their belief that the provision of good quality leather at a competitive price would enable the boot manufacturers to capture a large part of the market now supplied by imported boots of inferior quality.  It is my personal opinion that the boot manufacturers were very short-sighted in opposing the application.  It would have been very much to their interest if steps had been taken to ensure that internal supplies of leather would be always available.  Any temporary disadvantage resulting from the imposition of the tariff on leather might be offset by a slight increase in the tariff upon <Col N="432" /> boots which is, in any case, overdue. I think that the Tariff Commission and the Government were particularly short-sighted in rejecting the amended application made.  If the boot manufacturers were permitted to import the leather they required free of duty and the rest of the market were reserved for Free State tanneries, particularly the market for leather required by hand boot manufacturers and repairers, it would enable the tanneries here to get the increased output and put themselves in the position to offer more effective competition to the importers.  If that had been done, it might be possible for the tanneries to renew their application for a duty on sole and insole leather required by manufacturers at a later stage, when they would probably be able to demonstrate that a tariff could then be given without any of the disadvantages that are feared now.</P>
    <P>The only arguments against that course advanced in the Commission's Report is that some varieties of leather used in the repairing trade are not produced here and, consequently, would not be available at all or would have to be imported, despite the tariff, if the amended application were granted.  The obvious answer to that argument is &ldquo;We can do without those varieties.&rdquo;  If a tariff were imposed and these classes of leather were shut out altogether, we would have to do without them but nobody in this country would have to go badly shod on that account.</P>
    <P>The argument on which the Tariff Commission relied in the case of this application is similar to the argument they advanced in respect of other applications which came before them. That is, that because of intense competition the home manufacturers are not working to capacity and are not able to produce as cheaply as their rivals; consequently, they should not receive the protection they ask.  Apparently, protection will only be given where it is least required.  Where in the past bad government or restrictive legislation or intensive competition has reduced the efficiency of an existing industry, the old conditions are to be allowed to continue until the <Col N="433" /> industry disappears.  It is my opinion that the persistence of that mentality in the Executive Council or the Tariff Commission will mean the death-knell of the industrial revival.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to make special reference to the reports which appeared in the Press of the public sittings of the Commission in connection with this application.  We have stated here in the past that it is our view that members of that Commission are prejudiced against tariffs and against a tariff policy and that persons making application could not be sure of getting their case fairly considered.  That view has been borne out in a remarkable way by some of the statements made and questions put by members of the Commission at the public sittings in connection with this application.  I refer particularly to questions reported as having been put by one member, Mr. Twomey, who is reported as having said a number of things which would indicate that he is much more concerned about making free trade propaganda than in giving the case laid before him impartial consideration. He was informed by a boot manufacturer who was giving evidence on behalf of the opposition in this case that boots were now cheaper than in 1924 and that the boot tariff had not put up the price of boots.</P>
    <P>Then he came back with this intelligent question, &ldquo;Then what use is the tariff to Irish manufacturers?&rdquo; Witness replied, &ldquo;It is an assistance to us in our general manufacture.  It is also an assistance to us in getting on with the lighter end of the trade, which is the part most people want now.  If the tariff were taken off we would be swamped by the English manufacturers who would come in and cut us.&rdquo;  Then Mr. Twomey expressed this view: &ldquo;But it is perfectly clear that a tariff is no use to anybody unless it increased the price of the article made.&rdquo;  The witness, who was apparently taken aback by this partisan assertion on the part of a member of the Commission, replied, very sensibly, that: &ldquo;The object of the tariff is to keep out foreign competition.&rdquo;  There was further discussion on the matter and Mr. Twomey <Col N="434" /> ceased asking questions and began to make assertions.  His first assertion was: &ldquo;I want that made clear because there has been an attempt made to get away with the statement.&rdquo; When was the attempt made to get away with the statement, &ldquo;that the tariff had not increased prices&rdquo;?  Is this Government official on the Tariff Commission taking upon himself to reply to arguments advanced in the Dáil?  Does he consider that he is there paid by the taxpayers and appointed by the Government for the express purpose of refuting protectionist propaganda in the country or the arguments in favour of protection made here by Deputies elected by the people?  Apparently he seems to have some such idea in mind.  At any rate if witnesses attending before the Tariff Commission are to be badgered in that way and to have their opinions forced on them in that manner by members of the Commission then any group of manufacturers who are thinking of making application to the Commission are likely to be deterred from doing so and certainly they have no reason to believe that their application will be considered upon its merits.  It is, of course, only symptomatic of this Government that they should appoint a number of doctrinaire free traders to consider applications for tariffs. That is the easiest way of avoiding the possibility of having to impose tariffs, while at the same time being able to pose as impartial people anxious to do the best thing.</P>
    <P>The leather manufacturers are, I think, to be congratulated on having got a very small part of their application granted.  Other industries of much greater importance than theirs have had their applications completely rejected. Certainly I am convinced that no industry can have the slightest prospect of succeeding, no matter how strong its case, so long as it has to make its case before persons of the mentality of Mr. Twomey who made those nonsensical assertions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to know something about leather, and to a great extent I agree with the findings of the Tariff Commission in respect of the tariff sought on leather, for this <Col N="435" /> reason: At one time we made in Ireland some of the finest sole leather in the world and to-day O'Callaghan's of Limerick are the only tannery in the Free State making good sole leather.  The conditions have changed considerably in the last few years, and as has been pointed out in the report, the classes of sole leather extensively used here are not made in this country. Those who have to buy leather for the purposes of the boot repairing trade have to use this particular class of leather.  I agree with Deputy Lemass in this, that if we could succeed by any tariff, even a tariff amounting to a prohibition, in having this class of leather manufactured in the country, I for one would put up with the temporary inconvenience caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is another matter to which I wish to refer, and that is with reference to manufactured harness. I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it would not be possible to prohibit the importation of second-hand Army harness into this country. There is a considerable amount of harness made in Warsaw and sold cheaply in this country.  In addition, there is a considerable quantity of second-hand English army harness which is brought in and sold at prices that no harness maker in the country could compete with.  Apart from the tanning industry that we have had in this country, we have also had the harness-making industry, and this industry is petering out to such an extent that only an odd man is now engaged in repairing harness outside Dublin, where there is a considerable number of men engaged in the manufacture of harness.  These men throughout the country have been deprived of their living because they cannot compete against the importation of second-hand stuff, and I think it would be no hardship upon anybody if the importation of this second-hand harness was prohibited.  We make harness leather in Ireland, and very good harness leather, and I am glad to see that the Tariff Commission agreed to put a slight tariff on imported harness.  Outside O'Callaghan's of Limerick they make ood <Col N="436" /> harness leather in Clonmel and Kilkenny. Leather making industry for harness making could be far more easily and cheaply revived than could the tanning industry.  The modern process of tanning has become very complicated and highly scientific, and requires enormous capital.  The English tanneries engaged in that branch of the industry say they have been losing money upon it for years.  Having to face the competition of Germany and France and America, the English tanners have had to cut their prices to such an extent that they are losing money.</P>
    <P>Now the difficulty of the position from our point of view is that, as far as I understand it, Messrs.  O'Callaghan of Limerick are not in a position to cope with the demand for sole leather, outside sole leather required for the manufacture of new boots. There is a very extensive trade done in this country in the importation of sole leather for the purpose of repairs.  I think we import more sole leather for repair work than for new work.</P>
    <P>There is here and there in the country still a certain amount of old hand-made work being done, particularly in Kerry and West Cork and parts of Waterford.  In the mountain areas no boot will stand so well as the hand-made boot, and no boot is so fitted for the work in these areas as the boot made by an Irish country bootmaker.  The greatest part of the material used by these men is foreign. In some cases they use O'Callaghan's sole leather but the greater amount of the stuff used is from heavy English bends, and the upper leather is foreign. At one time we produced in this country a splendid upper leather and we could perhaps do that still.  But the fashion has changed to a great extent and the few Irish tanneries which manufactured kips in the old days have gone out of business.  The old-fashioned brogue made in the South of Ireland was made from this leather.  I am afraid that I am giving the House a lecture on the manufacture of leather.</P>

      <P>If we could succeed in inducing some of the old tanners in the small towns who used to produce a good class heavy leather in the old days to resume that production, and if we could then put on such a tariff as would compel our people to use that leather I think we would be doing a very good thing.  In recent years we have fallen into the habit, following the rest of the world, of wearing cheaply made shoddy boots sent to us from England.  It would be a good idea if our people were compelled to fall back on a better class of boot. That would be better for their health and it would be in the interests of the country.  If we could induce the smaller man who did produce good leather in the old days to go back to that, and if we could prohibit any any other class of leather coming in we would be doing a good thing.</P>
      <P>Ladies' boots are in a different category. For many years we have not produced any upper leather suitable for ladies' boots.  That has become a very highly specialised industry&mdash;an industry with an enormous capital behind it.  As far as men's upper and sole leather is concerned we can produce in this country in a comparatively short time the best leather and we need not send out of the country for a bit of leather for ordinary working boots, and if we can produce such a state of affairs in the country that every bit of leather going into good strong boots were produced in this country it would be a good thing, and any tariff that would bring about such a state of affairs would be well worth adopting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am protesting against the imposition of this tariff on harness leather from this point of view.  I have not been able to come across any statistics with regard to the amount of harness leather used in different industries, but I think the House will agree with me that a very large percentage of harness leather is now used by the farming and agricultural industry.  Motor traffic has more or less taken the place of horses, in nearly all our industries except the farming industry, and the amount of <Col N="438" /> harness leather and harness employed on an agricultural farm is no small item in the expenditure per annum. Very often I buy a couple of sides of leather&mdash;it is usual where I live&mdash;and employ a harness maker for two or three weeks.  The imposition of a 20 per cent. tariff on harness leather will not alone increase the price of the side leather by 20 per cent., but by more, because as you know the price of any article a tariff is put on is increased by more than the percentage of Customs duty.  I do not see why the agricultural community should be the one people in the State called upon to bear all these dues.  I think it is pretty well known and agreed that the cause of the financial crisis in England has been the high cost of production of her manufactures. England has since the war lost a great deal of her world trade through the high cost of production.  Yet here in the Free State for anything manufactured for the farming community they are called upon to pay anything from 15 to 25 per cent. more.</P>
      <P>I recognise that you cannot protect the farming industry because we produce a surplus of most of our agricultural produce and the price of that will depend upon the English market.  Yet we in Ireland are called upon to pay 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. higher for anything we buy than the English manufacturers.  The workers in the sheltered industries and our manufacturers should come to some agreement that they will produce manufactured articles for the use of the farming community as cheaply as they can be produced in any other country.  I do not see why the agricultural community of this country should be called upon to spoon-feed these industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As the report shows the Saorstát tanners can produce harness leather of the qualities that are required and have been able to produce them in the past cheaply enough to compete with imported leather on which there was no tariff and they can produce in a sufficient quantity.  Therefore I think there is not likely to be any increase or at any rate any material increase in the price of harness leather.  So in that way I think the fears that Deputy Mathews entertains have not very much basis. I do not say there will be no increase, but I think there is not likely to be any appreciable increase.  If the Tariff Commission looked at the whole matter as Deputy Lemass would have them look at it, the task would be entirely simple.  They would decide in every application that came before them that there was nothing for consideration only the amount of the tariff.  I daresay they would give a larger amount than any manufacturer would have the cheek to ask for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear, and I think it is clear even from Deputy Goulding's speech, that this matter is not a simple one, but is in fact a very complicated one, and is difficult because the article proposed to be tariffed is not an article which goes to the general public.  It is the raw material of another industry which is very much more important from the point of view of capital employed and from the point of view of the number of people employed than the tanning industry is or could be, because, as is shown in the report, if we were to manufacture here all the sole and in-sole leather required the boot industry would be very much more important. Therefore, while, if you like, the tanning industry is more nearly a primary industry in its economic aspect it is quite a subsidiary industry as compared with boot-making, and there is no doubt at all that the boot manufacturing industry of this country has still a very long way to go before it has captured that proportion of the market which it ought to be able to capture before all that proportion of our requirements in boots <Col N="440" /> is made here that ought to be made here.</P>
    <P>It would be very undesirable from every point of view to handicap the bootmaking industry with its great potentialities for the purpose of getting some small immediate increase in the tanning industry.  If there are two industries concerned, one of which supplies raw materials to the other, then the industry to promote and develop first is the industry nearest the general consumer.  If we had the boot manufacturing industry here carried on on a much more extensive scale than it is at present, supposing it were seven or eight times the size it is at present, supposing it had captured everything except certain specialities, shall we say; that it was in a strong condition, that it was well capitalised and had all the skilled workers that it required, that the factories had the reserves that prosperous factories would have&mdash;then we could face up to the position of perhaps requiring that industry to make some small sacrifices required, to face certain minor inconveniences for the purpose of enabling the industry, from which it got its raw material, to be built up.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have reached that stage.  I think at present if there is a choice to be made between the boot manufacturing and tanning then we must prefer the boot manufacture at once.</P>
    <P>There is of course the device of increasing very substantially the boot tariff.  I think if the tariff on boots is to be increased there ought to be a direct examination of the boot tariff and of the consequences of raising it. I do not think it should be dealt with as a subsidiary inquiry to an application for a tariff on an industry that I described as itself subsidiary, or as a relatively minor industry.  There may or may not be a case for increasing the tariff on boots, but if the boot tariff is to be increased the effect that the increased price of boots would have on the cost of living, on agriculture and all that, would certainly deserve to be considered specially and separately.  The manufacturers of boots <Col N="441" /> have not so far been in agreement amongst themselves as to whether or not an application should be made.  I would hope that this particular tariff, in addition to giving the tanners the Saorstát market for harness leather, will encourage them&mdash;I believe there is only one tannery concerned in this&mdash;to hold whatever ground they have in regard to sole and in-sole leather and to extend it.  If the factory is able to do a more profitable business because of a more certain business than before in sole and insole leather it ought to be used in dealing with the other branch of the business, but if there is something specially going to be done for sole and insole leather it can only suitably be done after the lapse of some years when the boot industry has very much strengthened its position.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that there is no definition of the term &ldquo;village&rdquo; at all.  Nobody seems to know what a village is.  The Minister says &ldquo;a cluster of houses.&rdquo;  He could not say how many houses should be in the cluster in order to constitute a village. The position is that in order to make the Bill operate, as I think its framers intend it should operate, to cover the case of houses which are not covered by the Land Act, it is necessary to get a definition of some sort of the term &ldquo;village.&rdquo;  I am suggesting a definition that would include isolated houses whether situated at a cross-roads or <Col N="443" /> half a mile outside a village boundary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, as I have said, have no objection to any houses being included in this Bill, but it was not the original intention that they should.  No representations were made to the Committee which sat on this matter that these houses if they exist should be included in the Bill, and no representations were ever made by anybody or as far as I know by even individuals who occupy this class of house that they should be included in the Bill.  In consequence of no representations being made, the matter has not been considered at all by the Town Tenants Commission.  It was not the original intention that they should be included.  I did, however, express my view that if there was such houses it would be perfectly all right that they should be included.  I did state, as Deputy O'Connell has said, that I would endeavour to get a formula which I thought would be in order and which at the same time would effectuate that purpose.</P>
      <P>I have been unable to find such a formula.  Leaving aside these things, and on the question as to whether the amendment by Deputy Lemass is in order or not, I do not think that the amendment would carry out what Deputy Lemass or Deputy O'Connell wants.  The amendment by Deputy Lemass reads as follows</P>
      <P>and shall include any lands or premises wherever situate held by the occupier thereof under a lease or other contract of tenancy and used solely for the purpose of trade or manufacture, or as a residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that that is at all a desirable amendment if you come to <Col N="444" /> consider what it would cut out.  It would have to be used solely for the purpose of trade, manufacture or residence.  If it were used partly for trade and partly as a residence it would be cut out by this definition. Suppose it were a house with a half acre or an acre of land attached to it, to use the expression used in law, a curtilage, supposing there was a curtilage there, the whole house would be cut out.  That would be because it would not be used solely for the purpose of a residence.  I failed to get any wording which I thought would be in order according to the ruling of An Ceann Comhairle.  I am not expressing any opinion now as to whether these words are or are not in order, but even if they were in order they would have to be very drastically altered to carry out the intentions of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was going through the Committee Stage, Deputy O'Connell moved to delete sub-section (2) of this Section.  The sub-section reads:</P>
      <P>A tenant shall not be entitled to compensation for improvements in respect of an improvement made before the passing of this Act on a tenement in contravention of the lease or other contract of tenancy under which such tenement was held.</P>

What I said was that I would see if I could accept the amendment. Having considered it, I have come to the conclusion that it would establish a very bad principle.  It is not on all fours with the other parts of the Bill, because in the other parts of the Bill you are contemplating a thing which will be done in the future while here you would legalise a thing which was done in the past in contravention of a covenant or agreement. In all leases for the future you will have a covenant implying that the consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  That is inserted in leases for the future, and therefore a tenant can have it decided as to whether it would be unreasonable.  Here you would be going back on the past and you would have the person who would have broken his covenant or agreement finding that his breach of the covenant or agreement was being legalised by subsequent legislation. That would be a bad precedent to introduce. I considered the matter pro and con very carefully, and I came to the conclusion that I could not accept an amendment of this nature.  I regret that I have to oppose Deputy Lemass's amendment.</P>

      <P>The point which the Minister appears to overlook&mdash;and it was referred to by Deputy O'Connell in Committee&mdash;was that very frequently the consent of the landlord is given verbally and the tenant is not always in a position to produce proof of consent when claiming compensation. These things are not always done in a formal manner, and it is quite possible that the tenant effecting the improvements under the impression that the landlord would agree to them would find himself on the expiration of the lease deprived of the compensation he was entitled to.  The landlord will not be asked to pay compensation unless the letting value is increased by the improvements.  It seems to me that the ordinary claims of justice would suggest an amendment of this kind as a safeguard against the possibility of a tenant being defrauded by a landlord who might have given a verbal consent but did not confirm it in writing.</P>

      <P>If he gave a verbal consent, unless the lease specified that the consent would have to be in writing, then the tenant would not have broken his covenant.  I also think that the tenant who would be told verbally by the landlord to go ahead and improve would have a case against the landlord.  But that is not what this is dealing with.  This is a case where the tenant has gone on with improvements although consent has been refused, unreasonably if you like, but still refused. That is what this amendment deals with, and I think it would be a dangerous and a very bad principle to introduce.</P>

The landlord might have died or disappeared, and it might be denied that such consent was given.  Injustice might very well be done to the tenant, who would have made considerable improvements in the belief that he had the consent <Col N="450" /> of the landlord to do so.  Later he might find that he was not in a position to prove that he had consent. Upon whom would the onus lie?</P>

      <P>Surely that is sufficient safeguard against any evil that might arise of which the Minister may be afraid.  The onus falls on the tenant to prove that he improved the place and the improvements were reasonable. He carried out improvements at his own risk and he knows he will be involved in litigation simply because he has chanced his hand in making improvements, for which he did not get the consent of the landlord.  He goes to court and there he has to make his case in order to prove that what he did was reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 10a.  There are several amendments dealing with the same point, that is how a landlord should be dealt with who avails himself of the exceptions in this Section 21, that is where he wants the benefit of vacant possession for the purpose of rebuilding or carrying out the development of property, makes a bogus claim and gets the tenant out.  I have made a suggestion in this amendment, and Deputy Lemass makes a suggestion in Amendment 10b.  There are other amendments dealing very much with the same question, such as Amendment 11a in my name, and Amendment No. 11, also in my name. The suggestion I make in these amendments is that if a landlord wants houses for a building scheme and gets possession of one house for that purpose, the other houses will not fall into possession for some little time, and of course he will not be able to start his building scheme until he has got possession of all the houses necessary for the reconstruction scheme, or whatever scheme of that nature he requires, and that the tenant should not be put out of occupation until the very last minute when it <Col N="454" /> is necessary, and that then, if the landlord acts towards one tenant or towards a series of tenants in an incorrect fashion, that is to say, if he gets possession by making a bogus case in court, that the court should deal with the person who has deliberately misused the procedure, who has deliberately gone into court and made the case that he required these premises for an estate improvement, and all the time did not require them for that improvement; in other words, for getting possession under false pretences.  I suggest that it should be left to the court to deal with him, that it should be considered to be a contempt of court, and the Judge will, I have no doubt, deal severely with a person who has so misused the process of the court.  I think that that would be an ample remedy in cases like that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, though he would achieve the same purpose, I do not think is achieving it altogether in a satisfactory manner.  We are both aiming at achieving the same purpose. He says that the tenant shall be entitled to have a new tenancy if he so wishes without having regard to any compensation which may have been paid.  It seems to me that that goes very far.  Suppose the landlord has paid £2,000 or £3,000&mdash;he may have paid even a larger sum&mdash;and he has not carried out his scheme.  The tenant has received full compensation for his loss of good-will, etc.  That he should get back his premises and at the same time have the compensation for what he has not lost appears to me to be rather rewarding the tenant too highly, giving him something which really is not his.  I do not think that would be a good principle. I think it is better that it should be left to the discretion of the court to punish the landlord who has deceived the court, and I think possession by the court of ample powers to punish the landlord who has deceived the court will prevent any landlord from endeavouring to deceive the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that we are both aiming at the same thing, but that he does not like the method I have devised to achieve it.  I submit, <Col N="455" /> however, that he has not achieved it at all.  Although he has taken two or three shots at the mark he has missed it each time.  In the first amendment he proposes to punish a landlord after he secures possession on a bogus statement. The actual punishment is of no value to the tenant who has been deprived of his tenancy in consequence of a bogus statement, and who is not getting any redress in consequence of this particular sub-section.  He may have the satisfaction of knowing that the landlord is going to go to prison for contempt of court, but that is not going to offset the loss he would be at in consequence of the landlord's crime.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is no guarantee that the landlord will be punished at all.  On whom is the obligation to rest of reporting to the Court that the landlord has not completed the improvements in a reasonable time?  And what is a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo;?  It seems to  that that section will be completely inoperative where the landlord makes a bogus statement and as a result regains possession of the tenement.  He does not proceed with the reconstruction or the rebuilding which he was expected to do, and which he told the court he was going to do.  What happens?  Must a common informer go to the court and point out that this particular landlord regained possession on the strength of the statement, and that he has not in fact proceeded to rebuild or reconstruct, and demand that the landlord in question be brought up for contempt of court? How is the person who lodges the information to know what the court will hold to be a reasonable time?  The phrase used here is &ldquo;reasonable time.&rdquo; What is a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo;?  In my opinion, the section as it stands will be of no benefit to anybody and of no danger to the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under amendment 11a, which is the second shot the Minister took at the same mark, he again missed it.  The Minister is providing in this case that if compensation for disturbance of the tenant is awarded and not paid, the tenant may apply to the court for a new tenancy.  But in this particular <Col N="456" /> case the landlord may have proceeded with the reconstruction, and by the time the tenant applies for a new tenancy the building may not be there. It is going to be of no advantage to the tenant if he has lost his compensation to get a new tenancy in a building that has been demolished.  In order to do that, he has to take the risk of having his award for compensation discharged before he institutes proceedings for the new tenancy.  The amendment says: &ldquo;And the institution of such application shall operate as a discharge of the said award.&rdquo;  He must throw away whatever advantage the award is to him, even though he has not got the compensation, on the chance that the court will favourably consider his application for a new tenancy in a building which has been demolished in the meantime.</P>
    <P>In his third shot the Minister hit something and that amendment appears to be all right, but it does not meet the case that the tenant, who has been deprived of a tenancy as a result of the bogus statement of the landlord, for whom some redress should be available. I suggest if the landlord has regained possession of a tenement on a statement made to the court that he was going to reconstruct and rebuild, and if in fact, he does not do so, that the tenant should be given the right to apply to the court for a new tenancy in that building, and as a particular punishment of the landlord I would provide that the application may be granted without regard to any compensation that might have been paid. It is put in as a punishment to the landlord and I suggest that if the amendment is put in as I drafted it no landlord would take the chance of regaining possession of a tenement on a bogus statement.  He stands to lose too much.  Whereas if the Minister's series of amendments are inserted he may get away with it and, in fact, lose nothing at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as amendment 11a is concerned, though I may not have made myself clear, that really deals with the same matter as Deputy Lemass is dealing with under amendment 16a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> In page 18, section 34, to insert after sub-section (1) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  Where compensation for disturbance under this Act is payable by a landlord to a tenant and such compensation is not so paid within the time specified in this section, such tenant may apply to the Court for an order declaring such tenant entitled to a new tenancy in the tenement in respect of which such compensation is payable.</P>
    <P>That really is the cor-relative amendment to amendment 11a.  I think the amendment I bring forward, 11a, is much more in favour of the tenant and against a defaulting landlord than the Deputy's amendment, because under my amendment it is stated &ldquo;the foregoing sub-sections of this section shall not apply in respect of such application.&rdquo; If the landlord has made default in payment of the money, and if the tenant goes to the Court, the landlord is completely done out of all the benefits of the preceeding sub-sections, that is to say whether he wants a building scheme or not, once he has made default in payment of the amount, he is precluded from raising these defences again.  Under the amendment of Deputy Lemass he will be able to raise these defences again. As far as the amendment is concerned, that is contempt of court, the person who would bring that before the Court would be the tenant.</P>
    <P>It might happen that the tenant would not do so.  But I think, in most cases, the tenant, if he had suffered loss, would bring the matter before the Court.  I think that is in human nature.  It also has occurred to me that the argument of Deputy Lemass was possibly a little bit against his own contention, because if the tenant is the tenant of a house that, as he says, has been demolished, he would go back there and get a new tenancy.  As the Deputy pointed out, it would be no use to him in that case.  If a tenant has taken a new lease or new premises&mdash;we must assume that most business people who are moved from premises will start business somewhere else in the neighbourhood&mdash;then the right to get a <Col N="458" /> fresh tenancy in his own premises will be of no use to him at all.  Even if he did go back I do not like the principle of getting a new tenancy and getting what may be a colossal sum of money paid into his pocket in addition.  That does not seem to me to be right.  If a person has suffered no loss, as might very well be the case, he might get thousands of pounds.  That does not seem to me to be quite right and fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, amendment 11a does not relate to this particular matter at all.  What we are discussing is the position of a tenant who has lost a tenancy because of a bogus deed of the landlord.  Amendment 11a does not refer to that, but refers to a matter in respect to Section 34, the actual payment of compensation. What I am suggesting is that the tenant should have the right to claim a new tenancy if the compensation awarded is not paid.  The only thing that arises in connection with that is what was referred to a short time ago, the operation of the concluding words in the amendment: &ldquo;the institution of such applications shall operate as a discharge of the said award of compensation for disturbance.&rdquo;  Does it not seem harsh to leave the tenant in the position that, having failed to get his compensation, he cannot apply to the courts for a new tenancy without at the beginning surrendering his claim to the compensation already awarded?</P>

But as the point then discussed was pressed very strongly I said I would introduce an amendment of this nature.  Deputy Lemass is bringing forward amendment 13a. While I thought that Deputy O'Connell's amendment was not very helpful&mdash;in fact that it was harmful and not quite fair to the tenant&mdash;I think that Deputy Lemass' amendment goes a little bit too far the other way, because it gives the tenant the absolute right to decide.  He would be one of the parties to the court proceedings. The Deputy's amendment would give him the absolute right to decide as to the length of the tenancy.  I think that the Bill was very much better as it stood originally.  It left a discretion <Col N="462" /> to the Court that is should not exceed 99 years, and that then the Court would do what was just between the parties without any particular period being laid down.  In the interests of justice between the parties, I think it would be much better to leave the Bill as it was, but as I undertook to introduce this amendment I am now doing so.  I do not think it is going to be a helpful amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that the amendment standing in my name is the one that Deputy O'Connell intended to suggest, though in fact he suggested the amendment which the Minister has introduced.  The amendment that the Minister is introducing is one that the House should be very slow to pass, because it puts the tenant in the position that he cannot refuse a tenancy for fifty years if it is offered to him. A tenant may not desire to be bound up for that period.  A tenant who, in present circumstances, takes a new tenancy is to some extent engaging in a gamble in the sense that rents may go up or may go down.  He has to exercise his own discretion as to whether he wants a long tenancy in the expectation of rents rising or a short one in the expectation of rents falling.</P>
      <P>I suggest that a discretion should be given to the tenant, that he should be allowed to elect whether he wants a five-year, a ten-year, or a ninety-nine-year tenancy.  If, in the election he makes, his gamble comes off, he should be allowed to profit by his good judgment.  If it does not come off, then the landlord will profit.  I think it would be much better to give a discretion to the tenant and let him say how long he wants a new tenancy for.</P>

      <P>There are two persons to be considered&mdash;the owner of the premises, who is the landlord, and the tenant&mdash;and I do not think that you should, so to speak, put the landlord completely at the mercy of the tenant, because what the tenant might do would be this: he would go in for two or three years, and at the end of that period come back to the <Col N="463" /> court and say: &ldquo;I will take it for another year.&rdquo;  He would be always entitled to go back and back.  He would take it over for a sufficiently long period to qualify himself under the Act.  I do not think that would be quite fair to the landlord.  He is now having a statutory tenancy imposed on him, without his being consulted as to what he thinks would be a proper letting period.  I do not know whether the Deputy would be inclined to enter into a bargain&mdash;that I withdraw my amendment, and that he should withdraw his, thus allowing the section to stand as it stood originally, leaving it to the discretion of the court to do justice between landlord and tenant.</P>

      <P>I can see this difficulty in this connection, that the court might be unreasonable in the view of the tenant.  The court is dealing with a case in which the tenant has a right to a new tenancy, in which, say, the rent shall be £300 a year.  The tenant goes to the court to get a renewal of the tenancy, in default of agreement, and if the court says, &ldquo;We will give you a tenancy for 99 years at a rent of £300 a year,&rdquo; the tenant might be slow to enter into such a contract, as if there was a fall in rents he would be bound to lose.  On the other hand, if he refused the offer of the court he might lose his right to a tenancy altogether.</P>
      <P>What is the position in that connection? I can see that at present people will be very slow to enter into long tenancies at existing rents.  On the other hand the court might feel that it was obliged to fix a long period in order to prevent these continuous renewals.  It is the tenant's interests, in my opinion, that should be considered. This is a case in which it is agreed that the tenant has a right to a new tenancy and I do not see that the landlord can have much objection to the duration of the new tenancy being decided by the tenant, seeing that the landlord has to give it in any case.</P>

      <P>It would be rather hard on the landlord if he had to give a renewal every two or three years.  Suppose the tenant asks for <Col N="464" /> a very short term, just enough to qualify him for renewal.  Then he would come for renewal after renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you would have no longer than a three years term.  I do not think it would be quite fair to the landlord that he would have to let his premises on such a short letting, because, after all, if you are going to make a fair bargain between people, there must be a reasonably long term letting, not a letting that can be renewed from three year periods to three year periods by one of the parties. That is possibly what the tenant might do and the landlord would not know the value of his property at all.  If you let premises for twenty-one years you know where you are for the next twenty-one years, and if you want to borrow money you have got a security in this letting on which you can borrow.  You know you have got a steady income for twenty-one years.  On the other hand if the premises are only let for three years they may be vacant at the end of the three years, for perhaps a year or longer, and you do not know where you are.  I think the landlord is entitled to a reasonably long letting.  I do not think it would be quite fair to him to compel him to give a tenancy for so short a term.  It would mean that he was always getting short term lettings.</P>

      <P>The Minister apparently has made up his mind not to yield to the amendment which has been tabled by Deputy Lemass.  I am not vain enough to think that anything I can say would alter what appears to be the fixed attitude of the Minister in regard to the amendment of Deputy Lemass, but I am not entirely without hope that the Minister may see his way slightly to alter his own amendment. The Minister has expressed the view that it would not be fair to the landlord to be called upon for new tenancies every two or three years.  In certain cases, the force of what the Minister says is manifest.  That might be unreasonable to the landlord but it is <Col N="465" /> a long cry from two or three years to fifty years.  If the Minister, as I rather anticipate, cannot see his way to adopt the structure of the amendment of Deputy Lemass, I would suggest that he might see his way to reduce the period suggested in his own amendment from fifty to thirty years. That would get rid of the grievance that the Minister has indicated.  At the same time it would prevent what might be a very great hardship in many cases, of having a fifty years term inflicted upon a tenant who did not want it.  If the Minister would advance on that line I think that possibly he would hold the scales evenly.</P>

      <P>As I stated before, I am not at all enamoured of this fifty year period.  I stated on the Committee Stage, I think in several instances, through I was willing to accept it when pressed on me, that I did not think that fifty years would be fair to the tenant.  There might be instances in which it would work out unfairly.  If the house is willing to adopt Deputy Geoghegan's suggestion I accept it.  I think twenty-one years would be an ample period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a most extraordinary position.  When the Bill was passing through Committee a certain amendment was moved in my name and accepted by the House.  Upon reading the Bill, as presented now, I find that it includes positively seven-eighths of the original section of the Bill, as introduced on Committee, to which section I most vehemently objected. I particularly objected in the section of the original Bill to the words giving the court power to fix such a rent as a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take, on the basis of vacant possession.  The amendment I moved, which was accepted by the Minister, appears on the Official Report, Vol. 39, page 834. That amendment, as accepted by the House, reads:</P>
      <P>(f)  The gross rent shall be the rent which may be fixed by the court having regard to the letting values of tenements of a similar character in the immediate vicinity and to the other terms of such tenancy but without regard to any good-will which may exist in respect of such tenement.</P>
      <P>That was passed and accepted by the House.  Why does that amendment, as passed and accepted by the House, not appear in the printed Bill which the House has now under consideration? It appears to me to be a most anomalous position and I cannot understand it.  If the Minister wanted to improve upon the amendment the House accepted, it was open to him to improve upon it in a reasonable way. But surely the Minister was bound by the acceptance of the amendment to insert in the present Bill the exact words of the amendment which the House originally accepted.  I think the Minister has acted ultra vires.</P>

That is, that the words that the Deputy proposed to delete should stand in the section.  That question was put and agreed to.  Therefore, the Deputy's amendment was defeated. I am afraid that in my reading the amendment hurriedly I took it that <Col N="472" /> the Deputy's amendment was put in the direct manner, rather than in the other manner.  In my hasty reading I thought it was carried.  But it is quite clear it was put in this form:&mdash;&ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part.&rdquo;  That was agreed to by the House and, therefore, the Deputy's amendment to leave out the words was defeated so that the record and the Bill are quite right and the Deputy and myself were wrong.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was originally introduced, I said that the whole kernel of the Bill was contained in the sub-section about the fixation of fair rents.  I pointed out that I had a most rooted objection to the words appearing in this section of the Bill fixing the fair rent, and the powers of the court to fix a fair rent, under such conditions that the rent should be what a willing lessee, not in occupation, would give and what a willing lessor would take.  I pointed out that this simply meant the full letting market value of the premises.  I pointed out that I had experience of what happened in a case where leases expired and when premises came to be offered, as they will be offered under the Bill, on the basis of vacant possession.  I pointed out that where the rent originally was £120, it was increased to £360 and £400, and in some instances to £500.  The Minister intends to perpetuate in this Bill that condition of <Col N="473" /> affairs.  If that is so, although I sit on the Government Benches, I will again go into the lobby against them.  If a business tenant is going to get a lease on the full letting market value of the premises then this Bill is absolutely worthless.  Every appeal has been made to the Minister to remedy this section, which is the kernel of the Bill, and he has turned a deaf ear.  First he introduced into the Bill the words &ldquo;in circumstances of normal competition.&rdquo; That met with such criticism that he was forced to withdraw it, and now he makes a complete volte face, and &ldquo;in circumstances of normal competition&rdquo; appears again in this section of the Bill.  I ask any lawyer in this House to interpret what a fair rent will be under the Bill as it now stands.  If to-day, in any of the leading streets in the city, a business premises becomes subject to the operations of this Bill, and a tenant is paying on an old rental at the rate of £120 a year, and is asked to come into court and have his rent fixed under this section, what will it be fixed at?  Before coming to the House to-day, I consulted several lawyers upon this section of the Bill and they were unanimous in saying, as the Bill now reads, the insertion of the additional words in the amendment will mean that tenants will have to pay a higher rent.  I must confess I could not interpret the section at all.  It is to me an enigma, and the position of a professional man who appears for or on behalf of tenant or landlord under this section will be hopeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want clear-cut, definite principles and the fixing of a fair rent.  This thing has been going on since 1906, and business tenants have never received a fair rent.  In 1931 they are not going to receive a fair rent, and if the Minister is not inclined to meet public opinion, to meet the demands of justice and to give tenants a reasonable rent under this Bill, it were better that this Town Tenants Bill were never introduced. Looking at that section of the Bill as it now stands, anybody knows that all the tenants are going to get under this section is the full market letting value of the premises.  The Minister inserts the words &ldquo;such circumstances <Col N="474" /> that the supply of similar tenements is sufficient to meet the demands and the competition therefor is normal.&rdquo;  Will the Minister say in how many cases will normal competition exist in the City of Dublin for the letting of premises?  Will the Minister say if there is 2½ per cent. of the streets in the City of Dublin where those wonderful amendments of his would apply? Is it not self-evident that 99 per cent. of the cases to be dealt with under this section of the Bill will not be affected under the amendment which the Minister has tabled for our consideration today? I do not know what to say about this Bill.  If it is going to be mere camouflage, as far as business people are concerned, then the sooner they know where they are the better, and I, for one, will take the trouble, and it will be pleasure for me, to enlighten them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne did not touch the amendment before the House in his speech at all. The question before the House is whether the words &ldquo;circumstances of normal competition&rdquo; are a better set of words than &ldquo;such circumstances that the supply of similar tenements is sufficient to meet the demands and the competition therefor is normal.&rdquo;  That is the one question before the House at the moment.  Deputy Byrne did not address himself to it at all.  As a matter of fact I expanded those words, &ldquo;circumstances of normal competition,&rdquo; into the present form rather more at the instance of Deputy Byrne than of anyone else.  As to the merits of the section as a whole, they do not arise here.  As far as Deputy Byrne's statements go, though I think they are irrelevant, I would like to answer them in two words.  In the first place the tenants will not pay the full letting value of the premises, because the full letting value would be the premises plus the goodwill.  They will have to pay nothing for the goodwill.  As far as starting the propaganda that this is not going to be of any use to tenants, I think if it had any effect at all, which I do not think it would have, it would have an effect prejudicial to the tenant.</P>

      <P>This raises a question on which we had a good deal of discussion on previous Stages of the Bill.  I think, as far as I can recollect, the result of that discussion was that the Minister felt rather favourable to the principles which the amendment seeks to bring into effect but found a difficulty in getting at any figure.  I ventured to put down for this Stage a particular figure for his consideration and, I hope, acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is this: that the Bill, as it stands, will I believe in practice lead to the rents under these kinds of leases here dealt with being continued to the ground landlord without any increase at all; that is to say, that leases which were given many years ago at a certain figure would have to be renewed at precisely the same figure for the ground landlord.  In other words, the value of the ground landlord's interest has increased.  The interest on the lapse of a lease will be taken from him, and the middleman who has held this lease in the knowledge that when the lease terminated it would be subject to a new rent, to be fixed by the ground landlord, will get a pleasant surprise. He will get a lease practically in perpetuity at the same rent as before.  That does not seem to be equitable.  Even with regard to the value of money when these original leases were made, a rent fixed at a certain figure then would have quite a different value today <Col N="478" /> and probably for many years to come.  The Bill as it stands takes no account of that whatever.  Neither does it take any account of the fact that in very many cases the rents fixed for these leases were fixed low in order to encourage building.  For that specific purpose the leases were given at a particularly low rent.  Now the Bill proposes that though that condition has been fulfilled there is no longer the same reason for having a low rent. That low rent is still to obtain.</P>

      <P>In estimating the figure which I have put in the amendment, namely, one-quarter of the gross rent, I have tried to follow what is professed to be and what I believe is the object of the Bill, namely, that it should be to suit the practice of the better managed estates and not to be guided by the cases of bad landlordship, which no doubt do exist; and if the figure of one-quarter of the gross rent be allowed as the new rent at which the lease should be given be taken and compared with actual instances of well-managed estates, I think it will be found to be very near indeed to the terms on which these new leases are granted on these estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one great objection to the plan that is suggested in the Bill. Even if the gross rent has been determined it would be extremely difficult to arrive at the figure for what are called in the Bill &ldquo;allowances.&rdquo; It will lead to a great deal of discussion, and possibly quite lengthy cases in order to get an estimate of these allowances.  All that will be avoided if the suggestion I have made is accepted, but once the gross rent has been determined the rent at which the new lease is to be given is automatically determined.  I do not think it can be argued or that it will be held in any section of the House that allowing one-quarter of the gross rent as the landlord's share of the rent is excessive.  The difference between a quarter of the gross rent and the rent at which the lease has been <Col N="479" /> given will be a very small thing, but I think it is only fair and equitable that some improvement in the letting value should be allowed to the landlord, and not the whole of it given to the middleman or the tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great deal to be said in favour of what Deputy Thrift has put forward, that it would save a very considerable amount of very difficult and complicated questions to be decided by the courts, and it would also take very much less of the court's time in settling these rents, and even lead to more settlements outside the court, if we would hit what would be a rule-of-thumb figure.  But before we can come to any conclusion like a quarter of the fair rent as being the proper thing for the future we would have to see how that would work out in every case.  I am afraid I am not satisfied that it would work out as being just, because it is very difficult to see how it would.  Take a number of specimen cases and see what a quarter of the fair rent would be.  It is very difficult to know and then to decide as to whether a quarter of that was right or was not right.  Therefore, while I say there is a great deal to be said in favour of it, I am afraid I am not sufficiently satisfied that a rule-of-thumb would work out justly in all cases.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister one case.  In the Commission's report on this matter there was practically a standard case cited&mdash; a ground rent of £5 and a gross rent of £70.  The Commission gave as a figure in that case a new rent of £50. Seventeen pounds, ten shillings would be the quarter I am suggesting which is a very close approximation.  You cannot secure or guarantee by such a rule that everybody would be satisfied. In many cases the landlord would not secure any benefit at all.  I submitted this figure to Deputies on different sides, and I found that the general opinion was that a quarter was a very near guess to what was right and fair. I think the matter is sufficiently important <Col N="480" /> for the Minister to go very closely into to see if he could accede to this figure.</P>

      <P>In page 27, before Section 56 (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The notice of motion or other document originating an application to the court under this section shall contain a statement of the general character, and the number of the buildings proposed to be erected under the building lease for which such application is made.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Deputy Thrift suggested that in any building scheme which was going to be set up, or when land is being taken for building purposes, detailed specifications should be put in.  I pointed out at the time it would not be quite fair that the tenant would have to produce plans and specifications.  This <Col N="484" /> amendment provides for a general outline without specific details.  That is reasonable, so that the owner of the premises would have a general plan before him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 36:</P>
      <P>In page 28, before Section 57 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the landlord of a tenement fails or neglects to execute repairs to such tenement which he is bound by covenant, agreement, or otherwise by law to execute and has been called upon by the tenant of such tenement to execute, and such tenant executes such repairs at his own expense, such tenant may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the amount expended by him in the execution of such repairs is equal to or less than the amount of the next gale of the rent of such tenement accruing due after such expenditure, set-off the amount so expended, so far as it will extend, against such gale of rent, or</P>
      <P>(b)  where the amount so expended by such tenant exceeds the amount of such gale of rent, against such gale of rent and every succeeding gale of such rent until by means of such set-off the amount so expended is repaid to such tenant.</P>
      <P>(2)  where a set-off is made under this section against the whole or part of a gale of rent, the landlord entitled to receive such rent shall, on receiving evidence of the expenditure of the amount so set-off, be bound to give the like receipt for such gale of rent as he would be bound to give if such gale or the whole of such gale had been paid in money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment 36a by Deputy Lemass deals with the same question&mdash; that is, where the landlord has entered into a covenant with the tenant that he would keep the premises in repair and where he is not keeping them in correct repair.  The amendment I put forward deals with a case where the <Col N="485" /> landlord fails or neglects to execute repairs to the premises.  It is very necessary that the landlord would be bound to carry out his repairs when he is called upon by the tenant.  Deputy Lemass suggested that the tenant should go to the court and have an order from the court, and that then he would be at liberty to carry out the repairs, and, if he wishes, the local sanitary authority can be called upon to do it.  I do not know whether the Deputy would like me to put the case against his amendment before he would make the case for it himself.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment is preferable to mine in so far as it eliminates the court.

      <P>I am afraid that the latter part of the Deputy's amendment, where he suggests that the sanitary authority would come in, would be found unworkable.  The sanitary authority could not come in, because in the first place they would not have any money to do it.  They have no authority to raise money for this purpose.  I think, however, the powers of the sanitary authority in relation to that matter may be increased in the near future, but at present they have not the powers.  I think that the tenant would always be able to borrow the money necessary for the repairs to improve the house.  This could be charged upon the house.  I think the tenant could always borrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 8 (2), to add at the end of the sub-section the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  rules (in this Act referred to as rules regulating apprenticeship premiums) in relation to the fee, premium, or other consideration which may be taken in respect of the employment of a person by way of apprenticeship in such trade in such district.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like amendment 1 and amendment 6 looked at together.  On the last stage I was asked to deal with the matter of premiums that might be paid or exacted in respect of employment as an apprentice.  I think amendments 1 and 6, taken together, meet the point urged.  Under the first amendment the committee will be empowered to make rules in relation to the fee, premium or other consideration which may be taken in respect of the employment of a person by way of apprenticeship in such trade in such district.  Amendment 6 carries that further, and under the amendment it shall not be lawful for any person to take or receive any fee, premium, or other consideration in respect of the employment of any person by way of apprenticeship, unless the rules made by the apprenticeship committee are for the time being in force and the premium does not exceed the amount permitted by such rules to be taken as an apprenticeship premium.  If there is no rule there can be no such premium, <Col N="487" /> and if there is a rule the premium must be in accordance with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this a very faulty proposal.  It is not mandatory on the committee to make rules regarding fees; it is purely optional with the committee, and they can make rules if they like.  If they make no rules regarding apprenticeship fees no premium can be accepted.  Therefore from the time the trade has been designated, fees are illegal pending the publication of rules to regulate them. At the same time rules may be in force regulating the number of apprentices. You will then have a position which will possibly lead to considerable friction.  Big fees may have been the custom of a certain trade.  The apprenticeship committee may ultimately decide that substantial fees are justified.  In the interregnum, employers may have a grievance.  How about the apprentices they will engage during the period?  Supposing that fees are afterwards approved, the committee presumably cannot make its rules retrospective.  The rules both as to the number of apprentices and the fees may take six or twelve months to prepare. That period will be a lean period for apprentices.</P>
      <P>After a trade is designated, the first job is to proceed with the rules that are mandatory on the committee, and that task may take six or twelve months.  It may take another six or twelve months before the rules that are optional can be made, if ever they are made.  What is the position in trades where at the present time big fees are being paid?  Obviously there must be a complete change of system. The employers will not be at liberty to accept the fees of apprentices.  To my mind, the effect of the amendment will be to confuse to a very serious extent the apprenticeship system in certain trades.  It is not an amendment which has been seriously thought out. I suggest the Minister should reconsider it.  He can hardly have examined its implications or he would not have put it forward in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has forgotten the Bill, apparently.  His argument <Col N="488" /> would be all right if the system we were looking to establish was the system of one body acting in a superior way and quite apart from the employers and employees in any trade deciding on an apprenticeship system for that business.  But that is not the situation.  This Bill is founded on the voluntary principle.  The Deputy was rather against that, but that is the system we are looking to.  There has to be accommodation between the employers and employees in any business before a trade is designated.  We have the wish of both sets of people before a trade is designated.  In those circumstances they have to draw up rules.  I do not hold that the Deputy is quite accurate when he says that making the rules will occupy six or twelve months. They themselves will consider do they or do they not want premiums in a particular business.  If they do they have to make rules.  They know that from the moment they see this Act.  If they do not make rules, that follows on the decision that they do not want a premium.  If they do agree that premiums ought to be paid they will make rules.  Taken in that atmosphere it is quite a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is assuming that the existing employees or apprentices will be interested in this matter.  They may not.  They may have no concern as to whether future apprentices will pay fees.  Take the grocery or drapery business.  Up to the present, particularly in the case of apprentices kept indoor, they pay very substantial fees.  If that trade is designated it may be that under the rules eventually a substantial fee will be paid; but what about the interregnum period?  It means that boys and girls wanting to go to shop business will not be able to get anyone to take them. The employer will not be at liberty to take a fee, and he is not going to take an indoor apprentice without a fee; he will wait until the rules are made.  The individual employer will not be able to force the position.  The Committee may be slow, and it may take them a long time to come to a decision.  I do not think that is at all reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see eye <Col N="489" /> to eye with Deputy Moore in this matter. As far as I learn, there is a general feeling among people in the trade to do away with all fees and premiums of every kind.  That view was expressed here on the occasion of the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage.  It seems to me that the Minister's proposal does that in effect, unless both sides agree to have a fee. Unless there are rules made there will be no fee or premium.  If there are rules, that presupposes that both sides are agreeable to have a fee.  Solely on that basis the rules are made.  I think the Minister's amendment is acceptable inasmuch as it does away with the fee.  It is not left in the power of the employer to exact a fee in a designated trade unless both sides agree.  There is, as I say, a general feeling amongst workers generally that there should be no fee or premium.  This goes some distance, in any case, towards that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy O'Connell contemplate that employers who at the present time are getting fees of £50 and £100 with apprentices are going to sacrifice that gain voluntarily or without very considerable agitation through the Apprenticeship Committee? Does he not know that the representatives of the employers on the Committee will fight hard to keep up that system of paying fees?  Does he not realise that the employees on these Committees may not be very much interested in doing away with fees?  They will not be eager to see the trades swamped, and they may have as much interest as the employers in retaining the premium system. Furthermore, he should remember that the Minister is giving the option to the Apprenticeship Committee of fixing premiums.  Deputy O'Connell cannot believe that that privilege is being given without a chance of its being used.  There are certain trades where it will be used for certain.  It is inevitable that it will be availed of in certain trades.  What is to happen in the indefinite interregnum with regard to apprenticeship?   The employers obviously would not be eager to take on apprentices if they contemplate that by waiting three, six <Col N="490" /> or twelve months they would get a fee of £50 or £70.  You are therefore holding up the whole system of engaging apprentices.  Deputy O'Connell is allowing to run away with him the wish that he has to see fees abolished. I may share in that wish, but I am looking at the facts and he is going on sentiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken of employers in a particular trade who are receiving premiums and do not want to give that up.  Very good.  They need not give it up, because by holding out they need not have the trade designated.  Does the Deputy think that that meets part of his point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it cannot be carried.  I have stated that the policy with regard to it is that the Bill is based on the voluntary principle, and unless they are both in agreement there is not going to be a trade designated.  If there is a body of employers in any business likely to be designated who want premiums, who are determined to fight for them, in other words, are not likely to give them up, then they will certainly not agree to the trade being designated until they get accommodation on the matter of premiums.  That is the possible procedure, certainly, under the Bill.  Secondly, as to the point of time.  The Deputy says: Let us consider other conditions; employers and employees in any business; an agreement that there should be some premium; and on a definite bargain that there is going to be a rule made with regard to premiums they unite in a demand, or somebody puts it forward and the other party does not object, and there is a trade designate.  The Deputy's point is that there is a period to be covered&mdash;that it will take some time, whether six months or only six days, to get rules out, and that during that period the premium will be illegal.  That can be met at once, positing always goodwill, that it is based on the mind of two parties being ad idem on a particular matter.  They <Col N="491" /> can immediately establish a rule allowing the maximum premium, whatever is the maximum in the business.  They can always arrive at it by regulation. If the Deputy imagines a group of warring people, some of whom do not want the apprenticeship system and some who do, and a designate trade forced on them against their will, undoubtedly there might be hardship.</P>
      <P>That, however, is not the atmosphere in which the thing ought to be considered. The whole thing is voluntary. There may be an odd individual who objects.  In general, unless there is something approaching unanimity, there is not going to be a designation of a trade.  There is room for bargaining within that, and I do not think that difficulties would arise.</P>

      <P>The only reason we can pass this amendment is on the likelihood that everything will go peacefully after the trade is designated, that the Committee will be harmonious, almost unanimous with regard to premiums, and so there will be no unreasonable delay, and that all sides will agree that apprentices can be accepted on payment of fees.  I think the Minister has just mentioned that fees can be fixed subject to subsequent adjustment. That would be illegal under the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That opens up a very big question.  There is a desire in certain trades to limit the number of employees and the number of apprentices coming into the industry.  There is a desire also on the part of some employers to retain the premium principle. There may be an arrangement made by such an Apprenticeship Committee that will meet the views of both parties.  By raising the premium you will certainly limit the number of apprentices.  Is that desirable in view of the large number of unemployed young people?</P>

    <Col N="493" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered the first point of the Deputy. The second point is that the Deputy fears that dealing with premiums may result in limiting the number of employees in any business.  If this amendment is not inserted there is much greater freedom to deal with premiums than if it is inserted.  This is a restrictive amendment.  This prohibits premiums unless there is a rule about them.  If this amendment is not put in, the Committee is entirely free.  It need not make rules, and in the absence of rules a premium can be charged and exacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted something that would improve the existing situation. There are a great many defects in the existing situation.  We had hoped that this Bill would clear away many of these defects.  It seems to me that it is not going to achieve that object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  I am dealing with this single point of the premium that may be taken.  I should like to try and relieve Deputy Moore's mind once more.  He says that there is a possibility of quarrelling.  I want to know on what?  Is it on whether there should be a premium allowed or not?  If that is the point, I say it can be met right at the start.  Supposing employers want to get a premium from apprentices.  If this Bill becomes law, in its amended state, they are faced with this, that unless they can get from the employees an agreement that afterwards there will be rules made and sent up to me for approval dealing with premiums, premiums will be illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will look for agreement on that point.  If they get it, they can agree and join in so that the trade should be designated and see that the undertaking is honourably carried out.  If they fail, and do not agree to have the trade designated, it will not be designated. Let me get back to the first point.  They have got an agreement with the employees that they should make rules with regard to premiums. The undertaking comes to be carried out.  The Deputy referred to the fact that some time would elapse and that <Col N="494" /> within that time premiums paid would be illegal and could be recovered.  My answer, again positing agreement, is that if the representatives of the employers and employees have agreed, rules must be made making legitimate this payment.  They can start to make rules, see what was the highest premium paid, and regularise it.  We will have to see what is the maximum payment we should allow in all the circumstances of the business.  They can put up a case for that and it has to be ruled upon.  Representations can be made to the Minister when the case is put before him for confirmation, that there was agreement and that otherwise certain employers would not come in.  That has to be taken into consideration.  There is power always to undo the designation of a trade.  I do not think the difficulty is going to arise, and I do not think that the Deputy can have any fears when he thinks of the circumstances under which this Bill is going to operate, being based on agreement clearly and definitely.  I admit that there may be an individual who wants a premium where the generality of the trade do not.  Certainly that man is going to be crushed out by the general trade feeling.  We would not let one or two people, by obstructive tactics, prevent a trade being designated.  Say that a considerable number want premiums, they must get them or they can prevent this Act applying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Minister contemplates that the question of fees will be discussed before the demand for designation is made to him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you assume that?  After all, there may be one hundred reasons for the demand for designation of a trade, and that matter may never enter into the question at all.  The request for designation may come from a big number of employees, and from employers who do not keep apprentices at all, or if they keep apprentices, only keep one per shop, and perhaps do not get fees, whereas there may be a number who are at present getting big fees who will be <Col N="495" /> opposed to designation, and the Minister may have to over-ride their wishes in agreeing to designation.  The assumption that the question of fees and rules to govern fees will be practically settled before designation takes place, is too big an assumption for me. I do not think the Bill as it stands allows such things as maximum and minimum fees.  As far as I remember that part of the Bill, there will have to be standard fees.  At all events, I think the Minister can hardly be satisfied that it is a satisfactory way of settling this question.  Probably there is no question that would cause more friction in certain trades, because, as I mentioned on a previous stage of the Bill, there are employers who are at present making a good yearly income out of fees from apprentices, and they are going to stick out as hard as they can in order to retain these fees.  I can see the possibility in certain trades of very prolonged discussions and very considerable friction before any satisfactory arrangement is arrived at with regard to the fees that will be considered reasonable for the trade as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said anything about maximum and minimum premiums.  The scheme I have in mind is that in order to get over the difficulty about a certain point of time elapsing for the legitimatising of premiums, the apprenticeship committee may say, &ldquo;That will be allowed.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; is used because amendment 6 says that if there are rules made allowing premiums then if premiums are exacted they must be within the amount allowed.  That is the only use I made of the word &ldquo;maximum.&rdquo;  But they can appoint a premium at any time, and can reduce that by amendment of the rules later. The Deputy said that possibly they will not discuss whether premiums should be allowed or not before the application is made or agreement come to in regard to designating a trade. I conceive that that will be always settled before that.  Ordinarily speaking, the question of premiums will arise before the event of seeking for <Col N="496" /> designation in a trade in which a premium is already a known thing.  I can conceive it arising afterwards in a trade where premiums are unknown. It will generally arise with regard to a trade where the premium idea is known.  There are certain employers in the business who know they are in receipt of these fees, and I think we can rely on them to see that the matter is threshed out and some accommodation got before they assent to the designation of the trade at all.  I put forward these amendments.  I am not in love with them.  I did not bring them in originally.  They were not in the Bill.  I wanted a certain amount of freedom with regard to this.  There seemed to me to be expressed on the Committee Stage a very strong point of view that the premium system should be controlled, and I think the idea of controlling it was with a view to seeing it disappear.  The amendment, while not making it disappear and while showing no tendency that way, does control it, because it makes premiums illegal unless rules are made, and after the rules are made, unless premiums are in accordance with the rules.  I leave it to the House.  I am not in love with it.</P>

      <P>No.  The amendment dealing with premiums only relates to trades which are designated trades.  The scheme of the Bill is that a trade will not be designated, and that the whole conditions under apprenticeship law will not apply unless there is a pretty general agreement between employers and employees in that trade.</P>

If they are not rendered illegal by any other legislation&mdash;and <Col N="497" /> I do not think they are&mdash;this Bill will not touch them unless they are being paid under what is to be known as designated trades.  They will be legal except in designated trades.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister saying that if this amendment is carried it will have the effect of making the premium system disappear. Deputy Moore said a number of things with regard to the question of premiums, but he did not make it clear to my mind whether he was in favour of or against that system.  He said that certain employers were making a certain income from premiums.  I know that some years ago, in the drapery trade, certain employers&mdash;I am glad to know that it has disappeared in Dublin &mdash;charged premiums to apprentices and made them work long hours without any wages.</P>
      <P>In other words they were paying the employers and in addition were getting no remuneration whatever. I understand that even at present in the hairdressing trade in Dublin premiums amounting to £50 and £60 are charged.  As far as that particular trade is concerned the employers are getting the services of these people, and instead of paying them a wage they are getting paid themselves.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he hoped that this particular system would disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was any need for me because this question of premiums is a world in itself.  I was not one of those who expressed the wish in the previous discussion that the question of premiums should be brought under control. That in itself would be a very big question for this House to tackle, and I was not prepared to deal with it as an aside on a big general Bill of this character.  If the House ever comes to deal with the question of <Col N="498" /> premiums it will have very many things to consider.  I do not know how Deputy Cassidy or anybody else could abolish premiums in the case of indoor apprentices to shop business. At the present time that constitutes a very big part of the apprenticeship system.  I do not know how young people are going to be brought in, kept in a house, boarded and looked after when they will be of very little use to an employer for at least twelve months.  I do not know how that is going to be settled when we bear in mind what prevails at present.  I think a change like that, where you drop a £60 fee for young people who are taken in as apprentices, is not going to be effected by the mere passing of a Bill of this kind.  Other considerations will enter into the matter.  If the idea be that youths of seventeen and eighteen are, on their merits going to be accepted voluntarily by employers as apprentices in their businesses then it means that certain youths are not going to get into any workshop or business in the country.  It means that they will be kicked out the moment they apply. We have not yet decided, if we pass this Bill, that at the same time we are going to pass another Bill providing for equality of means as between every family and equality of income as between every individual in the country.  I do not think that either Deputy Cassidy or Deputy O'Connell would be right in saying that it was a wrong system that parents with big means should as an inducement to an employer pay him a big fee to take their boys and girls into his business.  If the House were to do away with that system it would simply be creating a very big problem with regard to hundreds of youths in the country.  Youths who have grown up to the age of seventeen or eighteen with no aptitude for anything in particular and who have shown no disposition towards regular work, will be severely handicapped if, notwithstanding the assistance which their parents or friends can give them, they are deprived of the opportunity of getting into a workshop or business where possibly they may be reformed and may cultivate a taste for business. <Col N="499" /> I am not prepared at the moment to go into this question of premiums for apprentices, though if we were discussing it I might be as eager as anyone else to abolish the principle.</P>

      <P>The doctrine that Deputy Moore has preached is a most extraordinary one.  He suggests that youths who grow up with no aptitude for business ought to be able to get into some kind of business simply because their parents or friends, as he said, are able to give them assistance. But if the parents were not in a position to give them that assistance, then they would never have any chance of getting into business.  I think if there are other people who are apt and well qualified but whose parents are not in the position to pay a heavy fee for them, they ought to be entitled to claim that an employer would take them on, that is if they give promise of becoming good craftsmen, in preference to those who have no aptitude but whose parents are able to pay for them.  I think it would be much better if we had that position than the one Deputy Moore speaks of.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get as many trades as possible designated under the Act.  The more you insist on the apprenticeship committees doing things such as have been suggested, attending to premiums and so on, the more impediments you are putting in the way of trades coming within the scope of the Bill.  I feel inclined to vote against the amendment.  If the premium business is an objectionable feature of life it can be settled in another way.  I do not think it can be settled in this way.  I know that the Labour Deputies have strong feelings about this, but I ask them to consider this, that what ought to be aimed at is to get as many trades as possible designated.  The more duties that you throw on the committees the more points that they have to make orders about, the less chance they are going <Col N="500" /> to have of getting the co-operation and good-will of both employers and employees in asking for a trade to be designated. For that reason I think the amendment is slightly dangerous.</P>

      <P>In connection with this I would like to point out that we must not lose sight of the desire, at least I take it that it was the desire of the Minister, in introducing this Bill, to break down some of the difficulties that confront some young people at the moment in getting into industrial life.  We have not the numbers going into industry that we should have.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind the Minister of the Census Report issued by his own Department a couple of months ago.  It is based on the 1926 Census. In Volume 5, Part 2, it is stated: &ldquo;The proportion of our boys&rdquo;&mdash;that is in the Free State&mdash;&ldquo;of 16 and 17 years of age, who have no gainful occupation is 28 per cent.  It is three times as much as in Scotland where it is only 8 per cent. or in England and Wales where it is 9 per cent.&rdquo;  Then the Report proceeds: &ldquo;The proportion of our girls of the same age who have not yet secured employment is 55 per cent.  It is twice as great as in Scotland where it is 26 per cent. or England where it is 29 per cent.&rdquo; If we have these large numbers of young people of apprenticeship age unemployed it is quite obvious that there are some difficulties existing in this country which does not exist in other countries, and that there is not the same opportunity for these boys and girls getting into industrial employment as there is in other countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in those that are here, there is not the number of apprentices. If we want to improve that position we want to break down these barriers.  That, I understand, was the object the Minister had in view in introducing this Bill which was recommended in the Report of the <Col N="501" /> Commission on Technical Education&mdash; recommended for that particular object, so as to improve the avenues leading to industrial employment for our young people.  I want to point out to the Minister that if he is going to maintain these barriers, he is not going to improve the avenues of employment, and we are not going to get the additional number of young people into industrial occupations that we would like to see.  If these matters are all going to be left to committees to arrange and to report to the Minister, so that the Minister may adopt these recommendations, then I say we are not going to improve the situation.  As I visualise the situation, if the employers want to maintain large premiums and if the representatives of the workers want to keep down the numbers going into industry, then it is easy for these parties to join in keeping up the premium and limiting the numbers in that way.  That is not what I might call the large object.  That is not the way in which the House should look upon the measure.  In other words, if it is desirable to get employment for these young people and to continue the principle of these premiums, let us come to a decision on that point.</P>

      <P>I am with Deputy O'Connell that it is not desirable that there should be these large premiums, because they limit employment very considerably.  I think we should express an opinion to that effect on this Bill, and not leave it to the Committee. If we leave it to the Committee, we are only going to perpetuate the existing system rather than improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the feeling that because we are so long away from the Committee Stage of the Bill, Deputies have forgotten the scheme of the Bill.  Deputy Good makes the point that the House ought to determine and not leave it to the Committee this question of whether premiums should be payable or not. <Col N="502" /> That does not get us very far.  Supposing the House makes up its mind that it is not going to allow the payment of apprentices' premiums, how far is that going to carry us? The only effect of such a decision will be that in any trade in which a premium was payable the employers, knowing that you are going to have such a decision, will not ask to have the trade designated, and the Bill will not come into force in regard to that trade.  You cannot deal with the question of premiums as a general thing.  You can only deal with it in regard to designated trades.  We are going very much outside the Bill if we tackle the question of premiums irrespective of whether trades are going to be designated or not.  If the House says that the premium system is going to be abolished, to my mind you end all likelihood of trades, to which premiums have been paid, coming within the scope of the Bill.  The employers will object to designation of the trade, and the whole thing will lapse.  I think most Deputies in the House have forgotten that in the scheme of the Bill, as outlined in Section 2 of the Bill as introduced, it was provided that there would not be a designation of a trade unless groups representative of the employers and employees applied.</P>
      <P>I pointed out whether that clause remained in the Bill or not that the voluntary side of the scheme, the voluntary system, as necessitated by what occurs later on in the Bill in regard to Apprenticeship Committees, because if the employers do not want to work under the Bill, they can refuse to sit on the Apprenticeship Committees, and the clause fails, I would like the House to take a decision on the premium question in designated trades.  This is a dangerous amendment, because if inserted, it would prevent trades that in the ordinary course would be designated from being designated.  Obviously you are going to prevent them, if you put in this handicap with regard to the premium.</P>

The Deputy is undoubtedly correct in what he says, that to a certain extent the decision is given to the committee, but I do not think there is going to be any great hardship inflicted. Again, we have to take concrete circumstances.  A boy apprentices himself to a certain employer, who becomes bankrupt or dies.  That boy has some sort of contract.  He wants to have continuity under that contract.  The Bill provides that the committee may, if it thinks fit, release both parties from their respective obligations under the agreement implied by the section or modify the agreement. Then, it is proposed to add the <Col N="506" /> words &ldquo;or transfer the benefits and obligations of such employer under such agreement to another employer carrying on in such district such trade.&rdquo;  It is hardly likely that an Apprenticeship Committee, composed of representatives of both parties, will act in any very arbitrary way.  They will always have to rule according to circumstances.  The apprentice may want to go to a particular employer who does not want him or has not room for another apprentice.  The whole trend of the amendment is to benefit the apprentice, but there is the possibility of hardship to which the Deputy alludes.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where any rules made by an apprenticeship committee under this Act are for the time being in force it shall not be lawful for any person to do any act or thing whereby an employer carrying on in the district of such committee the designated trade for which such committee is established is prevented from or obstructed or impeded in complying with such rules.</P>

It is a quite clear, and Deputy Good ought to be honest about it, that it is aimed at trade unions.  It is aimed at preventing trade union interference in any way no matter what the practice or custom of the trade may be once the rules are made.

The amendment seeks to effect that where any rules made by an Apprenticeship Committee under this Act are for the time being in force, it shall not be lawful for any person to do any act or thing whereby an employer carrying on in the district of such Committee the designated trade for which such Committee is established is prevented from or obstructed or impeded in complying with such rules.  There is a penalty attached for impeding or obstructing.  There has to be first of all a designated trade, and there have to be rules made by the Apprenticeship Committee.  When these two things are done, if this amendment is carried it will make illegal certain acts that might be done preventing or impeding the employer from doing what is required by the Apprenticeship Committee, and it establishes a penalty.  I stress the fact of the designated trade, and I stress the rules to make the amendment more concrete.  Let me say what I said on a previous amendment.   A trade will not be designated unless the employers and the employees have in the main agreed that the trade should be brought within the scope of the apprenticeship.  When that has been done representatives of the employers and employees sit down and make rules.  What may they make rules about&mdash;Declaring that the employment of certain people in a specified way shall be employment for the purposes of the Act; relating to the period of employment; laying down regulations with regard to the minimum rates of wages; deciding with regard to the maximum number of hours, and they may go on to make rules about educational qualifications; the ages <Col N="509" /> of entry for apprenticeship; the training of apprentices; the burden upon the employer, and the number of apprentices to other people in employment. The Deputy's amendment seeks to impose a penalty on anybody who prevents an employer carrying out his duty under these rules made by a Committee, on which employers and employees will be represented in equal numbers in relation to a trade which has been designated because there is consent both of employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Is there anything unreasonable in asking that it should be declared illegal to prevent any employer from carrying out his duties under these rules and put a penalty on anybody who tries to prevent him?</P>

      <P>I have long since come to the conclusion that the Minister and his Department are going to make this Act a dead letter.  His speech on the discussion of the first amendment made it quite clear that it was the intention <Col N="510" /> not to apply the Act at all except in circumstances never likely to arise.  His speech now makes it equally clear that he is anxious to kill this Apprenticeship Act before it gets a chance of coming into operation.  He knows that the section which imposes a £20 fine on anybody who goes on strike is not going to apply.</P>
      <P>He knows that the opposition which has already come from the employers' side to the designation of a trade will be reinforced by opposition from the workers' side, and it seems to me since this Bill came to the Committee Stage that the Minister's whole purpose has been to kill the Bill, and it would be better if he withdrew it decently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I call the attention first of Deputies to the fact that Part III of this Act is entitled &ldquo;The leasing of State mines and minerals,&rdquo; whereas Part IV deals with &ldquo;The grant of rights in non-State mines and minerals.&rdquo;  The headings of these two sections of the Bill show the two main divisions of the clauses.  The Bill is necessitated on account of the provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution. Part III deals with the difficulties that have been encountered in connection with Article 11 of the Constitution. Portion of Article 11 reads: &ldquo;All the lands and waters, mines and minerals, within the territory of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) hitherto vested in the State, or any department thereof, or held for the public use or benefit&rdquo; ... and a variety of other things shall &ldquo;belong to the Irish Free State&rdquo; ...</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And shall be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation.&rdquo;  The Article goes on to state &ldquo;... the same shall not, nor shall any part thereof, be alienated, but may in the public interest be from time to time granted by way of lease or licence to be worked or enjoyed under the authority and subject to the control of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That Article would include such mines and minerals as come into the State possession under or through the agency of the Irish Land Commission by reason of land purchase under many of the Acts, and also would include any mines of gold and silver.  Part III of this Bill also deals with those things which have been declared to be mines and minerals in the possession of the State.  The Bill gives the legislation which is required by the Article; the legislation under which a lease may be granted, and this State property enjoyed and worked under the control and subject to the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of Part III is the operative section as far as these State <Col N="513" /> mines and minerals are concerned. Section 10 enacts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If in the opinion of the Minister it is in the public interest that any State mines and minerals or any exclusive State mining right should be granted by way of lease to any person, the Minister may, under and in accordance with this Part of this Act, demise such State mines and minerals or exclusive State mining right to such person by way of lease for such term not exceeding ninety-nine years as the Minister shall think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 of the Bill by definition State mines and minerals are extended for the purpose of Section 10 to mean not only such mines and minerals as were in the possession of the State at the passing of the Constitution, but any that have since come into its possession.  Correspondingly, Clause B of sub-section (1) of Section 2 takes away from the Land Commission the power it had of disposing of any mines and minerals it had possession of, a right which incidentally has been in abeyance since the passing of the Constitution because such disposal was prohibited until legislation was passed allowing the disposal of these rights.  Section 12 dealing with State property is extended by Section 4.  Section 12 gives the Minister also power to enter upon such lands for the purpose of experimenting, to make such experiments (including borings) as in his opinion appear necessary or desirable.  Section 13 indicates, &ldquo;wherever any damage has been done by entry to State lands or by any of the operations stated in Section 13 the person exercising such right, including the Minister, in an exclusive State right of mining or by searching for and taking State mines and minerals must pay compensation.&rdquo; The compensation terms are set out in Part 7 of the Bill.  Clause 38 is the directing section.  &ldquo;The amount of compensation under this Act shall, in default of agreement, be determined by the Board in the manner provided by this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two section I should advert to in connection with payment <Col N="514" /> of compensation.  Section 40, sub-section (5) states :&mdash;&ldquo;Where any award in relation to land for the time being subject to a land purchase annuity provides for the payment of any moneys to the Irish Land Commission, upon payment thereof to the Irish Land Commission such moneys shall be applied by the Irish Land Commission as they think fit in discharge of the arrears (if any) of such annuity and towards the redemption of such annuity or in either of the said ways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another section indicates that where compensation is awarded, and where the Land Commission annuity is payable, some portion of the compensation may be used to redeem portion of the land annuity.  The basis of the consideration for that is that as the damage done to the lands may to some degree weaken the security, therefore, the annuity to that extent should be redeemed.  Section 14 is also in connection with the compensation side of this measure.  I now direct attention mainly to lines 5 to 12 on page 8.  Under the old Land Purchase Acts, where property passed from the owner, and where the mineral rights were reserved to the Land Commission, if afterwards the Land Commission sold these, the law was that 25 per cent, of the rents and royalties received had to be paid to the owner.  Later legislation, such as the Land Act of 1903, determined that where land passed and where mineral rights were reserved, that the owner should get such rights as the Oireachtas would determine.  We propose to determine in sub-section (1) of Section 14 that an equivalent 25 per cent. be paid in relation to the rent or royalties derived from the sale of minerals from land that passed under the 1903 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>Does the Minister mean by owner the original landlord?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases it would be.  I can see exceptions to that, but that would be the answer generally.  Part III is the part which deals with State property, and legislation is required under Article 11 for the enjoyment of rights given in State property.  The main sections deal <Col N="515" /> with property covered and with regard to the terms and conditions of compensation.</P>
      <P>It has often been represented that there is valuable mineral wealth underneath the soil which is in private ownership, and that, for some reason or another, either because a number of owners would have to combine for the purpose of working or because some owner has held out and will not allow the work, or for a variety of reasons, that valuable mineral property is unworked.  We are trying to deal with that in Sections 4, 5 and 6.  Sections 17 and 18 are important sections in connection with this matter.  Section 17, in a series of sub-sections, sets out that grants variously described as grant of mining rights may be made in relation to these minerals.  The first three sub-sections describe the rights in various ways and the description given, to some extent, reveals the reason why the right has been granted.</P>
      <P>If Deputies will look at the two concluding lines in each of these sub-sections they will see &ldquo;a mining (proprietor's) right to work such minerals&rdquo;; &ldquo;a mining (small parcels) right to work first-mentioned minerals&rdquo;; and the third has it &ldquo;a mining (area) right to work the remainder of such minerals.&rdquo;  The three points made in the three sections are these :&mdash;The first refers to the difficulty encountered where minerals are comprised in or lying under land subject to a lease or otherwise, and are otherwise incapable of being worked without the concurrence of two or more persons.  Then we decide that we can grant to one person that right, and that not only over his own land, but over the others.  The second sub-section deals with cases where minerals are owned in such small parcels that they cannot be properly or conveniently worked by themselves, but that one enterprising person may work them. Then we can give to one of these the right to work these small parcels on their own lands and on the lands adjacent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third sub-section is different. This points to where there is a likelihood that minerals in a certain area will be left permanently unworked by <Col N="516" /> reason of the fact that they are in small parcels and that they are spread over a large area.  The intention is to bring these under one working.  Sub-section (4) is most important.  That sub-section says that &ldquo;where in the opinion of the Minister, minerals are not being worked, or are not being worked efficiently, and no satisfactory reason is shown by the person having an interest therein to the Minister for not working such minerals or for not working such minerals efficiently, the Minister may, subject to and in accordance with this Part of the Act, grant to any person who desires, either by himself or through his lessees, to work such minerals a right (in this Part of this Act referred to as a mining (unworked minerals) right) to work such minerals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I point to that as being the greatest invasion of private property that we propose to make in this Bill.  It is not for any specific reason, such as the difficulty in working a small parcel, but simply because it appears that the minerals are not being worked rightly, and this right may be granted to anyone not necessarily an adjoining owner. This is all subject to conditions that follow afterwards.</P>
    <P>Section 18 goes on to refer to ancillary rights.  It is the necessary complement to what is being done under Section 17 that where any facility, right or privilege is required in order that minerals may be properly and conveniently worked, there is power given that those ancillary rights should be granted.</P>
    <P>Section 34 indicates in a general way the point of view that has been taken about this.  Section 34 might be paraphrased by saying that what happens is this: One makes an owner compulsorily grant a lease.  We do it for him.  What is to be done in the conditions is, as if there were a willing lessor or lessee or grantor or grantee. You can give no more than the grantor would have given or that the grantee would get acting on his own from the private owner.</P>
    <P>We say you must grant certain rights and they are hedged about with certain conditions.  We enforce upon the owner the necessity of granting the rights that are described in Sections <Col N="517" /> 17 and 18.  Viewing the thing in that way, of course, it is obvious that if a willing grantor was given certain rights payment would have to be made and so this compensation falls to be paid. Before you pass away from this I want to refer to certain terms and conditions. Section 22 refers to some of these.  Reference was made to a Mining Board, of which I will speak in a moment.  When a report is sent in then the Minister is to consider it.  He is to grant it, provided that various conditions and terms have been kept, and it is made clear that it is in the public interest that such rights should be granted to the applicant.  In that event these rights may be granted subject to such conditions and for such a period as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>The compensation terms to which I have referred are dealt with in Section 40.  Section 38 will again have effect here:</P>
    <P>The amount of compensation under this Act shall, in default of agreement, be determined by the Board in the manner provided by this part of this Act.</P>
    <P>Claims of compensation may be made under Section 40 by any person claiming to be entitled to such compensation. Section 46 is more or less a term of reference to the Board with regard to the assessment of compensation:</P>
    <P>The Board in assessing compensation ... shall assess the same on the basis of what would be fair and reasonable between a willing grantor and a willing grantee having regard to the conditions subject to which such right is granted.</P>
    <P>Other safeguards of the type I have referred to are mentioned in Sections 19, 21 and 22 and a variety of sections follows indicating that there may be revocation, modification and so forth.  The Mining Board is described in Part II.&mdash;the constitution of it, its members and so on, and the qualifications that have to be possessed.  I want to point out that the Board has separate functions in relation to State mines and minerals and in relation to the granting of rights in connection with mines and minerals that do not belong to the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> In connection with State mines and minerals, the Board acts purely in an advisory capacity.  It is for the Minister to refer to the Board applications made and arguments put up. The Minister must take into consideration a report from the Board and any other considerations presented to him; but the Board has no judicial function&mdash;no function of determining in relation to State mines and minerals. That is for the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Finance.  The Board has a judicial capacity when it comes to the assessment of compensation and payment for rights.  The Board has also a judicial capacity in relation to the granting of these rights of non-State mines and minerals.  In relation to the leasing of State mines and minerals, the Board has not the final say.  It is purely an advisory body for that purpose.  It is the Minister, acting in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, who determines in that respect.  The big question of whether a lease is to be granted, and the conditions or terms upon which the lease is to be granted, is entirely a matter for the Minister. That is the big difference we make as between the granting of leases of State mines and minerals and the granting of rights in property that does not belong to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In what section is reference made to the Board's functions with regard to State mines and minerals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of the sections which refer to compensation do refer to the Mining Board because all matters of compensation are to be settled by the Board.  Under the section dealing with State mines and minerals liability to pay compensation for the damage and the amount of money to be paid for the damage will be referred to the Board.  I am stressing rather the opposite point, that as far as the leasing of State mines and minerals is concerned, we recommend by this piece of legislation that that should be left to the Minister, acting with the Minister for Finance.  The Mining Board is not going to be the <Col N="519" /> determining factor as far as whether or not a lease is to be given in such mines and minerals; that determination rests with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The other parts of this Bill are somewhat general.  Part 8 is miscellaneous and rather general in its terms.  Sections 49 and 50 are for the purpose of ensuring that information should be given to my own Department with regard to certain minerals.  Section 51 has power with regard to fencing, a matter which has often been complained of but which we take to ourselves here.  In Section 52 we make a partial repeal of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, an Act which never had any great operation in this country.  It is one that consolidates powers within a particular Department.</P>
      <P>That is the scheme of the Bill. There is one other matter that ought to be referred to.  As regards Section 3, the explanation of it is that questions in relation to exclusive mining rights are to be determined in a particular way by reference to the Irish Land Commission exclusive of the Judicial Commissioner, with an appeal from that Board to the Judicial Commissioner. That is necessary.  When I was reading it I left out certain portions of Article 11.  If I may stress another portion of the Article now, it goes on to say:</P>
      <P>All the lands and waters, mines and minerals, within the territory of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) hitherto vested in the State, or any department thereof, or held for the public use or benefit, and also all the natural resources of the same territory (including the air and all forms of potential energy), and also all royalties and franchises within that territory shall ... belong to the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).</P>
      <P>These words followed:</P>
      <P>subject to any trusts, grants, leases or concessions then existing in respect thereof,</P>
      <P>&mdash;matters that can be fairly easily determined&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>or any valid private interest therein, <Col N="520" /> and shall be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation...</P>
    <P>Under the various Land Purchase Acts a variety of circumstances might have occurred.  Certain things passed from the ownership of the landlord, sometimes to the tenant and sometimes they passed away from the landlord and remained in the possession of the Land Commission.  There are certain things described as stone, gravel, sand, and clay and they distinctly passed to the tenant but it has not yet been determined clearly by any judicial decision what the four words comprise. This Bill does not determine and will not set out to determine whether there is in any piece of property that appears to belong to the State any existing valid title.  If any question of that sort arises, particularly in respect of land under the old Land Purchase Acts&mdash;if the legal question arises&mdash;we leave that to the Land Commission exclusive of the Judicial Commissioner, reserving him as the court of appeal.</P>
    <P>This will not clear up some of the difficulties which hitherto have been experienced in connection with Article 11, but it does go some way towards determining what is the right and the wrong.  It is quite clear if people had an incentive to work minerals in a particular piece of property and, after this Bill was made law, approached my Department with a view to getting a lease, there would not be much good in such people getting a lease unless they were pretty certain of their rights, that the property had been gripped by Article 11 and is properly administered by this Act as being previously gripped by that Article.  We would have to have some method of getting judicial decision and that will arise in a great many cases by a simple action in court. On certain of these things, if any question arises, then the Minister may refer such questions to the Land Commission for determination with an appeal eventually to the Judicial Commissioner and, further, an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I stress that because at one time we <Col N="521" /> had considered defining these four words, &ldquo;gravel, sand, clay, etc.&rdquo;  We had also at one time considered defining what these words, &ldquo;valid private interests subsisting therein&rdquo; might mean, but the difficulty we were in then was that we might possibly have been changing property rights without having any appreciation of the circumstances that surround any of these rights.  We feel the best thing to do is to have a Bill which gives the legislation required under Article 11; leaving out for judicial determination any matter which is yet undetermined and which would properly fall to be determined by a judicial tribunal.</P>
    <P>The framework of the Bill is as I have described it.  Section 3 deals with State mines and minerals, giving power to lease to the Minister. Sections 4, 5 and 6 deal with certain rights we feel we ought to have the power to grant in property not belonging to the State for the purpose of getting mineral wealth efficiently and properly worked.  We surround all that with certain reservations and conditions, and in all cases where damage is done or property passes we allow for the payment of compensation, for the passage of money.  But the framework we have arrived at after a great deal of consideration is simply, if the House accepts it, that the Minister is to decide in one case, and the Mining Board to decide in the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one which can be more adequately discussed in Committee than on Second Reading. To the general principle of the Bill, if I might call it such, very little exception can be taken.  It is our view that the powers which the Minister proposes to acquire under the Bill are powers that, generally speaking, he should have, and our main complaint is that he has been very slow in acquiring them.  That applies particularly to the power given in Part IV, to grant rights in non-State mines and minerals.  It has been stated, and I believe it to be true, that there are a number of places in the country where minerals are not being worked because the persons now possessing the rights to work them do not desire that the deposit shall be developed.  If the <Col N="522" /> Minister is now taking on himself the power to grant the right to work these minerals to other persons, we hope that he is not doing so merely for the purpose of window-dressing, but with the very definite intention in mind of exercising that right when he has secured it.  The mineral resources of this country may not be very great, but such as they are we should make the most of them.  If their development has been impeded by the absence of this legislation, then we hope that the Minister will make up for the delay in its introduction by using it ruthlessly when it has been enacted.  We do not consider that the powers he has taken to interfere in the working of non-State mines and minerals are anything too drastic. The only fear that we have in respect to them is that the Minister may not be as determined as we would like him to be to use these powers when he has secured them.</P>
      <P>There are only a few remarks I wish to make concerning the general structure of the Bill.  Most of the matters that arise out of it in respect of which amendment may be required can be discussed much more satisfactorily when the Bill is before us in Committee.  The first impression I received on reading over the Bill was that it was a typical product of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I can visualise the Minister on receiving the Bill from the draftsman's office going through it with a blue pencil and everywhere he found the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; striking it out and substituting the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  He seems to have been very careful to prevent any definite obligation being left upon him to do anything and to ensure that everything would be left to his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To such an extent did he carry that carefulness that he has, I think, succeeded in making the Bill appear ridiculous in some particulars.  He has just referred to Section 3, which relates to the determination of questions in relation to exclusive mining rights.  The section says that if any question arises as to whether an exclusive mining right has or has not been vested in the Land Commission or in Sáorstát Eíreann, the Minister <Col N="523" /> may refer that question to the Land Commission for determination.  What happens if the Minister does not refer it to the Land Commission?  If there is a question to be settled, and the Minister, in the exercise of the discretion which he is giving himself in the wording of the section, does not refer it to the Land Commission, what happens?  Why is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; there and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?  Further down in the same section, sub-section (4) says &ldquo;The Irish Land Commission may make rules regulating proceedings before the Irish Land Commission and appeals to the Judicial Commissioner under this section.&rdquo;  What happens if the Land Commission does not make the rules?  Can proceedings be taken before it or before the Judicial Commissioner?  On the other side we see that the Minister may by order make regulations in relation to proceedings before the Board, the times and places of the sittings of the Board, the persons to whom, and the times and manner in which notices of the sittings of the Board shall be given, the admission or exclusion of the public, or any other matter in relation to the practice and procedure of the Board the Minister may consider to be necessary.  What happens if the Minister does not make regulations? Can the Board operate if the Minister, in the exercise of that discretion which he insisted upon keeping, decides not to make any regulations at all?</P>
    <P>We can go through the Bill section by section and point to quite a number of cases in which the Minister has given himself the power to make the entire Bill inoperative if he wants to do so.  One of the main faults, however, that I find with this Bill is in relation to Part 3&mdash;leasing of State mines and minerals.  I am sure Deputies who read it were struck by the fact that no provision is contained therein for submission to the Dáil of particulars of any leases of State mines which are granted.  In the State Lands Act provision is made for placing on the Table of the Dáil particulars of all leases of State lands and the Dáil has power, if it so decides, to annul any such leases <Col N="524" /> by resolution.  Surely a provision of that kind, which is considered necessary or desirable in relation to State lands should also exist in relation to State mines or mining rights? I am quite certain it is not an oversight on the part of the Minister, but a definite decision on his part to prevent the Dáil acquiring that power if he can.  We want to know the motives that led him to make that decision.</P>
    <P>One of the major matters arising is in connection with Section 14, and the Minister has drawn attention to this Section, which provides that where a mining right is vested in this State under the Land Act of 1903 or the Land Act of 1923 or this Bill, and a lease of that mining right is given by the Minister, there shall be paid to the former owner of the land 25 per cent. of the rent or purchase money received by the State in respect of the mining right, less whatever expenses are incurred by the State in experimenting or in the payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>I want to know what claim can be advanced for that royalty of 25 per cent. to the former owner of an estate who sold it to the Land Commission, and who, at the time of the sale, did not know that there were minerals under it.  It seems to me that such an owner can advance no claim in equity at all, and that it is a foolish proposition to ask the Dáil to agree to give that owner a claim in perpetuity to 25 per cent. of the income of the estate in respect of the minerals of which he was not aware.  The same would apply, I think, to minerals the existence of which might have been known, but which were not being worked commercially by the former owner at the time of the sale to the Land Commission. Some claim might be made if the former owner could prove that he had suffered a definite loss of income, or had been affected to his detriment in some other way by the acquisition of the estate by the Land Commission. But if, in fact, at the time he did not know there were any minerals on the land, or, knowing it, had never attempted to explore their possibilities or to work them commercially, it is surely preposterous to propose that he should be given this claim against <Col N="525" /> these minerals, to receive 25 per cent. of any income the State may derive from leasing them.  We are certainly going to oppose that particular provision, and will endeavour to insert an amendment on the Committee Stage which will express our views in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss this Bill at any length now.  There are a number of matters arising out of it which do not affect the principle and which cannot properly be considered now. These matters will arise again.  The only thing further I have to say is that the Minister is open to the criticism of the Dáil for the very long delay that has taken place in the introduction of the Bill.  As long ago as 1926 he promised this Bill.  He promised it quite frequently since, and it has now appeared in 1931.  He has not given us any indication of the cause of the delay or drawn attention to any special difficulty which would necessitate five years' consideration before the Bill could be printed and circulated.  However, it is here now, and the main concern of the House should be to give it a speedy passage subject to proper amendment, where amendment is necessary, and to endow the Minister with the various powers he asks, subject to his giving an undertaking that he is going to use these powers when he gets them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a Bill which will receive general approval not merely in every portion of this House, but in every portion and from every section of the country.  As Deputy Lemass reminded us, it is a Bill that is long overdue and unfortunately it comes at a time when the fortunes of the mining rights are at their very lowest ebb in this country. Two things are essential to make this Bill a success.  It is essential that the State should have the largest possible control of the mining rights.  If it has not, the Bill will be of no use.  Without going through the provisions of the Bill, I think that an honest effort has been made to carry out that point, which is absolutely essential, if the Bill is ever to come to anything.  The second essential in my view is this, that it is necessary that &ldquo;minerals&rdquo;<Col N="526" /> should have as wide a definition as possible, having regard to private rights and interests.  The definition of the word &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; has been the subject of many decisions, and is, I think, to-day the subject of pending decisions in an adjoining country.  It is essential that the necessity for having debated by litigation once again, as to what are minerals and what are not minerals, should be settled once and for all by this Bill.  There is no question but the definition which the Minister has given to the word &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; is the largest definition ever given to that word.  I suggest to the Minister that the difficulty is that the definition is now so wide that it will include almost anything. Looking at the definition of the word &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; in the most important part of the Bill, Section 1 (2), it says &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;minerals&rsquo; includes all minerals and substances in or under land obtainable by underground or surface working.&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Minister that turf is a substance, &ldquo;in our under land obtainable by surface working,&rdquo; and that the Bill as it stands prohibits once and for all, without the consent of the State, the exercise of any turbary rights.  The same observation will apply to sand and to gravel, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should get rid of this trouble arising, as it would be a very serious matter for this country if to-morrow the country were to awake to the fact that the Dáil had passed a Bill which would prevent forever the further cutting of turf, the taking of sand or of gravel. Bills that have been passed recently may have given rise to a little heat, if not in the country, at all events in this House, but it will be nothing compared to the heat that will arise if the country was told that it was the considered view of the Executive Council that we were to have no more turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might add to that definition a restrictive clause such as this: &ldquo;But shall not include sand or gravel used or intended to be used solely for the purpose of building, or the erection or repair of houses or buildings, and shall not include turf, bogwood or other bogstuffs.&rdquo;  I think the Minister might <Col N="527" /> see his way to modify slightly the definition of the word &ldquo;minerals,&rdquo; but, while I say that, I know some of the difficulties attaching to putting in anything like a restrictive amendment to that word.  I agree that the Minister was right in taking as wide a definition as possible.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Lemass who suggested, in connection with Section 3, that the words &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;the Minister shall.&rdquo;  I suggest that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the proper word. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would put the Minister in the position that if any one put up a claim, no matter how frivolous or untenable it was, the Minister would be forced of necessity to submit that ridiculous and untenable claim for the decision of the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is to decide that it is ridiculous and untenable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Common sense.  I think that may fairly be left to the Minister. The Deputy, I am sure, will be with me to this extent: that it would be possible to put up a question that would be absolutely frivolous, ridiculous and untenable.  Given the admission that that would be possible, then of necessity the question would have to be submitted by the Minister to the Judicial Commissioner.  As a result, time and expense would be taken up as well as delay in the investigation of mineral rights, a thing which I know the Deputy would not wish to render possible.  The only way of getting rid of that difficulty is by using the word which the Minister has put into the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that by a term used in sub-section (2) of Section 5 the Minister did not intend to place any slur on the profession of which I am a very humble member.  I take it from him that he would be quite pleased to add after the words &ldquo;practising barrister&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or solicitor.&rdquo;  It would be common sense to do so, as a solicitor is at least as well able to judge the value and quality of mining rights as a practising barrister.  In most cases, if you get the right man he has far more experience than a barrister in these matters.  The average barrister knows very little about <Col N="528" /> mining rights.  The average solicitor does.  I am sure I need only remind the Minister of that to have his assurance that he does not intend to place any slur on the solicitors' profession and that the matter will be remedied at the earliest opportunity.  Subject to what I have said, I believe the Bill will have the approval of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken seems to have been in a bit of a quandary as regards what exactly are minerals and what are not. In that respect he is not alone in the world because many people have not been able to differentiate between organic and inorganic chemistry.  A few things in connection with this Bill strike one immediately.  In Part II, Section 12, there is the right of entry to experiment by the Minister. I take it that means that somebody empowered by the Minister is entitled to enter land to see what is contained under the surface of it.  Deputies, including myself, have made appeals here that before now a geological survey of this country should have been made.  It is a most important thing in order to ascertain what minerals can be produced in the country either for internal use or for export.  This section of the Bill provides that if we set up a Board for the purpose of carrying out a geological survey of the country the Minister must compensate. The Minister may not agree with me on that, but I hold that under this section the Minister must pay compensation for the right of entry for any Board that may be set up for the purpose of carrying out a geological survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to ascertain what minerals are contained in the country.  We have got deposits, galena, barytes, and others.  It should be the function of any Government in this country to ascertain how much we have or what we have of any particular mineral so that we may utilise it for our own use or export it.  A geological survey of the country has not been carried out. Any text book on geology will show that certain things have been done in the past to find out the mineral wealth of the country, but here the <Col N="529" /> Minister sets out to compensate for the right of entry any person whose land is entered either by a Board or by a company set up by him to carry out a geological survey.</P>
    <P>When certain lands were taken over by the Land Commission from the landlords there were certain rights, fishing, shooting and mineral rights, reserved to the landlords.  Mining rights were reserved in certain places to them.  Under this Bill the man who purchases his land and pays his annuities to the Land Commission is not entitled to the minerals that underlie his land.  If and when the Minister pays compensation to a landlord who formerly owned land on which he proposes to enter to ascertain if it has a mineral bearing area, the landlord is to get 25 per cent of the compensation for any minerals that are found underlying it, land for which some unfortunate Irishman is paying to the Land Commission.  A typical example occurs to my mind at Glenagivney, Innishowen, in the County Donegal, formerly owned by the Earl of Shaftesbury. That land is at present in the possession of tenants who are paying to the Land Commission.  If a coal bearing or any other mineral tract is found on that land the Minister is supposed to pay compensation not to the people who are paying to the Land Commission but to the Earl of Shaftesbury, the former landlord.  That will have to be rectified before this Bill gets support from this side of the House, if my colleagues are in agreement with me on that, as I feel sure they are.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the tenants who have been paying to the Land Commission for years should be entitled to the minerals underlying their land.  If these minerals are reserved to the landlord, that is the fault of somebody other than the tenant.  If the Minister has to pay compensation to somebody for entering land to find out the mineral wealth of it, it is the fault of the Minister that he did not take steps long since to have the land entered compulsorily by a Board composed of geological experts to ascertain the mineral wealth of Ireland.  That suggestion was made to the Minister three <Col N="530" /> years ago, but he did not act upon it. Under the Bill the Minister now wants to pay compensation to a man for entering his land in order to find out whether it has a mineral bearing tract or not.  These are things that must be rectified before the Bill is allowed to pass through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a highly technical subject, and the House is not in a position to judge fully what may happen when a concrete instance regarding compensation, the deciding of claims, etc., comes before the Board. There are a few matters, however, that can well be stressed even on the Second Reading of the Bill, which must be largely experimental for many years to come.  Deputy Wolfe has called attention to some of them.  One of them is that the Dáil and the State should take the largest possible powers to themselves in regard to the whole question of mineral rights or the development of minerals.  For that reason, I think, it is rather strange that there does not seem to be anything definite in the Bill regarding any work of prospecting, surveying, or even for the development of the mineral resources by the Board itself.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think that people will be available in all cases to invest money and to meet themselves the heavy expense that will probably accrue before the question that will naturally arise can be decided by this Board?  It seems to me that such people will only be forthcoming wherever there is clear evidence that mining can be undertaken with the prospect of good profits.  In other cases where we can only go on hearsay or certain geological evidence, which, however good it may be, may prove to be rather fruitless when we examine the proposition from the commercial point of view, it seems to me that the Minister ought to give the Board full powers to do these things themselves if the necessary enterprise is not forthcoming to do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the period of two years is sufficient to permit of real results being achieved in this prospecting. It seems to me that the Minister could enlarge the period to say five years so as to give people who <Col N="531" /> are interested and who may not be very heavily capitalised every opportunity to see whether the thing is really feasible.  I think the period of two years might be increased, but I have not sufficient knowledge to say. Possibly the Minister has good reasons for fixing that period.  The point stressed by Deputy Lemass in regard to the terms of the lease and the fact that these terms should be laid before the Dáil as in the case of the State Lands Act is important, particularly when we see that the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, has the power to grant these rights to individuals quite free of any charge or payment.  In that case there should be very good reasons indeed.  We can understand that such cases may occur, but why should not Ministers on the opposite side give the Dáil an opportunity of discussing them or at least have the matter brought before the Dáil?</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill to which our Party is opposed in the present state of their knowledge, is the provision regarding the twenty-five per cent.  We are told that royalties are very small payments, and we can imagine that, in well-developed mines where development has been going on for possibly generations, the royalty may appear very small, but in the beginning, when you are trying to develop your resources, as we are, the royalty may be very heavy and may be quite sufficient to turn the business from a profit-making into a loss-making concern.  It may be sufficient to dissipate whatever profits may afterwards accrue.  I think there is great force in the point put forward that when there is no proof that the minerals have been worked heretofore and, as is often the case, that there is no proof that the former owner of the land had any knowledge that the minerals were there, when the State does the necessary geological and survey work and proves the minerals are there, and when some other individual comes along, it seems rather far fetched that a former owner, who really has no title that one can see, judging in an ordinary commonsense way, should get twenty-five per <Col N="532" /> cent.  It is true that various expenses are deducted from the twenty-five per cent., and that then it may not seem very much.  Nevertheless, it may be some considerable sum.  In all the circumstances and in the absence of fuller information we are opposed to it.</P>
    <P>I think that Part V of the Bill, Section 27, which gives the Board power to allow persons who have been restricted for various causes, which did not seem to be surmountable, legal causes or otherwise, and who have been trying to develop or prospect and have not succeeded, is a most valuable one.  I would like to see it coupled with definite powers given to the Board to work an area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe has touched on the question of sand and gravel.  The question is, will not interpretation of the definitions &ldquo;sand and gravel,&rdquo; if an attempt is made to exclude them from the operations of the Bill, cause difficulties later.  I think the Minister is right to take the fullest possible power to make his definition as wide as possible.  It would be a very bad thing if china clay or some other mineral of that kind were excluded because the court might decide that it was in fact clay as, under the old land cases, brick earth was excluded because it was decided that it was not, in fact, a mineral.  In any case I think the Minister is right to make the definition as wide as possible so as to cover all kinds of clays.  The Board will not be so foolish as to interfere with ordinary people who are quarrying for sand or gravel for building. The question arises, what is going to happen the tenant occupier, who, I think, will not be at all satisfied if considerable inconvenience is caused to him, and who may suffer damage to property, while the whole of the compensation payable goes to the Land Commission?  If this Bill passes in the same form in which it now stands, it may happen that all the compensation will go to the Land Commission.  We do not question the right of the Land Commission to appropriate to itself this compensation where the security of the land has been weakened. Where it is clear the State has a claim, that claim should be met, but I foresee <Col N="533" /> great difficulties.  Tenant occupiers will be looking for compensation, and that compensation may not be available.</P>

Lime is extensively used for reclamation of land in this particular district and, as a result of the closing of the local quarries, it is not possible for farmers to obtain lime.  I hope the Minister will make clear in this Bill that every facility will be given to people on whose land limestone quarries are situate to re-open them and to manufacture lime.  The inconvenience caused for some years past has been very serious and of no benefit to anybody. The quarries were closed down and left to lie idle while nobody has gained any benefit.  On the other hand, the people of the district have suffered serious loss.</P>

      <P>I support the Second Reading of this Bill.  It will remove certain restrictions which prevent mines being worked at present.  The Minister replied to me recently on the question of the working of the ochre mines at Avoca.  As is well known, <Col N="534" /> these mines gave employment to a large number of men in the area. Owing to the heavy royalties which the company had to meet, the mines had to be closed down.  The royalties amounted to over 25 per cent.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably an amendment which may be introduced in Committee bearing on this matter.  Section 17 is the most important section of the Bill, because it gives the Minister the right to grant a lease to persons to work mines.  By the removal of the heavy royalties in the case to which I have referred, I hope that employment will be provided at Avoca.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A variety of points have been raised, but they are mainly Committee points.  A few of these points may be dealt with, as they go somewhat to the principle of the Bill. Deputy Lemass discussed the nonappearance of the word &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; and its replacement by the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in several sections.  He queried it in Section 3, amongst others.  Deputy Wolfe has answered that.  It is quite clear that to impose on me the responsibility of referring to the Land Commission every question which might arise under (a), (b), and (c), would be very burdensome and would, in fact, if properly worked, give the recalcitrant owner many opportunities of postponing activities with regard to mines or minerals and their working.  There is the point, in addition to what Deputy Wolfe mentioned, that cases of this type may also come before one of the ordinary courts.  There may be a legal point of a particular type raised and it would be quite wrong, as well as being burdensome, to have the obligation laid upon the Minister to refer a matter which arises to the Land Commission, while at the same time the matter is being tried out in one of the ordinary courts of the land to get the question of right determined.  Similarly in Section 6, with regard to the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  The Deputy will have to go further than he suggests, because the section says &ldquo;in relation to all or any of the following matters.&rdquo;  If I were disposed to nullify the Bill, I could apparently still retain that power.  Deputy Lemass and some <Col N="535" /> other Deputy said that there was a definite avoidance in this Bill of the practice which has grown up in connection with the State Lands Act, where leases, before being made, are publicly notified to the Dáil, and the Dáil has a certain number of days in which the question may be raised.  We did deliberately avoid that procedure. If people want any sort of mineral development in the country they had better keep clear away from that procedure. Imagine the circumstances. Somebody with information derived in a scientific way, by geological surveys, by reading the information available to him, by entering upon the lands with permission of the person in possession for certain purposes and making certain small tests &mdash; which could be done&mdash;comes to the conclusion that there is a prospect of working certain minerals.  He finds that they are State controlled and approaches my Department with regard to a lease.  He is the first on the spot.  He has used a certion amount of intelligence with regard to finding out what is there; made certain preliminary observations, and possibly spent a certain sum of money in getting data for his own benefit.  I am supposed to take that lease here, turn this House into some kind of auction mart, revealing to the House what that man is proposing to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, it seems to me, there would incidentally emerge information as to what the particular mineral that was being prospected for was. After the person first on the spot had shown a certain amount of vigilance and intelligence, the offer he is making is to be thrown open to this House for consideration and the House may say &ldquo;That is not sufficient. We will seek for a better bargain.&rdquo; If there is to be any mineral development, you must cut yourself clean away from that type of procedure, which would inevitably stop development. Nobody is going to run the risk of having his plan revealed, so that somebody else may come in and a better bargain be made for the State.  We do not regard the moneys that may accrue to the State by way of rents or royalties as the primary consideration.  That is put in a rather <Col N="536" /> negative form in the Bill&mdash;that the Minister shall take the rent unless it seems to him that there is some reason why the rent should be remitted.  One of the things we stress as an important thing to be observed in negotiations and in leases that are afterwards made is that the question of the rents or royalties that may accrue to the State Department are not the main consideration, but rather the prospect of getting mineral development in the country.  These are the things that would be canvassed if we adopted the procedure of having leases brought before the House, with the prospect of their being annulled after cross-examination as to what they were all about and whether this was the best offer that could be obtained.  Deliberately we avoided that procedure, and we will deliberately persist in trying to get the Dáil not to accept it.</P>
    <P>Section 14 was referred to by a number of Deputies.  It was referred to by one Deputy in a way which showed that he had not any understanding of what it was intended to effect.  Deputy Carney canvassed this section from a peculiar angle.  He spoke of where the mineral rights were reserved to a landlord.  Where mineral rights are reserved to a landlord, under Article 11 I doubt very much if the State has any control or any possession, because the phrase &ldquo;valid private rights subsisting&rdquo; will, I think, very definitely take out such mines and minerals from the possession of the State.  In that case, the landlord would not have any interest in looking for 25 per cent. royalties because he would have the whole thing under his own control and could demand what he pleased, subject to the possibility of his being affected by a later section of this Bill which deals with non-State mines and minerals.  The Deputy also made a second case&mdash;the case of the land being sold and the rights not reserved to the landlord.  I do not know how that sale would have been effected.  If the rights were neither reserved to the landlord nor to the State, with some rights still subsisting in the landlord, then, again, I do not see how the landlord is coming in to deal with things which are ordinarily known as <Col N="537" /> minerals, not sand, gravel, stone or clay.  Where a sale had been made under any of the Land Purchase Acts, then the Land Commission generally became possessed of the minerals.  In that case, the law was&mdash;we propose to keep the law as it is&mdash;that where there was disposal afterwards of the mineral rights the landlord got 25 per cent. We propose to carry that into the Act of 1923.  The 1923 Act said that there would be given to the landlord such percentage as would be afterwards determined by the Oireachtas. This is the determination we now propose.  The equities of that 25 per cent. can be gone into in Committee.</P>
    <P>The other and bigger point raised was raised by Deputy Derrig.  It is a point I should like to counter right at the start.  Deputy Carney went somewhat on the same lines.  Deputy Derrig has the view that this Mining Board should be given power to prospect and make borings.  That is not the function we associate with the Board.  The function we associate with the Board is that of determining what legal rights there are in or about certain things, valuing these and assessing sums of money in consideration for their passing. That is the main function of the Board.  If we were to adopt the other scheme it would not be done in a Bill of this sort.  That would be dealt with in a Bill for the mineral development of the country under State auspices. We would set up a Board, equip it with funds for the purpose of obtaining extensive drilling and boring machinery, set them to prospect and, when we went that length, why should we not ask the Board finally to develop? What we aim at here is the getting of development in an ordinary, commercial way.  There is quite an amount of information at the disposal of those who would be likely to be interested in development here.  There is quite a good geological survey which is accessible and which has not been by any means made use of up to the point it should have been made use of.  It is ready and accessible to anybody who likes to avail himself of it. We are not thinking of a Board equipped with money and machinery for the purpose of getting out particulars <Col N="538" /> to entice commercial people to come along and develop.  The Deputy says that the geological survey information, however good it may be, may prove to be fruitless in connection with a commercial proposition. It is for the commercial men to make up their minds on that.  They get here, if they are not absolutely certain, the ordinary prospecting lease which is limited to two years.  So far as the experience of other countries has gone, that seems to be sufficient for the purpose.  If that is not sufficient, they can get another prospecting lease.  There is no difficulty about that.  They can get themselves established on the grounds, freedom to work under the ordinary conditions, and they can make up their own minds whether there is sufficient prospect of commercial success to make them enter upon a lease under whatever conditions they would like to establish in relation to that bit of property.  Deputy Carney regarded this Board as a sort of geological survey.  There has been a geological survey going on for years. The officials in connection with that survey have not had any difficulty in getting information for the purpose of that survey.  We do not think of that body equipped with the very expensive machinery that would be required for the purpose of getting out all the data that a commercial man would require before he would begin his work.  It has been doing its work in a very efficient way for years and doing it without any necessity for this compulsory right of entering land which the Deputy wanted to have given to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe's two points are distinctly Committee points and can be made in Committee.  There was no intention to degrade one branch of the profession in comparison with another. If the Deputy moves an amendment, we will be able to meet him.  The point as to the definition is much more serious, and I would like to have the Deputy's amendment sent in so that it could be considered.  The definition goes to the root of the whole thing. Although the definition to which the Deputy referred is only a definition for the purposes of Parts 4, 5 and 8, <Col N="539" /> the question of definition does run right through the whole thing and may have to be attended to in a better way.  In so far as Part 3 is concerned, there we are founding ourselves upon Article 11 of the Constitution, and Article 11 uses the word &ldquo;mineral&rdquo; without any definition.  If we come to define, we may, by the definition, be either limiting the mineral rights acquired by the State or other people or unnecessarily extending them.  I am sure the Deputy will bear that in mind when he is putting in his amendment.</P>
    <P>As far as the last two speakers are concerned, I cannot make up my mind upon the point raised by Deputy Goulding.  The whole thing would seem to turn on the question: is lime a mineral for the purpose of this Act? The Deputy had better consider that, and if he thinks it is not and should be met, he can put down an amendment. Similarly, with regard to the point raised by Deputy Everett.  The case there is one of minerals not being worked and no possibility of their being worked because, according to the Deputy's statement, extraordinarily high royalties are asked.  It is for the Deputy to consider whether that situation could be brought inside the scope of section 17 (4).  That is a case where minerals are not being worked or are not being worked efficiently and no satisfactory reason is shown by the person having an interest therein for not working such minerals.</P>

      <P>Then let us take it as limestone.  The Deputy will have to consider that point on his own, and if the Bill is not satisfactory I should like to see the amendment he brings in.  Deputy Lemass said this Bill ought to be supported only on the understanding that the powers I get will be used in a vigorous way.  What powers do I get?  I get powers which provide that when people make applications to me for leases, leases may be given with regard to State mines or minerals.  With regard to minerals not in State possession, where people make application, <Col N="540" /> I may grant them certain rights or ancillary rights.  I do not know whether the Deputy means by saying that I should use my powers vigorously that I should go out on the highways and bye-ways and get people to make application to me.  I certainly shall not promise that.  There are ways of encouraging mineral development, but I do not think that the proper way is to have, as Deputy Derrig thought, a Board set up by the State, everything got ready for the commercial man and the fruits of the commercial development left to the commercial man or that when the Minister is empowered to grant leases of State property or to grant rights in respect of non-State property, he should be expected not alone to do this but to look for people to act as lessees.</P>

There are three days to put down amendments.  Even though the Bill has been issued since June last has the Minister's Department been considering it since June or has anybody else?  The House has been given a holiday by the Government of three months.  I do not think anybody during these three months paid much attention to the Mines and Minerals Bill, the Minister no more than anybody else.  A week or two before the Dáil sat everybody started to look at the Bills.  I presume Deputy Lemass did, and I certainly did.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving that this Bill be read a Second Time I want to point out that first it is a non-party measure.  I have been joined in its introduction by a Deputy who sits on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches and one from the Labour Benches.  Its purpose is to provide for the humane slaughter of animals by the use of a mechanically operated instrument so as to ensure instantaneous insensibility to pain.  It is laid down in this Bill that the operator, who shall be eighteen years of age at least, shall be duly licensed by the local authority and that slaughter-houses are to be open to inspection by members of the Gárda Síochána and other persons authorised by the Department of Local Government.  I am quite certain that very few Deputies have read this Bill because I have, no later than within the last hour, been told here that you could not slaughter pigs by <Col N="543" /> this method at all.  Swine are excluded from the operations of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Owing to our history in this country we are inclined to be somewhat callous in our treatment of animals.  The struggle for existence perhaps prevented the development of the humanitarian spirit in certain sections of the community and blunted finer feelings perhaps or made us forgetful in such matters as these.  Other Deputies have said &ldquo;Oh this Bill is inspired by certain old ladies who have not much to do and go about interesting themselves in these animals!&rdquo; Perhaps some very estimable ladies do take an interest in this matter but I can quote for you letters of a very hard-headed business man, a man engaged in the cattle slaughter trade who could not for a moment be deemed a sentimentalist in regard to this.  I have got hundreds of other letters from very hard-headed business men indeed in support of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A licence will be necessary for persons operating these instruments. Licences are issued for twelve months and are renewed annually and there is a very small fee attached to them. &ldquo;The local authority for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Act shall be the respective urban sanitary authorities, and the expenses of enforcing this Act shall be defrayed as expenses incurred in the administration of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1919.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to is that the Act shall apply to all urban sanitary districts having a population exceeding ten thousand according to the last published census, and to no other area. That removes the objection of several Deputies who have been speaking to me.  It shall come into operation on the first day of January, 1932, provided that Section 1, in so far as it relates to the slaughter of any sheep, shall not come into operation until the first day of January, 1933, which gives ample time.  The Schedule to the Bill deals with the prevention of suffering or pain to these animals while they are <Col N="544" /> awaiting slaughter.  Paragraph 6 of the Schedule, I think, is important because it is said that most suffering is caused to these animals by the smell or sight of blood of animals previously slaughted in the same slaughter yard. Paragraph 6 provides:</P>
    <P>An occupier of a slaughter-house or knacker's yard shall not cause or allow any blood or other refuse to flow from such slaughter-house or knacker's yard so as to be within the sight or (so far as it is practicable to avoid it) within the smell of any animal in the slaughter-house or knacker's yard, and he shall not cause or allow any such blood or other refuse to be deposited in the waiting pens or lairs.</P>
    <P>We are not in advance of other nations in introducing this Bill.  As a matter of fact, we are years behind most European nations, which is a thing I would also like to point out. I find that in Glasgow, for instance, all pigs are stunned with humane killers thought they do not come under this Bill.  In Denmark all animals except in the bacon factories are killed with the humane killer.  A Scottish Bill which was passed three years ago excludes pigs, but 75 per cent. of the pigs in Scotland are slaughtered by the humane instrument.  Since this Bill was introduced here I see they again brought in a Bill which had been shelved in England for some time, and quoted the fact that the Irish Free State was getting ahead of them in debating this measure.  There is a good supply of efficient humane killers. They are simple to work and safe and reliable in operation and not expensive. In 1908 there was an Admiralty Commission appointed to investigate the method of slaughter of animals used for food for the navy.  You would hardly call navel officers sentimentalists or old ladies, I presume.  This Commission were unanimously of opinion that in the case of every animal stunning should be resorted to before slaughter.</P>
    <P>I have here information gleaned from other countries.  In France in several Departments, one being the Loire Department, the humane killer for the slaughter of larger animals is used; <Col N="545" /> also in the private abattoirs.  In Norway there is compulsory stunning of domestic animals, including tame reindeer. This has been in force since 1929.  In Switzerland compulsory stunning of animals, including swine, before bleeding, has been in force since 1893 as a result of a referendum.  So we are many years behind them.  In Germany the Bavarian Parliament passed a law in 1930 making it compulsory for cattle, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, mules and dogs to be stunned before being bled.</P>
    <P>In the State of Anhalt regulations in regard to compulsory stunning apply also to rabbits and poultry, while in Schleswig-Holstein fish are included. That is extensive enough.  In Holland humane slaughter is compulsory; in England humane slaughter is enforced in 380 areas by local authorities.  I have a list of them here which I shall not delay the House by reading.  In Denmark humane slaughter is the rule, but pigs whose meat is intended for export are not slaughtered humanely.</P>
    <P>As regards the instruments, you have the Greener Humane killer, the Cash Captive bolt, the Stoff instrument, the Schermer Baeirdorf pistol.  So there is a wide selection.</P>
    <P>There are many firms in Ireland which use the humane killer.  I will take just a few instances of Dublin firms.  I have some from the country also.  One firm, Michael McDonagh and Company, use this instrument for cattle, sheep and lambs; they have never had a mishap and they found the meat excellent.  O'Hanlon's, of Dublin, find it very satisfactory. Williams and Company and Egan Bros. say it is a most profitable investment even from the economic point of view. Eastman's have used the instrument for three years exclusively.  Another firm here have used the instrument exclusively for five years, and never had an accident; they find the meat is not injured in any way.  Archer's use it for pigs and say that it does not cause as much damage to the head of the animal as the pole-axe in the case of cattle. They find it safe and efficient in the case of pigs.  Speidal, pork butchers, Dublin, say it is the best method of killing pigs.  Price's, of Dublin, use <Col N="546" /> it exclusively for the killing of pigs, and find it reliable and effective.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is need for me to go into all these cases.  I have the names of about 150 butchers, including pork butchers, who use it.  I think we would only be getting into line with other nations in adopting this method.  We can save much suffering to these animals with no extra expense practically, and it is our duty to save these unfortunate animals pain if we can do so, even if it were more costly than other methods, but it is not.  As I believe there are not half-a-dozen Deputies in this House opposed to the measure, I move now, without further delay, that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely in sympathy with everything Deputy Fahy has said.  To my mind he has made out a most excellent case for the humane killer.  I can assure him that we are disgracefully behind other European nations in regard to this matter.  It was said some years ago that the humane killer was detrimental to the meat.  I asked the opinion of a man who is at the head of the cattle trade on this matter.  He gave me his opinion to be quite the reverse.  He was most heartily in favour of it.  It stands to reason that while in the hands of an experienced man the pole-axe may be all right, in the hands of an amateur there is no doubt that it is open to great abuses and has been, unintentionally of course, the cause of very great cruelty.  I was very glad to hear from Deputy Fahy that this instrument has been used with such satisfactory results and that it is now being used by such a large number of butchers. I am sure that in a very short time it will be used generally throughout this country.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with what either Deputy Fahy or Deputy Wolfe has said.  I have experience of slaughterhouses and of the stunning of animals, and I think the pole-axe is the proper way.  There is no amateur slaughtering cattle.  This work has got to be done by experienced men and I see no necessity whatever for this Bill. I have been connected with the Roscrea <Col N="547" /> Bacon Factory.  We tried the humane killer and it proved a complete failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from Deputy Fahy what is the difference between the humane killer and the pole-axe.  In one case you have a leaden or steel bullet fired into the brain of the animal. That is where the individual firing has never enough to fire straight. In the one case a lead or steel coated bullet enters the brain.  In the other case the point of the poleaxe enters the brain.  In both cases the animal is stunned and rendered insensible. The case in favour of this proposal comes only from the old women of both sexes in this country. The suggestion to use the poleaxe or the humane killer with regard to pigs could be put forward only by people who have no experience at all in these matters.  The Jewish method is quite different.  The beast is hoist by the hind leg, thrown on its back, not stunned, the knife is drawn across its throat and the animal bleeds to death. This measure exempts that method for obvious reasons and I do not question that.  The only difference between the other two methods is that one is more expensive than the other.  It means that you have to get supplies of cartridges for the humane killer. Behind the suggestion in this measure is a society of busy-bodies, old women of both sexes who go round the country preaching this sort of thing. People of a like mentality plagued China two thousand years ago, but the people of China discovered a method of getting rid of that class of people.  They had their problem a very long time ago and they solved it, the same problem that we have now. I appeal to Deputy Fahy to spare us the necessity or the obligation of adopting the Chinese method for dealing with these people.  This measure is really too nonsensical to put forward seriously in the National Assembly and I doubt if Deputy Fahy is really serious about it.  I hope the Dáil will reject this silly and foolish Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is little <Col N="548" /> ground for taking seriously the one thousand cuts with which Deputy Gorey threatens Deputy Fahy, Deputy George Wolfe and myself.  The Deputy referred to the nonsense of applying this Bill to swine.  Deputy Fahy had already reminded him that its application to swine does not arise here because of the difficulties that are known to exist in the case of swine. For this reason swine are excluded from the scope of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events that question does not arise at all, and I am afraid I cannot accept Deputy Gorey's way of looking at it.  It is all very well for the Deputy to speak of this Bill as having been put forward by old women of both sexes.  But I would remind the Deputy, as Deputy Fahy has already pointed out, that this method is not an untried one.  It is not a nonsensical proposal put up for the first time.  It has been tried both in this and in many other countries.  Within the last year the use of the humane killer was made compulsory even in this country in respect of cattle slaughtered. That was done in the case of a Bill brought in by the Minister for Agriculture himself.  Whoever might justly be charged with being an old woman, the Minister for Agriculture is not one of these.</P>
      <P>Nobody has disputed and I think nobody will dispute that the pole-axe skilfully used is a perfectly good instrument. I understand however that experience has shown that it is not always so used.  The humane killer at any rate is capable of being placed in such a position that it can be used by a totally unskilled person.  Let me again remind the Deputies that this Bill is confined in its terms to urban districts of a certain population.  That has been done in order to avoid the inconvenience and difficulty of enforcing the measure if it were extended to country districts where supervision would be impossible.  I hope the House will pass the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a sentimentalist nor an old woman and I am going to support the Second <Col N="549" /> Reading of this Bill.  I do so because the two main objections that I originally had to such a measure have been removed.  I objected to this Bill being extended to rural areas, to the farmer who was killing only one or two beasts. I objected to putting him to the considerable expense that this measure would involve.  My other objection was to the application of the Bill to the slaughter of swine.  This has been removed from the Bill as Deputy Fahy has shown.  The use of the humane killer is at present general throughout the large cities.</P>
      <P>Though I believe that animals can be slaughtered by the pole-axe with as little pain as in the other way, still there is a better chance, I think, of killing the animal painlessly by the use of the humane killer than by the pole-axe. I have, myself, seen men using the pole-axe who were not able to do the thing in a very satisfactory way. As Deputy Fahy has pointed out, another objection has been removed. That would not appeal, perhaps, to men like Deputy Gorey, whose name is so suggestive of blood.  When one has been brought in contact with the operations in a slaughter-house, and has seen the absolute fear and terror of the animals when they are brought into contact with the blood of other animals that have been slaughtered already&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have here an appeal from people in Limerick to see whether an amendment could be inserted in the Bill if it is to pass.  I was going beforehand to offer an amendment myself. If swine and their method of slaughter were to be in the Bill, that would affect the carrying on of the bacon industry. In addition to that, the butchers say that the animals do not give the blood as well when slaughtered by the humane killer as they do when the operation is performed by the pole-axe.  The people of Limerick have asked me to oppose the Bill, and consequently I am opposing it.</P>

      <P>The only criticism made on this Bill has been made by those interested in the bacon industry.  But that objection is dissipated by the fact that swine do not come within the operations of the Bill.  The other criticism made on the Bill in the usual method adopted by Deputy Gorey is on a par with his controversial methods and they are nothing new to this House.  These methods are well calculated to draw from people the same kind of retort that he himself makes.  If the Deputy calls these people who promoted the Bill &ldquo;old women&rdquo; he cannot complain if that brings upon him the obvious retort that he is the kind of creature who, when his motor car knocks down a motor cyclist, turns round and says: &ldquo;That's the right thing to do with these old crocks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merit of this Bill is simply that it is adopting a more scientific method of killing animals.  It is absurd to say that the use of the bullet is as painful as the stroke of the pole-axe because of the rapidity with which the bullet enters the brain. The experience of people who have <Col N="551" /> suffered from a clean bullet wound is that it is always perfectly painless, and obviously in the case of animals it must be the same because of its extreme swiftness.  There is no comparison between the bullet and the shock delivered by the pole-axe.  I have had experience of animals being terrorised by the sight and the smell of blood.  I was coming to town one day and in front of me were some cattle that seemed to have gone completely mad.  Nobody could do anything with them.  I asked what had happened and I was informed that they were being driven to a slaughter-yard where cattle had already been killed.  I was told it was the sight and the smell of blood that had driven them out of control.  From the scientific point of view it is better to have this humane method.  There will be far less labour expended and cattle will be got to the place of slaughter as quickly as possible instead of having them rushing around the road a danger to the community.  There has been a universal adoption of this more skilful and scientific method of killing animals and I think the method ought to be applied in this country.</P>

      <P>The object of the Bill is to prevent pain to animals being slaughtered and I would like to deal with that point on its merits.  The real question is whether the method suggested in this Bill is going to prevent unnecessary suffering to animals being slaughtered.  I take it that everybody agrees that no unnecessary suffering should be inflicted on animals.  From that point of view I entirely agree that the real suffering caused to animals is the suffering that arises from the smell and sight of blood.  Nature has given them the capacity to smell blood at a long distance and some instinct teaches them that something is going to happen to them, and undoubtedly they get into an excited condition when being driven to the place of slaughter.  I have had experience of this matter in this and other countries. From my observation the real pain caused to animals is caused by the fright that they experience while they <Col N="552" /> are being driven to the pens and brought to the slaughter-house.  That matter is dealt with in Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahy suggests that in all cases, with the exception of pigs, slaughter should be carried out by means of the humane killer.  Deputy Law is right when he says that cattle slaughtered for export are slaughtered by the humane killer.  I have a recollection of the discussion that took place when legislation was passed in that connection.  What was the basis of the decision as inserted in that particular Act?  Cattle are slaughtered for export in very large numbers in big slaughter-houses.  In those places there are efficient penning arrangements, there is efficient control and the cost of obtaining and keeping in good repair a sufficient number of humane killers would be only a fraction of the cost of all the operations put together. It was agreed that it is a practical proposition to require that the owners of slaughter-houses where large numbers of cattle are slaughtered regularly every week should use humane killers.  I am referring only to cattle because the provision that Deputy Law mentioned applied only to cattle.  This Bill applies not only to cattle slaughtered for export, but to all cattle slaughtered in the country in any slaughter-house or knacker's yard.</P>
      <P>The application of this Bill to horses, ponies, donkeys and goats is not of great importance.  There should be no unnecessary suffering in the case of any animal being slaughtered.  In its application, this Bill will really apply to cattle and sheep slaughtered for home consumption.  What is the position in regard to cattle?  Every week there are cattle slaughtered in every town and in every big village in the country.  What the Bill requires is that these cattle shall be slaughtered with the humane killer, or, as it is called in the Bill, a mechanically-operated instrument.</P>

      <P>That narrows it a bit. There is a tremendous number of small slaughter-houses in big towns, and how are you to carry out control? An efficient humane killer is probably a better weapon than a pole-axe in the hands of an efficient man, but I should think that a humane killer in the hands of an inefficient man, or a humane killer that has been neglected and that is used by an inefficient man, is very much more likely to be an instrument of cruelty than a pole-axe even in the hands of an inefficient man. That is my experience.  The local authority is going to require every small butcher in every big town to use a humane killer.  It costs £5.  Perhaps a butcher will buy a second-hand one.  It is quite a delicate instrument in a way, and it requires to be oiled regularly and kept in good order if it is to operate efficiently.  I am absolutely certain it will not be kept in good order.  Possibly the bullet will get worn&mdash;I do not know the technical term for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever it is, it will get worn.  The instrument will not work efficiently, and in a great many cases, when it comes to be operated, it will be most inefficient.  It is not such an easy matter as Deputies may think to use such an instrument, even where it is in good order.  The animal is restive, and it is a simple matter to miss.  I can see that it would be a difficult matter to use such an instrument on a sheep unless the animal is very well tied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes to this, that such an instrument in the hands of an inefficient user is at least as likely to be cruel in its operation as a pole-axe in the hands of an inefficient user.  I go further and say that an instrument that has not been properly looked after, even in the hands of a skilled user, can be at least as cruel as a pole-axe in the hands of an inefficient user.  The long and the short of it is that you are not going to save the animals that you are after now from unnecessary cruelty by this Bill.  That is my honest opinion.  You are going to cause a certain amount of <Col N="554" /> expense to people in getting in these instruments, but in nine cases out of ten they will use the pole-axe.  I do not think that any inspection which local authorities are likely to give them will be able to see to it that they always use the humane killer.  I think the humane killer is likely to lie there to be used only if the Civic Guards or inspectors are about, and that the pole-axe will be generally used.  The result of that will be that the humane killer will not be an efficient instrument when wanted, and the person who is using it will not be skilled or accustomed to using it.  Of course, the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>A licence to slaughter or stun animals in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall not be granted except to a person of the age of eighteen years or upwards who is, in the opinion of the local authority, a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.</P>
    <P>That looks all right in the Bill, but what is going to happen?  A butcher in some town will apply for a licence to kill cattle, and, of course, he will get it by stating that his son or his employee will use the humane killer, and the local authority will assume that he is efficient.  That is worthless so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill cannot be operated in the way that Deputies who are concerned with saving unnecessary suffering to beasts wish it to be.  I believe it will have no effect.  It will only cause a certain amount of expense and make-belief.  It was because we had that in our minds that we refused to insert this provision for the use of the humane killer in other than very big and easily controlled factories in the previous Act where we dealt with the export of cattle.  Deputy Fahy was not correct in saying that the humane killer is used universally.  It is not used universally in Scotland. It is used in some places.  I do not think it is used in Aberdeen.  Some butchers use it and some do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Aberdeen I do not think it is used.  The pole-axe is used by choice.  The English have a reputation, or at least they think they have themselves, for being careful about animals and being anxious to prevent unnecessary pain, but, as far as I know, they do not make it essential in Birkenhead, one of the biggest slaughtering places in the world, where I have seen cattle killed with the pole-axe.  I have seen cattle slaughtered in Aberdeen, and there is no such provision.  There are very live and virile branches of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in England, and they have considerable influence, political and otherwise. There are also a great number of people in England interested in this question who, as consumers, bring influence to bear sometimes on the butchers.  Yet, so far as I know there is no universal compulsion to use this humane killer in any of the big slaughtering places in England.  I think that is due to the good sense of the people interested in preventing unnecessary cruelty because they see that compulsion will only defeat its own ends.</P>
      <P>At present, cattle, so far as I know, are not treated with any unnecessary cruelty.  The arrangements for slaughtering cattle now are very much better than they were twenty-five or thirty years ago.  I may say, too, that in my experience the slaughtering of cattle in butchers' stalls in small towns is carried out in a better way than it would be even in bigger places, because only a beast or two are killed in the week and there is not a pervading stench of blood and the circumstances present which an animal's instinct seems to react again.  I have seen cattle slaughtered in country towns and it seems to me that they suffer less from the beginning to the end than the cattle slaughtered even in properly-run slaughter-houses where the humane killer is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 6 of the Schedule, I agree that that is where <Col N="556" /> the real cruelty comes in.  The stench of the blood and the other circumstances, which an animal recognises by instinct, do frighten him.  I do not know that Section 6 of the Schedule is going to be operative.  What does it say?</P>
    <P>An occupier of a slaughter-house or knacker's yard shall not cause or allow any blood or other refuse to flow from such slaughter-house or knacker's yard so as to be within the sight or (so far as it is practicable to avoid it) within the smell of any animal in the slaughter-house or knacker's yard, and he shall not cause or allow any such blood or other refuse to be deposited in the waiting pens or lairs.</P>
    <P>So far as the waiting pens or lairs are concerned, I think that is dealt with in previous Acts.  Blood or anything like that would be regarded as dirt, and would come under the Act passed to regulate the slaughter of animals.  But it is a difficult question to enforce any such provision so far as it applies to the actual slaughter-house. There will be traces of blood no matter how well washed out it is&mdash; considerable traces.  There will be a stench of blood.  You are only deceiving yourself by putting in a provision of that kind.  I do not believe it can be enforced.  I believe that the Gárda Síochána and the Veterinary Inspectors have under the existing Acts all the power they require to enable them, so far as they can do it, to see to it that animals are slaughtered in a decent way and with no unnecessary pain.  I believe you cannot get much further in that direction. Any efforts that anybody thinks are necessary should be directed towards educating the people in charge of slaughter-houses how to carry out the operation.  Laws cannot do everything. Unless there is a certain amount of decent standards amongst the workers and the employers of the country who are dealing with this, you will have a certain amount of cruelty, and no Act of Parliament will prevent it.  I oppose the Bill, therefore, because I honestly think it will defeat its purpose and that it is worthless.</P>

      <P>It is rather in the nature of things that after spending last week considering the torture of human beings we should be considering this week the humane killing of animals. After the sweeping condemnation that we have had of the Bill by the Minister for Agriculture, I think it rather strange that this Bill was allowed to reach the Second Reading Stage, while a Bill that was far more important to the tenant farmers was not allowed to receive a First Reading in this House.  I think that rather strange, to say the least of it.  I do not believe in the Bill and I am opposed to it.  When I hear a variety of opinions as to whether this Bill is going to be any benefit or not, I think the handiest way of finding out whether the humane killer is painless or not is to have a little experiment. I suggest that we should try it on Deputy Gorey for instance.  If it killed him without pain so much the better, but if it causes him some little pain it will be no harm after the Bill he voted for last week.  I am opposed to the Bill, but I would like to see that experiment tried on Deputy Gorey.</P>

      <P>That is so.  I was going to ask the promoter of the Bill if the same thing had not to be done with the humane killer.  Sheep have to be knocked in the ordinary way unless the mutton is to be injured by the humane killer, so that the animal is frightened to the same extent.  I had a little experience of butchering and I must say that I never saw the pole-axe used in an inefficient manner by a butcher.  One of the last things that an apprentice is allowed to do is to use the pole-axe.  The butcher wants to give a good swift shot and to knock the beast out at one blow.</P>

I should like to ask the Deputy whether he considers the people of Switzerland, who made the use of the humane killer compulsory twenty years ago, to be all old women; whether he considers the Germans, who insist on a humane killer being used for all animals, to be a lot of old women, or whether they were not a formidable lot of old women to meet some years ago.  The Deputy said that it would be nonsensical to use the humane killer on pigs.  We are not asking that it should be used on them. Take the case of Messers.  Hafner and Sons of Dublin.  They slaughter 100 pigs every week and they use nothing but the humane killer.  Does the Deputy think they are fools?  In the Rotherdam municipal abattoir 137,000 cattle are slaughtered with the humane killer per annum.</P>

      <P>It is a fairly large number. It is as many as are slaughtered in the Deputy's county.  I am not an authority on this matter.  I have never been in a slaughter-house and I do not intend to go into one.  Of course, I might be brought into one. The most reasoned opposition that I have heard against the Bill has come from the Minister for Agriculture. He is against the Bill because he does not believe it will achieve its purpose, and that it is necessary to educate public opinion.  It has been educated up to a certain point and I think that education will be fostered by legislation. In towns with a population of 10,000 or over there are sufficient Civic Guards or other people interested in this matter who could be authorised by the Department of Local Government to see that the humane killer was used and was kept in proper order.  I do not think that is asking too much.  The superintendent of Carlisle public slaughter-house, writing in &ldquo;The Spectator&rdquo; on the use of the pole-axe, says:</P>
      <P>May I state my candid opinion of the humane killer?  With the use of these all this suffering among these tens of thousands of animals is swept away.  My experience is that these instruments save much time and remove all pain.  Having been also engaged in the cutting-up of carcases, I am absolutely certain beyond the shadow of a doubt that it is impossible to detect the difference between the flesh of an animal shot and one otherwise slaughtered, and I do not know of a single slaughterman who would undertake to say that he could.  The one is equal to the other.  The talk of the blood being discoloured is to my mind silly and unworthy of the trade, and the assertion that pigs will not cure is absolutely ridiculous and untrue.</P>

      <P>He does not mention any special instruments and I take his word for it that he had no pecuniary interest in the matter.  I find in the proceedings of the London County Council for the 6th March, 1923, a report dealing with the use of the humane killer:</P>
      <P>We reported (20th December, 1921) that on the facts then before us we were not prepared to advise the Council to adopt the clause.</P>
      <P>In February, 1923, they report:</P>
      <P>We are now of opinion that the clause should be adopted and are so recommending.</P>
      <P>That was after watching its use in certain places.  If I thought this Bill would not achieve its purpose and save these animals pain, I would not have put my name to it.  After reading the letters of people who have experience of the humane killer, and who have seen it in operation in countries where it is compulsory, I think that sufficient supervision could be exercised in towns of 10,000 and over to ensure that the instrument would be kept in order.</P>
      <P>If it is compulsory in Switzerland and Germany, surely Irish boys and men are not so stupid as not to be able to learn the use of it, just as the Swiss and Germans.  I believe that you can learn to use it in a week, if training is compulsory.  A course of training is compulsory in Switzerland, I think it would be possible to get the small number required here.  We have not such a great number of towns with a population of over 10,000, and I believe that you could get instruction for the small number of operators that would be necessary.  You have a big number trained already.  As I believe the use of this instrument will achieve the purpose of avoiding pain for these animals, I propose that the Bill be given a Second Reading.</P>
