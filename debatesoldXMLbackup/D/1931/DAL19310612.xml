    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the discontent prevalent amongst the lower grades in the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should set up a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and report on the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus and its application to civil servants' salaries and wages.&rdquo;&mdash;(Richard S. Anthony; Liam O Daimhín.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of those who have already spoken on this motion commenced by drawing the attention of the Dáil to the terms of it.  Despite that fact, however, the majority of the speakers failed to deal with it.  They dealt with matters related to and possibly arising out of the motion. But the proposal which is before the Dáil cannot be said to have been discussed on its merits at all.  Briefly, the proposal is that a committee of inquiry should be set up to examine the method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure and the application of the bonus to civil servants' salaries. That is all that the motion asks the Dáil to do.  The Dáil is not asked to declare that the present method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure is unsatisfactory, or that the method of applying the bonus to salaries should be altered.  It is requested only, in view of the fact that dissatisfaction exists in certain branches of the service, to agree to the setting up of this inquiry so that it will <Col N="337" /> be possible to discover whether or not there are any grounds for that dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>I am one of those who think that it is very undesirable that questions relating to conditions in the Civil Service should be the subject-matter of political action.  When I was first approached concerning this matter I expressed that view.  It was only when it was demonstrated to me that no acceptable method existed for the adjustment of differences within the service that I agreed to become a member of a deputation which met the acting Minister for Finance to discuss the matter.  It was the implacable attitude of the acting Minister for Finance which brought those who were pushing this matter to the point of deciding that a motion should be tabled in the Dáil.  If the Minister for Finance had redeemed the promise which he is stated to have given to representatives of the service a number of years ago and had arranged for the establishment of a representative council with a constitution acceptable to the service, a council on which matters of this kind could be fully thrashed out between the interested parties, the Dáil would not have been called upon to consider such a motion as this.  The motion; however, is before us, and the question we are asked to decide is whether or not it is desirable that such a committee of inquiry should be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a very able and convincing speech last night, but it was not a speech that dealt with the motion.  It was a speech which convinced me that the members of the Government are thoroughly satisfied that if such a committee of inquiry were set up the case which they would be able to submit to it would be so strong that the committee would have no alternative except to decide that the present method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure is a satisfactory one.  The case which the Minister for Industry and Commerce made last night was one which, in our opinion, should have been reserved for this committee.  If the Minister is convinced, as obviously he is, that no satisfactory change can be made in the present method, then it is hard to see <Col N="338" /> why he should object to the inquiry. That was the point made by Deputy Finlay, who argued that if the Government are satisfied that the result of the inquiry must be a report to the effect that the present method is the most satisfactory one, then it is politically desirable that such an inquiry should be set up so that the grounds upon which it is alleged dissatisfaction in the Civil Service rests will be removed.  If such an inquiry was set up and produced such a report as the Minister anticipates, then the Minister for Finance would be in a much stronger position to reject the applications which are being made to him by the organisations representing the Civil Service.  On the other hand, if the committee of inquiry, having examined the case put forward last night by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, found that it was faulty, found, in fact, that the present method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure was not satisfactory, then is it not obviously desirable that the method should be changed or, at any rate, that the Dáil should be given an opportunity of examining the question again?</P>
    <P>Some attempt was made to link up the proposal at present before the Dáil with arguments which have been advanced here from time to time, to the effect that the cost of the Civil Service is excessive or that certain individual members of it are paid at an unduly high rate.  If such a committee of inquiry as is contemplated by the motion were set up we have no objection whatever to that committee being given terms of reference as wide as possible.  Let them examine the whole question and consider not merely the narrow point whether the present method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure is satisfactory, but whether the present method of remunerating civil servants, partly by basic salary and partly by bonus, is the most satisfactory one.  The views of members of this Party are, I think, quite well known.  We think there are a large number of civil servants who are being paid far more than they are worth to the State.  On the other hand, we believe that there are a large number of those in the lower <Col N="339" /> grades who can justly claim that they are being unfairly treated under the present method.  A reduction in the cost-of-living index figure means proportionately a much larger reduction in the remuneration of postmen and of other civil servants in the lower grades than it does in the case of civil servants in the higher grades. The method upon which the remuneration of civil servants is based has been explained by many speakers.  I do not propose to go into it again. Although not opposed to the system of having a portion of the salaries of civil servants upon a sliding scale, we think that that should be so calculated that the hardship consequent upon a problematical drop in the cost of living suffered by those with the lower salaries could be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The motion before the Dáil is divided into two parts.  The first relates to the method of compiling the figure.  I cannot claim to be an authority upon statistical matters, and I do not propose to enter into the arguments advanced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that connection.  We know that many matters that enter into the cost of living cannot be said to have fallen to any extent to what the cost-of-living figure would indicate.  We are concerned with this cost-of-living index figure for several reasons.  One of them is the grounds upon which the remuneration of civil servants is calculated in reference to it.  In fact, it could be said in the long run that the impression created by the publication of these figures determines wages and salaries in practically all industries. Rent is taken as one considerable item in the average budget, and therefore comes into the index figure.  No one can say that rents have been falling, particularly in the City of Dublin. As Deputies know, we have on the Statute Book Rent Restrictions Acts the existence of which implies that we believe the tendency of rents is to go upward, and that it is necessary, in the public interest, to keep them down by legislation.  The Rent Restrictions Acts are due to expire this year.  If they expire most Deputies know there will <Col N="340" /> be an upward tendency in the rents of dwellings which the lower-paid grades of civil servants usually inhabit. Whether or not the method of compiling the figure is right, we think an inquiry should be made into it.  Undoubtedly a large number of civil servants believe that they are adversely affected because of the fact that a wrong basis of calculation is in operation. If the Minister is satisfied that that is not so, then he can have no objection to an inquiry.  The only reason for which he could refuse an inquiry is because he believes it might result in a change in the system, a change which he might consider undesirable. If he is satisfied that the result of the inquiry must be a report in favour of the present system, then the only objection advanced against the inquiry is removed, whereas on the other hand a very decided advantage would be gained, the advantage of removing the cause of dissatisfaction which the motion states exists amongst various grades of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion deals with the application of the bonus to civil servants' salaries.  We think that question should be examined, the question whether there should in fact be a bonus, the question whether the proportion of the average salaries on a sliding scale is not excessive in relation to the basic salary, and the variation that might be made in basic salary rates.  A good case could be made, we believe, for examination of this question, apart altogether from any discontent that may exist in the Civil Service.  We would like to see the inquiry to be entered on, if the motion is passed, as wide as possible, so that the whole question of the remuneration of civil servants will be thoroughly examined and a system devised which would remove all causes of discontent.  Perhaps it is not possible to remove all causes of discontent. If motions of this kind and questions relating to the Civil Service are not to come before the Dáil again, the Minister must change his attitude, and must co-operate in the establishment of some council which will act as a medium for discussion between his <Col N="341" /> Department and those who can claim to speak for the general body of civil servants.</P>
    <P>These are the matters to which the motion relates.  The merits of the actual method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure do not relate to it.  The points raised by the Minister for Finance dealing with the variations which have taken place in the method of payment of bonus do not relate to it.  These matters might, and should, be properly discussed by a Committee of Inquiry, if established, but the question before the Dáil is merely whether it is politically advisable such inquiry should be made, and no answer whatever has been made to the contention that it should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation.  Deputy Lemass intimated that he either believed or heard that I had made a promise at some time to set up a Representative Council acceptable to the Civil Service.  I never gave any such pledge.  In fact, in the beginning, civil servants said that nothing would satisfy them but a Whitley Council, and I pledged myself not to set up such a council.  What I did promise was to set up a Council at which all grades of civil servants would be adequately represented, and at which all matters affecting the service could be discussed.  That is quite a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information given to me was that the Minister promised that the constitution of the Council would be a matter for discussion with representatives of the service before being finally decided, and that that promise was not kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The service were insisting on a Whitley Council, and refused to co-operate in the establishment of anything else.  Finally, decisions had to be taken by the Ministry, but there was no promise on any basis that the Council must be acceptable to the service.  We only promised to set up machinery for discussing matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the constitution of the Representative Council was decided by the Minister <Col N="342" /> without consulting the service, and that, in fact, the Council is not functioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

      <P>Is it a fact that the Minister refused to entertain a certain question that went to him through the existing Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say off-hand. It is conceivable, there might be a matter that the existing Council might want to bring up, which we would not think appropriate.  I have no recollection of anything of the sort.  As a matter of fact, the present constitution fell down because in the last resort we declined to have non-civil servants, and even possibly members of the Dáil, who are employees of the civil service organisations, sitting on a Civil Service Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, on a point of explanation to Deputy Lemass, that they had an existing machine through which all matters could be dealt with.  I addressed a question to the Minister 18 months ago drawing attention to the fact that there was a refusal to entertain a certain matter, although it was sent through the existing organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House by going over the arguments that have been advanced in favour of an inquiry.  I will point out the special hardships that certain officials in Waterford suffer, where the rates are particularly high owing to the valuation that was carried out by the Government. Rents are high and the cost of living correspondingly high.  The rates are so high in Waterford that it is impossible to start industries in the city.  I mention that as an indication of how it affects the cost of living. The postal workers of Waterford have been most unfairly treated, and have been placed on too low a grade.  They have a grievance.  That is a special reason why the inquiry should be held and real discontent remedied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the argument, and I suggest that it is quite clear to the intelligence of the Minister, to point out that there is an accentuation of the grievance, and that when the question of the standard of living is being dealt with the position of these people shall be taken into consideration, as part of the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>When one finds that there is general discontent amongst a body of people who usually are the quietest section of the community, the lower paid civil servants, and when one finds that discontent expressed in a motion supported by two parties in this House, it should, in my view, be sufficient reason for the Minister to grant that inquiry.  Either there is a legitimate grievance, in which case the Government is doing an injustice to that class of the community, or there is no grievance, and in that case the hands of the Government are so free that they should have no hesitation in granting such inquiry which would settle the matter in a short time.</P>

We will, perhaps, hear complaints about money being required to bring their salaries to a <Col N="344" /> fair scale and to give them a living wage, but, if that question arises, we can consider the question as to where the money could be found.  I suggest, however, at present when the Minister considers that civil servants with £1,500 a year get a cost-of-living bonus of £199 13s. 0d.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A man living in Dublin, where there is no control of prices by the Government, having even £100 a year and getting only £71 10s. as bonus, making a total of £171 10s. 0d., has not sufficient to live on owing to the complete absence of the control of prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this motion, but I feel in regard to civil servants generally that they are in a peculiarly protected position.  As long as they behave themselves and do their work they are sure of their employment.  They have security of tenure and, generally <Col N="346" /> speaking, taking all classes of the service together, they are fairly well paid.  That is, if we compare their position with that of ordinary clerical workers in industrial or commercial life.  They have guaranteed holidays and are fairly generously treated in that way, and also they have a pension to look forward to at the end of their period of work, at the age of 65 or so. Therefore their conditions of life are, generally speaking, far and away better than those of the ordinary worker who may earn in or about the same wage&mdash;sometimes more but more often less&mdash;in industrial and commercial pursuits. I know a considerable number of civil servants in Dublin as there are probably more of them living in my constituency than in any other part of the Free State area.  During the last year or two at frequent intervals I have been meeting numbers of them&mdash; some of them I have known to be in the Service for 20 or 25 years, most of them in the lower grades and some of them with, I am glad to say, large families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of these in the last year or two have stopped me in the street or written to me and complained of what they regard as their unfair and unjust treatment in regard to the cost-of-living-bonus. I said to them, as I say now to the House, that I believe that, on the whole, civil servants are in a much better position than the ordinary clerical worker outside. They have advantages which those other men have not got and we are not such a wealthy community as to be able to afford to be over-generous with the citizens' money.  We have to bear that in mind.  On the other hand, I do not like to see discontent rampant amongst a body of workers such as they are, men who are highly intelligent, well-educated and good citizens who are, generally speaking, a credit to the State.  It would appear from representations made to me at frequent intervals during the last few years that there is much discontent amongst them, especially in the lower grades, as they are described. If anything can be done by the Minister to meet the arguments of these members of the civil service and to satisfy them that their claims <Col N="347" /> are not well-founded, I think it ought to be done.  There are men and women in the Civil Service, even in the lower grades, who are highly intelligent and well-educated, and I believe that they are reasonable people as well, and can put up a good case. From listening to the speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce I know that a good case can be put up on their side.  The Minister for Finance told us that the present position of civil servants here, as compared with those in England, most of them being transferred officers, is not at all bad. The Minister for Industry and Commerce seemed to me to make a good case for the continuance of the present cost-of-living bonus and the basis on which it is founded.  As I say, however, I have heard civil servants make a case in opposition to that and make it in a rather convincing way.  I would, therefore, urge on the Minister that it would be an advantage to him and to the State that these civil servants, who are discontented and who feel that they are suffering under a grievance, should be given an opportunity to put their case before an independent tribunal of some kind.  If the Minister does not agree to have this House set up a tribunal he could himself appoint a tribunal of civil servants, having all classes of the service represented on it, and let the case be put there.</P>
    <P>As I say, these civil servants are reasonable, and if it were demonstrated to them that their case was badly founded, I believe that while you might not satisfy them and while you might not remove all the discontent, you would certainly remove a very big section of the support they have in this House and outside it.  We here do not stand for the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus at the figure at which it now is.  Prices, it is said, are falling.  They have not fallen, as several other speakers have proved, in the City of Dublin very considerably. If we take the whole country you will probably get an average figure showing that there has been a fall in the index figure, but the cost of living certainly in Dublin is high.  I <Col N="348" /> know many of these civil servants and I was speaking recently to one of them, who has eight children.  I went fairly closely with him into the figures and I know how difficult it is for him to make ends meet.  I do wish that the Minister would meet the case of the civil servants by agreeing to a tribunal being set up where the case of both the Minister for Finance and the lower grade civil servants could be put.  I think if that were done you would get a more contented service and, therefore, a more satisfactory service.  I am not saying that, even though they are discontented, civil servants will not do their duty loyally and efficiently.  They will do that no matter what happens, I am sure, but it is not for the good of the Service that there should be such discontent as there is represented to be in it.  I think the House would be wise in impressing on the Minister to do everything that it is possible to do to meet the case put up by the lower grades.  The Minister for Finance seemed to me last night to take an absolutely non-possumus attitude on this.  I think that is not wise, because I am sure that the civil servants have heard over and over again the arguments put up here against their case last night, and they do not seem to be any nearer conviction that their case is not just.  I would urge again on the Minister, and ask Deputies to urge on him to make an earnest endeavour to meet in some way the civil servants of the lower grades in Dublin and elsewhere in the Free State who feel they have a case, and give them an opportunity of putting it forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately the motion, which is too restricted for the mighty lens of Deputy Corry, is quite wide enough for the few sentences I wish to address to the House.  If I understood correctly something which the Minister said last night, he stated that there was a proposal at one time that this matter should come before a tribunal composed of civil servants, and I understood him to say that that had been rejected by the civil servants. I do not know how far that may be true, but even if that is so, I would <Col N="349" /> be inclined to suggest to the Minister, even if he is disinclined to bind his hands to the acceptance of the motion, that he should not leave it where it is. I do say that it is pretty generally known that a certain amount of discontent does exist in the lower grades of the Civil Service.  That cannot be denied.  Some Deputies may suggest that discontent exists amongst all classes and that it can never be satisfied. On the other hand, I am sufficiently old-fashioned to have considerable faith in human reason.  I believe if you give these civil servants an opportunity of putting their case fairly and of getting their grievances examined&mdash;to get it off their chest, to use a vulgarism&mdash;even if you get no definite result you do get rid of discontent amongst a great many people who would otherwise be labouring under a sense of grievance, and you can say to the people of the country as a whole that you have done your best.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that however strong the arguments produced in this House have been they cannot and ought not perhaps to carry the same weight in public opinion as would be carried by the Report of such a Committee.  The motion as I read it does not propose to prejudge in any way the nature of this inquiry.  If for any reason the Minister has made up his mind that he cannot accept this motion in the wide terms in which it is drawn still I would suggest to him again that he would not leave it there but that he should, on his own initiative, carry the matter a step further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that nearly all that could be said in favour of this motion has been said and that anything which could be said in opposition to it has also been said.  I, therefore, do not propose to take up the time of the House at any great length now. But I want to say at the outset that that excellent poseur of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy MacEntee started off by making a suggestion about me. Because I suggested in my opening remarks in support of this motion that I did not want to saddle the Government with all the responsibility and <Col N="350" /> suggested that a Department of the Government was responsible, as I feel at all times that certain Ministers or certain prominent officials have a good deal of say in matters of this kind, Deputy MacEntee compared my attitude to the gentleman in the advertisement who was facing both ways.  Let me suggest that in my view the Fianna Fáil Party must have adopted the Shell sign for use of their official notepaper and Party crest.  Fianna Fáil is the Party that is constantly facing both ways on this and on every issue.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed at the attitude taken up on this matter by the Minister for Finance.  He dragged in a whole lot of matter that was not at all appropriate to the motion before the House and I thought it was rather cheap on his part to attempt to make it appear that this motion, if it were carried by the House, would place further burdens on the farming community or that at least it would delay relief of those burdens to the farming community.</P>
      <P>I consider that is a kind of argument that is very cheap.  It appears to be the growing practice in this House on the part of Ministers to harp back to the farming community.  Every suggestion that is made for the betterment, every suggestion that is made for the social uplift of the people is met by the responsible heads of the various Government Departments by this kind of cheap argument about the unfortunate farmers.  This motion does not seek to place any further burdens on anybody but it does ask that the House should set up a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and report. Personally, I cannot see what objection there could be in the Department of Finance to this inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested the other evening when resuming the discussion on this motion that it was a fair proposition.  You are simply asked to examine the case.  It may be that in the course of this inquiry certain facts would be adduced which might lead to a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus to certain higher officials.  But the plea I make is on behalf of the lower-paid civil servants, <Col N="351" /> particularly the men in the cities of the Saorstát who are married and have families to maintain.  I stressed the fact that the most important item of such a man's household expenditure is by way of rent.  I have also pointed out to the Minister and to the House that you cannot expect to have a satisfied Civil Service when certain grades are kept on the poverty level.  I am not making any appeal whatever for the higher-paid officials in the Service.  The appeal I make in this motion is for an inquiry to be set up to report on the present method of the computation of the cost-of-living bonus.  I do not want to detain the House at any length.  I feel that the mind of the Government <Col N="352" /> Party is made up, my mind is made up and I do not want to detain the House at any very great length.  I ask you to put this motion from the Chair.</P>

      <P>The only thing we can discuss on this Bill is the Title.  We consider that the Bill should be called a preliminary Bill for the abolition of juries.  We had to listen to that type of cynical prosecutor mind to an alien government yesterday, namely to Deputy Jasper Wolfe, who threw ridicule upon the institution because in his opinion it never seemed to carry out justice.  Naturally from his own experience he only saw the thing from the point of view of what was then an alien government.  His whole speech and attitude of mind shows that he saw in it the satisfaction of his anti-national bias.  Therefore, I suggest that the Title of the Bill is entirely wrong, that instead of calling it the Juries (Protection) Bill it should be called a preliminary measure for the abolition of the jury system in Ireland altogether.</P>

I consider that the Title of <Col N="358" /> this Bill is completely wrong.  I think the Title should be &ldquo;a special Bill for the conviction of innocent prisoners.&rdquo;  It is a Bill for packing juries, nothing more or less.

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a scandal in the present state of this country that we should be asked to vote, all told, £25,822 for the upkeep of the Governor-General's establishment and for his personal salary.  Ministers to-day turned down an investigation into the cost-of-living bonus of the lower grade civil servants, some of whom have only £75 or £100 per year.  The Minister blandly comes along after that and asks us, without any explanation whatsoever, to vote £25,822 for the upkeep of one establishment.  There could be no argument put forward for the spending of that amount of money in the present circumstances of the country.  Even though Ministers are convinced that this is a necessary establishment, it certainly is not necessary to spend that amount of money upon it.  If we take one item alone, there is £9,305 being spent on accommodation, buildings, furniture, fuel, lighting, etc.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Public Accounts Committee were examining some of the expenses incurred under this Vote and they found that the Government had granted a sum of £232 towards giving the Governor-General a grand piano.  When the Committee examined into the matter they discovered that this was altogether a new arrangement; that the previous Governor-General, or any person who occupied a similar post as King's representative here, never had a grand piano supplied to him.  They also found that very large sums of money were spent in buying linen, cutlery and other things for this establishment.  The Committee were convinced that this should not be, and certainly were convinced that a man drawing £10,000 per year in salary out of this comparatively poor country should not get £232 to supply himself with a musical instrument.  He should be able to buy himself a musical instrument out of the £10,000.  I think it is a scandal, considering the things that Ministers have turned down, that this waste should be allowed to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we asked for some relief for the old age pensioners it was turned down on the plea that there was no money, and, as I pointed out, an <Col N="361" /> inquiry into the cost-of-living bonus for the lower grade civil servants was also turned down.  Everything that might tend to alleviate distress amongst people with no wages, or people with low wages, is turned down by Ministers, but they pile on taxes on the already over-taxed people to supply men like the Governor-General, who have large salaries, with further luxuries.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking in Carlow I think it was, said that we would have to have economy at the top, in the middle and at the bottom.  The Government have certainly been practising economy at the bottom.  They have economised to the extent of £600,000 per year on the old age pensioners, and they are piling on further taxes on these old age pensioners to give additional luxuries to gentlemen like the Governor-General. I think it is a disgrace, and I hope the House will not pass the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with Deputy Aiken in protesting against voting this sum of money.  The attitude of this Party is well known in this matter.  We believe that this establishment, if it cannot be done away with, should at least be run in accordance with the circumstances of this country.  There has been a slight reduction in the Vote, but the Minister has not vouchsafed any information of it.  I wonder what is the explanation?  The Comptroller of the Household is, I believe, a very important official, who looks after the entertainment of distinguished foreign visitors, in whose well-being, while they remain in this country, the Government have shown themselves to be specially interested.  If the establishment can be run without the services of the Comptroller of the Household, it seems to me that economy might be effected all the way down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Aiken pointed out, the £3,300 that we are now asked to vote is of course, only a small proportion of the entire expenditure.  The £10,000 for the Governor-General's salary is carried on the Central Fund, and £9,305 has already been voted to the Board of Works for accommodation, <Col N="362" /> etc.  The date of the termination of office of the present occupant of the post is in sight, and I have no doubt that the question of who will take up the position when the present occupant leaves is one that must be causing great anxiety to the Government.  We have seen statements in the English Press, which seems to be in the confidence occasionally of Ministers, of the intention to fill up the post when it becomes vacant next year.  I suggest to the Government that when the present holder vacates the post there will be an opportunity of going into the whole matter, and of reducing the expenditure on the whole establishment to something that the country will regard as reasonable and proper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken has called attention to the attitude of the Government in other matters.  I at any rate have always stressed the fact that when we come to effect economies the place where we ought to begin is at the top. As far as I know the occupant of this post has not and is not likely in the future, to contribute anything from his income to the upkeep of this establishment, although I see under Sub-head E, with regard to motor cars, there is a note which says &ldquo;All expenses in connection with the maintenance and running of the cars will fall upon the Governor-General.&rdquo;  As far as I know everything in connection with the establishment, including items of a personal nature, have to be provided by the State.  If a British peer or nobleman with substantial private income held the position and was able to carry on the establishment and to be of benefit to this country the matter would be on an entirely different plane. But here is an establishment every penny of the cost of which has to come out of the taxpayers' pocket.  Even if we accept the Minister's attitude that it is necessary that a certain dignity should be preserved I submit there is great room for economy under the heads I have read out.  If the Ministry feel that it is too late in the day to interfere while the present occupant holds the position, I think, when the new arrangements are being made, the matter ought to be looked into.  I am satisfied, and I think there is a large <Col N="363" /> body of feeling in the country that holds the view that any lead that the Governor-General is giving to the country socially is not really worth the cost.  Anything that is being done in this country towards gaelicising it or for the building up of Irish industries, is very often off-set by the very bad example given here as well as in other quarters.  There is no proof that in the matter of Irish manufacture or in the matter of lavish expenditure on entertainments we are getting a return for the money.  I urge the Minister to go into this question more carefully so that in next year's estimates we will be able to see some more substantial reduction in the Vote than we find at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also desire to protest against this expenditure which we are called upon to vote this morning.  It is true that in this we are only asked to vote £5,041, but we should remember that that is only part of the total expenditure in connection with the Governor-General's Department amounting to £25,822.  In another Vote the House will be asked for a sum of £10,000 the annual salary of the Governor-General.  In view of the unemployment and poverty existing in this country at the present time I believe that money could be expended in a much better way.  For instance we hear of a certain campaign launched by the Government in regard to economy and of endeavours made right through the country as far as the Department of the Minister for Finance is concerned through the secret instructions sent out to pensions officers to cut down old age pensions and to endeavour, as far as possible, to deprive old age pensioners of the pensions to which they are legally and justly entitled.  But when it comes to a Vote of this description, in view of the fact that the House will be asked for a further Vote of £10,000 for the Governor-General's salary&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not on the Estimates at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise it is not on the Estimates, and I understand it is statutory and that it was <Col N="364" /> one of the stipulations laid down at the signing of the Treaty.  But then it was understood that the jurisdiction of the Governor-General was to embrace thirty-two counties, whereas it turned out that it was only to embrace twenty-six counties and, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Governor-General is lessened.  If that is so I think a good case could be made out why the salary which was then agreed on should be lessened.  I do not think that a person with a salary of £10,000 a year should expect £5,041 for other purposes.  I suggest the Government are absolutely inconsistent in their attitude.  We have the Minister for Local Government refusing to allow the Donegal County Council to increase the rate of wages for Donegal road workers from 26/- to 30/- a week owing to the fact that 26/- a week is reckoned by the Executive Council as a sufficient rate for a labourer to live upon, keep his family, house, clothe and feed them.  On the other hand we have the Governor-General in receipt of £10,000 a year now asking for a Vote of £5,041.  I hope all Deputies irrespective of party in view of the poverty and the unemployment there is will not vote these large sums of money for that purpose.  The Minister for Local Government in a speech in Kildare said that emigration was decreasing and that there is not so much poverty in the country, but the Minister knows that the decrease in emigration is owing to the regulations which prevent people getting into other countries at present.  Owing to the fact that so much poverty does exist I suggest Deputies in all parties should register their protest against this Vote by going into the Lobby against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this Vote.  I think it is rather an extraordinary procedure and illustrates what is in the minds of the Ministry to have the two matters discussed to-day taken on the one day, that is, the motion in reference to the bonus paid to the lower grade civil servants, and this Vote now for £15,822 for the upkeep of the house and establishment, in addition <Col N="365" /> to £10,000 for the salary of the Governor-General.  I think that is a scandalous proceeding and one that should end.  The more we examine this Vote the more we wonder what is in the minds of the Government.  I remember in my young days, when learning my catechism, the passage: &ldquo;What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&rdquo;  I would expect from a religious man like the President of the Executive Council, who, in Press photographs, always appears between two bishops, that he, too, would take that into consideration. The Estimate shows that for the care of the Governor-General's body we have A.D.C.'s paid £300 a year.  That is a nice salary, but the poor chaplain only gets £150.  The President of the Executive Council considers that the care of the Governor-General's soul is worth only half the amount allowed for the care of his body.  It is a rather extraordinary thing to find that the President of the Executive Council who pretends to be such a religious man should agree to this.  I strongly object to the proposal to provide £2,000 for a new aeroplane for the Governor-General. Fancy expenditure of that kind to enable the Governor-General to sail around the country over the people's heads.  I think a proposal of that kind is a disgrace.  Although it does not appear in the Estimate we know that the Minister for Finance sanctioned an expenditure of £250 for a piano for the Governor-General's establishment.  At the same time, we have a wireless broadcasting station to supply him with music from stations all over the world.  If he wants to hear music let him go out to some of the slums which are not situate too far away from his residence, and he will hear numbers of starving children crying for bread, while he himself is costing this State £25,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate does not represent fully what the Governor-General is costing.  He visited Cork recently.  I was there on that day attending a meeting of the County Council.  At almost every street corner in the city I saw four or five big, rough-looking customers with bulging hip-pockets.  I would like to know what his visit to <Col N="366" /> Cork cost?  How much was spent on the transport of troops there and on these new C.I.D. men?  What did it cost to send all these gentlemen to Cork to protect the Governor-General on his tour?  The Governor-General is provided with a house, but in addition there is provision in the Estimate for £9,305 to meet the cost of furniture, fuel and light.  Surely to goodness that is a scandal when we remember all the rows that were kicked up in this House as to the need for providing money to build houses for the people and to take the unfortunate men and women and their families who are living in one-roomed tenements in Dublin out of them.  The upkeep of a house for one man costs over £9,000 a year, while you have the conditions that I refer to in the City of Dublin and other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies on the opposite side will take courage and vote against this Estimate.  I notice and it is rather strange that only the hardened sinners have remained on the opposite side. The others have cleared out so that they will not hear what is going on here.  Later they will come in with cotton wool in their ears and walk around legislating with their feet.  I suppose we cannot help that.  I would like to have an explanation as to why there is a special army provided for the Governor-General at a cost of £746.  Would this money be for special uniforms for Army officers?  I notice that we are also paying £575 a year in rates on the Governor-General's house.  That will be an interesting item for the poor farmer down the country who sees his last cow being driven away because he is unable to pay his rates.  But provision is made to pay out of the pockets of these poor people £575 in rates on the Governor-General's house.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on printing is not very heavy.  The Post Office charges, I observe, are £85.  Is the position this: that we have actually to stamp the letters of the Governor-General? We certainly should not have to do that in the case of a man with £10,000 a year.  I find that the butler has been done away with in the Governor-General's Establishment. <Col N="367" /> That being so, I expect he will have to cook his own grub in future.  I do not think that is fair.  I think that the removal of the butler is a calamity. What does the Private Secretary to the Governor-General do with the salary of £350 a year that is provided? It would be rather amusing to learn what the Private Secretary's job is. Is it to hold the rubber stamp that the Governor-General has to put on Bills that are run through here at a mile a minute?  When Bills that would be of any assistance to the country are introduced we find the Minister for Finance getting up on his hind legs and saying &ldquo;I object.&rdquo;  Would the duty of the Private Secretary be to hold up the ladies' trains when they are walking about?  At that rate, he must have a rather tough job.  It may be that his duty is to hand around the cream to the ladies at garden parties.</P>
    <P>I notice the Governor-General has an allowance for personal secretarial assistance.  What is the meaning of that £350?  Is it that there are two private secretaries in the job?  I suppose that so many ladies attend the garden parties that two private secretaries are required to hand around the strawberries and cream.  When we find such things in the Estimate we surely must say that this is a funny country and that it is a comical Government that puts this kind of thing before it. There is the provision of £3,000 for the maintenance of the Governor-General's official residence while at the same time buildings, furniture, fuel and light are provided at a cost of £9,305.  There seems to be a duplication of services there.  There is £200 a year for travelling expenses and £240 for a motor car. Is it that the Governor-General wants a new motor car every year?  We have been told that all the expenses in connection with the running of the car will fall on the Governor-General.  At the same time, we have this £200 for travelling expenses and £240 for the motor car.  Was there ever such a fraud as to provide him with £240 for a car?  Surely he does not buy a new car every year and even if he does, what is the £200 in travelling expenses for?  These are matters on which I <Col N="368" /> would like to have an explanation from the Minister for Finance, if he is able to give me one or if he is not going to be tongue-tied on the matter.</P>
    <P>We also find that the telegrams and telephone calls in connection with the Governor-General's Establishment are paid for out of this Vote.  What does he spend his £10,000 a year salary on? The clothes on his back are paid for by the State as well as the tablecloths and the knives and forks for his table. Everything possible is provided for him by the State and in addition he has this salary of £10,000 a year.  Surely a man with that salary ought to be able to buy the clothes that go on his back without the State providing them for him.  He ought, too, out of that salary to be able to provide himself with musical instruments without expecting the unfortunate people of this State to meet the cost of them.</P>
    <P>While all that is going on we have, as Deputy Cassidy pointed out and as I know myself to be the case in Cork, unfortunate men with their wives and families trying to live on a maximum wage of 26s. a week.  This is the Free State.  It is a freak State all right. I think it is time this ended and I hope the House will put an end to it to-day. The only way it can be ended is by Deputies voting against the Estimate. There is no use in Deputies who have remained outside while this Estimate is under discussion going down to their constituents with a lot of soft talk about the prosperity of the country and of the money that is going to be given next year for the building of houses, and then coming in here to vote for this huge sum of money for one man and the upkeep of his house. We have been told that there is no money to give an extra shilling to the old age pensioners or to give relief to the farmers and that we cannot afford to pay more than 26s. a week to workmen. That is not the kind of economy that should be practised.  The kind of economy that has been practised has gone so far as to take the shoe allowance from the Civic Guards.  There is plenty of room for economy on this Vote and I hope the Deputies will come in and vote against it.</P>
    <P>Surely no Deputy is going to be <Col N="369" /> callous enough to vote for the like of that.  I appeal to Deputies to end it. It is time it was ended.  There is only one way of ending it, and I think it is time that we took steps to end it in that way.  I should like to hear, before the debate concludes, what the Economy Committee had to say to this matter.  Has there been any report from the Economy Committee for the last five years dealing with it?  Surely the leader of the Farmers' Party, who is chairman of the Economy Committee, should either report to the House or get out?  Otherwise let him resign the chairmanship of the Economy Committee and tell us that it never sat and never will sit, or let the House have a report about this Vote.  We do not know what is being done under this Vote.  Perhaps next week or the week after, when the Public Accounts Committee examine the Estimate, they will find that £50 or £60 is required for a cradle.  Week after week, and month after month we do not know what demand we will have.  It is time that ended.  I would like an explanation about that.  It appears that £252 was spent on a piano for this gentleman. I hope that the money for the aeroplane will not be passed.  Perhaps the next thing we will have will be a demand for a special midwife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this Estimate, irrespective of the incidental details for telegrams and motor cars, on the grounds that the Governor-General is a concrete symbol of the slave status of this part of Ireland.  I object to voting any money, even one solitary pound, for the upkeep of the establishment of the direct representative, not alone of the British King, but the British Empire and all that it stands for.  Apart from that, I remember reading some time ago in the debates that took place during 1921 that some of the Deputies at that time put forward the argument that the Governor-General's establishment would be a centre of Anglicising influence in this State, while some Deputies who supported the Treaty put forward the argument that it would not; that, on the other hand, a citizen of the Irish Free State being appointed as a representative of the <Col N="370" /> British Crown would rather be a centre of a Gaelicising influence, to help the Government in the work of saving the Irish language and Irish culture.  What do we find ten years after?  We have very little evidence of any attempt on the part of an occupant of the office of Governor-General to help in any way in the Gaelicisation of this State, or in upholding its culture.  We find the chief representative of this State, the head of the State, deputising for the British King and attending football matches under foreign auspices.</P>

      <P>What I want to indicate to the Deputy is that the Governor-General is in a particular position, and that his actions are not open to criticism on an Estimate.  If the Deputy gives the matter some consideration, he will find that he is opening up a very wide field.  I think the actions of the representative of the Crown cannot be discussed on an Estimate at all.  We are discussing the provision of moneys by the Minister for Finance, as a matter of fact, and not the actions of the Governor-General.</P>

He has important duties to carry out, and can do an immensity of good for the trade of a country.  There is no doubt about that.  In present circumstances it is worth our while to keep the rubber stamp here&mdash;if we may call him so in such disrespectful terms.  We want more trade.</P>

      <P>We can see what can be done for trade in other countries by the head of the State, and there is no reason why the same should not apply here.  So long as we have a head of the State here, he must have a sufficient amount of money to enable him to carry out his duties properly.  We all know perfectly well that the money which he gets is spent in the country and is not spent out of it.  The house in which the Governor-General lives must be maintained unless we allow it to fall into ruin or turn it into a school.  That house cannot be kept up for nothing.  It would be foolish economy to allow any part of our property to fall into disrepair simply because we would not maintain it.</P>

I want to make it quite clear that I am not in favour of a British nobleman.</P>

      <P>As to the amount which the Governor-General gets I do not think that anyone will cavil at it.  Anyone who knows anything about the cost of keeping up an establishment of that kind knows that the amount set down here is the very lowest that could be given.  I have heard it said that in the old days when the Lord Lieutenant got about £20,000 a year, all of that sum used to be spent in Dublin between December and March and that the rest of the expenditure for the remainder of the year had to come out of his own pocket.  I do not think it is desirable that that should occur now. We are on our own, and it is for us to see that the individual who carries out the work of the State, and is the rubber stamp of the State, should be properly maintained and put into a position to do credit to the country which he represents.  So long as we have a head of the State here or a rubber stamp to carry out our official work, he should be maintained and properly paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I hope that when next we come to discuss the Governor-General's Estimate Deputy Wolfe will be able to apply some other adjective than &ldquo;futile&rdquo; to it and that this debate will have had some effect.  We are always asked, when discussing this Estimate, to consider the dignity of the office, the dignity of the position of the person who fills that office.  My philosophy is that no individual in any State can reflect anything but the dignity of the people of the State and that the greatest dignity of any State is the dignity of its people, the dignity of the citizens of the State.  When we come to consider what is called the dignity of the Governor-General and his office we should try and consider what is the dignity or indignity of the 60,000 people who are in need of proper housing accommodation, the dignity or indignity of 78,000 people living in one-roomed dwellings in the <Col N="376" /> City of Dublin where an endeavour is made to bring up boys and girls in a decent way.  We should further consider whether the amount of money we are voting for the office of the Governor-General reflects the dignity of these people or whether we would not be giving greater dignity to the office if we were to curtail the expenses and employ that money towards the relief of these people to whom I am referring.</P>
      <P>We are told that he is a representative of a King, that he is head of this State, in possibly a formal fashion and in possibly more than a formal fashion, but when one considers the position of the 50,000 or 60,000 unemployed, the 78,000 wretchedly housed people and the 60,000 houses needed we should ask exactly what is the position of the holder of the office of Governor-General? We find out that his salary will give him £1 5s. per hour at £10,000 per year.  £1 5s. per hour! Surely if any Deputy in the House, or any citizen in the State was offered £1 5s. per hour and asked to live on it, he would pay his telegrams and his telephone bills, pay for his stationery, for his wireless set and for his grand pianos.  Yet it is not £1 5s. per hour alone that is paid for this dignity that is super-imposed, for it it is a super-imposed dignity, on the citizens of the State.  It is not £1 5s. per hour alone that is being asked.  It is £3 per hour that the establishment of the Governor-General is costing the people of the State&mdash;£3 per hour or £72 per day.  That is an enormous sum when one contrasts what could be done with the money if it were made available for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been made a matter of complaint that people are finding fault with this year after year.  We are finding fault with it and why should we not find fault with it when a national calamity continues year after year?  Does Deputy Wolfe think that when we spoke of this last year and that when that national calamity continued into this year that we should not continue to talk about it this year?  So far as I am concerned I <Col N="377" /> have protested against it every year since I came into the Dáil and I will continue to protest against it as long as that calamity lasts.  I suppose we can do nothing but protest and point out to the average taxpayer of the country, to the unemployed, to the houseless people, to the people living in wretched slums, that the taxpayer is paying £3 per hour for the maintenance of an office which is of no advantage to the citizens of the State, and that there is no legal compulsion on the Government to vote all that money.  Let us say that you have to pay him all this money, this £10,000 a year; then we can vote something less for the upkeep of the establishment.  Is it necessary to vote £26,000, £3 per hour, for this establishment? Surely the legal advisers of the Government know that it is not advisable to vote all that money and leave the other problems of the State without attention.  Somebody has suggested to me that they should appoint a Crown harpist and a court jester for him.  Probably the Minister will remember that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe's remarks were interesting on this matter.  I agree with him that the State should have a head, but the head of that State should represent the culture of the country and should have the support of the people generally.  Instead of that the Governor-General in this country is in a dual capacity.  He is head of the State and he also represents the over-lordship of the British power over us.  Instead of being a dignity in the eyes of the people it is an indignity and a source of ridicule.  He is called by way of excuse a rubber stamp, and from that it develops into terms of abuse. If I were a supporter of the head of the State I should certainly resent his being called a rubber stamp.  I should regard him as a person who was in some way or other an expression of the culture of the country and at the same time a social centre for the cultural activities of the country, but by his function he can never represent anything but British culture in Ireland. That culture is no doubt a very excellent thing in Britain, but in Ireland <Col N="378" /> it is alien to the people and can never be of any value to the country, but a source of hostility, bitterness and contempt.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe also referred to this office as a chain.  It is a chain.  That is the way the people regard it.  Not merely the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, but even supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party look with coldness on the activities of the Governor-General, and if they could get rid of the whole office they would do so willingly.  We are not in a position to discuss the abolition of the office of Governor-General on this Vote, so I will not follow Deputy Wolfe when he throws out the challenge and says that we must accept him.  We cannot follow him on that argument.  The only thing we can do is to cut as much as we can off this Estimate, to cut down this unnecessary and undignified expenditure of the national resources under this Vote. If we could reduce the position of the Governor-General to such an extent that he could get the dole, say 15/- a week, that he would have to queue up with the rest of the unemployed, it would represent much more nearly the general feeling of the people of Ireland, except a very small section of the pro-British people.  If he was put in the position of one of the ordinary unemployed and made to queue up for 15/- a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, sir.  I remember the Phoenix Park and the Viceregal Lodge fifty years ago. One fine morning the students of Castleknock College walked down to the Fifteen Acres.  There were 5,000 red-coats assembled there.  They were just about to start a sham battle. Suddenly we heard the booming of cannon and then one of the earls about whom Deputy Derrig spoke came along with a grand crowd of scarlet and gold followers around him.  They came into the ground and thousands of our countrymen and women were there. What was that gesture?  It was a gesture that we were under the foot of a foreign power.  I walked again up to the Phoenix Park within the last month.  I took a stroll in that direction. I passed the Viceregal Lodge and I heard, not the booming of cannon, but just at 12 o'clock, as I stood right before the building, I heard the Angelus bell.  I was struck immediately by the wonderful change that had taken place.  A brave and glorious band of young Irishmen came along in later days who made it possible to have the Angelus bell rung at the Viceregal Lodge.  Within the Lodge there was a representative of the clan, that great Irish clan that centuries ago on the Hill of Tara ruled the entire of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Governor-General is there as a token and a sign to all who come to the Free State that there is welcome and hospitality waiting for them.  If there was a necessity, I am sure he would put them up for the night.  He receives great statesmen, and the other day he received representatives of the Medical Faculty from the Golden Gate of San Francisco to New York.  They came over here to admire our institutions. People came here also from other countries to see for themselves the progress we are making.  Are we to be so miserable here, as Deputy Cassidy suggested, that we will not even offer them refreshments or extend to them the hospitality they deserve when they come to admire the wonderful progress that this little State has made?  Deputy Flinn may jeer, but in his heart of hearts he knows that Tim Sheehy is right.

We tolerated a good deal of that kind of thing and, personally, I have been a good deal amused by it, but I think it is time that it was stopped.  I think that a representative of Cork should not deliberately and continuously make this House a place of ridicule.  Flunkeyism is the price that we pay for the political convenience of a crown.  Servility apparently is the price which we are prepared to continue to pay for the political inconvenience of a Governor-General.

    <P>What does it profit this nation or any other nation that it should have all the tinsel and ceremony of Government, that it should have the simulacra of a Court, that it should have some centre of pretended source of honour when, as was pointed out by Deputy Hogan, what you have is merely a scab upon a sore?  Underneath all this ceremonial expenditure you have the poverty and the degradation of a people made poorer and made degraded by the very people whose symbol we are asked to honour. Face the realities.  The best that has been said to-day for this symbol is that he is the caretaker of the Viceregal Lodge.  That is the best case that has been put forward.  If he were not there we would have to put in a <Col N="382" /> housekeeper.  Has any other case been put forward, except the case submitted by Deputy Sheehy that we are to keep a hiking hostel in the Phoenix Park for someone who may want to be put up for the week-end?  Has it been suggested that the dignity of this State, the dignity of this people, has been benefited by the continued existence of that symbol or by continued expenditure upon that symbol?  The case has gone by default.</P>
    <P>Of course we have the stupidity that belongs to servility, that belongs to flunkeyism, which can find for protests of this character in the name of the people of the country nothing but the word &ldquo;futile.&rdquo;  It is futile.  This House is futile and stupidly futile unless it is prepared to face up to the realities and to see that the very narrow resources of this State are turned into the channels which have been indicated by Deputy Hogan and not into channels of artificial snobbery and flunkeyish ceremony.  I I have no strong feeling, and I never expressed any strong feeling, in relation to the Governor-General.  To me he is merely a symbol, one of the symptoms, and I do not care twopence half-penny about symptoms.  What I am concerned with is the reality which he represents.  Being there, he declares to the world that somebody in this country in the name of Ireland professes to be satisfied with the manner in which those of whom that man is a symbol have deliberately divided our people into two separate and distinct legal entities.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary to say anything in reply to the remarks that we have heard from the opposite side. I should like to say that Deputy Corry's exposition of the case was quite a fitting exposition.  I would like to say one or two things.  I have <Col N="383" /> said them before, but I may as well repeat them, as repetition is the order of the day.  I am satisfied that no matter what the constitutional position was here, there would have to be a representative head of the State who would undertake certain public duties, not of a political character.  I believe, as I say, that no matter what the Constitution of the State was, that the expenditure would not be less than the present expenditure.  I have said already, and I believe it firmly, that if we had a separate Republic here the office of the President of that Republic would, one way or another, involve more expenditure than is involved in the office of the Governor-General. When Deputies talk about lavish expenditure they apparently have no idea at all of what they are talking about.  Certainly on the money that is provided here for the Governor-General there can be no such thing as lavish expenditure on entertainments. I do not think that lavish entertainments would be necessary.  I think a certain amount of entertainment is necessary.  All States find it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes it is difficult to find out what the exact costs of an office are. Our system enables one to calculate the costs.  It enables the exact cost to be shown.  In some other States you have small salaries and all sorts of things provided out of the Army and other Votes, so that it is impossible to find out in those cases what the whole cost is.  Here we show it.  I do not think it is unduly large.  I believe myself that if the political circumstances were different and if the office of the Governor-General were not a matter of controversy that it would be in the <Col N="384" /> national and economic interests of the country to look at the matter in a broad way, and that it would be desirable to spend more money than is being spent on the office of the Governor-General and of the activities connected with it.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind here that we are close up against another country more populous and richer, a country which, we all know, has many attractions for large numbers of people of this country&mdash;has attractions even for those who pretend it has none and who pretend to have extreme political views.  I do think myself that if the political circumstances were different and if this were not a matter of controversy that it would be for the national good to spend considerably more than is being spent now.  The Governor-General is not the representative of over-lordship.  The Governor-General is the representative of the full control of the people in this country.  He is chosen by the Government of this country.  He is responsible to the Government of this country.  He acts on the advice of Ministers who have derived their authority solely from the people of this country.  He has no authority of a political kind.  Therefore the suggestion that the Governor-General represents over-lordship is entirely absurd.  With reference to the one point of the piano: as it was mentioned by the Public Accounts Committee, in my view in an establishment of this sort that is an item of furniture that ought to be there.  I think the objections that were raised to it are entirely absurd.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be reduced by £175 in respect of Item J.&rdquo;  As a result of the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on another matter a few moments ago I do not know exactly what the limits are in regard to a discussion like that. There is very little to be said on it, and I do not propose to go into it in <Col N="388" /> detail except to say that in my opinion it is money absolutely thrown away.  This whole item for the British Empire Parliamentary Association is money absolutely thrown into the dust heap.  Nobody reads the publications in the first place and in the second place a copy in the Library would be sufficient.</P>
      <P>Even though that money is not of considerable moment it is a symbol of the waste that goes on in other Departments in this administration.  I submit that it is but another symbol of this obnoxious connection and suggest that the House should eliminate it from the Vote or reduce it by a sum which would not enable the Association concerned to supply the journals which are sent here for burning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the argument of Deputy Mullins in this matter.  It seems to me to vote £250 to supply journals to Deputies is sheer waste.  Any one who takes the trouble will see these parcels which come to us lying unopened in the House, in the Committee Rooms and on the tables.  No doubt some Deputies may read them and if an arrangement could be made whereby the Deputies who want to read them could notify the Ceann Comhairle it would be more economical.  The whole procedure cannot be described in any other terms than as sheer waste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies were deprived of the bound volumes of the Official Report on the lines of economy.  I think it an extraordinary procedure that these volumes which were of great use to the Deputies should be taken from them on the grounds of economy and that £250 should be voted for this item.  The greater portion of this money is devoted to the removing of this stuff from the Oireachtas.  No one reads it.  Half of it is left in the office from which Deputies will not remove it.  The remainder is taken out of the Committee Rooms and thrown into the shelves.  I think it is a scandalous procedure that £250 should be paid for it.  It is a waste of public money. <Col N="389" /> I have seen it been brought out of the Committee Rooms, even out of the Cumann na nGaedheal rooms.  I have seen piles of it lying in the Deputies' lockers and they will not remove it. I certainly support Deputy Mullins in the removal of this item in the Estimate.</P>

It is posted to each Deputy separately and on each wrapper there is a postage stamp of 9d.  I presume we have to pay that 9d. If the Minister is not going to consider Deputy Mullins' suggestion would he be prepared to arrange that it would be sent in another manner than by post, to each person?  It is agreed that very few people bother opening the book.</P>

I think it is interesting and essential for us to know what are the modern developments in industry and in agriculture that are taking place in countries which are our rivals in certain markets. For instance I think it is essential that we should know along what lines New Zealand is developing its butter industry.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most convenient ways of finding it out as far as I am concerned.  There may be other ways open to the Deputy.  I find that journal a very interesting <Col N="390" /> document.  I do not know whether Deputy Mullins reads it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; that has got on Deputy Mullins' nerves and on Deputy Corry's also.  There is too much attention being given to that rather than to the reality of the thing.  The reality is that we have countries like Canada, New Zealand and Australia engaged in certain work very much like that upon which we are engaged.  It is interesting to me to know how other countries are viewing problems which are very much like our own problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that from that point of view alone it serves a very useful purpose.  If we are to have no association whatever with those countries let us say that openly but let us not, because of the rather unfortunate name, I admit, that is attached to this publication, throw aside the reality that we have to pay attention to these things and take an interest in them.  I wish we could get a journal, not alone dealing with these countries but with all countries, giving extracts from the Parliamentary proceedings.  I really do not see that there is any principle involved in this amendment.  Deputy Mullins did not show that there was any principle involved in it.  It is a question of the opinion and the convenience of members.  If some people do not wish to read it there are others who do.  It is quite possible that the arrangement suggested by Deputy Lemass might be made that only those who are prepared to read it should get it.  I do not think that if <Col N="391" /> Deputy Corry or Deputy Mullins throws them into the waste-paper basket they should deprive others of the privilege of reading these publications which they take an interest in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy O'Connell's line of argument. It seems to me that if we were to follow his argument to a logical conclusion that any Deputy who wanted a book or journal should be supplied with it at the public expense.  If copies of this publication were available in the Library any Deputy who really wanted to see it could do so and it could be got at comparatively small expense, whereas now copies are being sent to Deputies who say that they do not want them.  The only reason I can see why a book like that should be circulated to the Deputies at the public expense would be if there was some propaganda idea behind it.  If the purpose is to force into our hands some material which those who force it into our hands would like us to read then I could understand why the House should go out of its way to put it into the hands of Deputies, in order to convert them to some particular point of view.  If it is a question of getting information, that point would be met if a sufficient number of copies were secured for the Library.  I find it very difficult to follow the line of reasoning that has been put forward by Deputy O'Connell.  I also think it is a waste of money.  £250 could be very much better spent than in purchasing these volumes.  No useful purpose is served by sending around these volumes that could not be served by having copies available in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell advised Deputy Corry to read the Empire Parliamentary Report, and in the same breath said he did not know why Deputy Mullins moved to reduce the Vote only by £175 out of £250.  I think if Deputy O'Connell spent less time reading the Empire Parliamentary Report and a little more time in studying the rules of this <Col N="392" /> House he would find that Deputy Mullins could not move to reduce the Estimate by more than the unexpended balance of £175.  I think it is ridiculous that Deputy O'Connell should force on every Deputy in the House a copy of a book that he himself wants to read. Everyone knows that the waste paper baskets go out loaded with these Empire books after they lie around in everybody's way for a couple of months.  I think it is a waste of public money.  I suppose a copy would only cost a shilling.  That would be twelve shillings per year for Deputy O'Connell's copies.  It is too much to ask that the State should pay £250 for what Deputy O'Connell can get by spending twelve shillings himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We consider that a far more useful purpose could be served with this money.  For instance, I went into the Library the other day.  I wanted for reference copies of Pearse's works.  I could not find them.  There is no proper set of books of national reference in the Library, whereas here we are spending money upon a paper which I read from time to time and which is thoroughly unsatisfactory, because it is so brief that you cannot follow with any intelligent understanding the mere summary and set of quotations from various countries.  It is impossible to give a really satisfactory report of these various institutions in a volume of that kind.  It does not give you a proper knowledge of what is going on in these institutions.  If this money was devoted to establishing a proper library of national reference&mdash;and it would not require a great deal of money to do that&mdash;I think it would be far better spent than on this book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this question that Deputies who have taken part in the debate seem to have missed.  This Empire Parliamentary Association is somewhat of a cooperative business.  If we do not make this contribution the Free State reports will not appear in the journal. It is not merely that individual members will not get the journal, but <Col N="393" /> that the Free State reports will not appear in it.  I think that this money, therefore, serves two purposes, and from that point of view it is well spent. A number of Deputies undoubtedly do not read the journal.  I think it would be well worth their while if they did. They would be clearer in regard to a number of matters.  A fair number of Deputies do read it.  There is no doubt that interest is taken by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth in the proceedings here.  In view of our particular relationship, of certain difficulties that have had to be met and overcome, and certain other difficulties that are still in process of being dealt with, it is distinctly useful that our position and our proceedings here should be brought before the eyes <Col N="394" /> of politicians in the different Parliaments of the Commonwealth.  From that point of view alone I think that the expenditure would be worth while. We are at the present time, and were in the old days, inclined, perhaps, to over-rate the question of propaganda and the importance of having the point of view that was held here brought to the notice of people outside. But I do think in this particular matter, having regard to the constitutional position, even if no member of the Oireachtas were to read the journal, it would still be worth this particular expenditure.</P>
