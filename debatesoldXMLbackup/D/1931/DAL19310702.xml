    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received a communication from the Cavan County Council agreeing to the Lough Oughter, River Erne and Annalee River Drainage Scheme, which he proposed, and when he intends to hold the first inquiry in Cavan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been informed of the Cavan County Council's agreement to the River Erne and Annalee proposed drainage district and have instructed their engineer to prepare a detailed drainage scheme for submission to the votes of the occupiers of affected lands.  The preparation of this scheme will take some time and it must then be exhibited locally for a month to afford each rated occupier of affected land an opportunity to vote upon it. Until the result of the voting on the scheme has been ascertained, it will not be known whether or not a public inquiry will be held because, if more than 50 per cent. of the occupiers dissent from the scheme, the Commissioners will take no further action in regard to it.  Accordingly it cannot be stated at present when, if at all, an inquiry will be held.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that grave discontent and dissatisfaction <Col N="1350" /> exists amongst the lower grade workers affected by the reduction in wages recommended by the Railway Wages Board; and if he is further aware that steps are being taken by the workers to bring about a strike which will paralyse metropolitan railway service unless the lower paid grades are not affected.</P>

      <P>The award of the Irish Railway Wages Board which has been accepted by the trades unions representing the railway employees does not involve any reduction in the wages of the operative classes receiving 40/- per week or less.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will have the findings of the Railway Wages Board examined with a view to recommending the non-reduction in the wages of the lower grades; and further, if he will state that in the promised Transport Bill a clause will be inserted to protect the lower grades from being reduced to a wage below minimum living rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 55 of the Railways Act, 1924, provides that the wages and conditions of service of railway employees shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made between the trades unions representative of such employees and the railway companies.  The Railway Wages Board derives its authority from such an agreement.  I am not aware of any more appropriate statutory provision for dealing with railway wages questions nor of any better machinery for examining such questions and making recommendations upon them.</P>

      <P>The question of a strike which has taken place or which is imminent has already been raised in the House.  I think it has been stated before from the Chair that the Minister has certain powers as a negotiator and that certain members of the Minister's staff whose salaries are on the Estimate represent the Minister in certain trade disputes.  If the Deputy desires to raise a question as to what the Minister is going to do with regard to an imminent trade dispute, that question would be in order, but it has often been ruled that as the Minister's functions are those of a negotiator or go-between, the merits of the dispute ought not to be discussed. If the Minister were to make a declaration on the merits of the dispute, his usefulness as an arbitrator would presumably be impaired.  Is question 2 of that type, as to whether the Minister will take certain action to prevent a trade dispute?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance may remember the point I raised with regard to the pensions of dependants of those executed in 1916, asking that they should be placed on the same footing as the pensions and retiring allowances that we pay to ex-officers and men of the National Forces.  As I have already explained to the House, those who are in receipt of army pensions are not subject to income tax.  I suggest as a matter of equity that the pensions which are paid to the dependants who were executed in 1916 should be upon the same footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into this matter.  The position is that, of course, there is only one class of pension at present that is not liable to income tax and that class is wound or disability pensions.  All ordinary widows pensions are liable to income tax.  It is true that certain lump sum payments to officers are not liable to tax, but apart from that, ordinarily officers' pensions are liable to tax. There are small sums payable by the widows of the leaders of 1916.  Looking into the matter we find that if we were to introduce a new class of exemptions there would be quite a series of new claims put up and on the whole I think it is not desirable to introduce a new class of exemptions. The amounts that are payable are very small.  In some cases there is no <Col N="1364" /> amount payable.  In others it is only a very small sum.  They arise because in the Amending Act passed a year or two ago, the amount of the allowances which had been heretofore payable to the widows of the signatories of the 1916 rising have been doubled and we think a certain amount of consideration was shown to these particular ladies by doubling the amount of the pensions.  While from the point of view of the Exchequer there is not much money involved yet we could hardly exempt these pensions from income tax without exempting certain other classes and, on the whole, as the amounts are very trifling, we think that the ordinary rule should hold.</P>

      <P>I would like to say with reference to this particular question that a doubt was expressed in the House as to whether the practice that has been in existence here since 1925 was in conformity with the practice that exists in England.  I have had inquiries made and I have a copy of a letter here in my hand from Somerset House which states that the practice which has been carried on here since 1925 is identical with the practice which has been carried on in Great Britain.  Since these provisions were made in 1923 they have never been challenged in Britain.  So that what we are seeking now is identical with the practice on the other side as well as being identical with the practice carried on here since 1925.  Somebody said that if this section were passed certain executors might be made liable to penalties for not having made returns.  There is not any intention at all to seek for penalties, and I am advised that the passing of this section would not enable us to seek penalties for anything that has been done.  As a couple of cases have come into the courts it is proposed &mdash;in a case before the Circuit Judge where the decision was got in favour of the executor&mdash;to pay the taxed costs of the parties.  It is the intention that the taxed costs of the parties should be paid on application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am afraid we shall have to vote against the section in its present form.  The letter from the British Income Tax Department which has been put before the House has nothing to do with the case.  It does not go to the root of the argument at all.  The position is that here for a certain number of years the law was something different from what the Revenue Commissioners contended it was.  One gentleman here more intimate with the law than they were contested their right to ask for certain returns.  When the matter came to the courts he was proven to be right.  This proposal of the Ministers is a proposal to penalise him on that ground and because of the fact that for a certain number of years the Income Tax Commissioners have been acting illegally; as a result of his action that has been found out.  That is the effect of the Minister's proposal.  It is an unjust and inequitable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the position which the Minister has in view would be fully met if we amend the law so as to bring it into line with the practice, but not to make it retrospective.  Surely there is no justification for that.  The citizen, after all, is entitled to the benefit of the law as it stands, and must not be victimised because some persons in authority think the law was something else.  The courts have decided in this man's favour.  It would be very unjust if the House were to go back upon the decision of the courts.  We have had retrospective legislation to amend court decisions in some respects here in this country, but as a general rule they have been to amend decisions of the House of Lords.  Never before has <Col N="1366" /> there been an attempt to get over the decision of our own courts in this way. I think the House would be well advised not to permit the Minister to act in the way he proposes under this section.</P>

A number of Deputies here are, perhaps, not able to argue from the legal point, but it appears to me and to a number of people outside as if this were retrospective legislation.  Whatever may be the rights and the wrongs of it, I think the Minister should give the fullest opportunity for discussion on the next stage, so as to remove any doubt whatever from the minds of the public, and from the minds of Deputies here too, as to what is intended in this matter.  I think Deputy J.T. Wolfe last week stated the case, and there is no necessity for me to add to it.  I will ask the Minister to take serious cognisance of the state of feeling that has got up through the introduction of legislation of this sort.</P>

      <P>I should like to have a little more light as to the meaning of the section.  I should like to know, for instance, has it the implication which Deputy MacEntee suggests, that it will have the effect of cancelling the decision of the court in a particular case?  I do not read that into it.  I do not think that that can hold.  I believe that that would be a very objectionable proceeding. As I say, I have not read that into it, that it would in this case which was tried out have the effect of wiping out, as it were, the decision of the court.  Apart from that, I cannot see why, if a person during his lifetime has succeeded in evading the income tax authorities and has not paid the tax which he was bound justly to pay in accordance with the law, his heirs and successors should be allowed to benefit by the fact that he has so evaded the law and has not been discovered.</P>

      <P>As I understand the section, this is its effect: that a person has evaded certain obligations during his life-time and the Revenue Commissioners have not discovered these evasions until after the man's death. Then they proceed to collect from his estate the tax that he should properly have paid during his life-time.  If that is the proper interpretation of it, I say it is just and fair that that should be done.  If a man who is bound to pay income tax does not pay it, the general community suffers to that extent.  If a man during his life-time does not meet his obligations with regard to income tax, I do not see why the people who benefit by what he leaves should be free from the obligation to pay.  They have got money that properly would not come to them if the man had met his obligations and I do not think the Revenue should be prevented from recovering it.  I do, however, say that if this section would have the effect of reversing a judgment in a particular case it is not right that that should be done.  Otherwise I would be prepared to support the section on its merits.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell said that he is not going to uphold a man who has evaded his obligations, who has evaded the law.  What has happened in this particular case is that the Minister for Finance, or his Department, has gone into the court to say that a man has evaded his obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter the tossing of a coin who it was.  The person who was in court was alleged by these people to have evaded his obligations, to have evaded the law, and the courts of this country have said that he did not evade his obligations <Col N="1368" /> and that he did not evade the law. That is perfectly clear.  If it is not clear, it is up to the Minister to make it clear instead of putting in a thing here which is certainly not clear.  This section says that the Finance Act of 1925 shall be construed to have effect and be deemed always to have had effect as if the figure &ldquo;1918&rdquo; now contained therein was inserted.  It was not.  The man was doing what he was entitled to do.  Whether he should have been entitled to do it or not is another question.  He was entitled to do it.  He was carrying out the law and the &ldquo;Ancient Order of Torturers&rdquo; were breaking it.  That is the position. The court-said they were breaking it. The court said this man was perfectly entitled to do what he did, that he was neither evading his obligations nor the law.  Deputy O'Connell has the effrontery to suggest that that man should now be penalised for knowing the law better than the Department of Finance, and carrying out the law more honestly than the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the plain English of this.</P>
      <P>There is very strong obligation on the ordinary citizen, an immensely onerous obligation, which presumes him to know the whole of the law in every particular, and to be held liable for the transgression of any particular of every law, even if he does not know it.  But it is a monstrous suggestion that a man should be held liable not merely to know the law, but to know what the Minister for Finance will do if the man carries out the law in a way which does not happen to suit the Minister. I have described this as anarchy.  Anarchy is a disrespect of law as law, and this is a disrespect of law as law.  First, they have disrespected the law and then, when that law has been enforced against them in their own courts, they disrespect the courts and the law by saying what they know to be untrue.  In other words, that you must take up an Act of Parliament and construe it to mean not merely what the court says it never meant and does not mean now, but what on the face of it it does not mean. If that sort of thing is to go on, where do we stand?</P>

      <Col N="1369" /> Deputy MacEntee, with that moderation which distinguishes him, has strained the case in favour of the Government.  Personally I have a habit of doing the same thing myself. He has strained it outside all the limits and I really feel I must rebuke him.  He has strained it outside all the limits when he said that the only thing that they have upset has been the decision of some court.  They have not.  They have upset it in every case that suited them.  They have actually proposed to upset it even before the court has decided.  We had the case of the Local Authorities Mutual Assurance Bill.  They set up a company there.</P>

      <P>Might I explain? The man who I said was evading his obligation was not the man in court, but the man who has gone beyond anything this Dáil or the courts can do&mdash; the deceased person.  My interpretation of this is that it deals with executors or trustees, and enables the Revenue Commissioners to recover from them taxes that should have been paid by the deceased before his death. I was not speaking at all of the person who went into court to insist upon his right.  I was speaking of the person <Col N="1370" /> who did not pay the taxes that he was obliged to pay before his death. This section proposes that the Commissioners should have the right to collect the taxes from his trustees and executors, if they find out after the man's death that he had not paid. On the merits I say that that seems to me to be fair and sound.  The man who evaded his obligation was the man who is dead.</P>

      <P>Surely it must be clear to Deputy O'Connell that if a man evades his obligation the law as it stands is what would have to deal with him.  It is by means of the law as it stands he would be dealt with and there would be no need whatever to introduce this particular clause to deal with a man if he were really evading his obligations.  I think he ought to have no doubt in his mind as to what the Minister is at.  The Minister made it quite clear on the last day as to what he was at.  He said in a certain case certain payments made by other people were not paid by a certain individual.  Then he brought the executors of that individual to the court and the decision was given against him, and now he wants by the wording of this Act to put himself in the position which he was not in when he came before a court and that is to try to declare the law to be something that the court previously declared it was not.  It seems to me that there can be no doubt from the Minister's own statement what he is after, I think it ought to be clear on the face of it that if a man were evading his statutory obligations the law as it stands should be the method by which he should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Which the courts would admit was lawfully due, and which the courts always have admitted was lawfully due.  The question of law which has been referred to by Deputy Flinn as being decided is not yet decided, and, as I understand it, is still sub judice.  But leaving that aside for one moment the point is whether the executors in another respect have been legally liable to do certain things or not.  One court has decided they must. That court took the view that the law was as these executors interpreted it, but apart from that, there is the other question as to whether what the Minister wants is to extend his powers over executors where other cases of attempted evasion of the law have occurred.  If the Minister will make it perfectly clear that that is what the section applies to, I think he would probably get the whole House with him.  The objection to the clause as it stands is that it will apply to a great many other cases besides this, and though I do not feel as strongly about this as other people, it is an objection to say that the clause would give the <Col N="1372" /> Revenue Commission powers which they do not intend to use in most cases.</P>

      <P>And I think the Minister ought to be able to word the section so as to secure what he wants, and yet not do what many of us would strongly dislike being done.  I urge him to accede to Deputy Myles's request, and give us an opportunity of going into this in the interval between now and the Report Stage, and see whether we cannot make the section something that will satisfy us all.</P>
      <P>If it is the case that after death it is discovered that any person has not paid the income-tax which he ought to have paid, and if it is the case that when his estate is declared, it becomes obvious that he had not declared his whole income and had been liable to tax, which I take is the case Deputy O'Connell referred to, I think we would all admit that the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners ought to have as much power as possible to get all the information as to what the man's income was in his lifetime and as to the amount of the tax he ought to have paid.  But I do put it to the Minister that the executors are in a difficult position frequently and that their position is difficult enough as it is and that they should not be put to unnecessary trouble and trouble of a very delicate nature.  I know that in such cases of difficulty in ordinary cases, the executors would get all the help possible from the Revenue Commissioners who would be reasonable in these matters.  Still I suggest to the Minister it is desirable that this section should not leave that entirely as an open question of law, and that it is unnecessary to have such a wide section in order to secure the power he wants to get in these cases where evasions have occurred.  Therefore I ask the Minister to meet Deputy Myles in the way he suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there is some misunderstanding in the minds of Deputy Thrift and members of the Labour Party in regard to what is our attitude to this section.  Our attitude towards those who have succeeded in evading taxes during their lifetime is exactly the same as that of Deputy <Col N="1373" /> Thrift and Deputy O'Connell.  We have no objection at all to the Minister by all the means in his possession recovering those taxes as soon as he discovers that the deceased has evaded the payment of them during his lifetime; but we say that the Minister has machinery quite effective for the purpose provided by this section if the section were to read: subsection (1) of Section 8 of the Finance Act &ldquo;shall be construed and have effect as if after the figure 1918 now contained therein there was inserted the words and figures, etc., etc.&rdquo; We do say it is not necessary and that it is giving retrospective effect to the section to insert the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had effect.&rdquo; That is the precise ground of our objection to the section in its present form that it does give it retrospective effect.  There can be no doubt about that.  The Minister speaking on the Second Reading suggested that the decision given against the Revenue Commissioners in one court was likely to be reversed on appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am merely a layman, but I have studied the sections and I am convinced that that decision will be upheld, and I say that in view of the fact that the courts have already tried and found in favour of the citizen in one case, we should be very slow when the matter is sub-judice to endeavour by a legislative act to reverse that decision of the courts and reverse it against the citizens.  I think if there is any doubt that the subject will get the benefit of the doubt, and he will not get that benefit if we make this section retrospective.  If we do, then we feel, notwithstanding what has been said in the House that it will be open for the Income Tax Commissioners to recover the penalties which the court held they are not entitled to recover in respect of this estate.  While I take up without reserve the attitude which Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Thrift have taken in the matter, nevertheless there are certain other factors which enter into the decision.  For one thing, the deceased is no longer in a position to put himself right with the State. His widow and dependants are possibly <Col N="1374" /> not in a position to redress the wrong which has been inflicted.  They may find it difficult to provide for themselves, let alone to pay, if you like, for the sins of the father, and for that reason there is a good deal to be said for the law as it originally stood; that is to say, the law which clearly states in Rule 18 that &ldquo;where a person dies without having delivered a statement of all his profits or gains chargeable to tax, with a view to an assessment thereon in due course, an assessment in respect of the profits or gains which arose or accrued to him before his death, may be made at any time within the year of assessment, or within three years after the expiration thereof, upon his executors or administrators, and the amount of the tax thereon shall be a debt demand payable out of his estate.&rdquo;  Quite obviously it would be a difficult matter for the executors to fight the additional assessments that had been made in regard to the estate of the deceased three years after the wrongful return had been made.  He would not be there to help them, so to that extent they are greatly handicapped. The estate may have decreased much in value, and, after all, their primary duty is to the legatees under the estate.  As the law stood in England originally, there was, therefore, a good deal to be said in favour of it.  We are leaving that to one side, and we are prepared to accept an amendment which would put the law in the same position as the law in England.  That should suffice for the Minister.  We ought not to go back and try to ante-date the amendment now before the House.  If we do not do that, but content ourselves with amending the law prospectively, we will have recovered for the Minister the machinery he desires, and he will not be doing an injustice to the executors, to the estate, and to the widow and dependants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of misapprehension, I think, in regard to this particular sort of case.  What is desired is simply this, that where the man has failed to pay what was due during his life-time, when, in fact, the man has avoided paying what was due &mdash;all the cases that have come up have <Col N="1375" /> been cases where people have taken steps to avoid what was due during their lifetime&mdash;that out of his estate, provided they act in time, the Revenue Commissioners can recover six years' tax&mdash;if they act immediately they can go back six years.  If they do not act up to the end of the limited period, they can only go back six years altogether, three years before the man's death.  This is to enable us to recover six years' tax out of the estate.  That has been the practice so far as we know, and perhaps still is the law here.  It is the practice in England.  It has not been challenged; it has always been the practice here and has only now been challenged.  There are no obligations thrown on the executors to discover whether a man paid this tax or not, or to discover if his returns were accurate.  The obligation will be on the inspector.  It will give the inspector power if he discovers that properties have been omitted from the assessment to include them, and that additional assessment will be subject to appeal, so that nothing at all is going to be taken from anybody except tax that was wrongfully withheld from the Revenue.  I quoted a case the other day, and it seems to me to be wrong that the heirs of a man should have the benefit of money wrongfully withheld from the Exchequer, and that other people should be obliged to pay it.  If we do not make this to some extent retrospective we will lose something like £100,000.  We will perhaps have to pay.</P>

      <P>I would not be assured by the Deputy's statement.  We may have to repay taxes for a much larger sum, all of which should have gone into the Exchequer and be duly paid. People have paid; nearly all executors have paid.  What sort of position are they going to be in?  Can we afford to repay this tax which was being paid all the time in England?  What position are they going to be in vis-a-vis the beneficiaries, who can say: &ldquo;You paid tax you ought never to have paid.&rdquo;<Col N="1376" /> The only just thing is to be retrospective. The only just thing is to make the law what it was intended to be; what it was conceived to be until this particular judgment was issued.  As I say, hundreds of cases have been settled and paid on this basis.  Thousands of cases have been settled in Great Britain on this basis.  If we now disturb it we open up a number of difficult problems.</P>
      <P>As I say this does not impose an obligation on the executors.  It simply means that when the Revenue Commissioners discover after a man's death that he has concealed his income, when the machinery which we conceived to be in existence and which apparently now has broken, is restored, they can put it in operation and they can make the assessments and these amounts can be recovered. Deputy O'Connell raises the point about cases where there was a decision in the Circuit Court.  I am really in doubt about that matter.  He really only got a Circuit Court decision and there would have been an appeal to the High Court and another to the Supreme Court, and there is a great difference of opinion amongst counsel as to what would be the result.  In certain cases if there was not a great deal of money involved we would wait until the Supreme Court had finally decided the matter and we would not bring in any legislation while the law was unsettled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter that involves big sums.  The revenue would be held up by people who would await the outcome of the litigation and revenue would have to be found by other means.  It would perhaps be a couple of years before a decision would be obtained and revenue which ultimately would prove to be payable would be held up during that period.  We act really before there is a final determination as to what the law is on the matter.  In the particular case that was before the Circuit Court the amount involved was not large and there would be a case if the man's expenses were paid, for letting him pay the tax under the amended law. We could equally let him have the tax.  It is a matter upon which I <Col N="1377" /> am quite indifferent so far as this particular provision is concerned but to condemn particularly one of these Revenue Acts because it is retrospective is to disregard the facts of all these cases.  It is disregarding the way in which the courts construe the revenue law, and if that taxpayer is given the benefit of the doubt in such a way as to upset the practice which had been in existence even for a very long period, a practice which everybody had thought to be entirely in accordance with the law, it will have serious results.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact both here and in England legislation has had to be introduced with retrospective effect. In the present year's Finance Bill in Great Britain pending a decision of the final court a section was introduced because they feared that a decision might be given which would have upset the practice as it had existed for forty or fifty years.  Before the court had announced its decision at all, a section was introduced to continue the existing practice if it proved to be necessary.  You can get the most extraordinary results if the whole meaning of legislation is going to be revealed, by some court decision, to be entirely contrary to what was intended and to what it was always believed to be.  In those cases no injustice is done if what everybody has been doing is confirmed as right.  In many cases a grave injustice would be done if the practice were entirely upset.  Though certainly no injustice might be done in a high degree to individuals, a grave injustice might be done to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the idea that executors should not be liable to pay for the same period as that for which an individual is liable to pay, a six year period, is really quite unjust.  As a matter of fact the executors escape a little because a man who during life was discovered to have made a false return, as in the case I quoted for the Dáil the other day, would certainly be mulcted in penalties as well as the tax.  I had a case here the other day of a man who was returning an income as relatively small but in fact it was discovered after his death that he had property the <Col N="1378" /> income from which gave him a sum of £12,500 a year.  His estate will only have to pay £17,000 but there is no doubt that if that fraud had been discovered during his lifetime, he would have been mulcted in penalties, as well as the amount of tax of which he had defrauded the revenue, so that there is no hardship on the heirs or successors of the deceased in these cases.  There is no burden cast on the executors because as I say the burden is on the inspector to discover it. He discovers it by a certain method. He finds that the man's estate was immensely greater than would have provided the income which he had been returning.  There is no delay in winding up the estate because the period during which the revenue officers can take action is limited to a period of three years after the year of assessment in which the person died.</P>

      <P>With the Minister's general proposition that the Revenue authorities should have power and machinery to enable them to go back six years to recover debts due by deceased persons, I certainly have no quarrel, and I do not think any other Deputy can have any quarrel.  I leave that portion of the discussion altogether upon one side, because the opposition to this section, as far as I understood it, has been, not to the Minister's proposal in regard to the future, but entirely to his carrying back those proposals to have effect in the past.  I may say that personally I am strongly against that principle.  I think to have it introduced in the Finance Bill, from the point of view of the revenue authorities, is injurious to the State.  I think it is injurious to the carrying on of the government of the State and I think it is bad for the whole system of government of the country.  After all if we have a state of law in the country and if ordinary citizens abide by that law, how are they to know that to-morrow there may not be some retrospective measure introduced saying that they were not acting in accordance with the law?  It is very far-reaching indeed to introduce in any measure, and especially in a Finance <Col N="1379" /> Bill this principle of retrospection. The Minister has said that if there is any doubt, is the taxpayer to have the benefit of the doubt?  I ask why should not the taxpayer have the benefit of the doubt?  Is it not up to the State to have their authority so watertight that they will be in a position to carry out their intentions according to the strict interpretation of the law?  If there is any doubt I say the taxpayer is distinctly entitled to the benefit of that doubt.</P>
      <P>What is the position with which we are faced?  The proposal of the Minister, as far as I understand it, is, that not only as regards the future but also the past, the custom which he says has prevailed in England so far and has also prevailed in this country merely as a custom, shall be given statutory effect.  That is that the Revenue authorities shall have the right to go back over a period of six years in these cases.  The Minister has thrown out the suggestion, though I do not think he can really have done it seriously, that if this custom is not now given statutory effect the State may be called upon to repay sums of money which have been paid by executors in the past.  I give him credit for knowing this much, that anything paid in mistake, certainly anything paid to the State, in law is not recoverable by those who pay it.  I do not think that he would seriously get up and state definitely that these sums of money can be recovered from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that if this section as it now stands is not passed the Minister will be at a considerable loss of revenue. That may be so.  We do not blame him for the loss; we shall have to bear it.  The State will have to bear whatever the loss is.  In my opinion that loss should be borne by the State and the law as it was should be respected. Let us make the law in future as we please, but let us have the law respected as we make it in the future.  It has been said that this practice has gone on in England and that it has gone on here until only the other day when it was challenged. The Minister has also <Col N="1380" /> suggested that the law might even be now as he desires it to be in the section because this particular case is still sub judice and a decision has not yet been given on it.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that if he had not some very grave doubts indeed that the law was not as he and the Revenue Commissioners endeavour to interpret it there would be no necessity for his bringing in this section as it stands in this Bill.  I think the only straightforward course for the Minister to adopt is to ask this House to pass this section with that portion of it deleted as suggested by Deputy MacEntee.  If those words were deleted I venture to suggest that he would have the unanimous support of the House because I said in the beginning that no one would question the right of the State if they think fit to go back the same number of years in regard to a deceased person's estate as they are entitled to in the case of a living being.  Therefore on the section as a whole I would ask the Minister to reconsider this retrospective portion of it.  The proposal that the law shall be changed now in order to have effect in a few cases even though it may involve a considerable amount of money is a principle I think which should not be approved of by this House in regard to any other financial Bills or any other legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance must make every lawyer tremble in his shoes and every judge wonder whether he is to administer the law as it is or the law as it is intended to be.  He says that you get the most extraordinary results from the decisions of the judges.  Of course that reveals the mind of the very ardent collector of taxes, quite a proper state of mind for the particular official who has to do that work, but the Minister should not forget that the decision of the judge is recognised in this country where there is constitutional law existing as that of the protector of the individual against the State.  He is there particularly for that purpose and in going in for retrospective legislation of that sort the Minister is over-riding a very essential principle of constitutional law.  Even if it does mean <Col N="1381" /> a certain loss of revenue provided he adjusts the law to carry out the intention of the legislature for the future he should be satisfied and not cut the ground of all constitutionalism from under the feet of lawyers and of judges.</P>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Minister, because he says in one breath that it has been the practice to work upon a certain line and to collect revenue upon that basis.  He ignores the principle of law that money which has been so collected cannot be recovered from the individual.  Crown debts, to use the old phrase, are irrecoverable.  Of course there are certain legislative exceptions to that, such as the getting of a rebate on Income Tax, but these are matters directly legislated for. Otherwise moneys paid for taxation cannot be, as a general rule, recovered back again, so that disposes of that bogey.</P>

      <P>I tremble before the Minister with my small knowledge of law.  It must be a splendid thing to be in the position of having a mind that is tabula rasa so far as law is concerned.  There are certain cases pending which will be determined by the decision of the court, but the decision, so far as it is to come, is a res judicata.  When the decision has been given it may be appealed against, and until it is appealed the decision of the Circuit Court stands.  The Minister says it is merely a decision of the Circuit Court.  The decision of the Circuit Court is as sacred in law as the decision of the High Court, and as such is part and parcel of the whole machine of law.  From the point of view of merely losing a certain amount of revenue, suppose there are a certain number of cases which will be decided by a case which is being tried. Up to a certain date, people have refrained from making their payments because they are waiting for this decision. The Minister ends the evil from that time on.  It may mean a loss of a certain amount of revenue pending the decision.  If he now changes the law he is going to stop what, from his point of view, is an evil.  I would <Col N="1382" /> submit that the Minister would be well advised, in maintaining respect for the law from every section of the people, to forgo that amount of revenue, to respect the law as it is, and simply to legislate for the future and not for the past.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I am going to go somewhat further, because there are certain things which Deputy Redmond referred to as being matters of general agreement with which I would be inclined to assent.  I do not think it is right to require from an executor precisely the same things that you would require from a living person. It is a question of justice and expediency, as Deputy Thrift has stated, and the duties of an executor are exceedingly onerous and thankless.  I think we ought not, in the case of persons who have taken on them such duties not from the point of view of pecuniary gain but out of friendship, to add to the great difficulties with which they are already encumbered.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I follow what the Minister meant when he stated a moment ago in the case of executors that the estate escaped more lightly than in the case of a living person who is found to have evaded his income tax; he did not quite finish what he was going to say.  He began to say that in the case of living persons such persons would be liable to penalty, and those penalties would be exacted, but he did not say that no penalties would be exacted in the case of the estate of deceased persons.  I would be glad if he would tell us if that is his intention.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister at the same time, quite apart from this, that he would do very well to harken to the suggestion which came from Deputy Professor Thrift.  It must be evident that there is a good deal of disquiet in the House at some of the proposals contained in this particular clause.  I could say a good deal more <Col N="1383" /> about it.  I dislike the form to begin with.  We were promised last year that a great effort would be made for the simplification of the income tax procedure. This hangs upon the simplification of the Income Tax Law.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this clause, in the form in which it is drafted&mdash;very convenient for the draftsman, of course&mdash;adds more bricks to that rambling structure full of dark corners, blind alleys with stairs going up but leading nowhere in particular, known as our income-tax law, and if for no other reason I would like to see the clause withdrawn.  I would like to have said a great deal on the substance of the clause, apart from the form.  I wonder how many people understand what we are doing.  If I understand it we are declaring that if a man in the view of the Revenue authorities makes a return that is incorrect or incomplete then it shall be held to be, and always has been the right of the State&mdash;a matter which I understand is in considerable doubt&mdash; to require from the executors returns going back for six years.  The Minister said that he saw no hardship in that. I hope that neither he nor I will ever be in that unfortunate position.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister.  There is no obligation on the executors to make a return but, if the assessment made is, in the judgment of the executors wholly excessive quite obviously they must furnish accounts over six years in order to justify their claim.  That comes to the same thing.  I hope neither the Minister nor I will ever be in the difficult position of having to act as executors for persons as unbusinesslike as I am. I should be very sorry for my unfortunate executors if they had to render <Col N="1384" /> any accounts relating to my affairs for a period of six years.  I should find it extremely difficult to render them myself. This is not a laughing matter. I said before, and I think it will bear repetition, that I think officials, particularly those dealing with such matters, do not realise the appalling difficulty that ordinary human beings have in giving the mass of information which quite naturally is required, and for that reason I should have thought that if we are going to make a change in the law&mdash;I know that the Minister says he is not going to make a change, but is merely declaring the law to be what the Revenue Commissioners hold it is&mdash;by incorporating this clause in the Bill, it shows that there is some doubt.  While I have no sympathy whatever with the man who defrauds the Revenue, if we are going to legislate do not let us forget that these returns are not always made fraudulently on the part of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted a certain case, but let me remind the House of the case quoted by Deputy Jasper Wolfe, in which a charge of fraud was brought by the Revenue Commissioners against a person who had recently died, because according to Deputy Wolfe who is a very responsible person, the Commissioners discovered that a deposit of £140 had been made in the bank and that it was not mentioned in the income tax returns.  According to the Deputy the amount was lodged in the bank three days before the person's death.  I do not know what happened afterwards.  At any rate, it shows that in dealing with matters of that kind we should be careful and should not always assume that the Revenue authorities are right and the public rogues.  I had occasion to criticise the Revenue authorities several times.  I am not voicing any sort of personal complaint.  I have nothing to complain of in any transaction I ever had with the Inspectors of Taxes or with the Revenue Commissioners. I received nothing but the greatest courtesy and consideration, and I do not speak on behalf of any individual who has reason to complain.  I say that we should be very careful before doing anything that would make it harder for the <Col N="1385" /> ordinary individual, and especially for an individual who is in the difficult position occupied by an executor.  With great respect to the Minister I say that I am not greatly impressed when he tells us what has been the practice in England and that they found it necessary to pass a measure of this kind there.  The Minister is not unaware that in very high quarters there have been grave complaints of the manner in which public departments have been, not alone seizing, but usurping powers which in the view of the late Lord Chief Justice more properly belonged to the law of the realm.</P>

      <P>My attention was called to this section in connection with the case decided in the Circuit Court.  I presume that is the case the Minister referred to.  I am told that if the law remains as it is and if this section is passed the executor cannot fail to succeed in the two other courts that he can go to.  That may be right or wrong.  But if it is right I think that it is not quite fair play that the law should be altered while the case is sub judice.  I think the Minister said that the sum involved was indifferent to the Exchequer.  If it is indifferent perhaps the Minister might use his discretion in connection with this Bill and so remove from the minds of the people the idea that there is unfair legislation against those who have succeeded in the Law Courts against the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I have already stated but perhaps I did not say it clearly in reply to Deputy O'Connell, that while I believe a good argument could be made for getting the tax in that particular case, nevertheless, it was a matter I did not feel strongly upon.  If Deputies think&mdash;and more than one Deputy appeared to think so&mdash;that it should be done, I would be quite prepared to undertake that, so far as that case was concerned, the decision of the Circuit Court Judge will not be appealed against, and so far as that particular case is concerned, only the amount of tax he considered chargeable would be collected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that I would like to make clear.  The Minister has prejudiced the whole of this discussion by making it appear that we were attempting to overthrow something that had been established by time.  He said that it had always been the custom of the Revenue Commissioners to proceed in that way. The section which the Bill proposes to amend was introduced in the Finance Act of 1925.  It has only been in operation for six years.  It is not as if it had been in operation for twenty or thirty years.  The number of cases that came under it must have been comparatively small and the value of the estates and of the amounts of the taxes to be recovered must be comparatively small.  Anyway, the one thing that is clear is that the Revenue Commissioners could only have been acting in the illegal way in which they have been acting for a period of six years.  As to whether there is any doubt that the decision of the Circuit Court will be upheld, I would like the House to bear with me for a minute or two, while I try to put before them what I think are the relevant sections. The basic Act in the matter is the Act of 1918, the first section of which provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate, the tax at that rate shall be charged for that year in respect and in accordance with the rules respectively applicable to these schedules, that is schedules A, B, C, and D.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The tax is to be charged and is to be collected in accordance with the rules applicable to these schedules.</P>
      <P>The next section with which we are concerned is Section 125 under which additional assessments may be made and Rule 18 relating to this section recites</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any person dies without having delivered a statement of all his profits or gains chargeable to tax with a view to an assessment thereon in due course an assessment in respect of the profits or gains which arose or accrued to him before his death may be made at any <Col N="1387" /> time within the year of assessment or within three years after the expiration thereof upon his executors or administrators and the amount of the tax thereon shall be a debt due from and payable out of his estate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the law as it stood in 1922. That is, the additional assessment must either be made at any time within the year of assessment or within three years after the expiration thereof upon his executor or administrator.  And the law as it was in 1922 remained the law up to 1925 when Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1925 provided:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, an assessment of an additional first assessment in respect of income tax chargeable for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1922, or any subsequent year may be amended or made (as the case may be) under Section 125 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, at any time not later than six years after the expiration of the year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The courts found this that while it amended Section 125 it did not amend Rule 18, and Rule 18 is part of the income tax law and therefore the section was defective in so far as it omitted to recite that the rule shall be amended accordingly.  I think that is entirely due to faulty drafting of this Act and to a misconstruction of the law on the part of the Income Tax Commissioners who have been responsible for creating the present situation.  In order that justice may be done and that the subject may have the benefit of the law as the courts have found that law, I think, irrespective of whether it costs the State £100,000 or £200,000, in equity we are forbidden to make this amendment retrospective in effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fortunate in some respects that the Minister has thought fit to introduce into this Bill the words &ldquo;deemed always to have had effect.&rdquo;  It is fortunate because it has directed the attention of Deputies in this House, who might <Col N="1388" /> be inclined to turn a blind eye, to the trend of things in this country. It was a pleasant surprise to me to listen to the speech of Deputy Murphy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy deprecated an attempt here by the Executive to divest people of their legal rights and to nullify all the proceedings that may have taken place in actions which are pending and where the arguments have concluded by enacting that the law is to be deemed to have been according to the Minister's fancy at the time that these arguments were advanced. Some of these Deputies were not so wide awake to that trend yesterday when the Minister sneered at a court of petty sessions and said that a court of petty sessions might construe a document in a certain way or take a view quite dissimilar from his view and that apparently he could give the force of law to something that he conceived ought to be the principle.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister comes in here and says his officials have been blundering for years past and because they have misconstrued an Act of Parliament that is the reason why this legislature is to pass ex post facto legislation of this character, because they have been blundering for these years, because this wrong has gone on, that we are now to sanctify it.  Surely that is the strongest argument against it.  It would have been the strongest argument against it but for the extraordinary utterance of the Minister a few minutes ago, because I think it was extraordinary.  The Minister said in reference to Deputy Murphy's speech that he, the Minister, was willing to undertake&mdash;I hope I have got his words precisely&mdash;not to interfere with the present case.  In other words, we are not to be all equal before the law, the law may be one thing for a Mr. Robinson and may be quite different for Mr. Jones, at the sweet will of the Minister.  That is what we are coming to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have understated it.  Perhaps we have been in that condition already, but perhaps <Col N="1389" /> I have been consistent because I rather indicated in the opening of my speech that we have been in that condition, that this law and order that is so much boasted about from the opposite benches is ignored whenever their own fancy or their own prejudices prompt them to ignore it.  We make speeches here from these benches prepared with some care.  We analyse statutes like the Treaty Confirmation Act.  We analyse documents like the Agreement of December, 1925, and we apply to them certain well known canons of construction.  We deal with them as they have been dealt with by eminent text writers, and all that is brushed aside with a sneer about what the courts may do.  We were ignoring altogether this divine right that there is to apply some sort of great principle that is to be found only in the bosom of the Minister.  It gives the go-by to all these ideas of construction that the text-book writers tell us about and that the judges tell us about.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to pay particular heed to what the Minister has said now.  That is, his idea of his responsibility and of his power is that when the House enacts this section he will dispense with it.  He will do here what James II lost his Throne for doing across the water.  He is to have some sort of dispensing powers. The Constitution of this Free State provides that we are powerless to make something an infringement of the law that was not an infringement of the law at the time the act was committed.  It is a curious phrase, infringement of the law.  Too vague though it may be, I think that it is quite sufficient to cover various consequences that flow from the omission to furnish proper accounts or the furnishing of erroneous accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is enacted, various things will be deemed infringements of the law that were not an infringement of the law as the law has been enunciated by a highly distinguished judge and as the law has been argued and some people think successfully argued in another case in which judgment has been reserved.  Deputy J.X. Murphy just as I came in stated in a few <Col N="1390" /> sentences one of the arguments that I had intended to advance in regard to this matter, that it coerces the judge to find, and to find in a way that he could not or might not have found if the law had been allowed to remain as it was at the time that the case was tried in court.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the Lord Chief Justice of England thought fit to write a book in which he has dealt in emphatic language with the great peril of the liberty of the subject in England by the encroachments by departments and ministries on the courts.  I think that Lord Hewart has not found anything to denounce which is as extreme as this section that is now before the House.  I would ask the House to be jealous of the privileges of the courts of justice and to remember that any true liberty that we can hope to enjoy is to be enjoyed owing to the independence of the judiciary and owing to the impartial administration of the law as the law may be at a particular time by these judges.  If this House is from time to time to make hay with the law by enacting that something is to be deemed always to have had effect, we will gradually undermine the confidence of the public in that just and impartial administration of the law to which we have grown accustomed, and thereby we will be eating in upon and undermining the foundations of that liberty which we all prize.</P>
    <P>I am not going into any discussion as to the merits or demerits of this proposal. I think a good deal could be said about the expediency of such an enactment either retrospectively or prospectively.  I think the Revenue Commissioners have already far-reaching powers for preventing anything in the nature of a fraud on the revenue. They have had quite a long enough time to use the machinery at their disposal. A great deal might be said against this elongation of the period, even prospectively.  But I do appeal to this House on the highest and broadest grounds not to endorse this attempt by the Minister to encroach upon the liberty of the citizen here, to encroach, as I say&mdash;it is an encroachment&mdash;upon <Col N="1391" /> the independence and impartial administration of justice by the courts of the land.</P>

      <P>I feel rather frightened, coming after a jurist of the calibre who has just spoken.  I cannot speak from the legal point of view.  I can only speak from the point of view of the ordinary man.  I am just as much against fraud or evasion of one's just tax as any man in the House.  I love the income tax officials just as little as anybody else, but I do think that a man who deliberately evades his taxes and makes the burden heavier for his fellow-citizens deserves no mercy, and if there is any loophole in the existing Finance Act that allows him to escape I will support the Minister in closing that loophole.  Nor do I think that a man who is committing a fraud of that sort should be condoned simply because the man succeeded in concealing it for a length of time.  That only makes the offence greater.  About this present section there is the old atmosphere of retrospective legislation. Always I find it hard to swallow it.  It does not seem to me the game, and it has very ugly consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been trying in this country to build up respect for the law, love for the law and for our courts.  This section seems to be, if I am not mistaken, a thing that will tend to cast a slur on the dignity of the law, and it will in some way be contempt of court from a quarter where the court should expect to receive respect, and has always received respect.  Such contempt exhibited in any other place would meet with sharp reproof from the court itself.  I am aware that we are privileged, but I do not think that we ought to take advantage of our privileged position and insult the dignity of the court by interfering in the cases that are actually before it&mdash; interference which amounts to nullifying their decisions.  It is that aspect of the section that seems to me to be particularly undesirable.  I am not speaking from the point of view of the law or lawyer, but from the point of view of the ordinary man who has played games.  I play games according <Col N="1392" /> to the rules and the laws, and when penalties are incurred I pay them. That is the atmosphere of every decent Irishman, and when you go to law you are playing a game.  You must obey the rules, and you must take the losses as well as the prizes.  Here now the Revenue Commissioners have gone into playing a game of cards with individuals. Suddenly, in the middle of the game, they want to change trumps or the value of the cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that objection is taken to this section on two broad grounds.  First, by way of sympathy with executors, and secondly, owing to the effect on pending proceedings before the court.  I should say, at the outset in regard to the income tax code that the length of time which the assessing authority could go back upon a live person in the way of income tax, was one year, and at the time that that was provided an executor was also placed in the same position as the person he represented, namely, that he was only liable to go back for one year.  Since then, the period for which the Revenue Commissioners were authorised to go back for the purpose of recovering arrears of income tax upon a live person was made, in the first instance, three years, and a corresponding extension was made in the time during which the Revenue Commissioners could call upon an executor to account.  I think there is a general recognition that money due by a person by way of income tax is a debt, just the same as money due by a person by way of individual is a debt.  From the year 1850 in this country a person is liable for any debt contracted six years previous to the date upon which it is sued for.  If a person be indebted to <Col N="1393" /> the Revenue Commissioners by way of income tax it seems difficult to understand why any great distinction should be drawn between that debt and a debt due to any private individual. The period of limitation in the case of a private debt is six years, and it seems difficult to appreciate why the same period of limitation should not apply in the case of a debt due to the State.  Some Deputies spoke of the hardship which would be incurred by reason of an executor having to go back and furnish accounts in respect of a deceased person whom he represents. In the case of private debts, the executor would be placed in practically the same difficulty as he may be in the case of a claim for income tax.</P>

    <P>As I understand, General Rule 18 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, confines the liability of an executor to income tax on profits or gains which had accrued to the deceased in his life-time.  Take the case of a person in business.  I understand that at the moment the Revenue Commissioners insist each year on a properly audited account being furnished by such person for the purpose of the assessment of his tax. This is the year 1931.  That has been insisted upon for some years past.  So that if an executor of a person engaged in business was called upon to account he has those accounts which have been furnished each year to the inspector of taxes and it would not cause him any great difficulty to go back upon them.  If, on the other hand, it is a tax upon shares, or money on deposit, or matters of that nature, they should not afford him any great difficulty in furnishing an account. Undoubtedly, from the passing of the Finance Act, 1925 (Section 8), there has been, let it be right or wrong, a generally recognised view of that section that executors were liable by means of the provisions of that section to account in respect of the estate of a deceased whom they represented over a period of six years.  Only recently for the first time has that section been challenged, and the challenging of that section was upon the basis that sub-section (4) of it really did not amount to a charging or taxing provision. That section may have failed or <Col N="1394" /> it may not have failed; that is a matter for decision by the court and it is a matter upon which there is some doubt, but one thing is clear from the section, that it was the intention of the legislature at that time, whether they effected it or not, to make an executor accountable for six years back, just as in the case of a private debt, and that was recognised until this recent case.</P>
    <P>On general principles, I do not think there is anything against the section which is the subject-matter of discussion. However, on the second branch of the matter perhaps more can be said.  I should say, before I pass from Section 8, that Deputy Geoghegan spoke of the consequences of infringement. I may be wrong, but, as I understand the section, there is no question whatever, under General Rule 18 of the Income tax Act, 1918, or as it is extended by the provisions of Section 8 (4) of the Finance Act, 1925, of the imposition of a penalty upon an executor, and as the income tax code stands at present no penalty can be imposed upon an executor for any defaults committed by a deceased person whom he represents in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>Exception has been taken to the provisions of Section 2 with regard to pending proceedings.  It is pointed out that certain people who have been alive, as it were, to their rights, and who have challenged these rights in court, may be prejudiced by this.  Retrospective legislation, as I understand in this matter of income tax, has been resorted to frequently not alone in this country but by the British Parliament. It is not at all unknown.  Perhaps there may be something in the point made as to actual pending proceedings, and I would suggest to the Minister that an exception might be made to Section 2, which would cover the case of actual pending proceedings conversant with Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1925.  I think that if that were done it would meet the matter fully, because, as I said, the generally accepted principle and view of this section by people in general, and by the Income Tax Department, was that Section 8 (4) of the Finance Act, 1925, <Col N="1395" /> did operate to make an executor chargeable for six years as set forth in the sub-section.</P>

      <P>I want to say, as far as I am concerned, and I think the other members of my Party, that we are not satisfied with the exception of pending cases.  We are opposing this on principle.  The suggestion that there is some confusion of thought amongst Deputies is, I think, altogether unwarranted.  Every Deputy who has spoken, from all sides of the House, except the last Deputy and Deputy O'Connell, made it quite clear what it is he is opposed to here, namely, the principle of retrospective legislation.  The law is as it is, and what it is is to be determined by the courts and not by the wishes of the Minister or anybody else.  That is the position.  The suggestion that there is any confusion in the minds of Deputies here is obviously unwarranted.  We can argue as much as we please about whether it is wise or not to change the law.  We have a very open mind&mdash;at least, I have got&mdash;as to whether the law ought to be changed or not, but I have certainly nothing but a firm conviction that the principle as enunciated by the Minister, and the attitude of mind revealed by him in his speech is one subversive of order and of law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thrift was one of those who talked about evasion.  It reminds me very much of a previous occasion in which Deputy Thrift introduced that very phrase to bring about an evasion of what was the law.  I remember it very well.  It was a case where, in order to avoid an obvious judgment, an artifice, a subterfuge was resorted to which was nothing but a violation of the law.</P>

      <P>I am referring to this whole principle of trying to nullify the law as it is, by the power of a majority Party, to make it what they want it to be, and to try to anticipate the judgment of a court by changing the law when cases are pending.  That was the position in this House and it is the position in regard to the cases in the courts.  We have to put up with the law as it is.  If the Exchequer is going to suffer from the law not being what the Minister would like it to be, then it has to suffer.  That is our attitude and, as far as we are concerned, we are not going to have any compromise on that particular matter, and we are not going to accept. any suggestion that there is to be retrospective legislation, even if pending cases are excepted.  The principle we stand upon is the law as it is and what it is to be as interpreted by the courts and not by the Minister for Finance.  We here ought not to adopt the attitude that we can suddenly come in and make, to the detriment of some private citizens, the law what we would like it to be.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  He stated the type of case to which he wished this section to apply.  In his statement my sympathies were quite with him and the question I want to ask is this: &ldquo;Are there any words in this section or the sections to which it makes reference which limit the application of the section to that type of case?  And if there are not such words will he consider the possibility between this and the Report Stage of limiting the application to that type of case?&rdquo;  We all dislike retrospective legislation, but it a deliberate evasion of the existing law which took place in previous years can be got after at all, then, in that sense the legislation that gets at it must be retrospective legislation.  It is not legislation making or altering the law which was evaded.  It is only making explicit the conditions under which that evasion of the law can be detected.  I do not want to improve the Minister's words at all.</P>

      <P>I would like to challenge the position at the outset that the practice has been what the House intended in the Act of 1925.  The Minister, so far as the section I have already read for the House is concerned, does not propose to amend Rule 18, which is the rule that applied in the particular case when an additional assessment is made upon the executors or administrators of the estate.  That is quite clear.  To my mind, the only thing with which Section 8 of the Act of 1925 is concerned is to deal with the general case of living individuals who made wrongful or misleading returns.  In the case of living individuals, it seems quite clear the Act intended this additional assessment should be applied.  If in the case of those who were deceased persons Section 8 of the Act did not propose to amend Rule 18, which was part of the Income Tax Act, 1918 then I think the clear intention was that this extension to six years was only to apply to living individuals and not to deceased persons.  That is really the position, and there is no formula that the Minister can devise that would prevent this section in its present form from being retrospective except by deleting the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have effect.&rdquo;  If these words are left out we have no objection to making the law and practice here conform to each other, and to put them on the same level as the law in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy Law indicated, on the merits even of that there must be considerable difference of opinion.  But, speaking for myself, I am prepared to accept the position stated so emphatically by Deputy Alton that where the law is evaded, and income tax not paid, we are entitled to collect it.  But the position in this case is that the law is not being evaded, that the executors and administrators who refuse to accept this additional assessment were acting in accordance with the law, and that it was the Revenue Commissioners who were acting contrary to the law.  That having been already established by the courts, I think it would be a defeat of justice for this House to propose now <Col N="1398" /> to reverse that decision and to make the illegalities of the Revenue Commissioners law for the past five or six years which it is proposed to do by this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made to the intention of the legislature to make the executors liable for six years.  I do not know how much value the House may attach to that phrase, but possibly certain members of the House may attach importance and may be influenced in the exercise of their votes by that phrase.  Is the intention referred to the intention expressed in the Act of 1925?  Many who were members of this House in 1925 are not here now.  Where would you get their intention except in the way we are told by the authorities we are to get it&mdash;that is, in the words used by them in the statute.  That is the only place we can look for their intention. As Deputy MacEntee pointed out, the words here are reasonably clear, and they have been interpreted by a judge and have been argued in a pending case, and that is the only place where you are to find the intention. It is not open to the Minister now to come here and say that in 1925 he or somebody in his Department intended something or other.  There is another matter that possibly may affect the judgment of some members of the House, and that is as to the extent to which this offends against the possible letter and at all events against the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested here that because the executors cannot, I suppose, be sent to jail that therefore it is not making something an infringement of the law that was not an infringement then.  I do not suggest that no words I used are capable of the meaning that the executor of some testator who has not acted according to what has been the practice can be sent to jail.  I do not suggest that for a moment. What I do suggest is that if you face this clause as it is now in the Bill that something will be made an infringement of the law that was not an infringement of it as it stood, that the estate of the testator can be blistered, and blistered very heavily, <Col N="1399" /> because of that infringement.  That is the punishment that will be meted out.</P>

      <P>At least I will try to endeavour to make it clear.  What I desire to convey to the House is this, that as the law stands now&mdash;if we are to accept a judgment, as I said before, of a very distinguished judge&mdash;if the law stands thus and that I understand the effect of the judgment correctly, the estate of a testator or an intestate, as the case may be, is subject, or may be subject, to certain liabilities of the Revenue authorities and the Minister here as the law exists.  If the law is to be deemed since 1925 to have been otherwise, then by the operation of this Bill, when passed, heavier liabilities will be imposed on that estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect to Deputy Alton, that may be begging the question.  If the testator or the intestate were alive something which, in the absence of explanation, may appear fraudulent may not be fraudulent at all if you hear both sides of the case.  I think possibly some members of this House have had experience from time to time as jurymen, and any of us who are familiar with the routine of the courts know that sometimes something that is presented, and quite fairly presented, and which appears to any reasonable man to be very serious and sometimes highly criminal and fraudulent may, when the other side is heard, be explained to the complete satisfaction of every person.  We have had experience of that.  The intestate cannot come back from the grave.  I possibly was taking too much for granted, but that is what I meant to convey that by this ex post facto legislation that you are putting a burden or fine&mdash;I am using the words in their popular sense&mdash;you are imposing a fine on the estate of the testator which it might otherwise escape, and in that way you are running right up against the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> It has been suggested by Deputy Finlay that this section could have a good deal of the poison taken out of it if it were to be so framed as to apply only to exclude pending cases.  I think that, after all, the prefatory remarks of Deputy Finlay to an income tax debt, a debt for goods sold or delivered, the reference to the Statute of Limitations&mdash;all that was a sort of smoke screen before the final sentence of Deputy Finlay's speech, in which he made it clear that this section, as it stands, was repugnant to his sense of the seemliness and fitness of things.  He suggested then that pending cases should be excluded.  The answer to that is the answer that has been given by Deputy de Valera&mdash;that there is a much bigger principle involved in this. If I may give a similar answer I would ask the House to consider this.  Cases of income tax law are frequently test cases.</P>
    <P>It is not everyone who is prepared to take on the Revenue Commissioners. Most people will prefer to pay something slightly in excess or perhaps substantially in excess of what they think right rather than run the hazard of litigation which may end in the last court of the land.  It is much more important to the Revenue Commissioners than it is to the citizens.  They might justly and properly think it right to bring a case involving a small amount of money to the last court in the land. For that reason the taxpayer, if he learns that some other citizen is litigating the particular point that is agitating him, he may stand by and await the decision in that case and avail of it, and he is right.  It is done in every branch of commercial life.  If some case is pending which will settle a question on principle, many others concerned in that point will stand by. If Deputy Finlay's suggestion were to be adopted, then the fact would be that anybody who issued a writ would apparently escape, but the possible thousand and one people who had as good or better cases and who stood by while that case was pending and awaited that decision to be guided by it would be mulcted by the enactment of the Dáil, even if it is whittled down in the way Deputy Finlay suggests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> I do not want to be dragged into any question of the fundamental rights or wrongs of these claims for income tax, but I do say, and I think it is a fair statement, that a liability for income tax is a liability that every right-minded citizen must discharge.  Nobody must have any sympathy, and no citizen will have any sympathy with anyone who tries to evade it, for the good reason that anybody who evades it is putting a greater burden on the citizens.  For reasons, and higher reasons, I have no sympathy for anyone who evades his liability.  I may say this, that a debt for income tax cannot fairly be compared to any ordinary debt, such as the debt I have mentioned, for goods sold and delivered. A debt for income tax is a purely artificial creation.  It does not exist until the words of the statute, in language or phrases that are inescapable, create it.  It does not exist.  It is not payable until the statute, on the strictest parsing, makes it payable, and if the statute on the strictest parsing does not make it payable, the citizen is entitled to refrain from paying and he would be a fool if he did pay it.  It cannot be suggested that that is comparable with pleading the Gaming Act or the Statute of Limitations. There is no resemblance between the two things.  I mention that because it emphasises the great gravity of the ex-post facto enactment such as you have in this clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with very great interest to the speech of Deputy Alton. It is well, and it is a wholesome discipline for this House, that there should be occasionally put before us the proposition that there are certain things that are not done, that it is one's duty to act not merely as a Christian but as a gentleman, that the rules of the game during the progress of the game should be observed.  I am very glad to be present in the House when a doctrine, which possibly it should be unnecessary to expound, but which the practice of this House has made it very necessary to emphasise, has been laid before the House.  I only propose to refer to it to this extent, to say that the speech reminds me of the counsel that has <Col N="1402" /> been often given that you should do as the preacher says and not as the preacher does.  Anything more grossly contrary to the practice and to the custom of Deputy Alton, and to the Party to which he belongs, than the idea that one should play the game, I cannot conceive.  In respect to the fundamental law of this State on the contrivance of Deputy Thrift, and with the consent of Deputy Alton, the rules of the game were altered during the progress of the game.</P>
      <P>I desire to call the attention of the House to the method in which this particular clause, which has caused a lot of anxiety, was introduced into the House, the method by which it was defended, and the principle that has been exposed as the foundation of that defence.  No one is going to deny that there is a feeling of seriousness and anxiety in every portion of the House in relation to the principle that is involved in this Bill.  No one is going to deny that that clause was sought to be introduced into this House by stealth, without explanation and passed without justification. If what has been said by every lawyer in this House of whatever politics&mdash; because the Minister has not been able to find any lawyer to take his attitude of mind&mdash;is true, then, in relation to this clause and its retrospective quality, fundamental things have been attempted to be done which most certainly ought not to be done by stealth, which ought not to be done without explanation, which ought not to be done without full advertence by the whole House to the seriousness and the consequences of the act which they were taking.  How has it been defended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various kinds of ignorance which I have at one time or another, I think, defined to the House.  One kind I have commonly referred to is privitive ignorance.  I am saying this in defence of the Minister.  Privitive ignorance is ignorance of the things which, in all the circumstances, it is your duty to know.  Before the Minister for Finance put before the House his arguments as to why they should <Col N="1403" /> consent to this retrospective legislation, introduced unexplained, by stealth, that if we did not do so the State would be subject to penalties by law, the Minister for Finance, in all the circumstances, ought to have known that he was talking nonsense. He was guilty of privitive ignorance. He was guilty of putting before the House a statement which he ought to have known was false for the purpose of getting an advantage out of it.  On what foundation principle&mdash;these are merely the procedure and the machinery&mdash;has this clause depended?  I have used the word anarchy.  As a grammar of anarchy, the utterances of the Minister, not merely in the past but precisely in this debate and on this issue, would deserve a very high place and authority.  Imagine the Minister for Finance in a responsible Government, who has the impudence to allude to the extraordinary results that would follow if the decisions of the court were accepted as the interpretation of the law.  Now get that.  I ask you to define anarchy in any stronger terms&mdash;the extraordinary results that are going to follow if the decisions of the court are accepted as the interpretations of the law.  Red ruin and the breaking up of the laws, or, rather, the breaking up of the customs built up outside the law by the unrestricted authority of the Executive&mdash;that is what is at issue&mdash;and that is the disaster which must be avoided by passing this particular retrospective legislature.</P>
    <P>If we are to take the Minister's speeches and especially the speeches into which he was unfortunately betrayed in interjectory defence, we have to take it as his principle that every decision of the Revenue Commissioners which shall be reversed by the court shall be declared to be right, but that every decision of the court upsetting a custom of the Revenue Commissioners shall ab initio be declared to be wrong.  We are certainly getting into fairly deep water for constitutional government&mdash;mar eadh.  When you come to the Minister's method of getting it, you get into a position more disgraceful than even the position <Col N="1404" /> which he attempts to take up.  What happens?  Deputy Thrift, Deputy Redmond, Deputy Murphy, Deputy Myles, Deputy Law&mdash;all his supporters&mdash;get up and interject that it was a hardship on a particular individual, and the Minister says: &ldquo;All right, if a sufficient number of Deputies on my side of the House object to the administration of the law as I say it is, in relation to a particular individual, in relation to that particular individual that law shall not operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What do you think of that for the constitutional, law-abiding people? &ldquo;Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them; whose sins you shall retain they are retained.&rdquo;  Selective protection, yes.  Selective commandments, yes.  Selective administration of the law in relation to individuals. Then he goes on to tell us the procedure of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I am not blaming them; they do what they are told; they are appointed by him, and they have got to carry out the law.  I do not know if the House knew until now that the Minister for Finance claimed the power to tell the Revenue Commissioners, in relation to any particular person, to put the law into operation or not, to put the law into operation just whether or not representation in sufficient volume was made by Deputies Thrift, Murphy, Redmond, Myles, and Law.  I wonder if they knew that before?  In the case of anybody else he says we shall go on; appeal and appeal and appeal.  Every man, according to the Minister, who, for some extravagant reason, thinks that his ipse dixit will carry one inch beyond the Division Lobby on a matter of law, says the law was intended to be this.  Now, what that means is that in future everybody in this State, before he enters into a contract, before he does any act which might or might not be criminal or otherwise, has got to anticipate all the Bills to remove doubt, not merely the daily ones he is getting, but all the Bills to remove doubts which the Ministry will be able to put through in future.  I am glad that Deputy Law did say that this was not altogether a laughing matter.  Deputy Law sometime stumbles on the truth.  It is not <Col N="1405" /> a laughing matter that the Minister for Finance should try to get through, by stealth, a provision of this kind, and that he should defend it by statements which he ought to know were false and founded upon the principle which is the denial of all law&mdash;that is, the claim of this Executive Council to interpret retrospectively the laws.  It is not a laughing matter.  It is a most serious matter that those who profess to be the constitutionalists of this country should have no respect whatever for law, except so far as they can use it as an instrument for their own benefit.</P>

The Ministers have never stood by the law unless when it suited them.  They started this State by flinging contempt on all the laws which had been in force. When a judge who had been appointed by the representatives of the Irish people wanted to stand in between the people and the breaches of the law committed by the Ministers, the Justice was dismissed and threatened with arrest.

It cannot affect any other type of case and consequently it can only mean this, that from the executors and from the man's estate there shall be recovered tax for which he was liable in his lifetime and which he would have been liable for if he lived, if the misrepresentations or evasions had been discovered.</P>

      <P>I will consider whether anything could be done to clarify it. I think it is clear as it stands.  I will have it examined.  Sometimes a question of fraud may be difficult to determine and there must have been evasions of tax and omissions from the returns of income received by the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have it further looked into.  It is perfectly clear that the section could only apply where the income was hidden from the revenue and where tax was not paid.  With regard to the intentions of the legislature, I think they are pretty clear as shown in the Act.  Whether the intentions are carried out is another matter. If Deputies will look at Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1925 they will see that it contains four sub-sections, and these extend the period from three years, for which people are liable to be assessed, to six years.  It winds up in the final sub-section by referring to the estates of deceased persons and the liabilities of executors and administrators.  If the section was not intended to have the effect of extending the period from three years to six years in the case of estates of a deceased person the insertion of sub-section (4) was entirely <Col N="1408" /> absurd and unnecessary.  Section 4, on the ruling of the Circuit Court judge who tried the case, did not achieve what it was intended to do.  Section 8 intended to extend the period from three years to six years, both in the case of living persons and in the case of estates of persons who died.  That is perfectly clear.  Even in his judgment, and by implication, as it were, the judge stated &ldquo;it is based on the assumption that the view urged on behalf of the Commissioners is correct, but I cannot construe the Act of 1918 by reference to the Act of 1925, or on the view of the framers of the Act of 1925.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With regard to the questions of respect for the courts, no disrespect is involved in amending the law, whether amending the law retrospectively or not.  Very frequently people discover, as a result of the courts carrying out their function of interpreting and applying the law, that the law contains something which it was not generally believed to contain, and steps are taken to amend the law.  Sometimes it is amended only for the future.  There are cases where there are strong reasons for amending it restrospectively, but there is no disrespect for the courts in that.  The function of the courts is to interpret and to apply the law as they find it.  If, as a result of the interpretation of the courts, the legislature thinks the law is not in a satisfactory position, there is absolutely no disrespect for the courts in the legislature exercising its function to alter the law.  There is no more than there would be in the court finding that, for instance, the legislature had not succeeded in carrying out what members, or even the bulk of them, expressed as their views at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the courts and the function of the legislature are distinct in the matter, and when the legislature exercises its function in any respect in which it thinks it right to do so, there is absolutely no disrespect to the courts involved. With regard to the case of people who have cases before the courts and have won them, some Deputies stated that there was no reason for treating them exceptionally.  I think there is good <Col N="1409" /> reason for treating them exceptionally. There is the fact that they have got a judgment, even though we may think it might be reversed on appeal. We have absolutely good ground for accepting the judgment as it stands and going on that.  In other cases people who did not take the risk of expending money and carrying on litigation might get that particular benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesKeogh" hpid="Dr. Keogh Dr. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1927, is hereby amended by the deletion of the word &ldquo;Gaelic&rdquo; now contained therein.</P>
      <P>If it were necessary to labour the amendment at all it would be with the object of coaxing the Minister to agree to it in the face of the representations that have been made to all the members of the House from football clubs and others interested in athletics to have this imposition removed from what is known as Association Football. Many thousands of our young people find enjoyment and recreation, week after week, in attending Association football matches, and they feel that they should not be treated differently from those attending Gaelic fixtures. I would suggest that it would be a happy gesture on the part of the Minister if he were to accept this amendment and show that no injustice would operate against any form of athletics in the Irish Free State.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not antagonistic to anything associated with Gaelic sports or games.  Every Deputy is fairly conversant with what could be said on it, as they have had all the facts laid before them by the Association twelve months ago when on a free vote this matter was defeated by a small majority.  Since then members of the House and of the Government have told me that they would vote for it this time, and that the amendment would be accepted.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Keogh.  As I said before, when Deputy O'Connell tabled a similar amendment last year, it is a great mistake that there should be any difference shown as between men who play different forms of football.  I think one game is as good as another. I think it rather hard that Association football and Rugby football should be penalised.  I think the Minister said that the tax from these games is negligible, and I think he should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared, as last year, to leave this matter to a free vote of the House, because it is really a matter which is not of financial consequence. However, I think there is something to be said against the amendment.  First, I do not think that, strictly speaking, there is a case for exempting either Gaelic football <Col N="1413" /> or other forms of football from income tax.  I think there would be quite a good case for charging income tax to all associations.  This particular exemption was given to Gaelic football simply as a sort of subsidy.  It was given as something of a subsidy, having regard to certain disadvantages under which national games laboured as compared with international games. I must say that I have not a bit of sympathy with the sort of boycott policy that is carried on by the G.A.A. &mdash;the policy of branding a man as a bad Irishman or a bad citizen if he happens to play a particular game of football.  I disagree entirely with that. Possibly some people may be inclined to vote for this amendment because they have been annoyed by the attitude of the G.A.A.  But I think they should look at the matter apart from any feeling we may have in regard to the policy of the G.A.A. in the matter of boycotting other games.  Here are certain games which are peculiar to our country; they are national games. The fostering of them was part of the movement which led to the establishment of the Free State.  I personally think that it is worth doing something towards preserving these particular games without necessarily taking up an intolerable attitude in regard to other games.</P>
      <P>These Gaelic games which are solely our own, labour under one very strong disadvantage.  They cannot get the sort of publicity that the international games get.  There is a tremendous amount of space devoted in the newspapers to Rugby football.  It is not merely the matches at home that are written up and dealt with in various ways in the newspapers, but matches outside.  Then you have the permanent attraction of the international match; the coming of the English or French teams here, the interest which they arouse and the crowds and the money which these draw are important factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Association football also has an advantage over the games that are local and national.  I think, therefore, that without in the least sympathising with the idea that the man who plays Rugby or Association football is doing <Col N="1414" /> anything wrong at all in that respect, or anything that he may be ashamed of, there is a good deal to be said for giving some little preferential treatment to the national games which do labour under disadvantages from the point of view of getting that public support that the international games do not labour under.  This does not mean penalising those other games.  It is income tax coming out of moneys earned.</P>
    <P>I do not think the payment of it is any hardship.  I do not think the payment would be any hardship to the G.A.A. if it were made to apply all round and there would be good reason why it should apply all round. But the remission of it is of very little assistance to the G.A.A.  I am not thinking of the G.A.A. but of the games which are played under it.  This exemption is a small thing but it is a sort of special recognition that there are grounds for the granting of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House will take a broad view on this matter and not discriminate against any game.  I have no objection to the statement of the Minister with regard to fostering Gaelic football as a national game, but it is only national to the extent that there is no other game of football quite like it.  We cannot have very much national distinctiveness in kicking a leather ball. I ask Deputies to remember that Deputy de Valera was a very successful Rugby player.  In fact, he was a better Rugby player than he is a politician.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My view on this matter is a very simple one.  If I had my way I would not tax any game.  But there is a case undoubtedly for giving special encouragement to hurling, for example.  So far as Gaelic football is concerned, as it is adopted as a national game and recognised as such, I see no reason why it should not get encouragement.  I am quite candid about it, and I would prefer to see encouragement given in a positive way rather than by exclusion from a tax. In other words, I would like to see definite aid given to the national games for the reason indicated by the Minister, namely, that they have not such opportunities of getting funds, and so on, as Rugby and Association have.  I must say that I dislike very much taxing outdoor sports, as we have not enough of them, and I should like to see them free from tax.  If the Minister would be prepared to settle it on these lines I would have no difficulty about my position, namely, that he would be prepared to give some encouragement, say, to hurling, which, I think, is much more important from the national point of view even than Gaelic football.  If a sum of money were to be available for the positive encouragement of hurling and Gaelic football, I would prefer it to this particular method, but if I do not see such positive aid being given, then the only way of giving preferential treatment as against other games is by the Act as it stands and not by the amend ment.  If the amendment were, so to speak, to get rid of all taxes on outdoor games, such as football, and at the same time to give positive encouragement to hurling and Gaelic football by a definite grant, that particular way would be the way that would please me best.  If the Minister is not prepared to approach it on that particular line, I will have to vote as I did on a previous occasion, so that the national games, hurling in particular, shall get preferential treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the amendment for reasons possibly different from those indicated by other speakers.  There might have been a time, as I know there was a period, <Col N="1416" /> during which it was found necessary to give some stimulus or encouragement to Gaelic games, but I feel, now that these games have been so well established, that this artificial stimulus is not necessary.  I cannot agree with the Minister, who suggests that the Irish games do not attract atendances as large as those of foreign games. Anybody who has visited Croke Park to witness an All-Ireland hurling or football final must testify to the thousands upon thousands of people in attendance there.  I have been at Gaelic football and hurling matches when it was necessary to turn away many hundreds of people because they could not find accommodation for them in the Park.  That does not go to show that Gaelic games want any artificial stimulus.  There is, of course, a feeling amongst a number of people that Gaelic games should be supported to the exclusion of other games, and that a man or a boy becomes a worse Irishman because he plays what is known as a foreign game, namely, Rugby or Association.  At one time that might have had some foundation, for sentimental or other reasons, but that time has passed.  Gaelic games have rooted themselves very deeply in the hearts of our people for very many reasons, reasons which have been mentioned by Deputy de Valera for one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera suggested that the Minister should take some positive action instead of this negative action, and support Gaelic games by way of an indemnity or other financial method, rather than by penalising the foreign games.  The Minister might be in a position to do that next year. Let us hope that he will indicate to Deputy de Valera that that will be his attitude in next year's Finance Bill.  At the same time, I think it would be a pity to lose the support of Deputy de Valera and many members of his Party, because I understand there is to be a free vote on this amendment.  I am only speaking for myself and not for the Labour Party. We are all perfectly free to vote and say what we like on this matter.  I do not want to lose the support of Deputy de Valera, who has played the game that I have played.  I have played Rugby and on one or two occasions I have <Col N="1417" /> given Deputy de Valera a severe knock, and I suppose I will again in another way.  I suggest that we should at least get rid of any political bias or prejudice in this matter.  Any of these old prejudices that we may have could be disregarded on this occasion at least.  I appeal to Deputies, who possibly have these old prejudices, that this is no occasion on which to display them or make them very manifest.  This amendment is a very simple one, and only asks that we should mete out the same treatment to the promoters and players of other games that we mete out to the promoters and players of the Gaelic code.  Those who control Association football in this country, and who play the game, have to pay income-tax under Schedules A and B and they simply ask to be relieved of income-tax under Schedule D and put upon the same plane as the Gaelic games.  It cannot in any way influence the attendances at the games, because no matter what we do here there will still be enthusiasts who will follow their own particular game. As it is to be a free vote, I hope the Minister will make that clear to some of his supporters who are out in the Lobby and who, when they come in, may possibly follow him into the Division Lobby.  I suggest that he should indicate to the House before the vote is taken that it is a free vote.  I have great pleasure in supporting the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I should personally like to see the tax taken off all sports, I am going to support the amendment. There should be no discrimination in a matter of this kind.  While we are all anxious to give support to native games, I think we ought all to be glad that young people indulge in any sort of game.  For these reasons I am going to support the amendment. What is given to one game in the way of privileges should be given to games of a similar nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is under a certain misapprehension as to the purpose of the amendment.  The phrase has been used that we should <Col N="1418" /> remove the tax on all games.  There is no tax on games under Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1927.  It does not impose a tax upon any game.  It imposes a quite legitimate income tax on profits, and what you are asking now to exempt from the operation of the income tax code are profits of the Rugby Football Association, one of the richest associations in this country, and the tax upon the profits of the Free State Association Football Organisation, another fairly large corporation.  Is there any reason why if people derive profit from income from sport they should not pay income tax in the same way as people who derive profit from trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>They derive no personal profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but nevertheless there are profits, and we may be quite certain, knowing how bodies of this sort are mainly run, if the State does not take its share in the income tax there will be so much more to be distributed, not in promoting the game but amongst the officials.  However, leaving that on one side, I want to make it clear that this is not a tax on games; it is a tax on the profits.  Take the Gaelic Athletic Association.  Why should the G.A.A. be put in a privileged position vis-a-vis with other associations in the State?  For a very good reason.  The Gaelic Athletic Association, in the year 1920-1921, established its right to that position.  They had refused to pay any amusement tax to the British, and the officials carrying on the Association ran the risk of imprisonment and suffering, and many of them suffered business losses because they refused to pay the tax.  While the Irish Rugby Association and the Irish Football Association at that time paid the tax and were loyal to the British Crown, those supporting the Gaelic Athletic Association took the popular and national view and stood by the Republican Government in the years 1920-1921.  And if to-day they are enjoying the privilege and exemption, it is a privilege and exemption which was rightly earned and which, I think, for that reason ought not to be extended to other associations in so far <Col N="1419" /> as the tax upon the profits of those associations are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is no amusement tax upon the games.  The public are free to walk in having paid the normal charge for admission.  They are perfectly free to walk in to Lansdowne Road, Dalymount, or Shelbourne Park.  They do not pay any amusement tax, so that there is no tax upon these games. Even where there is a charge for admission there is no tax paid.  There is certainly no tax where there is no charge for admission.  Again I repeat the only thing charged by way of tax is upon the profits derived by the Associations by the charges they levy upon the public.  If the charges to the public are reduced to such a level that there will be no profit, then there will be no taxes imposed under Schedule D.  It is because the charges to the public are fixed at such a level that the Associations make a profit that they are assessed for income tax. under Schedule D, and quite rightly assessed.</P>
      <P>Again as to the question of national games, let me make it clear.  I never played Gaelic football in my life.  I played Rugby and Association. Gaelic football is a game that I have very little esteem or regard for.  I would prefer to look at other games, but I know that, with the exception of the Cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin, it is the game universally played in the Twenty-Six Counties. The other games have made a certain amount of headway recently, and I am not at all displeased about that.  I take up the attitude of the Minister for Finance in this matter.  I would like every Irishman to play the game that most appeals to him, and I have no sympathy with the policy of exclusion pursued by the Gaelic Athletic Association.  But I say they have established the right to privileged treatment in this country, amongst the sporting associations, and I for one, am going to vote on behalf of that right.</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt that under the existing law there is discrimination against Association football.  Deputy de Valera <Col N="1420" /> summed up the whole position when he says that if he had his way there would be no tax upon any games in the country.  It is a pity that Deputy MacEntee does not take the view of his leader.  There should be no discrimination in favour of one game against another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In favour of any Association or game.  Deputy MacEntee asked why an Association football club should not pay income tax on profits. For a very good reason.  If he had read the leaflet sent round by the Football Association he would not have asked that question.  The reason is that none of these clubs are run for gain or profit, and that all the profits are utilised for the development of the game, and nothing could be more in the national interest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony asks the House not to take a narrow or prejudiced view of this question.  I hope the House will act upon Deputy Anthony's very well-timed request.  Deputy MacEntee said that if the charges for admission were brought down to such a level there would be no income tax, but then what position would Association football be in if reduced to that particular financial position?  Personally speaking, I would rather see one game of Association than ten of Gaelic, and I play both.  If people opposed to the remission of this tax consider that the enormous sum of sixpence is charged for admission to see this game played for one-and-a-half hours in the pure open air, I do not think they would suggest that the charge should be reduced to the lower level to which Deputy MacEntee would wish to reduce it.  There is discrimination against Association football.  I say that both these codes are playing a useful part in the national life of this country.  The Gaelic code is playing a very useful part in the life of the country.  If it is the national game the followers of that code are entitled to enjoy it as they think fit and proper. On the other hand, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, the discrimination <Col N="1421" /> that exists against Association football is not justified.  Since 1927 Gaelic football is free and exempt from this liability under Schedule D.  The movers of the amendment are making a reasonable request.  They want to put the Association code and the Gaelic code upon equal terms, and I cannot see how any reasonable man can say that one game is not entitled to exactly the same treatment as every other game.</P>
    <P>In my opinion that should be the aim of the Minister for Finance, although he refuses to accept the responsibility, to do everything in his power to encourage national games, whether it be Association football or whether it be Gaelic football.  I am sure there is nobody who has the moral and physical uplift of this country at heart but will realise that Association football is performing a useful function in the national interests of the country.  We must remember that not alone is it providing healthy amusement for 60,000 people who go to witness this game over the week-end, but it is producing a race of athletes in this country of which it should be proud, and of which any athlete who follows either Gaelic or Association is justly proud.  If the House approaches it in the way Deputy Anthony has requested the House to treat it, the spirit in which it should be treated is that sport knows no barrier, and there should be no division so far as sport is concerned, either national or international.  One of the arguments put down in the leaflet that the Association has circulated among the Deputies of this House is that there is no distinction of class or creed, and that is a consideration which should weigh with us.  The encouragement of Association football is in the interests of the country.  It is not alone in the interests of those who play Association football, but it is in the national interests.  Anybody who takes the view that Gaelic football is more a national game than Association football is taking an extremely narrow view.  Now, the Minister for Finance thinks no reason can be urged for the remission of this tax, but he put forward no reason why it should not be remitted. The only reason he put forward was <Col N="1422" /> that Gaelic football was more a national game than Association football. Did he put forward a reasonable argument against the remission of the tax?  I could put forward national reasons far more important than the Minister has urged that the tax should be remitted.  When our teams go away for international games, when they go to France, Belgium, England or Scotland, they perform a useful function to this State.  Are they not an international advertisement for this State? Are they not producing international harmony and friendship?  I say they are.  No argument has been urged against the imposition of this tax; I have not heard one single argument to-day except the narrow, bigoted argument that we should encourage one game at the expense of the other.  Have you ever attended a match between the Shamrock Rovers and Dundalk?  I have heard as many men shouting for Dundalk in the city of Dublin as I heard cheers for the home side.</P>

I have not heard a single argument of the Minister for Finance which will bear analysis, and I ask this House, in the interests of the country and in the interests of the 60,000 people who go to witness these games, to give fair play by the remission of this tax, and we are sure it will have the success it merits.  At the same time 60,000 followers of Association are entitled to the same treatment as those who follow the Gaelic code, and I hope this House will pass the motion.</P>

For that reason they are entitled to preferential treatment and should get it.  I will ask any speaker on the other side to explain what I have stated of the attitude of the Rugby Union towards the national flag.  What is the origin at all of the present position regarding that?  It is as Deputy MacEntee outlined here.  I was present at a G.A.A. convention in the City Hall at which a decision was come to, to refuse to pay tax to the British.  The G.A.A. went out on that fight with the British authorities and never paid amusement tax.  Because they went out, and because these other organisations refused to take up a national attitude at the time, they now want to take advantage of what the G.A.A. achieved.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact it is only within the past few years that the Irish daily Press, whether it pretended to be Nationalist or Unionist in colour, gave any sort of recognition to Gaelic games.  As a person who can claim to be in a position to know a little about the G.A.A., as I had a long connection with it, I know that one of the stiffest fights we were up <Col N="1425" /> against was the prejudicial attitude of the Press towards it.  I saw matches here in Dublin at which there were 40,000 people present, matches under the Gaelic code, and they scarcely got two or three inches in some of the daily papers, while matches under the other codes at which there might not be a dozen people present got a column and the reports were lavishly illustrated with photographs.  I say that those means have been used&mdash; Press propaganda, the action of the college authorities and every possible means in the power of the people who control these games&mdash;to stimulate them artificially.  I have been informed&mdash;I am not in a position to give the names but I believe the story is true&mdash;that a certain college last year flogged its boys because they played hurley.</P>

I agree with Deputy de Valera and I would prefer also that the preference to the G.A.A. should take another form than this. Judging from the tone of the speeches on the other side there is an assumption that now they can claim equal national status with the G.A.A.  They always say that when they think that anything can be gained by it but they were not very Irish when there was any service to be given.

I have been associated more than half my life with a hurling club.  I share with the Minister for Finance the view which is shared by many members of the G.A.A., that they should not look upon other Irishmen who play other games as bad Irishmen, or should not take the bigoted view that some members of the G.A.A. take, that members of the G.A.A. should not be allowed to look on at an Association match.</P>
      <P>I differ altogether from Deputy Byrne when he tries to convince the House that Association and Rugby are national games.  Association and Rugby are international games, and the question is whether members of the House ought to give the same preferential treatment to imported and international games as they are prepared to give to national games.  I would like also to be assured by Deputy Byrne, who apparently does know a good deal about the inside working of Association clubs, whether he is quite positive that some of the directors and the shareholders of Association football clubs do not actually receive dividends out of the moneys of those who pay for admission to Association matches.  I do know, and Deputy Byrne knows, that the people who take part in Association football themselves are paid for playing the game, and to that extent there is a great difference between them and those who take part in and encourage Gaelic as against Association.  I also know, as everybody who knows anything about Association football knows, that the directors of these big Association football clubs actually engage in buying and selling Irishmen and in deporting Irishmen across Channel to the great Association football clubs over there.</P>

Although I am not quite sure, perhaps it is the same in Rugby.  I agree that the Minister has made an admirable case for the retention of the law as it now stands.  That is, whether members of the House ought to give special treatment to the national game as against Association and Rugby, which are international and imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of the amendment.  There is no barrier or favour in force as far as horse racing is concerned, and I fail to see why there should be any discrimination in connection with football, which is a very valuable sport as far as the youth of the country is concerned.  I certainly support the amendment. The Rugby Union has been mentioned with regard to its having earned large sums.  If they have collected large sums they have spent huge sums of money at Lansdowne Road, and in other places which have given very valuable employment.  I certainly think that we should not discriminate against them, because if they have earned large sums, they have also spent large sums.  Deputy Walsh mentioned the absence of a certain flag at Lansdowne Road.  I do not want to develop that, but I say that I was present at an international Rugby match there, when 50,000 people from all countries stood to attention while the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; was being played, and that the national flag was displayed there amongst other flags.  Persons who are attempting in a narrow-minded manner to suggest that people who favour Rugby or Cricket, or other games should be discriminated against, instead of serving the interests of the Parties for whom they speak are doing the opposite. <Col N="1428" /> I do not very often agree with Deputy de Valera, but I agree with his statement that all sport should be exempt from taxation, and I certainly hope that his Party will follow him into the Division Lobby and vote in that fashion.</P>

I would suggest that in view of the manner in which Gaelic football and hurling were penalised during the Tan period, as he is well aware, when the game was prevented from being played on several occasions, that he should give as a subsidy to the G.A.A. at the present day, what he is getting off the other fellows.</P>
      <P>I think it would be the proper way to meet the question.  I would ask him to give it as a subsidy.  I am against relieving Association football of taxation and at the same time putting a tax upon the sugar of the poor. I think it is an extraordinary condition of affairs to go in one day and tax the poor man's sugar and on another day to relieve Association football of paying their dues.  I think it is a rather peculiar situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we have the argument developed here that Association football should be relieved.  The type of people who attend Rugby and Association matches are entirely different from the individuals who attend hurling or Gaelic football.  We all know that Association and Rugby football are generally played on a Saturday, and that their supporters are the moneyed classes.  If the G.A.A. held their matches on a Saturday they would not be able to get players, let alone getting a gate.  People who attend both hurling and Gaelic football are men who spend their whole week working and who have only Sunday off to attend the matches.  They are country people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, am definitely opposed to this relief of Rugby football.  I think that enough discrimination has been made in favour of that particular games.  An allusion has been made here to the fact that Association football <Col N="1429" /> players are paid.  That was admitted by Deputy Byrne.  That is one of the reasons why Gaelic football and hurling as against Association football are bound to win out.  They will win out just as the volunteer workers in Kildare won out against the paid workers of the Government.  Once you pay a man he is no more good to you; anyone who has been down in Kildare knows that.</P>

Any views that the Gaelic Athletic Association hold are views which any Irishman should be proud of.  A small concession was given by the Minister for Finance to which I believe we are entitled. Rugby and Association are international and foreign games.  I do not hold as one who is associated with the G.A.A., that they have not good Irishmen playing Rugby and Association. There are good Irishmen playing Rugby and Association.  The people who play under the G.A.A. cannot afford to play on Saturday and have to play their games on Sunday.  I certainly say that we are entitled to the small concession that we are getting from the Minister as hurling and football are our Gaelic pastimes.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to Deputy Byrne and some others who have spoken in favour of this amendment that they should read, if they have not already read, the history of the G.A.A. and the aim and purpose for which it was founded.  Its history during the troubled years, say from 1918 to 1922, was referred to by some <Col N="1430" /> speaker.  I quite agree that there are first-class Irishmen playing and have played both Rugby and Soccer. I would certainly prefer to see Rugby or Soccer played than to have no game played at all because it is morally and physically good for the youth of any nation that they should play some game.  If we had more playing grounds in the schools you would have fewer in your jails.</P>
      <P>The matter of professionalism has been referred to.  The purpose I see in the G.A.A. is to get all the youth in the country to play games.  While it may be a good thing to get your citizens out to see matches on Saturday afternoons it would be much better if you got the young men who go to those matches to play the game somewhere else.  I think that the G.A.A. is encouraging young men to play the games rather than to see them.  With regard to professionalism there is too much of the element of gambling about it.  The G.A.A. is an amateur association, none of its players is paid, and for that reason alone I think it deserves some privilege. It may not be exactly a privilege. They have got some exemption. It certainly is no hardship to pay on profits.  And if the benefit of these profits were given in the entrance fees for those games I, perhaps, would vote for the motion, but I have no assurance that it would.  When there are profits no one can complain of having to pay some income tax. Owing to its national history and the fact that it is purely an amateur association I think the Gaelic Athletic Association should get the slight concession which is given to it.</P>

With Deputy de Valera, I would like to see no tax on any of these games.  I would like to see them all free.  If that is not possible, then I would like to see Deputy Myles Keogh's recommendation carried out, that Soccer should have the benefit that the Gaelic Athletic Association games have at present.  Our national <Col N="1431" /> games are encouraged in every way throughout the country.  Everyone enjoys them, and those who like them play them.  They attract enormous crowds, just as the other games do. There is no use trying to force people to play games that they do not wish to play.  I think everyone should be left to decide what game they will play, so long as they do not interfere with anyone else.  I think that matters pertaining to sport should be lifted out of the arena of party politics.  They cannot succeed if that element gets in.  I hope that in the near future there will be no tax on outdoor games so that they may be free to the young people.  I entirely agree with what Deputy Fahy has said about the provision of playgrounds. There are some playgrounds in the larger towns, but I would like to see them in every village, so that young men who are hanging about doing nothing could play games and have healthy outdoor exercise.  I intend to support the amendment.</P>

The G.A.A. is only asserting its rights, and for the information of other speakers who may follow, I would like to explain why the rule against foreign games was introduced.  It was because the Southern Rugby Union passed a resolution eighteen or twenty years ago forbidding any of their members to play Gaelic football.  Naturally the G.A.A. retorted.  Any speakers who follow should not mention bigotry in connection with the G.A.A.  Its members are not bigoted.  Whatever concessions it has got from the Minister or the Government in the way of exemption from tax, it is legally entitled to it, because its members had the guts to fight ten or fifteen years ago when England was over-running this country.  At that time members of the G.A.A. manned the gates and would not allow the R.I.C. into the grounds, and would not pay taxes that the Soccerites or the Rugbyites paid.</P>

      <P>Then I do not see why we should confer any privilege on foreign games.  The only reason for exempting any games was that the G.A.A. represented the national games.  If people across the water do not exempt their own games it would be rather far-fetched for this House to do so.</P>

      <P>I am President of the Football Association, and I have listened to what has taken place here this evening year after year.  I think Deputies have very well covered the football history of the country from the early days down to modern times. Soccer was played by the British Army and by the British police.  Rugby was played by many people.  Archbishop Croke developed the Gaelic game for the ordinary people of this country. After the Great War one was attracted by the curious anomaly that while Gaelic football was the common game of the people in the country, the people of Dublin rose against those in Belfast who controlled Association football and established the Irish Free State Football Association, which is by no means a snobbish association, but is composed of ordinary Irish people. This Association played many matches with France, Belgium and other countries. The Belgians came here, and the Italians came here, and the Association did good work in bringing Ireland into contact with the people of these countries.  An extraordinary scene took place a few months ago when the Irish team played Spain at Barcelona, the occasion being rather a historic one.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We provided the Irish flag as a neutral ground for a meeting between the President of Spain and the President of Barcelona, who were equally friendly with us.  When the flag of the Irish Free State was unfurled in Barcelona it created a very great sensation amongst the Spanish people.  To say that Association football is anti-national, anti-Irish or anti-patriotic is not a fact. That is what some of these gentlemen have been saying.  In fact, there is no conflict between the G.A.A. and the Soccer Association, because the G.A.A. is there for a very definite purpose&mdash;to develop Irish national games.  The Soccer Association is there to uphold, <Col N="1434" /> in the international language of football, the honour of our country.  I cannot see any conflict between these two methods of promoting national athletics.  One thing I must say, and that is that the Minister is badly neglecting football and badly neglecting the children of this country, and especially of this city, because he does not do anything to remedy conditions in the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £35,014 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1932, chun tuarastail agus costaisí Oifig an Aire Talmhaíochta agus seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riara na hOifige sin, maraon le hIldeontaisí i gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £35,014 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1932, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and of certain services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>There are two items on this Estimate. One is an item of £1,014 for the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and the other is an item of £34,000 for the extension of the creamery industry. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons conducted examinations and collected fees in this country from the Irish members up to the establishment of the Free State.  They have conducted these examinations for the convenience of members who wanted to get their degrees, but they have no legal power to collect fees, and as that became known the fees got less and less as the years went on. Up to 1927 the amount they had actually lost in conducting examinations was £714.  That is to say, they were out of pocket £714 for conducting these examinations.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement made between the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and ourselves they pointed out that the conducting of these examinations cost £250 a year up to 1927, and they were at a loss on this service, which was entirely for the benefit of the students who wished to become veterinary surgeons in Ireland and the members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  They were at a loss in this sum, and it was agreed that we would pay them £500, which does not quite cover their out-of-pocket expenses. We also agreed that the amount of the annual fees due for 1930 and 1931 would be paid in full.  That was £514.  These are the fees due by the veterinary surgeons who have not paid fees during the past few years. The total comes to £1,014.  That is so far as the first item on the list is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second item, this is a new departure.  Up to the present we have been buying creameries and reselling their milk supplies to co-operative firms adjoining them.  Here we propose to establish creameries in areas where creameries have not been up to the present.  The justification for that is that there are certain areas in the country where there are considerable <Col N="1437" /> quantities of milk, where the milk is turned into home butter, which, taking one year with another, is sold at from 3d. to 4d. a lb. less than creamery butter.  The price of creamery butter may be very low, but still that does not alter the fact that 3d. or 4d. a lb. less is a very considerable loss to the farmers of the area.  One such typical area is West Clare.  There there are big supplies of milk scattered over a wide area, and we have decided, as an experiment, to erect creameries there this year at a cost of £34,000.  That would include the purchase of a central and auxiliary that have just been erected, the extension of the central and auxiliary, and the erection of from 6 to 9 auxiliary creameries, and also a certain amount for working capital to cover certain losses which are bound to occur during the years in which the creameries are being organised.</P>
    <P>It also provides a certain amount for loans to farmers to purchase cows, which is quite usual in creamery areas.  We propose to erect that creamery and to run it ourselves for the moment, and to recover the price later with 5 per cent. interest from the suppliers.  We think we can do that. We have been led to that view by our experience of creameries which we actually hold at the moment.  It might be reasonable to ask why should not these people erect these creameries themselves; that is a question I could possibly ask myself.  The trouble is that people do not always do what they should do, and there are special reasons why creameries have not been quite a success in West Clare and similar areas.  The main economic reason is that West Clare has not the same intensive milk supplies in a small area as you would have in County Limerick.  On the other hand, you have very much bigger milk supplies than there would be in a purely non-creamery or non-dairying county.  You have quite big milk supplies in West Clare, but in order to tap them economically you require a very big central, and four or five, and sometimes more auxiliaries.  The fact that the central is big and that the auxiliaries are big does not necessarily mean that <Col N="1438" /> they should be expensive.  You have got to have a central, and you have got to have a number of auxiliaries at various points.  It takes much more money than the initiation of the creamery industry in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In other parts of the country the creamery industry was run in two ways. Strange to say, as a rule in a new district the proprietary creameries were the first to come in.  Where that did not occur, where there was a certain creamery tradition, the creamery movement extended by putting up a central or maybe a central and an auxiliary in an area where there were milk supplies within a reasonable distance of the central and the auxiliary sufficient to make the unit an economic one.  You have not that condition of affairs here.  If you are to have an economic unit you must have a central and seven or eight auxiliaries.  If you have that you have a very big supply.  It is much easier to find capital for one central and an auxiliary than for a bigger unit.  That has been one of the great causes of the failure of the industry in Clare.  Well-intentioned people conceived the idea of starting the industry, found the difficulties of getting adequate capital greater than they anticipated, and even went ahead with the enterprise without providing sufficient capital for it.  You had failures there, and that again makes it still more difficult for the farmers of the districts to establish successful creameries themselves.</P>
    <P>Anyway, I am of opinion that it will be very hard to get these creameries established in an area like Clare and saving the farmer the difference, whatever it may be, between the price of the home butter and the net price, that is, after the cost of production, of creamery butter, which is considerable, varying one year with another, sometimes threepence and sometimes four-pence. I think if you are to save that difference something like this must be tried.  I propose to try it in this area, which is specially suitable for a number of reasons.  First of all, the milk supply is extremely big.  If I have a central and five auxiliaries I expect to get milk supplies of something like 18,000 gallons <Col N="1439" /> in the first year, and the central which we propose to build or to complete, will be able to handle 30,000 gallons, and there are 30,000 gallons in the area.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to continue this experiment, unless and until it is a success or a failure or otherwise and the experiment has been tried out in West Clare.  That is to say, there is no prospect of any continuance of this experiment.  I believe myself that I can establish these creameries much more cheaply even than a good society could do it, because, through the Dairy Disposals Board, we are able to get, as a rule, better contracts than other people.  We do business in a bigger way.  Our goodwill is more important to the possible contractor, and I believe these creameries can be established more cheaply than if they had been established by co-operative societies.  I believe myself, after giving the matter considerable examination and being very much alive to the dangers and difficulties, that I can make a success of this experiment and I hope I will be able to demonstrate that it is an experiment which can be extended to other parts of the country. In any event, the bald fact remains that in that district for a very long time farmers have taken less for milk sold as butter than they could get if creamery butter were being made.  I see no other way of extending the creamery industry into these districts except the way I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister will admit there has been very little time to look into this Estimate.  I do not know that it is fair to ask us to adopt it straight off.  With regard to the first part, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, when the Veterinary Surgeons Bill was going through the House some of us pointed out that the Minister for External Affairs in making that agreement with the British was facilitating the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, London, in collecting one guinea from every veterinary surgeon here that they had not any legal power as things stood to collect.  When that Bill becomes an Act, it will enable the <Col N="1440" /> Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to collect one guinea per year from every veterinary surgeon on the British Register.  Now we are being asked to go back and collect, as it were, the back money that they were unable to collect legally before the Bill was brought in.  It is a principle that I think we should not agree to.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult on a few hours' notice to go into anything more than the main object of this.  With regard to the extension of the creamery industry, this is a new principle of buying a co-operative creamery.  Whether it is going to be a success or not, it is very hard to say.  As the Minister says, it is an experiment, and we must try it.  I should like to ask whether the shares owned by the farmers and members of this creamery company are to be bought at par, and is it the Dairy Disposals Board that is buying this. Having held it for some time, do they intend to dispose of it again to the same shareholders at the same price? In that case, what is the difficulty of giving them a loan or mortgage?  There may be legal difficulties.  But, if the same shareholders are going to own the group of creameries at some future date, as I think it is the aim of the creamery legislation to get them back into the hands of the suppliers, if we get them back into the hands of the suppliers, we naturally give them back to the same people.  If that is the aim, what is the difficulty in the Government coming to their aid by giving them a loan, as they have done in other cases?  I think loans have been given to creameries, and I do not know what the difficulty was in this case. The extension of the creamery industry proposed in the second part of this Vote is, I believe, a justifiable experiment, and probably the Minister should get a chance to try it out.  But I would like very much to have an opportunity of voting against the first part, that is K. 4.  It is impossible, owing to the short notice, to do that. If we had had time to give notice to refer the Estimate back, we could, perhaps, make our position clear, and I should like if you, sir, could say whether that could be done even now.</P>

      <P>When the suggestion that this Estimate should be taken at 7 o'clock was made to-day, it was indicated by the President that if there was a motion to refer it back it would be favourably considered; in fact, he indicated that the Estimate would not be pressed.  Now it is clear from what Deputy Ryan has said, that there are two items here, one of which we would be disposed to favour, but we are definitely against the other.  The only way we can show that is to move a motion to have item K.4 referred back, that is in reference to the payment to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  If the President is prepared to put it off until Wednesday, that could be done.  It is impossible to deal with these two items. In respect to one, even though we have not had all the information we would like, we are disposed to accept it, but in respect of K.4, we are definitely hostile, so I think that could be taken on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I think it would be only wasting the time of the House to repeat the arguments we used here in the case of the Veterinary Surgeons Bill in regard to these payments.  I feel that the Department of Agriculture was lacking&mdash;or else that the Department of Education was lacking &mdash;but I suppose it falls definitely on the Department of Agriculture&mdash;in not having made provision very much earlier for giving degrees and having a register of our own here.  We are not at all satisfied with the provision made in the Bill.  As a matter of fact, we are definitely hostile to it, and we cannot see any case in justice that can be made for the payment of this sum. It is not necessary to go over all these arguments again.</P>
      <P>With respect to item M.6., I have the same difficulty that Deputy Ryan has in seeing exactly what the Minister is aiming at.  He has indicated that his idea is to start this industry and that it cannot be started without his aid.  How does he propose afterwards to dispose of these creameries? What is the scheme as a whole?  It is an experiment.  What is the experiment going to end in?  That is not made clear and I do not think that we are in a position to argue the merits of the case until we know exactly what the Minister proposes to do and why he has elected, for instance, to proceed in a manner other than that suggested by Deputy Ryan by giving a loan and securing the loan.  Who are ultimately to become the proprietors of the creameries?</P>

It will cost something like one penny a gallon to collect the milk, and the <Col N="1444" /> full price of the milk to-day is something like 4d. a gallon, so that the cost of collection would be 25 per cent. of the price of the finished article.  That is a dangerous position.  There is another matter.  I did not know if the creamery mentioned by the Minister is at present in existence.  I think it is. I am not opposing creameries; in fact, I favour them very much, but I have experience of large areas where there is a small supply of milk, and I know the cost of collection is very high, and the thing is not going to be economic. Another matter is that the people who are in the habit of producing butter at home become unemployed when the milk is sent to the creameries, and the Minister should devise some scheme of finding alternative employment for these people selling their milk to the creameries and having it manufactured at a higher cost than at home.  He should develop the egg and poultry business, and get it to go hand in hand with the dairy business.  Certainly something will have to be done to supplement the dairy business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with the object of item M.6 of the Estimate for the extension of the creamery industry.  Considering at the present time what is being done for other branches of industry in this country, for instance, the amount of money that is being made available for electricity development, which will affect our industrial position, I, as a farmer, would think it wise that the dairy industry side by side with that development, should receive adequate consideration from the Department of Agriculture.  I look upon agricultural development as the main development for this country. In the initial stages in new areas or in areas where creameries, through lack of co-operation in the past by the farmers and because of insufficient capital, did not succeed, it is necessary for the Government to come to the rescue and to help the business by carrying out educational work and getting the farmers to realise what they can do by co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate position which has affected West Clare, the industrial <Col N="1445" /> West Clare co-operative creamery, is true of other new creameries in the past few years.  If we had a succession of years as in 1929 the industry would be able to get on its feet of its own.  In a favourable year farmers would be satisfied with the prices and contrasting it with the old system of butter making at home, there would be no difficulty in convincing people that the creamery system would be better than the home system.  Every Deputy in the House and men in towns and in business know quite well that during the summer time that milk is plentiful and home butter is correspondingly plentiful.  There is also the great difficulty of several shopkeepers handling a large amount of not first quality butter and I can speak from experience in the district where a similar experiment is going on as in West Clare that even indirectly the effect of establishing creameries has benefited farmers as a whole.</P>
    <P>It has benefited the farmers who refuse to come in and join creameries, and in the district I am familiar with I know quite well that several farmers who did not join the creamery have benefited very much.  At this time of the year a large quantity of butter which would be manufactured at home is manufactured in the creameries as a first-class article and it left the market all the better.  At the present time it is unfortunate that in several areas of the country there are very large quantities of Irish butter, almost unsaleable from the point of view that it has been very badly handled.  I will say this, that we have in this country as good home butter makers as any in the world and at the same time we have a large number of people who make bad butter, and that butter is put on the market to the detriment of the industry as a whole.  For that reason I believe it is good policy for the Dáil and Government to advance the necessary funds to help creameries in their initial stages.  I said the industry can stand on its own if we had a year like 1929, but last year and this year have been years of acute depression in the butter market.  We have had to <Col N="1446" /> compete with the butter production in other countries; we have had the difficulty of having to compete with these countries in the market where we sell our surplus butter, and when butter is produced in greater quantities than we can deal with at home there is a consequent reduction in price.  At the world price now available for butter it is impossible for farmers to carry on the industry with any hope of success and even the old established creameries at the present time are feeling the pinch.</P>
    <P>If you ask farmers to produce milk at 4d. per gallon or less, you are asking them to do something that you would not ask people in the industrial world to do.  I do not think it irrelevant to say that people are expecting too much of the farmers in this respect.  I hold that the butter produced from milk bought at 4d. per gallon, and adding on the cost of production, imposes an impossible charge on the farmers of this country.  If you develop the industry for the mutual benefit of the countryside, they will have to take on the responsibility of paying the loans for the erection of the buildings, the purchase of plant, etc.  You can picture the difficulty where farmers supply 10 gallons a day, and the system is to collect back the loans at 2s. or 2s. 6d. per share for the five best months of the year.  The deductions that have to be made from the small cheques at the 4d. rate from the farmers in some cases, eats up the whole amount received for the milk, with the result that the small farmers say to themselves, it is not worth their while sending out supplies at the low price, especially where farmers are placed a good distance away from creameries.  I believe the experiment is a help to the industry, whether in this particular area or other parts of the country where it may be suitable, and is very good policy, and deserves support.</P>
    <P>I believe that the creamery industry where the promoters have been cautious before the start off to see that the necessary facilities for development and success are there, has come to stay.  I believe that this period of <Col N="1447" /> depression will go by.  At the same time, I am satisfied that for the next few years the new creameries will require the very sympathetic help of the Department of Agriculture.  They are the people who are directly concerned with the development of agriculture, and I think it very unfair for any section of the Dáil who are interested in other industrial projects to be too critical where a work of this kind is being attempted in the interest of the farming community.  We are all anxious to help the industry, which is most in need of help to-day.  Possibly, dairying is the one branch of industry which I believe is deserving of every possible co-operation from the Government and the farmers.  We have seen in Denmark and other countries that the Government is helping the farmers when the farmers are, in the first instance, agreeable to co-operate.</P>
    <P>In the West Clare district it was unfortunate that the development took place just at the time when the depression had set in, and the promoters were up against a serious handicap.  It would be much easier developed in 1929 or last year.  All the same, it is all the more reason now, when they have attempted the industry, that they should be helped.  I am quite satisfied that the dairying industry has a future before it when the promoters are co-operative in outlook and when the farmers are active in co-operation.  The creamery industry in the country as a whole will be glad to see that the Department in this particular instance is favourably disposed to help the whole industry, and I am quite confident that the experiment, when carried out with caution and when developing new areas, should be proceeded with carefully before the sites for our auxiliaries are selected, so that the milk supply will be adequate and the success of the industry assured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Deputy MacEntee's question first.  The share capital taken up was £6,000 by about 150 people.  They paid up about £600, that is one-tenth, at the first call. The assets include the central creamery, <Col N="1448" /> the auxiliary, stocks and other assets. The liabilities are about £9,100.  Of the liabilities, £600 would go to the shareholders who have to be repaid.  The working capital that would be required for a place like that would be about £5,000.  It will be managed by the Dairy Disposals Board, who are already managing a number of creameries.  They will be disposed of. That was a point which was also raised by Deputy Gorry.  We proposed to dispose of them.  The assets really will become the property of the milk suppliers. An arrangement will be made by which the milk suppliers will pay over a period of years by deductions from the money from their milk supply. We believe that we can pay them as good a price as we are now paying in Limerick after these deductions.  That is to say, we will pay the interest and sinking fund and a competitive price for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>For what period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not really say. That would depend on a number of factors.  It will depend on the price of butter for one thing.  If the price of butter is good, obviously you can afford to make a good deduction from the milk supplies.  If the present depression got worse, we would be obliged to go very slowly in the beginning. It varies in every creamery with the price of butter.  The deductions for depreciation and sinking fund would vary in every creamery with the price ruling for the product.  I should say that we should get it back in five or six years unless prices collapse.  I think we can manage these creameries very economically.  That is our experience in regard to creameries that we have opened already.  Of course the manufacture of butter is an ideal commodity from the point of view of an experiment like this.  It is more or less mechanical.  The price of the raw materials, if the business is run in the way that a co-operative society runs it, and if there is no gambling in butter stocks, depends absolutely on the price of butter.  If your mathematics are right you should never be at a loss.  The reason they <Col N="1449" /> are at a loss sometimes is that, firstly, they try to give too much.  Obviously, if they give too much, having regard to the price of butter, they will be at a loss.  They may sometimes incur losses through causes connected with the personnel of their staff, and they may have losses on other occasions in holding butter and in gambling in stocks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen made quite an important point that was also made by Deputy Gorry.  Everything depends on the milk supplies in these districts. It is quite impossible to run a creamery unless there are economic milk supplies.  What I want to point out is that the milk supplies in this area are absolutely ample.  Yet it is an extraordinary thing that in Clare, where there are ample supplies, the creamery industry never flourished, for some reasons which I have indicated in the beginning, and for other reasons that are peculiar to the county.  The milk supplies, however, are ample, and I believe even there the usual economic laws will operate.  They have got there a first-class concern for manufacturing their milk into butter, rather than turning it into butter at home, and I believe the milk supplies will come in.  If the milk supplies do not come in this experiment is a failure, but I believe they will come in.  Anyway it is their asset; it has been purchased at £1 per share.  The creamery will be resold, if you like to put it that way, to the same people, but if you say it will be resold to the same people it depends on what you mean by the same people.  There are 150 shareholders in this creamery, but there will be over one thousand milk suppliers, and these milk suppliers are the people who will own the creamery if we succeed in deducting the interest and the sinking fund within a couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan wanted to know why we had not acted in this area as in other areas.  The trouble about the money is that there is no security.  If it were a question of lending money to put up one creamery, costing seven or eight thousand pounds, then you would have a security of some kind in <Col N="1450" /> the seven or eight thousand shares. Here you have a creamery with seven or eight auxiliaries, capable of handling up to 30,000 gallons of milk.  If we were to give the money without security, we might as well go the whole hog, and take the whole responsibility of running it.  If we are to lose money at all, let us lose it ourselves, or let us have a good chance of not losing it.  If we give it without security, we have no control over the body that is handling it.  They may make mistakes or they may not, but we have no way of controlling their processes.  We are parting with money without either security or without seeing that it is spent in the way we like, because when you give money without security, you should have the right to see how the money is spent.  If you give money to start a business in that way, if you want to see how it must be spent, you must really take charge yourself, and we propose to do that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the veterinary Estimate, of course, if Deputies take the line that this agreement should not have been made, and that there is no reason why we should have the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons acting in this particular way, it is quite logical to vote against the Estimate.  If it is once admitted that it facilitates veterinary surgeons to have that degree, then in sheer self-respect what we must do is to refund the cost of the examinations.  It is not an issue whether a man should be paid for the service he renders.  Even though the expenses of the Royal College of Surgeons were £714 in connection with examinations, we settled with them for £500.  We did not bargain with them, but it was suggested as a round figure. Once we were ready to agree that the Royal College of Surgeons should carry out these examinations, we had to pay.  There is a fundamental difference, of course.  Deputies opposite feel that there should be no agreement, and that there should be a purely Irish degree, that there should be no need to pay the Royal College of Surgeons for the examinations they carry out here.  That being so, they are going to vote against the Estimate.  If it is <Col N="1451" /> essential that there should be opportunities here for intending veterinary surgeons to obtain the degree of the Royal College of Surgeons, on that assumption you cannot refuse to pay the actual out-of-pocket expenses of the examination.</P>

      <P>I mean in future.  We find that in our district in the initial stages a certain number of shareholders have to take responsibility for the organisation, and do all the uphill work while a number of their neighbours are on the ditch looking on.  When you make deductions at the outset from the value of their milk cheques, you are burdening them with the liabilities which possibly the whole people should carry, and in this particular instance, wishing to see these experiments getting a fair chance of success, I think no collection should be made further than what would cover the interest.  I think they should start right away to collect the shares.</P>

      <P>We have already indicated our attitude towards this section in the debate on the Second Reading Stage.  I do not propose to add anything to what has already <Col N="1458" /> been said.  This is an additional tax upon a necessity of life and upon a commodity which is most generally used by the poorer sections of the community.  We believe that the Minister for the purposes which the Minister has in view in imposing this tax could have procured the money in other ways out of economies and retrenchments, and for that reason we see no justification for imposing the additional tax upon sugar.  Accordingly we propose to divide the House upon it.</P>

      <P>Not exactly.  An ordinary contractor at present, if he has entered into a contract to supply say sugar or any other article prior to the imposition of the increased duty, can charge the amount to the person to whom he supplies it.  But a doubt has arisen in the case of the Combined Purchasing Department as to whether or not a contract has been completed until the order has been given.  That is to say a contractor tenders with the Combined Purchasing Department to supply goods at a certain price.  Then these goods are ordered by the local authority and it has come to be believed that under the law as it stands the contract was not completed at the time that the person tendered and was accepted by the Combined Purchasing Department.  Consequently he would not be able to charge the increased price caused by the increase in duty and this is to enable him to charge it.</P>

      <P>exceeds 8d. and does not exceed 1s. 1d.&mdash;threepence;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the duty on sound films places an additional burden on cinema <Col N="1461" /> proprietors which, in accordance with the general principles governing the incidence of taxation, they should be in a position to pass on to the public. This they can only do, of course, by an increase in their charges of admission. In any case, however, in which a proprietor is already charging the highest possible price appropriate to any particular rate of duty, he cannot increase that price without incurring liability to a higher rate of duty.  The common inclusive price of 2s. 4d. may be taken as an illustration.  This price is made up of a 2s. charge for admission plus 4d. duty.  If the proprietor wishes to increase his charge by 1d., the increased charge will be brought within the scope of the next higher rate of duty, viz.: 6d., and the new inclusive price will be 2s. 1d. plus 6d.&mdash;i.e., 2s. 7d.  An increase of 3d. on the 2s. 4d. price would probably be resented by the public, and would result in some transference of patronage to lower-priced seats, thus defeating the object aimed at.  The same argument applies to the inclusive prices 6d., 9d., and 1s. 3d., all of which are very popular prices.  There is, therefore, a strong case for some modification of the scale which will provide for increases of charges at these points without any increased liability in respect of duty.</P>
    <P>The draft clause renders it possible to make increased charges without increasing the rates of duty.  The existing rates of duty are as follow:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The higher rates are not affected by the proposal, since the highest inclusive price for admission to a cinema (unless on some exceptional occasion) being 3/-, there is no case for carrying the revision further.  In any event, the classes of entertainments to which the higher rates will apply will, in view of the exemptions embodied in the Finance Bill, be very limited, and the number of such entertainments held very few.</P>
    <P>Under the amended scale the inclusive prices of 6d., 9d., 1/3, and 2/4 may be increased to 7d., 10d., 1/4 and 2/6 respectively, or to any intermediate figure, without any increase of duty.  It is not probable that there will be any substantial transference of patronage to lower-priced seats on account of any increases which will actually be made, and consequently the yield of the duty will not be appreciably affected by the change.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister and the House will accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly evident that unless something of that kind is done the great majority of cinemas in the Free State will have to close down in view of the tax which has been put upon films. The exhibitors are in the difficult position that the renters can charge what price they like, and they have notified the exhibitors that they will put this increased duty on them.  If this amendment is carried it will meet them in a small way, and I hope that the Minister and the House will accept it.</P>

      <P>This amendment gives greater flexibility to the owners of picture houses in regard to the scale of charges at certain points of that scale.  It is not a change that will make for any loss in revenue.  Representations in favour of it have been <Col N="1463" /> very strongly made by representatives of the picture house owners.  Without accepting absolutely the whole of their arguments, I think that there is no harm in giving them this increased measure of flexibility in the matter of charges, and I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am very glad this amendment has been accepted.  I am not speaking for the moment on the actual details of the proposal put forward by Deputy Shaw, but there has undoubtedly been trouble in the past, due to lack of flexibility, and the amendment, which does give a little room of that kind, is undoubtedly valuable and practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of flexibility, I agree with the Minister and Deputies Shaw and Flinn, but I am not quite so certain whether we are justified in giving all the flexibility that the amendment proposes.  It would seem that those behind the amendment have in mind the idea of passing on to the public the full burden of the tax on films, and not only passing on the full burden, but possibly making a substantial profit, and using the tax as an excuse for increasing the charges to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has not been presented to the House in a manner which would satisfy me that its terms are entirely justified.  We have had no figures to show what the average revenue of a first-run picture house in the City of Dublin would be, nor have we any particulars as to the burden of the tax upon such a house for a week's run.  I think that before the Dáil can agree to accept in full the proposal put forward by Deputy Shaw, we ought to have some further information upon these points.  Personally, I would very strongly object to the whole of this tax being passed on to the public.  After all, the people whom I think the Minister had in mind as victims in the first place were not the public, who are already sufficiently shorn in this country where they are subject already to a very strong ring and monopoly, but the film renters.  Now if, owing to certain political exigencies, the burden <Col N="1464" /> of the tax is going to be diverted from the huge monopolistic concerns which control this industry in Ireland and passed on to the public, I should very strongly object to that.  I do see that there is some case to be made for the exhibitors, but I do not believe it is anything so strong as Deputy Shaw has made it, nor do I think that we would be entitled to make this amendment so flexible that the whole burden of the tax should be passed on to the public. For that reason I think we should get some fuller information with regard to it.  Do I take it the Minister is going himself to introduce an amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because I think it it will have no effect on revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not going to have any effect on revenue admittedly. The whole tax is going to be collected. The question is, from whom is it going to be collected?  Is it going to be collected from the public who go to the picture houses, or from the exhibitors, or from the film renters&mdash;that is, virtually the people who make the films?  If I have any say in the matter, it is going to be collected from the renters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>That is impossible.  The renters are in the position that they can dictate their own terms.  There is no other way to obtain films than through renters.  You must either shut down or take the films at whatever price they care to charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shaw is under a misapprehension&mdash;at least he is endeavouring to leave the House under a misapprehension.  There are other sources from which films can be got besides Hollywood or Elstree.  There are excellent films done in English made in Germany and there is a very big film industry in Russia whose films have been admired and praised as masterpieces.  The only thing about it is this, that the film exhibitors in this country are so tied up with both British and American concerns that they will not go elsewhere.  There are French firms making pictures which are creating astonishment in London, even though the major portion of the <Col N="1465" /> dialogue is in French.  These pictures are being shown to crowded houses, to people who scarcely know a word of French.  There are also Italian and Norwegian films.  The fact of the matter is that if the exhibitors are content to continue and endeavour to preserve the monopoly which certain American and British interests have created in this country, then undoubtedly these renters are going to make exhibitors pay.  If they go further afield and develop what Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Esmonde possibly are fond of describing as the continental mind, and really try to get in touch with continental culture in the matter of the cinema, then I do not believe they will be subject to that extortion which Deputy Shaw fears.  I certainly am not disposed, until I hear some further argument in favour of it, to support this amendment. I think that the Minister would not be justified in permitting exhibitors and renters between them to pass this tax on to the public.  I believe that if the exhibitors show sufficient independence and enterprise they can get just as good films outside ring sources as are being shown in Dublin.  They can get French, German, Italian, Russian and Norwegian films, and films from other countries which are turning out real masterpieces, and can help to break this ring and compel the Americans and the British to meet them fairly in the matter.  I hope the Minister is not going to accept this amendment in its present form and that he will insist that there is included in it, at any rate, some condition to safeguard the public to some extent.</P>

      <P>There is nothing that would please every exhibitor better than to be able to break the monopoly. If Deputy MacEntee can convey to people in that business&mdash;I do not know much about it myself&mdash;that he could get them suitable films, he will find that they are most anxious to break that monopoly, and if he can get people in foreign countries to supply them they will be only too pleased. So far as my knowledge goes I never heard that any of these foreign films <Col N="1466" /> offered were refused by any exhibitors in the trade.</P>

      <P>I can tell Deputy Shaw that two pictures, &ldquo;End of St. Petersburg&rdquo; and &ldquo;Storm Over Asia,&rdquo; films produced in Russia, have aroused demonstrations of admiration wherever they were shown.  These films were hawked up and down Dublin and not a single one of the prominent exhibitors who were tied up to the Paramount and the British International firms would look at them.</P>

      <P>Of course, but that is because the Deputy did not see the films and because he has no receptivity of mind, no openness in this matter. I went to see them.  I went to see them many times, because I am interested in the cinema.  They were most wonderful productions, but those people who profess not to be able to break a monopoly would not look at this.  The picture &ldquo;The End of St. Petersburg&rdquo; had to be shown in a very small cinema where few people go, but it attracted a crowded house. The picture of the &ldquo;Storm Over Asia&rdquo; had to be shown in a small picture house in Lower O'Connell Street, but there again the house was crowded for three weeks.  The big picture houses would not show them because they had the same sort of mind as Deputy Shaw has.  They were not sufficiently enterprising to risk the experiment.  People of that sort are not entitled to any consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not touch the point.  I am somewhere between Deputy Shaw and Deputy MacEntee in this matter.  I think in principle what Deputy MacEntee has said is perfectly correct, but the practical business of putting it into effect is entirely different. It is true that, broadly speaking, we are in the hands of a ring.  It is also <Col N="1467" /> true it would be very desirable for us to break that ring.  I doubt very much myself unless we could get co-operation from the Executive authority whether we would be able to produce inside the cinema industry in Ireland that unity and effectiveness that would enable us to break it.  I think we all agree in principle that this monopoly is undesirable, and that this monopoly is exercising the ordinary functions and custom of monopoly in taking monopoly prices.  It is also perfectly true that they have attempted to hand on the whole of this cost to the community. I am not suggesting that it could be done in this, not for a moment, but I am suggesting that when it is recognised that there is this monopoly at present in existence, that there are real difficulties in getting the cinema industry as at present organised in Ireland to break through that ring on its own, and that the Minister recognising the extra cost put upon the Free State due to the power of that monopoly, should between now and the next Budget or ad interim, in consultation with those concerned, see whether something could be done.  I think something could be done, but I do not think it could be done very easily.  Another point is this&mdash;it will not refer to Deputy Shaw's particular interest in the matter&mdash;a certain amount of the extra cost of films is undoubtedly due to preventable, and very unwise and stupid competition between different cinemas in the cities themselves. The whole blame is not on the monopoly.  The monopoly is getting, as all monopolies do, its monopoly prices, on top of a fool price, due to lack of organisation.  If I thought the cinema industry itself was absolutely clear of blame in the matter I think I would press the case very much more strongly on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we might frankly recognise that it is desirable that films should come into Ireland from more than one source.  If that is to be done it is necessary that films coming in, say, from some of the alternative sources should have reasonable opportunity.  Most of the cinemas at the present moment are booked up with one or other of the <Col N="1468" /> branches of the monopoly.  What the Minister may well do&mdash;I am not putting it in any definite form, as it is a matter for consideration&mdash;is that he might take a ration system say next year, or whoever is running the Finance Department next year, might do so.  They could say that ten per cent. of the films shall come in from France or from England or Germany, or some other country.  They might be able to divide it up into three, and in that way they would be able to guarantee to the alternative sources of supplies that they would have a market when they came here.  At the present moment the position is that if any of these Russian films attempt to come in nobody can take them without breaking existing contracts and existing good-will in the matter of preferences as to when precisely they are going to get films to show.  Deputy Shaw and everyone knows that the whole film industry is honeycombed with preferences and queer things of that kind, and it is very difficult for people who want to be quite honest and straight to get through things of that kind.  It is not so easy as Deputy MacEntee imagines or so impossible as Deputy Shaw thinks, but it may require the co-operative of the Executive to make it effective. My sole agreement with this amendment is because it is flexible.  I always desire to be perfectly frank in a matter of this kind, and I am speaking with some knowledge, as I am interested, and the House is entitled to discount what a person says who is interested to that extent, I like flexibility. Anyone who has attempted to arrange prices in different portions of the house knows how completely we have been tied up in the past.  You have got to make huge jumps.  If you have four or five different prices and if you try to vary them you will find it is very difficult in the present schedule.</P>
    <P>I personally would prefer that, where it was possible, some system of percentage on the total takings and complete freedom as to the prices which they were charging, would be allowed. But if the Minister cannot do that, then I would prefer anything that makes for flexibility and for the benefit of the entertainment consuming <Col N="1469" /> public.  I would very much like if the Minister would take two lines&mdash;one the line proposed by Deputy Hogan last year and that is that the lower-priced entertainment, because it has certain social and psychological values, should be as far as possible exempted. I would exempt all entertainment to a cost of 6d. and after that I would allow the entertainment houses to pay upon a percentage total basis and give them complete freedom as to how they would regulate the prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point in connection with that and that is that Deputy Shaw has made a point that the renters are going to pass this tax on to the exhibitors, and I object to this amendment.  It means that they are going to pass that tax on to the public.  So far as Dublin is concerned, there is one picture theatre with a seating capacity of over 3,000, which is run by a film manufacturing concern.  There is another one with an equally large capacity which is closely related with a British film-making concern and there is a third one not so closely related with a film-making concern but which has certain affiliations with them.  Those two or three theatres between them account for a total seating capacity of 9,000. In their case, if Deputy Shaw's amendment were not accepted by the House they would not be able to pass the tax on.  The tax would remain with the renters.  If Deputy Shaw's amendment is passed the tax is going to be passed by the renters on to the public. There is one way in which Deputy Shaw's point of view may be met.  I take it he is interested in the smaller and provincial picture theatres.  For them, I have a considerable sympathy and if the principles, not the exact terms, of Deputy Shaw's amendment were to be applied to houses with a certain limited capacity I would see much less objection in it.  It it were not to apply to houses with a seating capacity of over 1,500 or between 1,200 or 1,500, or if the terms were changed to reduce its flexibility or to prevent the renters or exhibitors passing the tax on to the public my objection to it would be diminished.</P>

      <P>There is, at the present time, a scarcity of films, and many picture houses in Dublin have had to show the same film for two successive weeks because they were unable to procure others.  There is also at the present time, due to our strict censorship of which we approve, a disposition on the part of a great many film companies not to send pictures to the Free State, and if any person from any side can suggest any way by which the renters can be penalised I shall certainly be very glad to hear it.  But none of the deputation to-day on behalf of the picture houses of the country were able to make any suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. de Loughrey Mr. de Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just rise because the discussion centres round Dublin. I would like to remind the House that there are cinemas and picture houses in other places and they are very hardly hit by the action of the film renters.  The theatres in Dublin with a fair seating capacity have a good way of carrying on and can fight against it, but the smaller cinemas in the country are practically left to the mercy of the film renters.  I know of my own experience how very difficult it is to carry on cinemas and I must say this whole amendment of Deputy Shaw's is disappointing. Cinema exhibitors in the country have been looking forward for years expecting to get remissions, as Deputy Flinn says up to 6d., but this amendment leaves the smaller houses, for which I think we ought to have some consideration, in practically the same position as they were before.  For instance, in any of the popular price seats there is no change.  If he charged unusual prices he might make something, for instance if he charged 7d., but the 4d. is the same, the 6d. is the same, the 9d., 1s., and 1s. 6d. prices are the same, and in any of the regular prices there is no change.  Our grievance is that the tax on the lower seats is too high.  When you come to the higher seats it reduces down to one-eighth.  It is meant for the seat apparently.  For 2s. 4d. you charge 2s. 6d. now; for 2s. you charge <Col N="1471" /> 2s. 2d.  There is no such seat in the smaller country towns.  The working class seat used to be 6d.  This has ceased to exist in the country.  They get in at 4d. now free of tax.  The 4d. seat is not much good in the country and the whole seating accommodation pulls in £5 or £6.  I would like to stress the point that there is nobody making money in the country on cinemas at the present time.  They have to meet all these charges that the exhibitors put on, and if given free up to 6d. they would have 3d. as well as 4d. and 1s. seats.  They should be allowed to put a 2d. tax on the 1s. price.  It is really impossible between the attitude of the renters and the continuation of the exorbitant entertainment tax to carry on.</P>
      <P>Although I am interested, I would like to make it clear, and everybody recognises, that the cinema in the country is the only entertainment the people have.  My own experience is that I think the lower price seats should be treated more generously.  I think a jump of 1½d. is too much.  A 1½d. tax on a 4d. ticket is too much. I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that in the country it is difficult to carry on cinemas.  I believe that he will be convinced that it is necessary to be somewhat more generous on the lower price seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we could contemplate at present any changes in the scale which would mean less revenue because the whole revenue position is not such that we could afford at the moment to make changes which would involve a loss. On the question of flexibility, there is no doubt if it could be done that an ideal thing would be to give flexibility by simply charging a percentage of the takings.  That has been my view for some time.  The difficulty is, however, that for various reasons it has not been possible to allow all houses to pay on certified returns.  The house which pays on certified returns has a certain advantage in that respect and if you give it a further advantage by allowing it to have complete <Col N="1472" /> flexibility, which the house not paying on certified returns could not have, then you will increase the difference between them.  We always felt that it would be very severe, for reasons which were sufficient from the revenue point of view but which might not appeal to the house whose returns were not accepted, to put that house at a very definite disadvantage compared with some other houses.  For that reason we have not been able to make up our minds to arrange for complete flexibility.  On the other hand, I think that any changes in the scale which will make for it are to the good. People are of the view that by giving them that measure of flexibility you are giving them a certain bargaining power in dealing with the renters in certain cases.  I think there are cases in which that would occur.  Moreover, there might be cases in which if the renters succeeded in passing on the tax the proprietor would be driven to put up the price, if he had not flexibility and, in addition to putting up the price a penny or so, the tax might be increased further, which I think is not desirable.</P>
      <P>I think the present difficulty that exists in the matter of obtaining films will disappear.  I do believe something could be done towards getting films from sources that are not now tapped. I think also that as the making of talkie films is a relatively new industry the shortage people have experienced will be modified and that there will be an element of competition if the cinema proprietors really operate as they might operate.  If it were possible for the State to give help certainly it should be given, but I think anything of that nature can only be done when the cinema proprietors are well organised and had decided on some plan of campaign themselves.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the application of this amendment to houses not exceeding a certain seating accommodation?  In its present form it does enable some of the tied houses to pass the whole of the tax on to the public.  Under the Act as it stands these people, because they will have to meet competition, will be compelled <Col N="1473" /> to pay the tax themselves.  The point is whether these big foreign concerns are going to be benefited by Deputy Shaw's amendment.  It is designed to help the smaller country houses, but these big concerns are going to be enabled to pass the tax on here to a large body of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I made some objection to this section and I do not think I was satisfactorily answered by the Minister.  I pointed out that it exempted public utility companies who were limited either in regard to dividend or to the price which they could charge to the public, by charter or law, from the corporation profits tax.  I have yet to hear the Minister make a case for that.  I do not think that the limitation as to dividend and the price charged by the concern for the commodity manufactured by the company, is in actual practice an effective one because it simply means that the distribution of these dividends is deferred until such time as a sufficiently large sum has accumulated to warrant their making a bonus distribution of shares.  That is what has happened in a number of undertakings in this country which would be effected by this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister again put forward to the House some solid reasons as to why these particular companies should be exempt from the operation of a tax which he has already indicated to the House he considers <Col N="1474" /> unfair when it is applied to less fortunate undertakings.  If a company or an undertaking, enjoying a monopoly position in the country, is to be exempt from the corporation profits tax, why should another limited company not so fortunate, say, as the Gas Company, not enjoying a monopoly, possibly a manufacturing concern in this country, not be exempt from the corporation profits tax also?</P>
    <P>There are many struggling concerns engaged in various industries which are just finding their feet under the protection of tariffs, and they are assessed for corporation tax.  The Gas Company and the Tramways Company, I think, to which this section of the Bill in particular relates, have&mdash;at least the Gas Company has&mdash;an unchallenged monopoly virtually.  The Tramways Company has a certain limited monopoly.  In either case, the clause in their charter limiting their dividends in proportion to the price which they charge, is no effective protection for the public.  We all know that the shares of these undertakings were standing at a very low figure in the markets some years ago.  They are now standing at a comparatively high figure, and they are standing at that very high figure because the companies did not distribute anything like the major portion of their profits.  They put them into mains and reserves, and ultimately the day will come when the shareholders are going to have these reserves distributed as bonus shares.</P>
    <P>They are simply hoarding up these dividends and not distributing them. At the present moment, because they are hoarding up, they have nothing to pay with regard to the corporation profits tax.  Their dividend is not supposed to exceed six per cent.  That may not be the actual dividend of the company.  The company is making £100,000 profit per annum.  It distributes as a dividend £60,000 of that, and it has the other £40,000 to put into reserve.  When they have done that for several years the reserve will have equalled the nominal value of the capital, and then they will distribute a bonus share to each shareholder for every share he holds.  Then the nominal <Col N="1475" /> capital of the company will be one million pounds, and the amount distributed in dividends will have been increased from £30,000 to £60,000, and the shareholders who originally had one share in that company and were receiving six per cent. dividend on it will now be receiving 12 per cent. dividend on it, and the company will not have paid any corporation profits tax, because its dividends were supposed to be limited by charter.  In actual fact, what is happening is that the shareholders will not take their dividends at once.  They merely store them up until they are able to receive them as capital increments.  The ordinary consumers living under the monopoly have had to pay such an excess price as to enable that capital increment to be created, and all the time the company is exempted from the corporation profits tax.  For that reason, before we agree to the amendment I would like if the Minister would justify the exemption of these particular companies from the operation of that tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the last Deputy, as I will approach the matter from an entirely different angle.  I do not regard the corporation profits tax as a good type of tax.  It is really additional income tax levied on a number of businesses; therefore I do not think that it is an extremely good tax.  It is, however, a tax which gives us substantial revenue, and it also gives us a revenue which I regard as coming in place of death duties from foreign companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the greater portion of our corporation profits tax comes from foreign companies not registered or controlled here, owning property and carrying on business here.  If you take a foreign company which owns property here, with a great many shareholders who live outside the country, it means that in the course of a generation all that property may pass into the hands of new owners, but we do not get any death duties.  The shareholders are living in England.  I have several times said that until some new tax is devised that will get us the <Col N="1476" /> equivalent of death duties in respect of property owned here by foreign companies, I think the corporation profits tax should be maintained.  The extension of the scope of a tax which I do not regard as a really good tax or a very defensible tax is another matter. Although we are only renewing what was a temporary exemption here, to fail to renew it, having regard to the fact that it has existed since the commencement of the tax would be equivalent to extending the scope of the tax and it is really on that basis that I propose the amendment.  I admit that certain arguments of a limited value can be put up in favour of some of these companies, but my main point in connection with it is that to refuse to extend this exemption which has been extended time after time would be equivalent to an extension of the scope of the tax, and I do not want to do it.</P>

I am accepting the Minister's point of view in regard to that at the moment, but the Minister proposes to exempt the Dublin United Tramways Company, a big carrying undertaking which for years enjoyed the monopoly of transport in this city and which could virtually charge the passengers anything it liked provided it was able to make an apparent case before the Tribunal.

The Minister stated that the reason he wanted to continue this tax was because by means of it he was able to get at certain companies who were controlled outside this country and that when shares passed from one ownership to another, owing to death, he was not able to collect death duties. The Gas Company is not controlled in this country.  It is controlled in London. Why should it be exempt since the Minister wants to get at these companies which are controlled outside this country?  The Minister is not at all consistent in the attitude he has taken up.  In order to get at companies which are controlled outside this country he proposes to apply this corporation profits tax, which he regards as an undesirable tax, to virtually every substantial company in this country, whether it is controlled here or not.  The Minister could achieve his purpose and could achieve it very effectively by deleting paragraph (a) and substituting for it a paragraph which would make the corporation profits tax apply only to companies which were controlled outside this country, whether they were limited in respect of dividends or price or not.

    </Speaker>
    <P>All taxes and duties imposed or continued by this Act are hereby <Col N="1479" /> placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister to-day blatantly told the House that the Revenue Commissioners do attempt to take care of and collect this tax, in particular cases if it does not suit him he damn well will not let them.  That is the plain English of it. The Minister says here is a particular case.  Deputy Myles, Deputy Murphy and all the other absent Independents who find it perfectly safe to go into the Division Lobby when they knew Labour was going to vote with Cumann na nGaedheal, put forward representations in favour of particular people, and immediately the Minister said this particular clause shall not operate. &ldquo;All taxes and duties imposed or continued by this Act are hereby placed under the care and management of Deputies Myles, Thrift, Alton, Redmond, Murphy and other recalcitrant members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am asking whether or not these Revenue Commissioners are an independent body with independent jurisdiction to carry out this section, or whether they may be interfered with by the Minister for Finance as and when it suits him to do so.  If it means that &ldquo;all taxes and duties imposed or continued by this Act are hereby placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners subject to the parliamentary exigencies of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; then we know where we stand.  Does it mean that?  Am I entitled to assume that the Revenue Commissioners in this case mean the Revenue Commissioners as knocked about, played about and ordered about by the Minister for Finance, or are they independent people?  I think we ought to know.</P>

      <P>I notice that the net total of the Estimate has been reduced from £93,600 to £87,500.  Is that due to a general decrease in rates throughout the country, or does it represent merely an arbitrary reduction by the Minister for Finance?  The fact that the figures represent a reduction of almost 7 per cent. would seem to be a very effective retort to the statement made by the Minister with regard to local authorities.

      <P>We all realise that the Government must have some fund of this sort, a Secret Service Fund, that we cannot know exactly how it is spent, but we are pretty certain over here on these benches that it is spent in a way in which it should not be spent, that is in the employment of agents-provocateur.  When I mentioned this matter before, the Minister denied that he was using it in that way, but when I mentioned that one of these people had declared on oath that he had organised raids while in the employment of the Government, the Minister did not say any more. Since then we have had another case. As long as this money is suspected of being used for such a purpose we are going to object to it.  I expect the Minister is not going to tell us how the money is being spent but I suggest that a certain portion of it is being spent in that way.  We are going to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of course, in regard to this particular Vote is that one has no way of knowing what the money is spent on.  I <Col N="1483" /> would ask the Minister whether it is out of this fund that the kind of person who is sent along as a bodyguard to save the President when he goes to places like Naas, is paid.  On the occasion I refer to, those people acted with such activity that they beat anybody who asked questions at the meeting in Naas on June 21st.  They beat not only the people who asked questions, but some of their own supporters.  On one occasion some enterprising member of the force put a revolver to the chest of a girl and told her to repeat what she had said.  I do not know whether those people are paid out of that fund or not.  I think it is only right that the matter should be mentioned.  It would be far better to have no fund of that sort than to have the public savaged in that way by irresponsible persons paid out of that fund.</P>
      <P>The second matter is whether that fund can be used for the purpose, say, of paying compensation money to people who may have been damnified under the order given originally by the Minister for Defence for stopping trains to Bodenstown.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether it is intended to use that money for the purpose of compensating the railway company or other persons for the losses sustained, and, if so, what authority he would be acting under for doing so.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be entitled to use this secret service fund, or has he used it, for the purpose of indemnifying officers of the law who have grossly exceeded their functions and have been held liable in damages of a civil kind for wrongful and illegal arrest?  Would he be entitled to use this money for the purpose of indemnifying perfectly good Civic Guards who, according to the Minister for Justice, remained perfectly good Civic Guards but who have committed forty physical assaults upon members of the public? Would he be entitled to use it for the purpose of paying the fines of perfectly good peace commissioners who go out into the fairs and knock the teeth down the throats of perfectly good ordinary citizens?  Are there any <Col N="1484" /> limits for the purpose for which this fund can be used, and if there are limits would the Minister tell us what the limits are?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why we object to this Vote is because we have already had an admission from a responsible officer in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department that an unfortunate man who was found murdered in the neighbourhood of Dublin some months ago had been for a considerable time in the pay of the Secret Service.  While he was in the pay of the Secret Service he was pretending to be a member of what the Minister and the Minister for Justice and other members of the Executive Council have referred to in this House from time to time as a murder gang, an illegal organisation or society to subvert the State.  He was not only a member of that organisation, but he enjoyed a certain prominence and influence in it.  I have no doubt that while he was a member of that organisation he was guilty of inciting other members of that organisation to acts for which some of them were afterwards apprehended.  The information which has been conveyed to me is that one of the prisoners who were recently on hunger strike was brought to trial and sentenced and imprisoned because of an explosive machine which had been given to him by this unfortunate man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, when this matter was raised in the House, was emphatic and unmeasured in the denunciatory language which he employed in relation to the man who was then on huger strike.  He was equally emphatic and unmeasured in his condemnation of the Fianna Fáil Party because they had endorsed a question which had been put in this House in relation to that particular hunger strike, but the association between the Minister for Justice and the Executive Council with these acts of unrest in the country, with these incidents with which from time to time the Executive Council endeavour to terrorise and intimidate <Col N="1485" /> the people of this country into continuing to support the present Government and its policy&mdash;the association between the Executive Council and this organisation&mdash;is very much closer and very much more intimate than the association of Fianna Fáil with that organisation.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that we are Republicans as they are, that we are out to achieve the establishment of the independence of this country.  We are out to establish that independence under a Republican form of Government, but I do not think that there are any members of the Fianna Fáil organisation who at the same time are members of that association which the Minister and those who are associated with him so bitterly condemn.  Certainly no member of the Fianna Fáil organisation is paid out of Fianna Fáil funds to be a member of that organisation.  But the Minister and those who are associated with him have paid certain individuals out of public funds to go into that organisation, to incite other members of that organisation to acts of lawlessness for which they are subsequently apprehended, and when the time comes the Minister with a show of virtue and with a pretended zeal for law and order seizes the opportunity of associating us with those acts.  I think it is time that the Minister and those associated with him should stop playing the double game in this country. If they are really in earnest in wanting to preserve peace and order in this country they ought not any longer to subvent, as they are doing by means of a Secret Service Vote, people to go into that organisation and to endeavour to stir it up and keep it active.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is a Secret Service Vote I do not propose to discuss either the purpose or the expenditure of the Vote.  I just say this one thing with reference to what has been said that it is not only justifiable but it is the duty of a Government when there is illegal armed associations in the country to endeavour to obtain information from inside about the affairs, the plans and the proceedings <Col N="1486" /> of that association.  I just say, on the other hand, that it would be wrong for the Government to cause anybody to go into that association as an <i>agent-provocateur</i> or to urge on illegal acts on the part of the association. There is quite a distinction between obtaining information and remaining inside for the purpose of obtaining information and going into or remaining inside for the purpose causing illegal acts to be done.</P>
