      <P>The Deputy gave notice of a question which was not in a form that seemed to be in accord with the Standing Orders.  I suggested to him yesterday that we might get a form that would be suitable. We did not succeed in getting such a form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion this is a direct invasion of the liberty of members to ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Orders prescribe, for asking questions, a particular scheme.  That scheme has worked so successfully that until this particular instance there was never a case since September, 1922, when a Deputy was available for consultation and the form of a question could not be agreed on.  As a general rule the Deputy brings the question to the office.  If the clerks take exception to anything in the question agreement is nearly always reached.  If the clerks cannot succeed in satisfying the Deputy he sees the Ceann Comhairle. Within the last couple of years there have been very few cases where a Deputy thought it necessary to see the Ceann Comhairle, but in every case where that was done a satisfactory solution was reached.  In this case it has not been reached.  The only thing that I can say to Deputy de Valera is that this is the scheme under the Standing Orders.  If he wants to change it he must change the Standing Orders. It is not contemplated that a Deputy <Col N="1124" /> may put down a question, without any regard to Standing Orders, in any form he pleases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that that is not the situation.  The Standing Order is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy propose to argue on the Standing Orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What I propose arguing is that my question is directly in accordance with the Standing Order.  The Ceann Comhairle has not shown in what manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order gives a discretion to the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there are definite rules set down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are rules for the Ceann Comhairle to observe. The Standing Order clearly does not give the Deputy a right to raise in the House, in this particular fashion at any rate, the form of question which he wants to put.  As I pointed out yesterday&mdash;and it was pointed out before&mdash;if a Deputy can read out in the House the question he wants to ask and which is deemed to be not in order then, in fact, any Deputy can ask any question or what purports to be a question in any form he pleases.  Therefore the point of order cannot be raised in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Where can it be raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be raised at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the Ceann Comhairle can rule as he pleases quite irrespective of the Standing Orders and of their plain intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle can interpret the Standing Orders with regard to questions, and the matter cannot be raised in the House on a specific question except by way of indicting the Ceann Comhairle for an improper performance of his duty.  A Parliamentary assembly, working as this one does, cannot work <Col N="1125" /> on any other scheme.  If the Deputy thinks of another scheme, then that will have to be incorporated in the Standing Orders.  A point of order cannot be raised by citing a question in a form which has been ruled out. If it is deemed that the Ceann Comhairle has improperly performed his duty he can be indicated for it, but there is no scheme by which a Deputy who is dissatisfied can get up in the House and say that he is dissatisfied and that the Ceann Camhairle is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And the scheme apparently was that there should be a private conversation with the Ceann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle, by his public action in misrepresenting my attitude when I went to see him privately, made it impossible for me to do it.  We have to do it therefore by proxy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no recollection of having misrepresented the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the interview?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to go into that or any other matter he will have to do it in a regular way.  There is no scheme by which the Deputy can rise in his place to attack the Ceann Comhairle in a casual fashion, no matter who the Deputy may be or who the Ceann Comhairle may be and no matter under what form of Constitution the House is working.  It is an impossible scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is a matter of urgent public importance I propose under Standing Order 27 to move the adjournment of the House to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given me no notice that he was going to do this.  If he reads the Standing Order he will find that it prescribes that notice shall be given in writing to the Ceann Comhairle of the subject to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A motion for the adjournment of <Col N="1126" /> the Dáil on a definite matter of urgent public importance may be made, if a Deputy at the commencement of public business rises in his place, and states that he requests leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, whereupon he shall state the matter &mdash;I propose to state the matter&mdash; and deliver to the Ceann Comhairle a written statement of the subject to be discussed.</P>
    <P>I have it here and I can deliver it to the Ceann Comhairle in a written form. I propose definitely to follow the sequence of the Standing Order.  The matter that I ask leave for the adjournment of the House to discuss is the advisability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this matter been handed to the Ceann Comhairle in writing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order I submit is definitely clear.  There is no misunderstanding.  It states that the motion for the adjournment of the Dáil on a matter of urgent public importance may be made if a Deputy at the commencement of public business rises in his place and states that he requests leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance &mdash; I have done the first part.  I have stated that I wished to move the adjournment of the House &mdash;&ldquo;whereupon he shall state the matter&rdquo;&mdash;I propose to do that first&mdash;&ldquo;and deliver to the Ceann Comhairle a written statement of the subject to be discussed.&rdquo;  I propose to go in sequence.  I am going to state the matter and simultaneously hand to the Ceann Comhairle a copy of my statement. If that does not obey the Standing Order I do not know what does. The matter that I wish to move the adjournment of the House to have discussed is this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advisability, in view of the likelihood of President Hoover's proposal for a moratorium on inter-governmental payments being accepted, <Col N="1127" /> of immediately taking steps to see that appropriate representations are made to secure that the land annuities and other sums totalling over five million pounds sent by us annually to Britain are included in the category of payments to which the moratorium will apply without prejudice to the claim that any future Irish Government may make that these payments are not justly due.</P>
    <P>That is the question I wish to ask the Minister, to find out whether he was taking these steps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy desired to move the adjournment of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have moved it.  I ask leave of the House accordingly that this matter be taken up on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest what was the matter that the Deputy in forty-eight hours could not make up his mind to frame a proper question on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I made up my mind and presented my question but the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I was wrong.  The Deputy found it impossible so to frame his question as to have it accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this matter in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. The Deputy has given notice that he desires to discuss this matter as a definite matter of public importance under Standing Order 27.  On the question of notice the Deputy seems to me to be correct in stating that under the Standing Order the procedure is that he shall state the matter and deliver to the Ceann Comhairle a written statement of the subject to be discussed.  In order to enable the Ceann Comhairle to make up his mind on the matter it has always been the practice&mdash;and it would seem a proper practice&mdash;that the Ceann Comhairle should get notice when he is being asked to take a decision under this <Col N="1128" /> particular Standing Order.  The Ceann Comhairle shall, if he considers the motion is one contemplated by this Standing Order, desire the Deputies who support the request to rise in their places.  I do not consider that this matter is one contemplated by the Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be in a tremendous hurry to get King James's law made law in this country. Perhaps there is something of that kind in the Bill.  I have only just read the long title.  It may go back to 1647 or 1680 or 1690.  That might be a desirable thing from some point of view, but, at all events, the Acts at that time applied to all Ireland. Whatever the Bill proposes to deal with, as a matter of order and procedure I shall certainly object to its being considered on Wednesday or Thursday, or before Wednesday week at the earliest.</P>

    <P>Deputies will see that Section 4 states that the Minister may serve a notice in writing on any registered proprietor.  There are a number of registered proprietors.  There are registered creameries and registered butter factories and other registered proprietors.  The draftsman was of opinion that as the Bill stood only one prescribed form could be used and that the same prescribed form would have to be used for the purpose of serving a notice on, say, a creamery and a butter factory.  It was considered that the powers should be more elastic and that the Minister might have power to have one prescribed notice for a factory and another for a creamery and hence the wording is changed as in the amendment.  It is to ensure that a different prescribed form might be used for different establishments.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We started to draft the regulations before the Bill was passed and submitted them to the draftsman.  The draftsman pointed out that, under the Bill as it stood, one form only could be used, as the Bill speaks of a return &ldquo;in the prescribed form.&rdquo;  We had intended to use different forms, one for creameries and another for butter factories, as we thought it only right that there should be different forms.  The draftsman gave it as his opinion that it would be <Col N="1134" /> necessary to have such powers under the Bill, and, therefore, it is proposed to change the wording of the section.</P>

      <P>I did my best to convey to the Minister that those directly affected by the Bill would be better pleased if the number of members proposed for the Dublin Union Committee was increased.  The Minister read a communication from the Dublin Union Committee stating clearly that the number of nine and two co-opted members, making a total of eleven, was accepted by them as a minimum.  Deputy Murphy asked if the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; did not indicate that they would have preferred to have a few more members and the Minister gave no direct reply. Since then I have discussed this matter with some of the elected representatives concerned in the matter and they feel that the points I put are deserving of consideration, namely, that in order to enable the Dublin Union Committee to carry out their work they should be made a more elastic body, that they should not be tied down to routine office work.  The Minister probably knows better than I do the system of work in the Dublin Union. When the Committee meet on a Wednesday, all their time is taken up in going into applications and reports and there is no time for them to consider schemes which they could recommend to the Council and which would subsequently be approved by the Minister. The Minister will recollect that the Dublin Union Committee suggested a form of relief work which the Minister did not consider suitable.  They wanted, instead of giving tickets for food, to be able to provide some kind <Col N="1136" /> of work for those in need and who are being given relief under the present system.  If the Minister has made up his mind, and feels that there is no sense in the suggestions made, we cannot do any more now and must wait until there will be a chance of altering the Bill as it now being put through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, annexed to the Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of Nations on the 26th day of September, 1928, a copy of which General Act was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 18th day of June, 1931, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to accede to the said General Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bring this motion before the House with a view to having ratification or accession made to the Act to which reference is made, hoping that in doing this we may take another step along the rather difficult and rather tortuous way that leads to the settlement of disputes by means other than war-like ones.  I think it would be well to link this up with the measures which have gone before it, and to indicate what are the obligations that <Col N="1137" /> we have accepted as members of the community of nations with regard to the settlement of disputes by other than warlike means, and by that means to point out what is the necessity or the advisability in having a measure of this type accepted.  We have incurred obligations with regard to the pacific settlement of disputes in a variety of ways, under the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg Pact, the Optional Clause with regard to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and in a variety of Treaties which have specific clauses attached to them from time to time.</P>
    <P>Under Article 12 of the Covenant, States are bound to bring forward either for judicial settlement, arbitration or inquiry by the Council, all disputes which seem likely to lead to a breach of the peace, anything which seems likely to provoke war.  Under, I think, Section 13 of the Covenant, States are also bound to submit to either judicial settlement or arbitration such disputes as they think are suitable for submission in either of these two ways.  If they do not feel that a certain dispute is one which is proper for submission either to judicial settlement or to arbitration, then they are bound to bring it before the Council for inquiry.  These two obligations under the Covenant are imperfect obligations, first because they are subject to test by the Nations implicated as to whether or not a particular event is likely to provoke war, and on that, of course, argument might proceed. While the argument was proceeding the event which it was sought to prevent might have taken place.  The second method of submission to judicial settlement and arbitration is also imperfect, because it, again, depends on the view of the Nations concerned, whether they consider the item suitable for submission in these ways.  If they do not so consider it suitable, then that particular type of pacific settlement has broken down.</P>
    <P>I said already that under a different Article of the Covenant disputes which the Nations do not consider to be suitable for disposal in this way must be brought before the Council. <Col N="1138" /> But imperfection arises in that matter in this way, that on inquiry by the Council, if the Council are unanimous, then a particular result flows, but if the Council are not unanimous the whole scheme of pacific settlement has again broken down.  To meet these gaps, and in an endeavour to get the Nations to face up more resolutely to the idea of peaceful means of persuasion, the Kellogg Pact, first spoken of by M. Briand, was brought forward. Under it the Nations, of which we are one, bound themselves to renounce war as an instrument of national policy in regard to disputes.  They bound themselves not to resort to other than pacific means for the settlement of disputes.  That again, although not so imperfect, because there are no subjective tests which have to be applied, is imperfect in the method of machinery.  No machinery was laid down and no procedure was arranged as to how certain disputes might be brought forward.</P>
    <P>As I said, in addition to the Covenant of the League and its various clauses, and the Kellogg Pact, we have become signatories from time to time, to various conventions and treaties.  Most of the conventions and Treaties concluded at this time have in them a clause allowing for some method of pacific settlement, generally a reference to an arbitral tribunal to be determined ad hoc.  We have signed some five or six treaties or con ventions which have a clause of that type in them.  In all these Treaties there is the same scheme with regard to pacific settlement.  Last year we ratified the Optional Clause.  Progress has been made since I spoke in February, 1930.  I said then that twenty countries were signing and ratifying the Optional Clause, that twenty had signed, but had not taken the further step of ratification.  At the moment the position is that 36 countries have adopted, signed and ratified; 10 have signed but have not yet ratified.</P>
    <P>The group with which we are allied in connection with the Optional Clause has grown, to a certain extent, in the last twelve months.  The Optional Clause deals with legal disputes, legal disputes having reference to interpretation <Col N="1139" /> of the Treaty on any question of international law, the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of international obligations, and the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for a breach of international obligation. We signed that, of course, without condition for a period of twenty years, simply demanding reciprocity.  In relation to any Nations which have also accepted the Optional Clause, if there is any dispute with regard to a legal matter of the type to which I have referred, then we, and they also, are bound to a reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice.  Not so much the flaw as the limitation in this case is, that this applies only to legal disputes, and so the General Act was drawn up.</P>
    <P>The General Act really applies to all classes of disputes, whether legal or those that could not be brought within the category of legal disputes. It sets out, in four chapters, certain procedure and certain schemes for pacific settlement.  Chapter 4 is rather general with regard to procedure. The main chapters are those dealing with conciliation, judicial settlement and arbitration: The scheme under the General Act is that non-legal disputes must go, in the first instance, in relation to people who accept this General Act, to a Conciliation Commission.  If they are not then resolved by that Conciliation Commission they must go forward to an arbitral tribunal.</P>
    <P>Legal disputes will go to some court to seek some method of judicial settlement, unless prior to a particular date the parties have agreed to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal.  The difference as between conciliation procedure and the procedure of judicial settlement or arbitration is, of course, that in conciliation a group of commissioners, five in number, get the parties to come together.  They get the facts before them, and try to elicit further facts.  They will try to get in any arguments that can be adduced with regard to pacific settlement, and endeavour to bring the parties together to arrange a settlement.  There is this flaw, that if a settlement cannot be <Col N="1140" /> reached, then there is simply a report to that effect, that conciliation has failed.  But under the General Act, if conciliation does fail, the matter goes forward to arbitration.  The difference between conciliation and arbitration, or judicial settlement, really is that under the one procedure there is no final and binding decision given by anybody.  In the case of either arbitration or judicial settlement a decision final and binding on the parties is given.</P>
    <P>Chapter I. deals with conciliation. It lays down rather exact procedure in detail, and seems to have blocked any gap that there might be with regard to non-agreement between the parties or as to matters brought forward to the Conciliation Board.  Chapter 2 deals with judicial settlement and the procedure to be followed in the case of legal disputes.  Chapter 3 deals with arbitration. In accordance with Article 38 accession to the present General Act may be applied completely or may be limited in a way which is precisely defined. Accession may extend either to all the provisions in the Act, to the 4 chapters, or else to those provisions only which relate to conciliation and judicial settlement, or to conciliation only.  We propose, first, to accede under (A) of Article 38 to all the provisions of the Act.  If we acceded to (C) procedure, which relates only to conciliation and the general provisions concerning that procedure of conciliation, we have then established a particular type of conciliation machinery. We know the precise details of the conciliation Board, who are to be the Commissioners, and so on, if disputes are to be settled in that way, but if we leave it at that, and accede only in relation to Chapters 1 and 4, and if the Conciliation Board fails to get people together and to come to agreement, then we are thrown back again on the somewhat imperfect obligations under the Kellogg Pact, or under the Covenant of the League.</P>
    <P>Accession, therefore, to Chapter I, conciliation or to Chapter 4, general procedure, would not seem to bring us very much further.  It does not seem to me that the House will have very much difficulty in accepting the somewhat wider scheme than merely accession to a single chapter, with regard <Col N="1141" /> to conciliation, because the House has already taken the decision that it would accept in legal matters as final and binding the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice.  There seems to be no reason why, having taken that step with regard to legal disputes, the House should not also be ready to submit either to an arbitration tribunal, or to some method of judicial settlement, disputes which are of a non-legal character.  I leave out (B) as a matter not to be considered seriously at all.  It allows you to accede to Chapters 1 and 2 which we have already accepted under the Optional Clause agreement except that there is this difference, that on the Optional Clause the matter was precisely stated to refer only to legal disputes of the type mentioned, whereas legal judicial settlement under the General Act would be in relation to disputes where the parties are in conflict as to their respective rights.  It is understood from the second paragraph that the disputes referred to include those mentioned in Article 36 of the Permanent Court.  While it is still related to legal disputes it does go somewhat wider than those mentioned in Article 36 of the Statute for the Permanent Court.  It seems better that we should have the whole procedure with regard to both judicial settlement and arbitration as well as conciliation.  Having accepted, or put ourselves in the position that we may accept, the decision of the Permanent Court in regard to legal disputes, there seems to be no reason why we should stop short at this, and refrain from having disputes, whether of the legal type or non-legal type, also submitted, in default of conciliation, to either the process of judicial settlement or arbitration.</P>
    <P>At many meetings of the Assembly recently when this Act was being discussed we announced that we were in favour of an all-round pacific policy and to limit our accession to any one of the chapters and not accept the Act as a whole would be somewhat in contrariety to what has been said at the League on many occasions by Irish representatives.  The whole Act has, so far, been accepted by a number of <Col N="1142" /> States: France, Great Britain, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and Finland. Norway and Denmark accepted it with some limitations.  It has been accepted, with regard to certain parts of Chapters 1, 2 and 3 by Holland and Sweden.  Italy has announced its intention to accept the whole Act. Article 39 deals with reservations. The things which are kept alive under the provisions of the General Act are dealt with in this Article.  The general principle with regard to these international Conventions is that unless specifically declared the newer one is not in derogation of anything accepted under a previous one, but is in addition to any obligation previously incurred.  All that is specifically set out in Article 29, which keeps alive the special procedure laid down in other Conventions in force between the parties.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of Article 29 states that &ldquo;the present General Act shall not affect any agreements in force by which conciliation procedure is established between the parties or they are bound by obligation to resort to arbitration or judicial settlement which ensure the settlement of the dispute.&rdquo;  For instance, if there is a conflict at all as to the generality and wide scope of those in opposition to the Optional Clause, to the group of legal matters, to the Kellogg Pact or the Covenant, the generality of the others would overcome any limitation that is in this although set out to be as general and wide as possible. Article 29 specifically keeps alive any Conventions in force between the parties and sets out a special procedure for settling disputes.  It is provided where those Conventions are in force that disputes shall be settled in conformity with the provisions of these Conventions.  It refers specifically to the agreement by which conciliation procedure is established or an agreement under which the parties were bound to resort either to arbitration or judicial settlement.</P>
    <P>Article 39 deals with reservations. It says in the first paragraph:</P>
    <P>1.  In addition to the power given in the preceding article, a party, in acceding to the present General Act, <Col N="1143" /> may make his acceptance conditional upon the reservations exhaustively enumerated in the following paragraph. These reservations must be indicated at the time of accession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the phrase used in the first paragraph that these reservations are supposed to have been &ldquo;exhaustively enumerated,&rdquo; and then the next paragraph goes on:</P>
    <P>2.  These reservations may be such as to exclude from the procedure described in the present Act:</P>
    <P>(a)  Disputes arising out of facts prior to the accession either of the party making the reservation or of any other party with whom the said party may have a dispute;</P>
    <P>(b)  Disputes concerning questions which by international law are solely within the domestic jurisdiction of States;</P>
    <P>(c)  Disputes concerning particular cases or clearly specified subject-matters, such as territorial status, or disputes falling within clearly-defined categories.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 says:</P>
    <P>If one of the parties to a dispute has made a reservation the other parties may enforce the same reservation in regard to that party.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 says:</P>
    <P>In the case of parties who have acceded to the provisions of the present General Act relating to judicial settlement or to arbitration, such reservations as they may have made shall, unless otherwise expressly stated, be deemed not to apply to the procedure of conciliation.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the usual article in a much more precise form this time than in the similar article in the statute of the Permanent Court.  Article 41 deals with disputes as to interpretation.  It states:</P>
    <P>Disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the present General Act, including those concerning the classification of disputes and the scope of reservations, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> We propose to sign this.  There is no question of imposing a time limit in this matter because, under Article 45, the General Act shall be concluded for a period of five years, dating from its entry into force.  It shall then remain in force for further successive periods of five years in the case of contracting parties which do not denounce it at least six months before the expiration of the current period. The General Act, once acceded to, runs in laps of five-year periods.  There is no necessity to put in any phrase relating to time as we did in the case where the period was twenty years.  I am proposing that we accept the whole Act and that we accept it unconditionally.</P>
    <P>The British Government made certain reservations.  The reservations are almost identical with the reservations made to their acceptance of the Optional Clause.  They have included amongst them a reservation to this effect:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the following disputes (amongst others) are excluded from the procedure described in the General Act, including the procedure of conciliation:</P>
    <P>(iii)  Disputes between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of any other Member of the League which is a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, all of which disputes shall be settled in such a manner as the parties have agreed or shall agree;</P>
    <P>There was a reservation almost in precise terms made with regard to the Optional Clause.  Dealing with that in the Seanad and here, I expressed grave doubts as to the validity of the reservation in regard to the acceptance of the Statute of the Permanent Court.  I read the portion of the Article dealing with reservations that might be made and argued that there was no room for a reservation which excluded disputes between certain specified States or groups of States. I felt that these could not come within the terms of Article 36 or the Statute of the Permanent Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> I felt there might be some doubt as to the validity of any provision which seeks to exclude disputes between certain definite States or groups of States.  Although the reservations are wider in their terms than in the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the same doubt exists.</P>
    <P>In regard to disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the General Act, including those concerning the classification of disputes and the scope of reservations, the Act provides that they shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice.  It will, therefore, when the occasion arises, decide on the validity of reservations with regard to the Commonwealth States; that is, if that matter has ever to be decided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one has to have a considerable amount of optimism in one's composition to be enthusiastic about this procedure through which it is hoped to end war.  The Minister appears to have quite a considerable amount of that optimism.  For my part, I am afraid I have not got it, certainly not in the quantity that the Minister apparently possesses.  I am rather cynical.  Perhaps it is that I am a good many years older than the Minister, and perhaps it is the nature of the beast.  I think everybody will agree that anything that can be done in order to make war more difficult and to bring nations to a realisation, if they need to be so brought, of the horrors of warfare, and thus to get them to adopt the methods that the League of Nations is year after year developing in the direction of a peaceful settlement of international disputes, will be all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quite properly said that, having signed without reservation the Optional Clause a year or so ago, it is only natural that we should sign what might be called a development of that procedure.  We have always been content to allow our disputes with our neighbour to be discussed by an international tribunal, properly constituted.  Our leaders have stated that openly and that is our position still.  The time may come when the reservations that the Minister referred <Col N="1146" /> to, that have been made by the British Government with regard to the Optional Clause, and again with regard to this General Act, may have to be tested.  The Minister maintains that the reservations are ultra vires.  That may or may not be so.  Great Britain will hold a contrary opinion and it may be that the matter will have to be tested.  If it ever comes to the stage when the dispute that still exists between ourselves and our neighbour has to be put to the test, it would be better for all nations interested that that dispute, long as it has lasted, should be settled rather by conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement than by resort to war.</P>
    <P>I am, however, rather cynical and, despite all the engagements that have been entered into, no doubt with the very best intentions, by some of the greatest nations in the world, as well as some of the smallest, I feel that when the time comes, and when the interests of some of those great nations are at stake, they will do in the future what they have done in the past, ignore international treaties, engagements and obligations, General Acts and otherwise, and take the law into their own hands.  However, if the signature by the great nations to documents of this kind, publicly and formally binding them to accept conciliatory methods to end international disputes, tend to make it more difficult to resort to war, we are certainly glad to join and to bring about that condition of affairs.  Speaking generally for the Irish people, I say we would be happy if our own disputes could be settled through the same medium.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us an interesting account of recent developments which would seem to indicate, judging by the number of nations that have signed the Optional Clause and the number that have agreed to the General Act, that there is a considerable amount of real belief, if not enthusiasm, in the League of Nations method and machinery for the purpose of ending disputes.  The more that spirit can be cultivated, the more it can grow and develop, the better it will be for the world.  If our signature can help in that direction and if our belief, even modified and <Col N="1147" /> conditional as it may be, in the machinery to be utilised is of any value, then I think we ought to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Movement and Labour Parties in all civilised countries on all occasions welcomed any method that would substitute warfare by peaceful methods of conciliation. For that reason we, the Labour Party, heartily welcome this motion. While we feel that it is not perhaps all that we might desire&mdash;undoubtedly the machinery set up under the League of Nations has its drawbacks and limitations&mdash;it does mark some advance, however small, along the road towards universal peace.  I gather from the Minister's statement that there are three methods by which a peaceful solution without recourse to arms may be obtained through the machinery set up by the League of Nations&mdash;conciliation, arbitration or a judicial settlement.</P>
      <P>It may be that one or other or perhaps all those methods may in some cases fail to produce the desired result, the result that we all earnestly hope and pray for, that is the ultimate success of the League of Nations in their programme for the solution of the world's economic and other ills by the method suggested in this motion. After the very elaborate and very clear statement made by the Minister for External Affairs, and the support that it got in the speech delivered by Deputy O'Kelly of the Fianna Fáil Party, there remains very little for me to say.  If any machinery can be established which will tend towards the abolition of the horrors of war, it will have, as it had always, the support of this Party.  We feel, as I am sure most of the Deputies in the Dáil feel, that in all wars it is the working classes who suffer most.  They supplied the cannon fodder for the great European War.  They have been the cannon fodder in all wars of conquest at all times.  If some of us were, perhaps, over sanguine at the initiation of the League of Nations, over sanguine as to its ultimate results, we feel that there is no reason for disappointment up to the present.</P>

    <P>Human nature being what it is, and recognising that there are certain <Col N="1148" /> factors in the political world to-day, which perhaps dominate the more sane and sensible views of the thinking masses of our people, yet we feel that any institution, even though it may have certain limitations and imperfections, any institution that will even go a small way in the direction of world peace should commend itself to Deputies of all Parties in this House. Any expenses that have been undertaken in connection with our association with the League of Nations are money well spent.  I certainly must congratulate the Minister for External Affairs on the admirable way in which he has done his job, especially on these negotiations.  I do not want to throw any bouquets at the Minister, but I do feel that he has done his job remarkably well, and for this reason I support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(West Cork): As a member of Dáil Eireann I felt extremely pleased and gratified to-day when I heard one of the leaders of Fianna Fáil give a benediction to the Minister for External Affairs on his great work at the League of Nations. I wish also to congratulate my fellow county man, Deputy Anthony.  Deputy Anthony has realised that we have now at last, thank God, seized a position in world affairs that we did not hold for seven hundred years. Our voice now can be heard, and heard with great effect at the League of Nations.  Small as we are as a nation, still we have noble and great traditions behind us.  I feel, as far as this nation and its people are concerned, that their interests and the interests of the peace and concord amongst the nations is in safe keeping in the hands of the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to find that the atmosphere of the Dáil is like the atmosphere of the League of Nations. We recognise that we are part and parcel of the entire world in endeavouring to keep off the horrors of war from the human race.  That is a wonderful gesture that should wake in the hearts of every man, woman and child the feeling that we are at last improving our position, and that we are now side by side with <Col N="1149" /> the great and small nations of the earth.  In connection with that matter it is only well to say that friendship and good fellowship are all that could be desired amongst the nations as well as amongst individuals.</P>
    <P>The great President of the American Republic is not now averse to holding out the hand of friendship to the afflicted and distressed nations of Europe.  He realises that the time has arrived when all turmoil, disunion and confusion should cease, and that if we are to make this world a world worth living for and living in we must do our part to carry on the great work of conciliation and building up the nations of the earth after the terrible war of 1914.</P>
    <P>My friends, here in the Dáil we have a great lesson to learn from this, if we can only bring it home to ourselves. We have, in the League of Nations a splendid and noble example amongst the nations of the earth.  We see how they are striving to hold out the hand of friendship to one another. The President of the great Republic of the West, the United States of America, is not averse to holding out the hand of friendship to European nations.  We are not averse here to holding out our hands in welcome to the nations of the earth. We claim we have our position now amongst the people of Europe.  No man can gainsay the point that we are an independent, self-governing nation, thanks to the heroism and sacrifices of the brave, great and dauntless generation of young men who won our liberties.  Let us stand up to that position and we will be all right.</P>
    <P>Since I entered the Dáil I did not feel so pleased as I do now on hearing from the benches opposite, from the members of Fianna Fáil, and from the Labour representatives here, their appreciation of the work of the Minister for External Affairs at Geneva. This Government and the Minister for External Affairs have done great and good work for the peace of the world at Geneva.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the introduction of this motion can produce the same harmony and concert at the League of <Col N="1150" /> Nations that it appears to have produced in the Dáil it will have served its purpose.  In the few remarks that I have to make I do not intend to concern myself with the merits of the Act as an instrument for a settlement pacifically of international differences. I do not think that as such it concerns us much.  There are very few, except, perhaps, the Minister, who will maintain that we are exercising an effective control over our foreign policy, or over our relation with foreign States.  What I am concerned about particularly is the history of the attitude of the Government to this Act.  The Minister did not think fit to make any reference to that at all, despite the fact that, from time to time, conflicting statements concerning it have been made by the Minister.  Various changes appear to have taken place in the Government's policy.  In the year 1929 the Minister for External Affairs led our delegation to the Assembly of the League of Nations.  Whilst there he announced the Government's decision to sign the Optional Clause without reservation.</P>
      <P>In his speech in the Assembly in which that decision was announced he proceeded to refer to this General Act which is now before us.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The General Act as well as the model bilateral Treaties in regard to arbitration, conciliation and judicial settlement are now open to accession by the Members of the League.  It is my intention to seek during the next session of the Oireachtas approval for the acceptance of the General Act by the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in the autumn of 1929.  The Minister having made that definite announcement of his intention to propose such a motion as is now before us, in the session of the Oireachtas following the meeting of the Assembly, failed to give effect to it.  No proposal came before us.  Apparently some modifications of the Government's policy took place following the Minister's return.  We are anxious to know what was the cause of it.  An entirely different policy in respect to the General Act was announced at the meeting of the Assembly in 1930 by the Minister for Finance, who, on that occasion, was the leader of our delegation. <Col N="1151" /> In the meantime, of course, the Free State Government had decided to offer itself as candidate for election to the Council of the League and, despite various doubts which were expressed from time to time, it succeeded in getting, in support of that candidature, the unanimous vote of the States Members of the British Empire. The policy of the Minister and the policy of the Government up to the date of the announcement of the candidature of the Free State for the Council of the League appeared to have been one of greater independence of British policy than it has since become.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the Government, in singing the Optional Clause without reservation, acted contrary to the wishes of the other Members of the Commonwealth, all of whom attached the same reservation as the British Government.  When the Minister for Finance was speaking at the meeting of the Assembly last year, he indicated that the attitude of his Government to the principles embodied in this General Act had remained unchanged, but he did not indicate that the intention to come forthwith to the Oireachtas to seek approval for ratification was to be proceeded with.  Although twelve months had elapsed since the original announcement of the Minister for External Affairs nothing was done and the Minister for Finance merely informed the League that the attitude of his Government to the Act would form the subject of consultation between all the States Members of the British Commonwealth at a meeting which they proposed to hold at an early date.</P>

I will read that statement again: &ldquo;It is my intention to seek during the next session of the Oireachtas approval for the acceptance of the General Act by the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to ride away on that quibble, he is perfectly at liberty to do so.

      <P>The usual meaning attached to the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; by members of the Oireachtas is continuous meetings of the Dáil at any one part of the year.  We have a session before Easter, a session after Easter and a session in the second part of the year. That may not be the legal meaning of the word &ldquo;session.&rdquo;  As far as I can discover, it has no legal meaning whatever. It might mean all the meetings of the Dáil from one general election to another or all the meetings of the Dáil from the beginning of the Free State to this day but, as far as I know, the usual meaning attached to the word here, and I have no doubt the meaning which the Minister intended to attach to it when speaking at the League Assembly, was the smaller meaning to which I at first referred, and that he gave the League Assembly to understand that he was going to seek approval for ratification within that year.  He did not do so for some <Col N="1153" /> reasons which I am anxious to know. Why that change of policy?  Had that change of policy anything to do with the Government's decision to offer the Free State as candidate for the League Council?</P>

However, I want to get clear from the Minister that the support which the Free State got in its candidature for the League of Nations was not subject to any condition that the policy of the Government on the Council of the League would be in conformity with the wishes of the other States Members of the British Empire, and that the representative of the Free State there would act as the representative of what might be called the policy of the British Empire.

      <P>That is one of the matters; we can discuss the others on the Estimates which are to come before us. I want to get quite clear what the Minister's attitude on that matter is. So far as the Act is concerned, it is of very little importance to us.  No matter what Deputy Sheehy or Deputy Anthony may say, the question whether or not we are going to be involved in war will not be decided by us.  It will be decided by the British Government, and it is of much more significance to us that the British Government has decided to ratify this Act than that we have.</P>

I think he ought to tell us what grounds he is going on in that matter, because it is a most serious thing if this Act is to be of any use.  A State is only bound by the reservations made by the State with which it has a dispute.  In other words, if we have a dispute with England which we want to submit to the Conciliation Board or the Arbitral Tribunal, and England says she does not recognise the authority of that Tribunal to deal with a dispute between two of the Commonwealth States, then where are we?  Who is to decide whether there is power or not?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly has accepted this Act with a certain amount of cynicism, attributable to his age or temperament.  Deputy Anthony accepts it with a certain amount of fervour, due, perhaps, also to his temperament.  Of the two, I would prefer Deputy Anthony's outlook to Deputy O'Kelly's.  It is easy to be cynical about all these matters. <Col N="1158" /> It is particularly easy when nations have not yet clearly made up their minds that the point has been reached at which disarmament of a decent type must come about because naturally, at the moment, while nations sign all these things, they have a certain amount of suspicion, at any rate, towards one another.  Even in these circumstances there is room for something more than cynicism.  Anybody who can look back at the conditions which prevailed at the outbreak of the European War must have realised the tremendous effect that public opinion had, particularly with regard to the nations that were going to join in that struggle.  This General Act, at any rate&mdash;let us put it at no higher than this&mdash;does put those people in the position in face of world public opinion hereafter that, having signed Kellogg Pacts, agreed to Covenants of the League and entered upon agreements such as the General Act, nevertheless they throw aside all sorts of conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlements and so on and go out for war.  It is going to be hard to get an impartial public opinion to favour such a nation hereafter.  There will be many signposts whereby a nation will be marked out more or less as the aggressor, though it may not be sufficiently defined to be brought within the terms of a particular statute. Deputy Lemass referred to what he described as &ldquo;conflicting statements&rdquo; and &ldquo;changes of policy&rdquo; in regard to this matter which, he argued, give reason for the belief that support of the British Commonwealth of Nations was bought at the price of something that amounts to subservience to British foreign policy.  There was no conflicting statement produced.  There was no change of policy indicated.  I tried to take the Deputy over the ground and to make him realise the points that he had not referred to.  I tried to get him to quote to the House in an open fashion the whole statement which the Vice-President made in the year 1930 and to put that in contrast with what had already been said. What is the conflict?  Let us say that the next session covered the period between the time I spoke and the Christmas of 1929.  Where is the conflict <Col N="1159" /> and change of policy because the motion was not brought in in that time?  As far as the change of policy is concerned, leave out the time element for the moment.  This motion is being brought in now.  Take the statement made by me in 1929, that we were going to accept this in the broadest way, and the statement made by the Vice-President in 1930 that our attitude with regard to this is unchanged, that we had already done certain things in regard to legal disputes&mdash;signed optional clauses and carried the whole thing through&mdash;that we proposed to ratify this Act and provide machinery for giving effect to all the obligations that we incur.  We do bring this motion forward now, without any modification or reservation. In 1929 that was not the situation, but we do it now when the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations have decided&mdash;I speak with reserve because I am not sure of them all&mdash;to sign with the same reservation and, I presume, with the same feelings as those with which they approached the signature of the Optional Clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to find where is the conflicting statement or change of policy.  At the most, it was that something was not done between September, 1929, and Christmas that has been done now. Deputy Lemass says that is the reason which entitles him to conclude that the support to the Council was bought.  It was clearly not bought from this, or else we are playing a very tricky type of game.  The Deputy's thoughts must run in this way: that if we held off signature we would get support to go on the Council, and now, being on the Council, we are prepared to sign without modification where we previously had agreed to modify.  There is no such conduct being carried on. We always maintained the attitude that we were going to do it without any condition, and that we did not care what other view was held. That was our point of view, and it was realised that that point of view in our signing the Optional Clause was as logical as the other view was logical in regard to signing the Optional Clause.  It was a declaration of a point <Col N="1160" /> of view and a clear acceptance that the logical course for people who signed the Optional Clause was to go on and sign the General Act in the same way. If I made an endeavour after the 1929 conference to get the Optional Clause accepted, to get the matter brought here, to get ratification and to be completely established with regard to the Optional Clause I had in mind at that time Article 29 of this.  When we now proceed to sign Article 29 it is signed and carries the signature in the Optional Clause in its relation to legal disputes without any reservation. It particularly carries in the British signature.  It was of the greatest importance to us to have the Optional Clause signed prior to approaching the General Act, and to have it signed in a particular way.  There was no modification of views, and what the Deputy read from the Minister for Finance's speech before 1930 shows that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The attitude of our Government to the principles embodied in this General Act remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>My Government's ratification of the Optional Clause was deposited with the Secretary General in the course of the year that has passed. So far as legal disputes are concerned, therefore, we have provided ourselves with the machinery of pacific settlement.</P>
    <P>It is the firm intention of my Government, in the year that is to come, to carry this process further and to provide the machinery for giving practical effect to all the obligations they incur by subscribing to the principle that none but pacific means may be sought for the settlement of international disputes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy does not date himself properly.  I know at the time when we were going to make application to sit on the Council last year the paper which the Deputy subscribes to did bring out that we were going to get British support by dropping the General Act.  It was a bad thing to bring forward foolish statements like that at a time when the statement was being controverted by fact.  We are <Col N="1161" /> bringing forward the General Act without modification.  My statement in 1929 followed by the Minister's statement in 1930 set forth our position and our attitude in full.  We were going further this year and were seeking pacific means of settlement not merely of legal disputes but all classes of disputes.  There was no conflicting statement, no change of policy, no reason to say that support was bought when in fact no support was bought, and there is no subservience of any policy to anything a British Minister may do or may want to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little change in the Estimate as between this and last year.  There is a slight decrease in travelling and incidental expenses. The Railway Tribunal presented a <Col N="1162" /> report which was put before this House detailing the conclusion of its work up to the end of the calendar year, that is, up to the end of December last.  Since then the Tribunal has been mainly engaged in the matter of exceptional rates and the work given to it under the 1924 Act is almost complete.  I am again at the point where other difficulties are merged in certain actions which were taken in court.  We have to wait for their decision.  We are again at the point at which it will be possible, during the course of the year, to cut down membership of the Railway Tribunal.</P>

      <P>The only point I wish to raise is the delay in effecting the reduction which the Dáil sanctioned two years ago.  Examining the most recent proposal issued by the Tribunal, there does not appear to be any exceptional matter which would require a change of the Minister's original contention that reductions might take place when standard charges were fixed.  According to that report, standard charges were fixed in January, 1930, and came into operation on the 1st July of that year.  Since then the Tribunal has been occupied with routine matters, changing of classification, singling of lines and other things of that kind.  There is a possibility that under some new legislation which the Minister proposes to introduce the work of the Tribunal will be increased. The saving could have been made last year or possibly this year, and if a larger Tribunal were found to be necessary the membership could be increased. It seems to me that the Minister must have miscalculated very badly when he got an Act passed through this House in 1929 empowering himself to effect reductions, which Act does not appear to have been given effect to since.</P>

      <P>I did use a phrase with regard to keeping on the Tribunal at its full membership.  It probably was not detailed enough.  I said that it had been intended to cut down the members previously, but that certain points taken to the courts in connection with the Tribunal's decision had <Col N="1163" /> to be awaited.  I am assuming that the applications that were previously made will be persisted in, and if that is the case there will be an absolute necessity to keep on the three members. Although the point may appear to be one for judicial settlement, it is the type of point we thought would have arisen in the earlier years.  I may point out that there is not a considerable saving to be effected by cutting down the number, because the three people here are on a certain basis of payment, and suspended pensions and certain other rights will arise if the rights which they have under this will disappear.  There will be some saving, and we will effect it as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>There is a slight increase shown in the Vote, mainly because they are being obliged to take on a pretty large staff of temporary examiners, eight in number.  These were taken on this year for the purpose of dealing with a very big amount of arrears that had accumulated in the patent branch of the office.  It is hoped to clear these off within two years.  Outside of these temporary examiners, the establishment <Col N="1164" /> on the Vote has now pretty definitely been fixed.  With the exception of these eight examiners it is to be concluded that the Vote will remain at the same figure except for any change that may be due to annual increments. The estimated receipts last year were £35,000.  The exact amount obtained in receipts was £37,400.  The Estimate was for about £1,500 over the amount received from the previous year, but the amount actually received was £2,500 more than was estimated. The increase was due to the fact that the office took up a particular attitude towards trade marks offenders under a particular section of the Act, and an increased number of applications resulted. The receipts of this year are not estimated to be so high, but the indications are that the £34,000 in the Estimate will in fact be received.</P>
    <P>There is one small vote of £20, expenses in connection with the register of patent agents.  It appeared in each Estimate for the last two years, and has not been used.  This year it will be used and there may be some slight increase there because it is proposed to hold examinations in the course of the coming year for admission to the Register of Patent Agents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to raise some point concerning this Register of Patent Agents, for admission to which the Minister says an examination will be held in the course of the year.  In the Registration Act passed in 1927 it was provided that in order to get admission to the register, an agent had either to reside or have a place of business here. That worked out in such a way that British agents who secured accommodation residences here were able to get on the register.  To remedy that situation the Minister brought in an amending Act in 1929 which required that to secure registration an agent had both to reside and have his place of business here.  Though that Act was passed, I am informed that there are still on the register a number of British agents.  In a recent case against the Comptroller of the office a decision was given in the High <Col N="1165" /> Court that a British agent who had been placed upon the register prior to the passing of the 1929 Act, could not be removed in consequence of the passage of the Act, that it applied only to new applicants.  I do not think that was the intention of the Minister, or of the Oireachtas, and I would be glad to know if the Minister intends to take any action to deal with the position, also, if he would tell us exactly what is the state of the register in respect of these British agents, who were entitled to get on it prior to the 1929 Act, and who are still on it despite the passage of the new Act; if any action is going to be taken apart from the legal decision to which I have referred, to limit the register to those entitled to go on it under the amending Act of 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The action to which Deputy Lemass refers was taken, not against the Comptroller, but against myself, and the courts decided that the action which I have taken and which put certain English patent agents off the register was not legal, and that these people must be put back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is much as Deputy Lemass described it.  The first Act entitled a person to have his name put on the register if he had either a residence or a place of business here.  We amended that later on by saying that the applicant must both reside and have a place of business here.  The point then arose as to whether people who had got on the register under the earlier definition could be put off.  The whole thing turned upon the point as to whether they ceased to have certain qualifications.  The court decision pretty well amounts to this, that the Act which we passed will have effect with regard to new applicants, but that any agents who were previously on could not be removed&mdash;in other words, that the Act was not retrospective. When I brought in that particular piece of legislation it was represented to me that there were quite a number of people who were able to take on the work of patent agents in the country, that there was quite a lucrative field of employment which had been occupied by outsiders, and it was aimed at getting that field of employment for <Col N="1166" /> our own people.  An examination was held, and, as far as I remember, four people obtained the qualifications to go on the register, but since then that number has diminished.  There has been one death, and some of the others, I am informed by the office, do not appear to be taking patent work seriously.  Consequently, there is a very definite dearth of patent agents who would have the double qualification, if we insisted on re-establishing the new condition with regard to those who had been previously on the register.  I have to wait to see what results the new examination will bring. In other words, if there is a sufficient number, then it will be an easy thing to amend the Act.  I am not moving for legislation at the moment.  I cannot do it before the autumn, and even in the autumn decisions will be taken on the result of certain examinations and on the equities of the whole situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What occurs to me is that the number of persons who would prepare themselves for such examination will be influenced by the Minister's intention to restrict employment in this particular branch to persons resident in the country.  If it was clearly understood, as I think the Minister has now stated, that if there was a sufficient number of persons trained and available to do patent work in this country he would seek the necessary legislative powers to confine employment to these, there would be a much better chance of the number being forthcoming than if it was thought the position was likely to remain as at present.  I understand that a very small proportion of the work is made available for Irish agents, and that it is mostly done through English offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that policy.  I stated it when the amending legislation was introduced, and have, in fact, stated it when a number of persons who had the intention of proceeding for this examination consulted me.  When a sufficient number of people show themselves, then we can close the doors to people from outside. But there is an equity which will <Col N="1167" /> even then have to be examined with regard to people who took up occupation in this country under the terms of a particular Act, and under the terms of a court judgment as to what the intentions of that Act are declared to be, and even the intentions of the second Act, as found by the court.</P>

Then an appeal was made in accordance with the Act, and when the thing came for hearing before me I found myself in a tremendous difficulty.  I found, as far as I was concerned, not pretending to have the best judicial outlook on the whole matter, tremendous difficulty as to whether or not these people should be struck off. I did strike them off without any great feeling of certainty, and more or less encouraged an appeal to the court.  An appeal was taken with that result.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion by Dr. Ward:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in refusing to allow Deputies to make representations in person to the deciding officer on behalf of old age pension claimants whose cases are on appeal, whether at the instance of the pension officer or of the claimants themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few points to make which I think are relevant to this motion.  In the constituency of Meath there are a number of parishes where the records of births have been destroyed, and claimants for old age pensions find the greatest difficulty in satisfying the authorities that they are of the requisite age, with the result that personal interviews in a number of these cases are found to be absolutely necessary and the cutting off of the approach of Deputies to the Department is often a very great hardship and entails an undue amount of correspondence both on Deputies and claimants.  I do not see that it is necessary that the Minister should put up this barrier.  I know that after we entered the Dáil the pressure on the Department was extreme owing to a number of applicants not understanding how to procure an old age pension. Some of them refrained altogether from making application.  As a result of that I admit that the Minister may have been inundated with visits from Deputies, but at the present time these requests have become normal, and I think it is hardly reasonable that this Department should be different from other Departments in that respect, as personal interviews are in a good many instances absolutely necessary.  A number of these claimants for old age pensions have not friends that they can depend upon.  I have found even in a number of cases that they have been misled. Therefore, it is necessary that somebody should represent them personally and generally the only person they can get is a Deputy.  I admit that a number of visits paid hitherto were to a certain extent superfluous and unnecessary. I do not think the Minister can put me in that category, as the constituency of Meath does not contain old age pensioners to a very great number.  I know that other districts are not in that position, that there are a great number of applicants from them and that Deputies are constantly approached with the view, not of writing to the Minister or the Department, but of seeing the Minister and explaining their case personally.  The necessity for that personal interview is because of the difficulty these people <Col N="1169" /> have in proving their age.  In a great number of cases the records have been destroyed and in other cases there never were any records.  Deputies are often in a position to be able to prove that people who made affidavits are people of standing.  The Minister is generally not in a position to be able to discover that fact, with the result that the pensioners are often left two or three years without a pension. I have known cases where they have been left three years without a pension. It is true that after waiting for a pension for, say, three years, the pension, when granted, is made retrospective for nine months or a year, but not for the whole period.  These are the principal reasons why I think the approach to this Department should not be cut off.  I do not think it is necessary now to cut off that approach, because the visits are not anything like as numerous as they were hitherto, and therefore I support the motion proposed by Deputy Ward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the privilege accorded to Deputies to appear in person on behalf of claimants for old age pensions before the deciding officer could be abused.  I think we all admit that it could.  The question, however, is whether the possibility of abuse is such that the privilege should be altogether denied. Every Deputy knows that the claimants for old age pensions who want to have their cases presented are not always in a position to present them in writing, and, consequently, that it would mean a great deal for them if the local Deputies who knew the circumstances of the case were to be permitted to appear as advocates, just as if they were lawyers and were allowed, as advocates, to state the position.  I do not think that the deciding officer would be unduly influenced by their statements.  At the start he would recognise that they were the statements of advocates, and hearing their statements would simply mean hearing the other side of the case.  Now, why the person who is to give judgment should be denied the opportunity of hearing the case put in that way by a Deputy as an advocate is difficult for me to understand.  The Deputy should, <Col N="1170" /> of course, only be permitted to present it as an advocate, and not attempt to use what would be regarded as influence. To deal with the matter otherwise than the manner in which an advocate would be allowed to present a case in court would be altogether, to my mind, a wrong proceeding.  I take it that the motion here simply means that the Minister would permit the practice which obtains in the case of other Departments&mdash;that is, would permit Deputies who know the circumstances of the case to come forward and represent the case of the claimant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations are constantly being made, I know, to the Land Commission, but I admit that there is a judicial procedure employed in the final determination of a case by the Land Commission.  But that is very expensive and it would be unfair to the old age pensioner to have to fee a solicitor or other lawyer to present his case as if it was coming before a strictly legal tribunal.  What we are doing is&mdash;we are trying to have a semi-judicial procedure&mdash;allowing Deputies who know the case to present the case on behalf of the claimant.  I take it that although the motion mentions both sides, still what is in view, for the most part, is the case of the claimant.  That is how I look at it and while I admit quite frankly that it is a system that could be open to abuse, at the same time, I think, it would be most unwise, because of the possibility of that abuse, to cut it off altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could safeguard against possible abuse by giving the officers to understand clearly that they are not to be influenced by statements made by Deputies other than in so far as the arguments or facts are presented before them.  In other words, they should clearly understand that they are in the position of judges and that the Deputies are presenting one side of the case, and, of course, as officers in a judicial position, they ought to be well able to realise that there is probably another side to the case and that they have an opportunity of examining that <Col N="1171" /> other side.  All that is claimed by Deputies who put down this motion is that the claimants should have an opportunity of having their cases presented and their side heard before the final court of appeal, so to speak.  I think that is a fair claim. Although Deputy Wolfe talked about interference and so on, after all, this is purely a matter of regulation.  Any head of a Department should understand that he is independent and that no Deputy could browbeat him or anything else.  If the officer does not know that he ought to know it and take up the attitude of a judge and say to the Deputy: &ldquo;I am judging this case.  You are at liberty to present the main facts concerning this case, and I shall take them into consideration when deciding, but I shall not allow you to go one step beyond that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is fair.  It is a matter of regulation and I think the Minister should approach it by way of regulation and instruction to his own Department rather than by cutting out Deputies and depriving claimants for old age pensions of having somebody to present their cases in person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who moved this motion is well acquainted with the subject.  He has raised it time after time in the last few years until he has made himself the special advocate of the old age pensioners.  But I noticed, in presenting this case the other evening, he did not display the usual vehemence against the Minister for Local Government that he generally does in presenting his case.  I think his attitude was rather apologetic. It amounted to this: That the privilege of appearing in the Custom House before the deciding officer was a reasonable one in the interests of the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has displayed, as he usually does, the best intentions, but his knowledge of the procedure is not very exact.  The gist of Deputy de Valera's remarks is this: That Deputies interested in old age pensioners should act as advocates, and that as such they should be entitled to go before the deciding officer on the <Col N="1172" /> appeal to the Local Government Department. I entirely dissent from that. The Deputy who moved this motion, in some of the remarks he made, also agreed with that, though he said it was known to members of the Minister's staff that in presenting the case of the old age pensioners he not only put forward the case that the applicant was entitled to have put forward, but also the case where the applicant was not so entitled.  That does not show that he believes that Deputies should be advocates. Neither do I.  I may tell the House that ever since I became a member eight years ago I have had more to do probably than any other Deputy with matters connected with old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I know the procedure very well, The practice which I followed, and which I found most successful, in presenting cases for old age pensioners who were unable to present the cases themselves, was to take up the cases at the source.  As a Peace Commissioner when far away from the pensions officer, I went out and found the evidence, and put it up, not to the Appeal Board, but to the pension officer and the sub-committee. I do not know whether Deputies are aware of the fact that the Department of Local Government has nothing whatever to do with the granting of pensions.  They are simply an appeal board.  According to the Act the local committees selected by the county councils are the persons entitled to allocate pensions, subject of course, to the local pension officers. While I have no complaint against a single pension officer in the country &mdash;and I know most of them&mdash;I find that the committee before whom the cases go, are mostly to blame for any delay or lack of attention that arises.  The pension committees are composed largely of shop keepers who bring the claims forward.  They put forward cases, as Deputy de Valera would say, as advocates, but they put forward no grounds or evidence on the questions of age or means.  The cases are then passed to the pension officer, whose duty it is to investigate, and when he finds that as regards age or means these people are not eligible, <Col N="1173" /> he is bound to appeal.  I see nothing wrong in that.  From my experience I must say, with possibly two or three exceptions, I have found all the officials absolutely fair, and absolutely painstaking in the interests of the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subject matter of this motion, that Deputies are deprived of a privilege, I am delighted that that privilege was removed, because it enables me, after the initial trouble that I have taken, to place any further evidence required in writing before the Board.  I have done so, and I would certainly advise Deputies&mdash;even Deputy Ward, who seems to have strong feelings on this matter&mdash;that the Minister has done a great service, and saved Deputies a great deal of trouble, by announcing that they could not be received at the Custom House.  I could not support the motion.</P>

      <P>I did not like to interrupt the Deputy while he was speaking.  By &ldquo;advocating&rdquo; I did not mean that Deputies would take up a case, as if they were feed like a lawyer, or that they would take up and press a case that they would not think fair or just.  By &ldquo;advocating&rdquo; I meant that they were not to be considered as having influence as Deputies; in other words, it was not to be a case so to speak of putting a word in the Judge's ear.  I simply regarded them as advocates in the sense that they would present a case and, of course, would present all the facts.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, speaking yesterday on a matter pertinent to the motion before the House, said that political capital had often been made out of securing old age pensions for claimants.  I think that is regrettable.  I would like to have all Departments of Government so efficient, and all claims so well made, in the Land Commission or anywhere else, that no Deputies on any side would or should claim credit for securing what is due to the public in the matter of land or old age pensions.  I <Col N="1174" /> might say personally that I have never written a letter to the local or daily Press regarding my success in advocating the claims of anybody looking for a pension.  We are told that some of these officers are impudent and rough with the public.  That has not been my experience.  Deputy Wolfe spoke of their efficiency and of their courtesy when dealing with the public. I had one experience&mdash;I do not know if I referred to it in the House before&mdash; with a pension officer, who was extremely courteous.  I believe this particular officer was born within a very few miles of Blarney Castle.  Two brothers, aged men, lived in a cottage. They had a sister who married a small farmer.  One of the brothers had the old age pension.  On reaching the age his claim was put in.  Meanwhile the sister's husband died, and the pensioner was asked to go to the widow's place to settle up her affairs.  He was there for a few weeks and met the pension officer, who did not disclose his identity.  When asked where he was living the pensioner said that he was living with his sister, that he was fed there, and that he got a few shillings for tobacco.  It was on that statement that an assessment of means was made in that case.  That officer was very courteous.  I might say that the man got the pension when his case was fully considered by the Appeals Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J. Wolfe blames Deputy Ward for searching for evidence against claimants for the old age pension. Of course Deputy Ward never said that.  Neither did he put up cases where the claimants were not entitled to the pension.  Deputy Ward did what I did on at least two occasions when allowed to interview the officers at the Custom House.  If I knew definitely that any statements were false I would point out that they were false. I think every Deputy should do so, because the granting of a pension to a person who is not entitled to it means depriving people of pensions who are perfectly entitled.  I think that should be done.  I would do it.  If I found a bogus claim I would say that it was a bogus claim.  I think there is particular need for allowing Deputies to do the best they can by way of a personal interview in connection with claims for <Col N="1175" /> the old age pension.  The claimants are very helpless and very poor, and, as has been pointed out by Deputy Haslett and by Deputy Doherty, local committees are often negligent and rather lax in presenting evidence on behalf of such claimants.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any fear of any undue pressure being put on the officials.  They are wide awake and they take the representations that are put forward for what they are worth. Certainly when we were allowed to make representations these were given full weight but no more.  The officials would discuss the matter and if there were affidavits in a case Deputies could say if the persons who made them were people that could be relied upon.  I do not think there would be undue pressure upon the officials.  As to waste of time, if two or three letters are written they have to be noted, replies have to be prepared and the correspondence filed.  More could be accomplished in five minutes by an interview than by ten letters.  In my view, the case can be put much better at an interview.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Ward's introductory speech on this motion it is said that he showed no vehemence against the Minister for Local Government.  I do not think we should.  This privilege is granted in the Land Commission, in the other Government Departments and in connection with drainage, and I do not see why it should be denied in the case of old age pensions.  I have been successful in some of my representations on behalf of claimants and in others I quite agreed with the pension officer's report that the persons were not entitled.  I think we might accomplish good work on behalf of these poor people by being allowed to appear before the Board.  There will be no waste of time and no undue pressure on the officials.  I deprecate any political capital being made by any Deputy for his success in obtaining pensions for these old people.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote against this motion.  Like Deputy Doherty, I think it was a privilege that, though largely availed of, was seldom of any advantage to Deputies.  Deputy de <Col N="1176" /> Valera said that it was a privilege that could be abused.  What could be, generally is, and was, I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy allows me to proceed I might.  I must say that though I have been in the pension offices I have never achieved any success by personal interviews that I could not have achieved by letter. Long before I was a Deputy, in my capacity as a private individual it was my business sometimes to write on behalf of claimants for the old age pension. Looking back I must say that I met with just as large a measure of success then as I did since I became a Deputy.  I agree with what Deputy Haslett said, and also with what Deputy Fahy said, that all Departments ought to be so administered that the intervention of Deputies or anybody else should not be necessary.  I believe personally that this particular Department dealing with old age pensions is administered inside the definite limitations of the regulations which the pension board are bound to keep.</P>
      <P>For my part I will admit that these regulations are very stringent.  If I had any complaint to make it would be that they are too stringent.  Inside the regulations I think any Deputy will achieve as much by a letter as by a personal interview.  In a letter you can put the relevant points concisely, whereas in an interview one is generally carried away by too zealously advocating the claim and bringing in a lot of irrelevant matters which do not concern the pension and which most people would not take into account. The conversation very often runs on irrelevant matters, so much so that possibly the relevant one is lost in the course of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Murphy interrupted me I was about to say that the privilege was abused.  I believe it was.  It is not my purpose to interfere unduly with the officers in any department.  I generally send the particulars, and while I am not always successful with cases I believe the measure of my success is just as great by writing as it would be by an interview.  On a few <Col N="1177" /> occasions, when I had to appear at the Custom House to meet the deciding officials, I must say that I did not achieve any greater success than I would have achieved by letter.  On these visits I found six or eight Deputies similarly situated to myself waiting to interview one of the officers who had to decide according to the regulations. I believe the privilege was abused.  I believe that many Deputies went unnecessarily to the Custom House when they could have as easily submitted the claims in writing.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am more or less glad that the motion has been put down, and that we have had an opportunity of backing up the Minister in his decision to cut out this privilege altogether, because it was a privilege that was availed of by some Deputies, and not by others, who, perhaps, do their duty as well as those men who pester the officials in their offices.  Certainly I can see no hardship on any Deputy putting the facts plainly on paper, and I believe that the officials sympathetically receive such representations, as far as the limits of the regulations allow them.</P>

      <P>This motion opens up a very important question, the question of the rights and privileges of Deputies.  If Deputies have certain privileges and rights they are entitled to use them.  I do not know that they have the right and privilege of approaching Departments.  It is a matter that I often wished to see cleared up.  If they have those rights where did they get them, and are they statutory rights?  A Deputy, as we all know, is a Parliamentary representative. When he comes here clothed with that representation, does he come as a person entitled to go into a Department, swagger around there with a hundred per cent.  American style and say to everybody there, &ldquo;I am a Deputy, I am a Parliamentary representative and you have got to hear me.  When I make my case you have got to give a decision in my favour because I know what I am talking about.  I am a Parliamentary representative.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have the position cleared up because I have often been very timid in approaching Government Departments.  I am glad that Deputy Ward has put down this motion in order that it may help to clear the air with regard to the rights and privileges of Deputies.  If, as Deputies, we carry those rights and privileges then I take it the Minister has no power or authority to refuse us the right to exercise them.  That is an aspect of the case that requires to be cleared up.  Is the Minister taking on some powers that he has no right to take on with regard to the position of Deputies in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for the purpose of having our position defined as Parliamentary representatives that I have got up to speak.  Personally I do not desire to approach any Government Department even though I have these rights.  Deputies from time to time approach the Land Commission, the Department of Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners and so on.  Is that a waste of time?  I often think it is.  A civil servant must know his job or he will not be kept in his position.  A Deputy approaches a civil servant, but surely he cannot make the boast that he knows all about the case and that he is 100 per cent. correct.  A Deputy is as liable to be incorrect in his evidence or in his knowledge of affairs as perhaps any other person.  To my mind, when Deputies approach Departments I think it means that they are wasting a good deal of valuable time.  The place, to my mind, for Deputies to ventilate their grievances, if they have any, is in this House.  If Deputies feel that their constituents, whether they are applicants for the old age pension, for land or anything else, are not being properly treated by the Department or by Departmental officers, then they should bring forward their cases in the House.  They should tell the House what the position is like and how the Minister and the Department had treated them.  They are neglecting their important functions.  Instead of raising these matters in the House they <Col N="1179" /> go round from Department to Department. I am not a bit sorry that we have been precluded by the Minister from approaching this branch of the Local Government Department.  I think that as Deputies we would be better employed by utilising our efforts to change the whole system of dealing with old age pension applicants.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion as between the Local Government Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  I really do not know where an old age pension applicant stands as between the two Departments, or where the responsibility begins and ends.  I will give an illustration.</P>
    <P>Last year I went to my constituency and two people, representing separate families, approached me.  One of them pointed out to me that his father had made an application for a pension eight months before.  No reply had been received and the family was in a starving, helpless condition.  I said I was sorry I had not been approached before as I could have made inquiries. I wrote to the Local Government Department and I was amazed to hear that, although the case had been heard by the local pensions committee eight months earlier, the papers had not been forwarded to the appeal board in the Local Government Department. I asked the Department to fix responsibility on the person who negligently or deliberately held up the papers while these unfortunate people were starving.  I was referred then to the Revenue Commissioners whom I asked to fix responsibility.  In the course of time I was referred by the Revenue Commissioners back again to the Local Government Department.  I was so disgusted I did not pursue the matter further.  One applicant died before any decision was come to about his pension and the other man, who was entitled to a pension eight months earlier, lived only two or three weeks after he received it.  There certainly is confusion as between the two Departments.</P>
    <P>We are told the local committees have certain powers and functions.  I do not believe they have either the <Col N="1180" /> one or the other.  I believe they are merely there to waste time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Hennessy suggest that, instead of writing letters to the circumlocution office he has so carefully described, he ought to come in direct contact with that office?  If the Deputy used the ordinary energy which he would use in relation to one of his own affairs in pursuing the question, does he suggest that he would have allowed himself to be put off in the way he alleges he was put off?  I never heard a better case put by Cumann na nGaedheal for the inefficiency of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies when they come in contact with the Department.  Deputy Beckett tells us that when he goes to interview a public official his statement is full of zeal and irrelevancy.  Deputy Hennessy tells us that when he goes there he swaggers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. Hennessy Mr. Hennessy">

      <P>He tells us that somebody else swaggers.  If people who go to the Department make statements that are full of zeal and irrelevancy and if they are full of swagger, then it is perfectly <Col N="1181" /> right, in the interests of old age pensioners, that Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies should not be allowed to have contact with the officials.  That is no reason why Deputies who do not go there full of zeal and irrelevancy and who do not swagger should not be allowed to put cases before the court of appeal.  Why should not all cases in courts of appeal be tried on letters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. Hennessy Mr. Hennessy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>God help us! Just think that the electors have sent that Deputy here.  They will not again.  There is one type of advocacy, and there is advocacy of the type which you would expect from the speeches we have heard from Deputy Hennessy and from Deputy Beckett.  You have advocacy of the type that you would get from Deputy Doherty, who told us he was grateful to the Minister because he had saved him the trouble of doing the work that his constituents desire him to do.  That sort of advocacy is no good.  Nor is the advocacy of men who go continuously to overstate a case any good.  Where men come continually in contact with a department or a court a great deal depends upon their method of advocacy.  Where a man comes to a department of this kind and puts before them statements which they know from experience are balanced statements, their advocacy would be very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been put in Deputy de Valera's mouth that men were going to the Department simply and solely as feed lawyers to get their clients all that could be got whether or not they would be entitled to it.  That is bad advocacy.  There are two principles: &ldquo;Do right though the sky falls,&rdquo; is the first principle.  The second principle is &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rdquo;  That is an entirely secondary principle.  I contend, and everybody with experience of business will know, that while honesty is the best policy is the principle upon which they work, <Col N="1182" /> the mere carrying out of that policy does keep the average business man far straighter than the average moralist would be able to keep him. Deputies who make contact with Departments will learn from experience that a balanced statement of fact is the most useful.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Beckett who said that the system had been abused. He may have abused it.  He may have that evidence in his possession of abuse due to the fact that he abused it.  He has produced no evidence to the House that anyone else has abused the system, nor has the Minister produced evidence that his Department has allowed the system to be abused.  I do not want Departmental officers interfered with.  Where a Deputy thinks a case can be fairly stated for an applicant, where he thinks there is some material which could be put forward by means of personal representation, no question of principle is involved in preventing him from making personal representation.  It is going to make it more convenient for us if we can get word sent out that in future no Deputy will be allowed to have contact with the Department.  It will make things very easy for us if none of us is allowed to ask for a grant for a drainage scheme or facilities for a housing scheme.</P>

      <P>It would be amusing, if the matter were not serious, to listen to Deputy Flinn making, with his wonderful fluency, the worse case appear the better case.  As Deputy de Valera said, if this motion were passed it would open avenues for abuse.  It is evident to everybody that it would <Col N="1183" /> open an avenue of abuse that regulations or theories that might be put forward by Deputy de Valera could not counteract.  I think the present system is working satisfactorily.  My experience of it is that where old age pensioners apply for a pension they have friends in the locality who know all the circumstances of the case.  There is the parish priest, the curate, and the local shopkeeper. Where genuine cases have been turned down, and where I have been approached to get them re-opened and given further examination, I found that invariably a letter to the old age pensions office met with immediate consideration.  I cannot remember a single instance of a genuine application for a pension being turned down. I can visualise the difficulties Deputies would have in getting accurate local information from places forty or sixty miles away&mdash;out-of-the-way places.</P>
      <P>If this motion were passed there can be no advantage gained over the existing position, because a Deputy writing to the old age pensions office gets an immediate acknowledgment and, by correspondence, can get that claim re-opened and reinvestigated and dealt with on a perfectly satisfactory basis. It would be very easy to see the office of the Old Age Pensions Department crowded with Deputies and with applications from all over the country.  I think in the working of any Government Department that simplicity should be aimed at.  Complexities and entanglements should be avoided.  I can see nothing but confusion and entanglement arising out of a motion such as this.  For my part I do not think it is possible to improve on the present situation.  At all events the passing of this motion will only make for the creation of confusion that does not exist at present.</P>

      <P>Deputy Egan seems to think that he can make as good representation in writing as by personal interview.  He stated one could have a case re-opened.  Perhaps that is his experience.  But it is not mine.  As far as I know when a Deputy makes representation on behalf of a claimant <Col N="1184" /> in writing what happens is that you get an acknowledgment of your letter and the next you hear about it is the decision.</P>
      <P>There is no prospect, as far as my experience goes, of having cases re-opened, except the applicant makes another application.  In that way he may be done out of a pension over a period of twelve months.  I do not think the Minister or anybody else has stated that this practice has been abused.  I did not hear the case made that there has been abuse.  I do not think there has been.  I often had to go on behalf of my constituents, and they resent the fact that I cannot go now.  I would like to know why the procedure followed before we came into the House was allowed to continue for only eighteen months afterwards. That practice was dropped for some peculiar reason.  It is alleged that the Fianna Fáil Party abused the system, or was it due to the fact that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were too lazy, and when they found another Party in the House taking advantage of the machinery provided for dealing with these cases, they got rather uneasy?  Perhaps it was that Cumann na nGaedheal felt that Fianna Fáil were taking too much advantage of the machinery provided, and that they were, perhaps, gaining a little political advantage by doing the work the Cumann na nGaedheal representatives were supposed to do.  It might bear that interpretation.  There may have been laziness and neglect on the part of the people who were in the Dáil four years before we came. They found that we were doing the work our constituents wanted us to do, and we were doing it apparently with some success.  I suggest the Minister was not altogether unmindful of that when he made the new order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a case can be re-opened in writing as Deputy Egan states, I would be glad to know how it is done.  He may have some information about the matter that we on this side of the House have not.  I rather thought there should be no difference in the methods adopted in regard to this <Col N="1185" /> matter, but there may be some way of getting information, and certainly we have not got it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we were allowed to go there, we would be satisfied that anything that was to be said on behalf of the applicant would be said and if the decision went against him we would have no cause for complaint. But if there is some private way of reopening cases, I think we ought to be told about it and every Deputy put on an equal footing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would permit me to explain.  I was taking up the point made by Deputy Egan, who said that a case could be reopened by correspondence.  My experience is that it cannot.  You get a letter acknowledging your letter and the next communication you get is the decision.  I do not suggest that the deciding officer does not consider the letter sent to him but there is no such thing as reopening a case.  I understood from Deputy Egan that a case could be reopened if additional information came in in the meantime.  I do not know how that can be done under the present arrangement, though it could be done before.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Boland that it would be very serious if the deciding officer were to come to a <Col N="1186" /> decision without taking into account all relevant facts, but I cannot see why the facts cannot be put before him as effectively in writing as they could be put to him personally.  Looking at the matter from the point of view of the deciding officer as a judge, this is a question of fact and I think it would be better not to embarrass him or to occupy his time too much by interference, in which possibly a lot of extraneous and irrelevant considerations would be brought to his attention.  I happen to be in the position of examiner and I am continually pestered with applications by candidates who think&mdash;perfectly naturally&mdash;that they would be the best persons to mark and examine their papers.  A conscientious official will be glad to take all relevant facts into consideration.  If you want to make him an effective officer, you should not trouble him with interference that will occupy his time and which will be fruitless so far as ascertaining facts which have a bearing on the case under consideration is concerned.</P>

      <P>The only argument I have heard used by the Minister against allowed personal representation was about twelve months ago, in this House, when he said that the Department would be placed at a decided disadvantage, and the officials would be inconvenienced.  If we are to take that as the principal reason, I do not think it will bear investigation. We have a great deal of machinery set up to deal with the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  If the service available for the administration of the Act is not sufficient, and if the staff have of necessity to be increased, then it is clearly the duty of the Department to increase the staff to the capacity required to enable the fullest investigation to be made.  The argument used by the Minister can bear only one interpretation&mdash;that the machinery required for the administration of the Act at present is pretty elaborate, and for the purpose of economy he must close some channels if the staff is not to be enlarged.  In doing that, he has <Col N="1187" /> not borne in mind that in closing that avenue of representation to Deputies he has deprived the applicants of means that were necessary for the full investigation of their claims, and for the just application of the Old Age Pensions Acts.  I do not think that that can be justified.  I do not think that Deputies will say that applicants should be prevented from having the full facts placed before the final court of appeal.  It was insinuated from other quarters in the House&mdash;I did not take it seriously&mdash;that personal representation was likely to result in unfair decisions, that Deputies approaching these officials would influence them in giving pensions where pensions could not strictly be given within the limits of the Act.  That is not fair to the deciding officers.  The officers I met on various occasions told me that they were very pleased that Deputies should go before them and assist them in arriving at proper decisions.  Again and again, they have expressed the opinion that we have helped them considerably.  They have never declared that we caused them any inconvenience.  From my experience of them, they are men well fitted for their jobs, and would not be influenced by any Deputy who approached them in regard to a particular case.  I think it is unfair to insinuate that personal representations would influence them in an unfair way. I repudiate that suggestion on behalf of the officers whom I met, who were capable and honest men.  I also repudiate it on behalf of Deputies who have interested themselves in old age pensions cases.  We did not go to these officers with a view to getting applicants anything to which they were not entitled.  We simply went to them with the facts which we had received as the local representatives of these people&mdash;facts which were within our knowledge, or which were furnished from sources upon which we could rely.  To prevent the people having the full facts placed before the deciding officers, is to deprive them of some of the rights of citizenship, and that is, to my mind, quite wrong, quite undemocratic, and should <Col N="1188" /> not have the sanction of any person in this House who thinks democratically, or who is interested in these old people.  The motive behind this suggestion is very difficult to understand. Deputy Boland made a statement which may seem far-fetched, but I believe there is a good deal in it&mdash; that there was a good deal of prejudice in the minds of those who sanctioned the order preventing Deputies making representation in that Department. There were other reasons put forward in justification of this order, but they would not bear investigation. The only substantial argument advanced was that by the Minister, to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been making representations for over a year prior to that order, and the officials there never told me that they caused them any inconvenience. As a matter of fact, they expressed their satisfaction, and stated that I had given valuable assistance, and that they were quite pleased to meet me and discuss the matter there from a particular viewpoint with whatever information I could place at their disposal. Deputy Wolfe stated here on the last day that the order made was made at the instigation of the Independents. What motive they could have in having such an order applied it is difficult to understand.  I think whoever the responsible party was, the Government must take the responsibility for it, and up to the present they have put forward no justifiable explanation for that course.  It is an arbitrary action, an unjust and an unfair action, and should not find approval amongst Deputies who are closely in touch with the people of the country.  I would like also to say that no similar order was made in connection with other Departments.  If a rigid rule of that kind were applied all round we could understand at least that it was a general policy, but to single out one class of people, the aged poor, and to close the door against representations by Deputies who have knowledge of the cases, and wish to put these representations before the higher officials who can deal with the matter, is decidedly unfair.  I do not think that <Col N="1189" /> it is at all justifiable.  If there is to be fair play for all parties and all interests according to this rule Deputies should not have the right of representation to any Department.  They have those rights in the case of every other Department with this one exception.  Why is this Department singled out for special treatment?  Let us have an answer to that question.  Perhaps we would hear from the Minister now a further explanation other than that which he has already given, which is quite unsatisfactory and which convinces nobody.  Perhaps he would find a further explanation that would justify his action.</P>
    <P>Up to now none has been put forward, and I do not think that the Minister could justifiably ask Deputies to give this rule their sanction.  Let us at least be as fair to the aged people as we are to the well-to-do people and to various other interests in the State.  Let us see that their cases will be dealt with in a fair manner and above board, that all the courts in this State are open to the people in the usual way, that they will not be excluded from the different Departments and that these people will be entitled to the same rights as every other class in the State is receiving. That is not asking too much.  Let us withdraw an insinuation which is a reflection on the officers of the Department who deal with these cases.  Let us repudiate the charge made against Deputies of the House that they go before these officials with the idea of influencing them in departing from strict right and justice.  Let us be fair to ourselves and repudiate that charge. Let us be fair to the officials whose characters are besmirched by this order.  Let us, above all, be fair to those we represent, the plain people, and let us be sure that no mere order will prevent them having the Departments of the State open to them to the fullest degree.  Let us see that no decision will be arrived at behind closed doors.  Let us show those people who believe in secrecy, the Independents, who, as Deputy Wolfe stated, dictated the policy of the Government&mdash;let us, representing the plain people of the State, show Deputy Wolfe that secrecy is no part of our programme, that the <Col N="1190" /> rights of the people are our care, that it is our duty to stand by them and that we will stand by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion, because I agree entirely with the object which it seeks to attain. That is to say, personal representations made by us to the Department of Local Government and Public Health on behalf of old age pensioners are really the best and most effective way of presenting the case on behalf of these pensioners.  After all, old age pensioners are a different class of people to any others in the community. They have not the same opportunities or the same ability to put their case that people in other walks of life have. They are largely deprived, owing to their age of their natural senses, and they require help in many respects that people in different circumstances in life would not require.  Deputy Hennessy, in putting his case that we should not be permitted to approach the Department on behalf of old age pensioners, stated that he doubts if we have a right to approach any of the Departments.  Speaking for myself, I may say that I would scruple, and have scrupled, to put a question in this House on the old age pension issue, because one can get by letter from the Old Age Pension Department a reply in similar terms to that which the Minister could give us in the House if we put down a question.  We are informed that the expense of putting a question on the Order Paper is £2 or upwards on the average.  That is the reason that I disapprove of putting a question in that way to the Minister and having it entered on the Order Paper.  There is no necessity whatever for such expense as that and, in my opinion, it should not be incurred. I have never done it myself and I think that Deputy Hennessy was very much at sea on that issue when he put his case in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one case down the country, for instance&mdash;and this is one reason why I support the demand that representations by us to the Department should be permitted&mdash;of a woman the registration of whose birth could not be found.  Her age, however, was found <Col N="1191" /> on an old school register.  The registration of the birth of another member of the family, however, who was the second next child born after the woman to whom I refer, was found, and it shows that this latter woman is 67 years of age.  There was another child between her and the woman who is looking for the old age pension. According to the rule of the Department, there is a two years' interval allowed for each birth, and it is quite clear, therefore, that the woman applying for the old age pension was over 70 years of age.  Notwithstanding the fact, however, that her school register showed that she was over 70 years of age and that there would be four years difference in age between herself and her next surviving sister, the old age pension officer, the local representative of the Local Government Department, brought up that case on appeal here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I daresay that is correct, but that does not influence the point I am making in the sense that what I am stating is the case which is so glaringly clear, that an appeal by the old age pension officer is a thing that should not happen.  When cases such as that occur, I think there is very good reason why we should be permitted to visit the Old Age Pensions Department and explain cases such as that.  It could be much more effectively done by a personal appeal in the Department than by letter.  Some of us would much prefer to do that.  We consider we would be more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> A few other cases have come under my notice of old people who have spent some few years in America.  Their case for a pension, in my opinion, is very strong for the reason that while in America they assisted in supporting the family in this country.  The Department takes it that those people, because of the fact that they had emigrated and lived a few years out of the country, are not entitled to a pension until a certain number of years has elapsed.  I think that is very unfair. That also could be put right in a short time if we were allowed to make personal representations on behalf of those people in the Department.  I think these are very strong reasons why the Minister should reconsider his decision in this matter and give us the opportunity that, as public representatives, I consider we are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I must say that I never attempted to abuse the advantages that I have been given in that respect.  I would be very sorry to do so, and I do not know of anybody who has done so.  I think it would be very unfair on the part of anybody who would attempt it.  I think that the Minister need not fear anything from Deputies who might be permitted to make these personal representations on behalf of members of the community who are not able to put their own cases.  Most of them do not know exactly what to do or what party to approach in order to get assistance to put their cases through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the start that on any occasion on which I visited the Department of Local Government in connection with appeals I met with courtesy and consideration, and any statements that have been made by other Deputies as regards that part of it cannot find an echo so far as I am concerned.  This question of the withdrawal of the facilities afforded to Deputies is a matter which can be looked at from two angles, firstly, from the lack of facilities which it now inflicts on Deputies and, from the Minister's point of view I presume, the advantage which it is to the officials of the Local Government Department and the time which it saves them in getting <Col N="1193" /> on with their work.  However, I doubt if the advantages which accrue through the smooth running of the local government machine are offset by the time that it saves in respect of Deputies' visits to that Department.  The position created by the withdrawal of these facilities may be summarised as leading up to a feeling of uneasiness in the minds of a considerable number of old people throughout the country.  Whilst I agree that a case can be made to a certain extent for the withdrawal of facilities on the grounds that it would ensure the smoother working of the machine, I do not at all agree that that withdrawal is to the advantage either of the Local Government Department or of the people of the country.  Old people who are faced with the position that most people claiming old age pensions are faced with look to their public representatives to do something for them when all other methods have failed and when their public representatives find themselves in a position that the only court of appeal which they can approach is closed to them, except by correspondence, it undoubtedly leads to a feeling in the minds of the people in the first place of uneasiness, and also a feeling that public representatives up here are of very little use.</P>

      <P>Suggestions that can be given to the officer who is prepared to take a verbatim report can be conveyed by correspondence to the authorities concerned.  He is not in a position to argue the case.  He has not before him the information that would enable him to discuss the matter with the Deputy concerned and, therefore, what difference is there between meeting him in the Department of Local Government and in writing a letter to the Minister concerned?  The amount of satisfaction to be got from each is very little.  The inability on the part of Deputies to approach the officer concerned and to discuss with him the full facts of the case puts them in a very awkward position.  Whether it is the intention of the Government to create that impression in the minds of the people or not I do not know.  I <Col N="1195" /> imagine that the creation of an impression that this Dáil is ineffective and that the representatives of the people are ineffective would be a matter that the Minister for Defence should consider very seriously after his <Col N="1196" /> action last Sunday.
