      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce (1) if it is a fact that the Derry and Lough Swilly Railway is to close down to-morrow; and, if so, (2) whether the reason assigned is the refusal of the Saorstát and Six Counties Governments to continue the subsidy paid in previous years; (3) if he will say what is the reason for his refusal to ask the Dáil for a renewal of the subsidy; (4) if he is satisfied that there is a satisfactory alternative form of transport available <Col N="2316" /> in County Donegal to meet the requirements of the community and avoid financial loss and inconvenience to the farmers, traders, and those engaged in the fishing industry; (5) if the railway employees resident in County Donegal have been exempted by him from the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and, if so, what steps, if any, he proposes to take to save the workers concerned from the consequences of not being entitled to Unemployment Insurance benefits; (6) whether he will consider favourably the continuation of the subsidy until such time as a Committee appointed by the Government, and partly composed of railway experts, investigates and reports upon the possibility of reorganising and placing on an economic basis the section of the line situated in County Donegal, in view of the serious consequences for the citizens of County Donegal as a whole which the closing of the line will involve; and (7) whether he will state what is to be the position in regard to the rolling-stock, buildings and other property of the State-owned sections of the line in the event of the Derry and Lough Swilly Railway Company ceasing to work them.</P>

In view of that, I suggest to the Minister that the time is opportune to set up a Committee, partly composed of railway experts, to inquire into the whole situation, so that the railway may be put on a proper economic footing.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary deserves the congratulations of his Party, and of his colleagues on the Front Benches in particular, for having got through the Bill with practically no alteration.  A few proposals made from this side of the House, which were accepted, have been considerably watered down and, in their actual application, I doubt very much if any substantial result will accrue to the tenants whose grievances are said to be remedied under these new sections. On the other hand, the section which was inserted on the Committee Stage dealing with compensation for damage and disturbance is a blot on the whole measure, and I am very sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary ever introduced it.  The problem has been enormously increased, and the potentialities of that section have been greatly increased by virtue of the information that the Land Commission has placed at our disposal, showing what the present position is in regard to these resumed holdings.  It seems quite clear that an extravagant price is being paid for them on the present level of compensation, and the only possible justification for the new arrangement would be that the State was going to step in and bridge the gap.  To the inquiries that have been made from this side of the House as to what is really the Government's policy in this matter of relieving congestion, there has been no reply.  Do they agree with us that this section as it now stands is going to prove a definite barrier in the way of relief of congestion and the settlement of the land problem in the West of Ireland?  If they do not, then it simply means that the State is going to dispose of these lands on resale at a loss.  I cannot imagine the Minister for Finance coming along with the Estimate for the Land Commission and asking the Dáil to vote a larger amount of money yearly to provide for the losses on resale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opinion is that the Land Commission <Col N="2321" /> exists to try and make the resale of land a business and economic proposition.  It is difficult enough for them to do it at present.  The Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that only a small amount of the money expended on improvements can be recovered but, if this new burthen of compensation is going to be added, it is our settled opinion that it is going to complicate the problem and make matters much more difficult. We would be prepared to discuss the question of providing additional facilities, or giving additional powers, or even additional finance, if we were satisfied that such additional finance was going to be spent specifically on the relief of congestion and for the purpose of dividing up the land.  According to the latest report of the Land Commission, the present position is that there is practically no untenanted land available on the Congested Districts Board estates.  It is stated on page 24 of the report that the 78,000 acres which now remain for distribution are almost entirely mountain and turbary land. Therefore no relief can be expected in the matter of congestion in the western counties from the acreage of untenanted lands still on hands unless the Land Commission are going to reclaim 78,000 acres, as they are already doing in certain other areas, and are going to spend vast sums on their reclamation.</P>
    <P>It seems to us that there is a strong case for assuming that the scheme for planting people on land in other parts of the country might, at least, be as economic as the manufacture of land, because really that is what it means, in the West.  If we leave out of consideration the fact that while reclaiming land we are giving more employment, it seems to us as an economic proposition that if these reclamation schemes are to go ahead in certain areas the slowing down of the division and resumption of land in the midlands should not take place. The total number of people, in one way or another, that has been placed on the land since the present Administration took over and since the Land Act of 1923 came into operation is <Col N="2322" /> 12,200 allottees.  That includes some people who had land before.  In fact practically nothing in the way of division of land has taken place in the West that was not already contemplated, or was not in hand, when the old Congested Districts Board was in existence.</P>
    <P>As regards the amount of money that has been spent, it does not show at all favourably, even if you include the special allocations made to deal with housing in the Gaeltacht and with other Gaeltacht industries.  The showing which the old Congested Districts Board could make as against that figure is very good.  In the last year in which the Board functioned it spent £197,000 on improvements in the West.  According to the figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary there was only £120,000 spent last year.  To that might be added the sum of £80,000, and I do not think that we need be specially thankful for the granting of that sum because the Government, having set up the Gaeltacht Commission and having expressed a strong interest in the revival of the language in the Irish-speaking districts, had to do something. As I said, even if we add that sum of £80,000 for the total provision as regards housing and the improvement of land, the two figures together are only equivalent to what the Congested Districts Board spent on land improvements alone in the year 1920-21.</P>
    <P>Considerable assets also fell into the hands of the Administration, amounting in the case of stock and security to something like £190,000.  I have not yet got the figures to show whether, as matters now stand, the Congested Districts Board estates are not actually paying for themselves and leaving a surplus in hands to be expended as the Minister for Finance shall think fit.  If the scheme of work in the congested areas was being done in the way it had been done and in a way in which the people there have a right to expect, I think that it could be made an economic proposition and that even greater facilities than those at present given could be provided. There were free grants for improvements. <Col N="2323" /> There were parish committees established in these areas where loans were given for the purpose of stocking the land.  The amounts involved under those heads would not necessarily be very great, because, as I have previously pointed out, a sum of £1,000 in those areas would be equivalent to a sum of £10,000 in other areas.  I call attention to the matter in order to get a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what the policy is going to be in regard to the resumption of holdings the acquisition of land in the Midlands, and the transfer of the larger or even smaller migrants from the West.  In regard to people in the congested areas for whom no land is available except mountain and turbary, is the only future for them to lie in the hope that the Land Commission will reclaim these lands at enormous expense?  Is all hope of transferring them to more fertile areas completely excluded?</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me that the new section which has been introduced to deal with holdings deteriorated by abuse, through the neglect of the landlord to repair drains, does not cover the question of coast erosion, which is a pressing matter in some areas.  I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary be in a position to include that matter in the Bill, and to promise that when it goes to the Seanad he will endeavour to have it adopted there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Derrig will analyse the figures in the statement which I supplied to him some days ago he will see that the Land Commission is not paying an extravagant price for land resumed in the congested areas.  In 1928 the total resumption price only represented 20 years' purchase of the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no land resumed in congested areas in that year.  In 1929 we did resume eight large holdings in congested areas, and the total resumption price represented 19 years' purchase of the rent.  In other counties the price paid represented <Col N="2324" /> about 20 years' purchase.  In 1930 the price paid in congested areas was somewhat higher, and amounted on an average to about 25 years' purchase.  The other figures relate to estates purchased by the Congested Districts Board before the Board was transferred to the Land Commission, and the landlord's price was already fixed, and consequently the Land Commission had no option but to accept the number of years' purchase fixed by the Congested Districts Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary question the figure of 50 years' purchase which we made out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>You question it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on to explain.  The second part of the return relates to estates purchased by the Congested Districts Board in the years before it was transferred to the Land Commission, and as I have just said, the landlord's price was fixed by the Board, and would approximate on an average to about 21 years' purchase. What the Land Commission has done since is to fix the compensation for the tenant's interest in the holdings which we have resumed.  That compensation depends on the market value prevailing for land in that particular district.  Deputy Derrig knows sufficient about conditions in the West of Ireland to realise that competition for land in the majority of districts is very keen, and where a small holding, or, at least, a reasonably small holding, is put up for sale you have at least 100 competitors for it. That happens in practically every county in the West.  Naturally the keener the competition the higher price for the land is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission is obliged under the Act of 1881&mdash;that is the Act which determines the compensation for the tenant in these cases&mdash; to give the market value. If you take the tenant's interest in addition to the price paid to the landlord it may happen that in some cases the number of years' purchase appears to be exorbitant. <Col N="2325" /> In such cases you must take into consideration many additional factors.  It may happen that when we resume land of that character there may be two or three houses on it.  As a matter of fact in the year 1929, when we resumed a certain holding of this character there were four houses on it. One was a public house, one was a post office and there were two others. What the character of the other houses was I do not know.  In such cases the Land Commission sell these houses for cash and the money realised goes to reduce the price of the land on resale to the tenants.  The cash value of the houses when realised reduces the number of years' purchase.  It sometimes reduces it by 27 or 28 years, as it did in this case.  In all these cases as the Deputy is aware the Land Commission resell the land at an annuity for which the land is security. They invariably lose a substantial sum, but in any case they never fix an exorbitant annuity.  In no case have I heard a complaint from tenants that the Land Commission have fixed an annuity which is exorbitant.  There are factors and special conditions that must be taken into consideration in connection with the acquisition of these holdings.  Really to understand the position clearly Deputies would want to have all the facts and circumstances relating to the acquisition of these holdings presented to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has not received objections to the annuities, is it not because he has taken away the right to object, even where the tenant refuses to sign.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the Bill we have been discussing for the last three or four weeks.  I think the Deputy himself proposed an amendment to this particular section.  The point is that in connection with the acquisition <Col N="2326" /> of these holdings special circumstances must be taken into consideration. As I say, in many parts of the West of Ireland, it is necessary to acquire many such holdings in order that the Land Commission may be enabled to carry out schemes of re-arrangement. It is necessary to carry out these schemes for the purpose of doing away with rundale lettings and giving the tenants compact holdings. There are houses sometimes on the holdings resumed.  The Land Commission naturally do not want to retain these houses.  They endeavour to sell them in all cases.  They invariably succeed in selling these houses for cash and the money realised goes to reduce the price of the land on resale to the tenants.  Consequently in such cases there is a very substantial reduction in the number of years' purchase. The losses on the resale of land have not been very great.  In 1928 the total losses on resale of land resumed only amounted to £246.  On lands resumed in 1929 the total loss was £2,432.  On lands resumed in 1930 the total loss was £820.  I do not anticipate that proportionately the loss will be any greater under Section 43 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question: It will be necessary to resume a much greater area of land in future in order to provide for the migrants whom we will have to remove if we are going to make any impression on the problem of congestion.  This is the most important section in the Bill to my mind.  It is a section which gives the Land Commission a power that we have been long looking for.  It will smooth and do away with the difficulties which we experience at the moment in negotiating the acquisition of land of this character.  It will enable the Land Commission to avoid many of the delays that are inevitably inherent in the whole problem of migration. As I have already said, we will have to deal with a large number of migrants in future and it is absolutely necessary that the Land Commission should have some such power as this.  It is also necessary that the Land Commission should have complete power to acquire any holding, <Col N="2327" /> no matter what size, which in their opinion it is necessary to acquire.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact it is much more important and much more economical from the standpoint of the State that the Land Commission should resume large holdings, holdings sufficiently large to enable us to place on them three or four or more of these migrants.  We have resumed in fact holdings of that character in 1929, at least one holding of that character, on which we were able to place six or seven migrants.  It is much more economical from the point of view of the State that we should have complete power to resume the large holdings. It saves money, it saves time in the office, it saves administrative and other expenses as well.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to make it clear to Deputies on the Committee Stage of the Bill that it was really more important to enable us to resume large holdings than it was to enable us to resume small holdings.  It is equally important so far as the West of Ireland is concerned that we should have power to resume small holdings also, because if we are going to carry out successfully the present policy of the Government it will be necessary for us to resume small holdings.  It will also be necessary to resume these holdings in order to carry out schemes of rearrangement for the purpose of doing away with the rundale system that is such a trouble and annoyance to tenants and such a fruitful source of litigation.  The Land Commission in carrying out this policy for the relief of congestion in the West insist on the tenants on rundale estates agreeing to the Land Commission scheme of rearrangement.  If a tenant objects or refuses to agree with such schemes then the Land Commission suspend proceedings until such time as the tenants come to their senses and agree to the arrangement being carried out.  It will be necessary to resume small holdings for that purpose. It will also be necessary to resume a number of holdings probably not quite so small as the holdings I have just dealt with, large holdings <Col N="2328" /> in various parts of the western counties.  It will be necessary to migrate the tenants of these holdings to eastern counties where there is land available and where land can be resumed at a reasonable price.  Hence it is absolutely necessary that the Land Commission should have the power which the Dáil has given them in this particular section.  In my opinion, it is the most important section in the Bill.  It will undoubtedly help the Land Commission to speed up the migration of farmers from these western areas and so will help us to relieve the problem of congestion in these areas.</P>

Does he consider that a reasonable price for such a piece of land?  There are also competitors bidding in the shape of police pensioners and people who got large sums of money for past services rendered to the former Government, and who are thereby in a position to give exorbitant prices for pieces of land to secure a home for themselves.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that the price of <Col N="2330" /> land enhanced in that way is a reasonable excuse for the Land Commission in paying such prices as have been given for land in recent times?

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third Telephone Capital Bill since the setting up of the Saorstát.  Funds for telephone development as distinct from moneys required for ordinary working and maintenance are provided through Telephone Capital Acts.  These Acts authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund such sum, not to exceed a stipulated amount, as may be required for the development of the telephone system in accordance with estimates which must have the prior sanction of the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance may, if he thinks fit, raise the necessary capital by means of terminable annuities of a period not exceeding 20 years.  Capital funds already provided by the Oireachtas amount to £1,000,000, consisting of £500,000 under the Act of 1924, and £500,000 under the Act of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount asked for in the present Bill is £250,000.  There is still unexpended under the provisions of the 1927 Act a sum of £40,000.  These amounts taken together will, it is anticipated, suffice to meet our capital requirements for the next four years or thereabouts.  The £1,000,000 provided under the previous Acts covered expenditure <Col N="2331" /> for development purposes since 1922, and therefore the average annual expenditure was round about £107,000.  This rate, however, cannot be regarded as normal, because it covers not only the exceptional extensions rendered necessary by the un-telephoned condition of the country on the establishment of the Saorstát, but provision for growth in congested city areas, work that must be done in bulk well ahead of the actual needs of the moment.</P>
    <P>The obsolescent state of the plant taken over was due to circumstances existing in the period preceding its acquisition.  In anticipation of the expiration of the licence under which it operated, the National Telephone Company in the latter years of its existence expended the least possible sum on maintenance and renewals and kept its system in working order by many expedients of a temporary kind. When the temporary service was acquired by the Post Office in 1912 the main exchanges as well as the plant were inadequate and inefficient.  The outbreak of the Great War brought matters almost to a standstill.</P>
    <P>In this country matters were much worse than in Great Britain by reason of the destruction which took place from 1916 to the end of the Civil War.  Consequently when the staff of this Department were free to bend their energies towards permanent development and improvement they had to face a situation in which all the important exchanges were obsolete and inefficient, the underground cables and conduits inadequate and the trunk lines defective and insufficient.  Little or no development had taken place in the rural areas and many counties were without any service whatever.  The situation was taken in hand energetically, and we are satisfied that the service has in general reached a high level of efficiency and that no area of real importance has been left uncovered.  The expenditure necessary was in excess of requirements under normal conditions, or which will be required in future.  Of the capital funds so far provided £70,000 has been expended <Col N="2332" /> on the introduction of automatics; £3,000 on main underground schemes; £418,000 on local underground plant; £80,000 on new exchanges and call offices; £88,000 on overhead trunks and £190,000 on subscribers' lines.</P>
    <P>The following comparison of the position in 1922 and now will indicate more clearly what was done. Exchanges in 1922 numbered 194, in 1931, 720; call offices in 1922 were 552, in 1931, 1,257; exchange lines in 1922 were 12,387, in 1931, 19,289; stations in 1922 were 19,101, in 1931, 30,465; kiosks nil in 1922, 14 in 1931.  The most important development work carried out has been the conversion of the central area of Dublin from manual to automatic working.  6,381 subscribers are now connected with the new automatic exchanges at Merrion Street and Ship Street.  The system is highly efficient and has given satisfaction.  In connection with the conversion, underground cables have been laid to provide wires for new subscribers for ten to fifteen years to come.  In Limerick a new manual exchange of the most modern type has been installed.  Other extensions of an important nature have been carried out all over the country.</P>
    <P>As to future development policy, owing to the work already done there is not scope for any immediate large-scale extensions, and therefore capital expenditure will be substantially less than in the past.  As to the automatic service, it is the intention that the whole Greater Dublin area shall be brought within the system, but existing manual exchanges will be maintained as long as they are capable of giving efficient service.</P>
    <P>From the financial provision made in this Bill, it is hoped to convert Rathmines and Terenure Exchanges to the automatic system.  In the meantime a temporary relief exchange has been opened in Terenure.  The Drumcondra Exchange is also congested, but arrangements are being made under which it is hoped to meet all the requirements of that district for telephones within a few months.  Projected developments in the provinces includes the provision of additional <Col N="2333" /> trunk lines so as to give a &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service to the more important centres. The introduction of small automatic exchanges is contemplated for outlying areas where the cost of manual service is prohibitive.  This side of our development is, however, still in the experimental stage, and its practicability is not yet assured.</P>
    <P>A statement of the financial results of our telephone undertaking is more strictly applicable to the Estimates, but Deputies may be interested to hear that it is hoped when our commercial accounts for the current financial year are issued it will be shown that the telephone service has now been established on a self-supporting basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the establishment of the Free State Government substantial sums have been invested in telephone capital, and although there can be no doubt that it is very desirable that we should have an efficient telephone service, it is not clear that the money thus invested has given us the result in efficient service which we might reasonably expect.  The increased investment of capital in the service has, of course, increased its liability for interest while, at the same time, its ability to meet these interest charges appears to be declining.  Since 1925 it is true that the revenue of the service from rentals has been increasing, but the cost of maintaining it and the other charges against it have also been increasing, with the result that the annual deficit has been, if not actually increased, at least not diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, difficult to say what the annual deficit would be if proper bookkeeping methods prevailed in the Post Office.  At present the deficit is given as the amount required to meet the interest charges after deductions have been made from the balance in the Revenue Account in respect of pension liabilities and provision for depreciation.  Year after year, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has been drawing the attention of the Dáil to the fact that inadequate provision is being made both in respect of pension liabilities and in provision for depreciation.  Year after year it has been pointed out that the amount set <Col N="2334" /> aside for depreciation has been less than the annual amount expended on renewals, with the result that the balance in the Depreciation Account has been steadily reduced.  If it is proposed to invest another £250,000 in the telephone service in addition to the £1,000,000 already invested, I should like to know to what extent that additional capital is required in consequence of the failure of the Post Office authorities to make adequate provision for depreciation in the past.</P>
    <P>The accounts show that the amount raised in telephone capital up to 31st March, 1929&mdash;these are the last accounts available&mdash; was £1,566,858. Of that total, however, £765,358 represents British loans expended on the Irish Free State telephone plant, which the Parliamentary Secretary has told us was in an obsolescent condition when taken over by the Free State Government.  Was any attempt made to secure a revaluation of these loans by the Government in consequence of the fact that the British authorities had allowed the plant here to become obsolescent, as the Parliamentary Secretary described it?  The interest charges on these British loans expended upon the erection and maintenance of the obsolescent plant represent the total of the annual deficit upon the Post Office service, which, of course, has to be met out of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>In account No. 3 of the commercial accounts of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the amount set out as the value of the plant, including private wires, is £1,501,973.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether that figure represents anything, except an amount of income on paper.  If that figure does, in fact, represent the value of the plant, then the plant taken over from the British Post Office in 1922 must still in the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary be worth the total amount expended on it originally.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the way in which the telephone service has been administered, and particularly the manner in which its accounts have been prepared and presented to the Dáil, <Col N="2335" /> suggests that things are done in the Department concerned in a very slipshod manner.  The fact that the taxpayer is asked to provide some £30,000 or £40,000 per year to meet interest charges upon the money already invested in the service should make us very slow to agree to any increase of its capital liability until we are satisfied that there is some real prospect that the efficiency of the service will be increased, so as to ensure that its revenue will meet its outgoings in the year, and meet these outgoings at a proper valuation of them.</P>
    <P>It is merely postponing the evil day to endeavour to present favourable figures to the Dáil by the device of making inadequate provision for pension liabilities and depreciation, as the Post Office is doing according to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. We can discuss upon the Estimate for the Department the question of administration, but on this Bill we should have from the Parliamentary Secretary a more adequate explanation as to the policy of the Department, as to the reason why it is not paying at present, and as to the steps which he proposes to take to remove these causes and to ensure that this service will be put, as it can be put and as it was put in one year since the Free State was established, on a paying basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most people throughout the country will welcome the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that it is proposed to expend more money in the development of the telephone service.  There is no more useful service throughout the country or one from which one gets more value. That is my opinion but I am sorry to say that up to the present it has not been nearly enough spread out through the country in the way that it might possibly have been.  I know there are considerable difficulties, financial and otherwise, in the way, but it is good news to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that the position of the telephones is now approaching solvency. That being so I hope that the Department will do everything that is in their <Col N="2336" /> power to extend the telephone service throughout the rural area, even though there may be a small apparent loss at the beginning.</P>
      <P>So far as I know at present, the cost of installing a telephone is prohibitive in my district.  The rent proposed to be charged in many cases is far too high, even compared with pre-war.  In pre-war the rents were fairly high, and we had to give a guarantee.  In fact I think it would be good business to be prepared to lose a little at first in an extension of the telephone service.  It would be good business for the Post Office to reduce the rents.  I know that if the rents were lowered there is quite a large number of people in my area who would instal the telephone; they are constantly speaking to me and saying that the charges are too high entirely.  I am perfectly certain that the number of people who would put in a telephone would be enormously increased if the charges were not so prohibitive.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter.  Whatever small loss there might be at first, would be made up by the increase in the number of people who would instal the telephone as a consequence of a reduction in the rent. There should be a reasonable reduction in the present rate.  Why the making of such reductions would mean an enormous loss eventually I cannot make out.</P>
      <P>I did not quite gather from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he proposes to have automatics in the rural areas.  I was not quite clear as to whether he proposes that or not.  If automatics could be installed in the rural post offices, that, too, would make the working of the telephone cheaper.  Whether he instals automatics or not, I would press on him to do everything he can to reduce the cost. It would pay the Post Office ultimately to lose a little at first by conveniencing the people in the rural areas.  I am perfectly positive that in a very short time there would be no loss, but, on the contrary, an immense gain not only to the Post Office, but to the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the sum of money <Col N="2337" /> which he hopes to secure when this Bill becomes law will be expended on the installation of the automatic system in the Dublin suburban district. The only benefit that will accrue to the country district is that some districts which are at present remote or isolated may possibly get the benefit of the automatic system, and that there will be some improvement in the trunk service.  I would like to point out that subscribers in rural districts at present get very poor value for the rents they pay for the telephone service. They are charged prohibitive rents, and they have no night service and no Sunday service.</P>
      <P>Until such times as the Parliamentary Secretary can see his way to have both a night and a Sunday service included for subscribers in rural areas, I maintain that the telephone service will be a failure.  Any development that should take place should be a development along those lines.  The people who subscribe in rural areas are entitled to as much consideration as the subscribers in Rathmines or Terenure.  In any development that should take place there should be an improvement in the rural services. The Parliamentary Secretary should see that good instruments and good apparatus are installed in every district in which he is installing telephones.  At present it is only obsolete instruments, and old instruments discarded from Dublin, that are sent down to the country.  The result is that there is a very poor reception. In nine out of ten times I can neither deliver a message nor hear it in my own telephone.  Until such time as better instruments are installed and until such time as we, in the rural districts, are given a Sunday and a night service, such as is available at present for the Gárda Stations, the telephone service will not, I am afraid, be popular.  I urge upon the Secretary that, side by side with any development, he should see that these improvements are included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bear out <Col N="2338" /> Deputy O'Dowd's statement.  If the difficulties that the Parliamentary Secretary gave us indicate anything, they indicate the great demand that there is all over the country for telephonic development.  In some cases there has been as many as twenty times the number of installations that there were a few years ago. As Deputy O'Dowd said, the Parliamentary Secretary's attention has been directed to the suburban development of the telephone service.  He has had no regard for the development in the rural parts nor in the improvement of the county exchanges.  Repeatedly on the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I have complained about the bad service in the rural parts.  It is no exaggeration to say that five out of every six calls are unsatisfactory.  Not later than last year I had a lengthy correspondence with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs about the Mullingar Exchange and its bad work.  The Parliamentary Secretary happened to come down to Westmeath about the time of the close of the correspondence, and about that time we noticed a wonderful development in the telephone. We did not know where we were.  I had a letter from his Department saying that the telephone service in Westmeath was the most perfect service in the Saorstát.  Unfortunately he stayed with us only for a short time, and we have gone back again to the old bad system of bad calls and bad service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know first of all the necessity of linking up the rural areas with the exchanges is altogether wrong.  I do not see why the sub-offices that are under the county office for all other services should not be linked up with the principal post office for the telephone service.  Although all the sub-offices are governed by a central post office in a particular county, yet in the administration of the telephone service some of these sub-offices are linked up with one county on the one side and another county on the other side.  In County Westmeath we have Delvin and Streete sub-offices of Mullingar.  In the case of postal and telegram deliveries they are connected <Col N="2339" /> with Mullingar.  We find that if we want a telephone call from Delvin to Mullingar, a distance of ten miles, the Delvin office has to get in touch with Kells and the call has to be made by way of Dublin to Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I know the case of a man who called for Mullingar from Delvin.  He was waiting about five or ten minutes. Then he went out, entered his motor car and drove to Collinstown, a distance of seven miles.  He had not cancelled his call at Delvin.  He called the Mullingar subscriber from Collinstown, got through, and returned by motor car to Delvin.  Even when he reached Delvin the original call had not been put through and he cancelled it.  That is no exaggeration. The same would apply to a call from the Streete post office.  It would really be much cheaper to go by car, but one cannot always afford to get a car to go to another office in order to put a telephone call through.  The telephone is supposed to give facilities, but in the rural districts many difficulties have to be met with in the making of calls.  In the case of Streete, some miles from Mullingar, a telephone call has to go by way of Longford.  The operator has to ring up Longford, about twenty miles away, in order to get to Mullingar. I do not see why, in the administration of the telephone service, the same system in regard to sub-offices and the central office in each county should not apply.  There is a complete lack of system.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd referred to bad instruments. In the case of a call from Castlepollard to Trim you cannot use the telephone, no matter how you shout.  It is very difficult to get through, and there really is no satisfaction. Business people are more and more using the telephone every day, and the Parliamentary Secretary should divert his attention from Rathmines and Terenure to the rural districts.  If the whole matter is investigated, I am sure it will be found that the greatest development is in the rural areas.  It is my belief that all the obsolete instruments that were in Dublin have been <Col N="2340" /> dumped throughout the country.  When I was complaining about the exchanges I was told by the Department about my lack of courtesy with the people in the exchanges.  It is an extraordinary thing that when you come to Dublin you are served in a quick way.  No matter where you go in Dublin you are through in a couple of minutes.  There is no half-hour or twenty minutes delay.  Deliberately I say that an ordinary call in a post office in the country, not alone in my county, but in other counties, means usually a twenty minutes wait, even though the distance may be only ten or twelve miles.  The people in the exchange may have to manicure their nails, and they will tell you that the number is engaged, and the receiver is hung up.  People in business often have very urgent calls to make, and they suffer a great deal through want of a better service. When repeated complaints are made to the Department the people who make them should not be told that they lack courtesy.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd has spoken about automatic telephones being installed in the rural parts.  They are really very necessary, but where they cannot be installed we would like at least as good instruments as were here before the automatic telephone came.  The instruments that we are using in the country should be more properly placed in the Museum.  That is the right place for them.  They are apparently the first instruments which came out.  In no place else in the world would you see them utilised in the telephone service.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be doing a national good if he handed them over to the Museum.

Express calls should be much better <Col N="2341" /> developed.  With this money at his disposal for the further development of the telephone service the Parliamentary Secretary should see that the rural parts should get the sort of service we have indicated here, and there should be better service in the county exchanges.  Better instruments and better reception than we have at present should be given, and this would place the service in the rural parts in as good a position as the service in Dublin before the installation of the automatic telephones.</P>

      <P>What is the principle of the Post Office with regard to call offices in villages in rural areas?  Is it the principle of the Department that every call office must pay for itself, that if there is not a prospect of that happening at once that the call office will not be erected?  I think that has been the principle with regard to certain applications made to them in recent months.  I know that in Kilcool, in Wicklow, and again in Brittas, which everyone knows is developing as a seaside resort, the applications were refused on the grounds that they were not going to pay.  It is well known that Brittas is going to have a large population in the near future, and one of the things which would assist its development is a call office, because it is a good distance from any town.  I do not think there is a good delivery of letters there.  The principle with regard to letter distribution is that there are many services which have to be paid for by other areas.  Is it the practice of the Department in regard to call offices that unless there is practically a certainty that the full working revenue will be obtained from a call office no call office will be provided? <Col N="2342" /> I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some information on that matter, because I do not think it is a wise principle, and certainly it leaves a great many people who desire to avail of the telephone services with a particularly strong grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I look at this as one of the most important Bills that come before the Dáil from year to year.  I want to make vocal some of the complaints that I have heard from time to time against the telephone service. Certainly some advance has been made in the establishment of kiosks, but yet the complaint remains that the service is altogether too expensive. What is required in rural areas especially is a more efficient service.  It would certainly be a step forward if the Parliamentary Secretary would undertake to improve the services somewhat in the rural areas.  In addition to the more immediate wants, necessary from time to time, such as the calling of medical or surgical aid in these rural areas the absence of adequate telephone service is very much felt.  The complaint also made by Deputy Kennedy and others is well justified, namely, the dumping into these areas and other important centres of the Free State of secondhand apparatus from Dublin.  It is hardly fair to the rest of the country who have to bear their share of the taxation to be dumping these secondhand duds on them.  It is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction indeed, and I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary find some other dumping ground than the rural areas for this apparatus.  The Museum has been suggested by Deputy Kennedy, but I think that even there it would be a little bit too antique for some of the places reserved for antiques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary is not aware of the gravity of those complaints.  The telephone service in the rural areas is quite a joke.  In Dublin and some cities the service is very efficient, but in the rural areas it is anything but efficient, and some move should be made to provide adequate and efficient services in those <Col N="2343" /> areas.  I quite understand and appreciate that this means extra expense, but I feel that it is a public utility service and should not be discussed in the light of a profit-making machine. Even at some loss to the State it should provide a decent and adequate service in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat difficult to understand Deputy Lemass's criticism of the financial side of the telephone undertaking, because I pointed out in my opening statement that the telephone undertaking is now on a paying basis and that in accordance with the estimated commercial accounts for the end of this financial year we will break even on the telephone account.  As indicated by the balance shown in the commercial accounts of the telephone side the position has improved from year to year.  The Deputy is probably aware that at the end of the financial year 1924-5 the telephone undertaking had almost reached the stage of paying for itself.  The adverse balance at the end of that year was £3,348, but the scale of charges was considerably reduced at the end of the financial year with the result that the adverse balance at the end of the next financial year was considerably increased, amounting in 1925-26 to £33,976 and a still further increase in the following year to £44,191.  There was a further adverse balance of £49,255, in 1927-28, incidentally the year when I took over charge of the political end of the post office administration. From that stage the adverse balance showed a steady decline.  At the end of the next year it was £34,719, and the following year £16,055.  That was the year 1929-30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a matter for satisfaction. The Deputy referred to the fact that the expenditure has increased. The expenditure has increased. The tendency of the expenditure on a growing undertaking of that kind is to increase, but co-incident with the increase in expenditure there has been an increase in revenue and a decrease in the adverse balance. We do not object to the expenditure <Col N="2344" /> increasing provided there is, at the same time, an increase of revenue, and that has taken place.  It is interesting to note, as indicated in the advance figures of our commercial accounts, that the expenditure during the past year has actually decreased from £382,732 to £378,000.  So, from every point of view, I think the financial position of the telephone undertaking is satisfactory.  Not only is the balance satisfactory, but it is shown after full allowance is made for interest on outstanding liabilities.  In a commercial undertaking profit as a rule is not shown until the interest on capital is provided for.  An ordinary commercial undertaking can be shown to be on a paying basis but not on the basis of paying a dividend.  Our accounts are shown first on the basis of paying a dividend and then breaking even. That is, I think, a very satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the statement of the Auditor-General on the matter of depreciation.  My answer to the Auditor-General's remarks and to the remarks of the Deputy is that considerable allocation has been made from year to year from the Revenue Account to the Depreciation Account, but that allocation has not been sufficient to meet the amount expended on renewals.  The reason for that is fairly obvious.  When we took over the undertaking, as I indicated in my opening statement, it was in an obsolescent condition.  Considerable expenditure of capital was necessary, and an undue amount had to be taken out of the Depreciation Account for renewals.  The amount in some cases exceeded the actual sum that was put to the Depreciation Account each year. If the Deputy will look at the Capital Account for 1929, he will see that the amount spent on renewals in that year is less than the amount credited to the Depreciation Account, with the result that the Depreciation Account shows an increased balance.  The balance brought forward to the Depreciation Account in accordance with the Telephone Capital Account, 1929, was £91,740.  There was transferred from the net revenue £62,980.  The amount spent on renewals was £49,000.  That <Col N="2345" /> is a smaller amount than the amount transferred from net revenue, with the result that there is an increased balance shown in the Depreciation Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that in the same period the prime cost of the plant increased considerably, with the result, as the Comptroller and Auditor-General pointed out, that the proportion which the balance in the Depreciation Account bore to the prime cost decreased from 6.8 per cent. to 6.5 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but that prime cost is calculated on the plant, and the plant is almost new in condition. So that the depreciation is very small.  If the renewals continue, as we hope they will, to be less than the amount transferred to the Depreciation Account the Depreciation Account will grow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has started to do so.  I think the Deputy made some comment on the value of the plant taken over from the British.  As far as I could gather, his remarks were that the plant was not worth the outstanding liability.  That is not so. The condition of the plant was very poor indeed.  The actual value of the plant, after making all allowances for depreciation, was only £558,944.  I think the Deputy will agree that that was not a very excessive capital liability, even for the obsolescent plant we took over, while the capital liability was only £340,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary reconcile his figures with the figures given in Account C&mdash;Commercial Accounts&mdash;where the value of the plant is shown to be £765,358?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take depreciation from that.  There is a net amount shown which I think will closely correspond with my figure.  I think the financial side is satisfactory.  I think we in the Department have reason to feel pleased that the undertaking is at <Col N="2346" /> last on a sound financial basis, paying for itself, and the people who are using the telephone are not being subsidised by the taxpayer.  The person who has a telephone is paying the full value for the service which he gets.</P>
      <P>Most of the other comments were really more applicable to the administration of the Department, and should be raised on the Estimates.  Deputy Wolfe commented on what he called excessive charges which we are making for our service.  Charges were reduced in 1924, and our charges do not compare unfavourably with the charges in other countries.  I could give comparative figures for Great Britain and America.  I think the comparative figures in 1921 will not show the charges made here in an unfavourable light.  I must say, however, that our charges in rural areas as compared with the charges in rural areas in other countries are not favourable to this country.  There is a reason for that.  I would mention Sweden, and the rural parts, perhaps, of America and Canada.  The reason is that in those countries the system adopted and accepted by the people is what is known as the party-line system.  I think if the people in this country would accept the party-line system and make use of it, we could give the telephone installation at a much lower rate of charge.  We have issued circulars throughout our post offices showing the rate of charge for party-lines.  I think that Deputy Wolfe has a party-line, and that he can express satisfaction at the service which he gets on that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>The present charge for party-lines is enormously increased. It is six or eight times what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the party-line has not increased in recent years.  There seems to be objection to the use of the party-line system in this country.  One of the reasons possibly is that in the party-line system all the subscribers can listen to the conversation of the person using the line.  We are supposed to have a little more curiosity as to our neighbours' affairs in this country than is the case in other countries, with the result that <Col N="2347" /> people will not instal the party-line.  If they did, we could give them cheap telephonic accommodation.</P>
      <P>The other comments made were concerned chiefly with the condition of the telephone service in the rural areas.  I recognise that the service which we render in the rural areas is not as good as the service which we render in the cities.  Some of the plant in use in the rural areas is not of the most modern type.  The tendency has been to instal the more modern plant in the cities.  We have given the least modern plant to the rural areas, and we have made use of lines which were not as modern as we would like them to be.  The alternative would be to have no service at all.  In the initial stages we endeavoured to give a service wherever it could possibly be justified financially.  In endeavouring to do that, we made use of plant which was not the dearest available plant.  If we were to make use of the dearest available plant, the charges would be correspondingly higher.  Our policy is gradually to improve the quality of the apparatus.  We are gradually superseding the older type of plant by newer and more modern plant in the rural areas.  One of the reasons that this capital sum is required is to replace some of the existing obsolete plant in the rural areas by modern and up-to-date plant.  Our efforts in that direction will naturally be somewhat slow. But that is our general tendency.  We are definitely improving the plant in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised a question as to the system on which we base our calculations in deciding whether or not we shall establish a call office in a particular place or not.  Our general requirement is that the estimated revenue from the call office, including a considerable proportion of the amount paid for trunk charges, shall be sufficient to repay the annual charges incurred by the establishment of that call office.  The actual charges will be based on the capital expenditure, plus the operating cost.  There is a regular accounting formula for basing the annual charges on the actual cost.  On the opposite side of the balance-sheet <Col N="2348" /> is shown the estimated revenue from the call office.  Our staff has become experienced in the estimating of possible revenue and, where the estimated revenue does not equal the estimated annual expenditure, we are prohibited from establishing call offices.  The call office is expected to be on a paying basis.  While, generally speaking, the call offices must be on a paying basis, it may be taken that the rural fringe of our telephone service is the least paying section and, possibly, the nonpaying section of our undertaking.</P>
    <P>We are giving special attention to this question of rural telephone development and we are considering, as indicated in my opening statement, the possibility of establishing automatic rural exchanges.  We have not yet brought our experiment to a conclusion. We are experimenting and we believe that we have nearly arrived at a position where we can say that small automatic telephone exchanges will work satisfactorily in rural areas.  If our experience in that respect proves satisfactory, we hope to be able to instal exchanges in places where they cannot at present be installed because of the operating costs and we hope to be able to give in those places a day and night service, thereby meeting the objection raised by Deputy Dr. O'Dowd.</P>

I do not know if we have a very large selection of men of that type.  I should like to know if, during the negotiations the Minister had on this matter in London, he raised that question with the British representatives.  Naturally, under present conditions in Great Britain, they must insist on these qualifications, but I would like to know if the Minister suggested to the British representatives that the Irish representatives should not be required to have such qualifications.  I think that our selection would be very small if this were to be the case and I do not know if four such members could be found in the Free State at the present time.</P>

    <P>Attention was drawn on the Second Stage of this Bill to the fact that the Free State Council will send one guinea each year to the Council in Great Britain in respect of every member of the General Register.  I think that is a service that the General Council in London has not been enjoying up to the present.  They should at least pay out of the fees paid to the General Council in London the expenses of members from the Free State who attend the meetings.  It is altogether unfair to expect that the Council in the Free State should pay the expenses of the members attending the meeting of the General Council when one guinea has been paid for each member who is on the <Col N="2352" /> general register.  After all, if you take the case in Great Britain, there the members pay the ordinary fee of one guinea, and having got that fee from those residents in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the General Council pays the expenses of members attending the meetings.</P>

      <P>This section states that the powers under it can be delegated to the Registrar.  I think it is rather risky to allow even the Council to delegate to the Registrar the power of removing from the register all entries therein procured by fraud or misrepresentation. I take it that the Registrar would have to be a judge of what is fraud or misrepresentation, and I do <Col N="2353" /> not think there is any appeal against that by a member who might be removed. At least it should be made a condition that the Council would exercise that right and not be allowed to delegate it to the Registrar.</P>

There is certain power in the Minister to supervise and regulate some matters in relation to the Council.  I think that could be attended to.  If you look at the actual practice rather than rely on speculation as to what might happen, the Registrar is only permitted certain formal duties in connection with removals.  I do not think the Registrar would ever be permitted to decide what is fraud or wilful misrepresentation so as to disentitle a man to be on the register.  There is a certain amount of discretion left to the Council as to whether or not they will delegate that to the Registrar I think we can rely on a body of men appointed in a certain way not to delegate that to the Registrar.

      <P>(4)  In this section the word &ldquo;year&rdquo; means a period of twelve months commencing on any 1st day of April and ending on the next following 31st day of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with registration fees and puts into Section 27 <Col N="2354" /> with regard to registration fees a clause almost identical with sub-section (6) of Section 28 in regard to annual fees.  The position we want to achieve is this, that when a person is about to be registered it may be found that he has paid a registration or annual fee already for that particular year to the other college.  In that case he is not mulcted twice. There is a rebate made to him with regard to either of these things.  We had not a clause similar to sub-section 6 of Section 28 in regard to registration fees and we want to establish the same thing.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 27, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 28 (4).</P>
    <P>(4)  The annual fee shall be of such amount as the Executive Council shall from time to time appoint by order and, until the Executive Council so appoints the amount of such fee, the amount thereof shall be two guineas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already referred to this amendment as a ludicrous way of dealing with the matter.  The idea that we had in mind in framing the amendment was that the Council should not be asked to collect a guinea from those who are on the general register, that if that guinea for those on the general register were to pass through the Council, it should, at least, be collected in a different way.  It seems unfair to compel all those veterinary surgeons who register on the home register to pay £2 2s., whether they want to remain on the general register or not. It would appear to me that if they want to remain on the home register only they should be asked only for such fee as would pay the expenses, and so on, of that register.  That is why a sum of 10s. 6d. is put down.  The question of <Col N="2355" /> the guinea going to the General Council can be dealt with afterwards. The Minister for External Affairs has given a rather peculiar view of this question of the general register. At the close of the debate on the last day he gave us to understand that his view was that if a veterinary surgeon got his degree from the Royal College, the College had power, in case he did not pay his annual fee, to take his degree from him, so that in that way he would be no longer an effective practising veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>I think that, having brought this Bill in, we should look at the matter in a different way.  I am talking about men who are at present practising veterinary surgery in the Free State.  I think that we should make it possible for a number of them, if they wish to practise here, to remain on the home register only, thereby relieving them of the necessity of paying £1 1s. 0d. to the general register. A number of them have, I take it, made up their minds to remain in practice here, and have no intention of practising in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  They would not pay £1 1s. 0d. a year for the privilege of practising there. and I think that we should frame the Bill so as to relieve them from paying £1 1s. 0d. a year to the general register.  I suppose that all our veterinary surgeons have the degree of M.R.C.V.S., and have thereby been admitted to the general register. That means that they are qualified and pronounced competent to practise veterinary surgery, and, if that is so, surely they should be, from the Free State point of view, all right for the rest of their lives.  They intend to practise here, and I take it that they are willing to do so.  At least, if they are not willing, we would, I think, be entitled to compel them to pay an annual fee to the Free State register for the protection we are going to give them under the Bill.</P>
    <P>So far, a number of them have been paying the annual fee for the privilege of having their names on the general register, and they do not want to pay any fee for going on the general register in addition to the home register. <Col N="2356" /> If they are told, first of all, that they must go on the home register to practise veterinary surgery in the Free State, and if they have the option of registering on the general register, they will have to pay £1 1s. 0d. in addition to that paid for being on the home register.  If they opt to go on the general register, you can allow them to pay an extra £1 1s. 0d. into the Treasury of the Free State Council, who can send it across to the General Council.  They should, at least, have the option of saying whether they intend to go on the general register or not, and, if not, they should be relieved of paying the second guinea.  I propose that the amount to be paid for registering on the home register should be 10/6.  I think that when the Minister referred to this as being a ludicrous way of trying to meet the views of people, he did not look at it from the point of view of the man who wishes to register on the Free State register only.  I do not know whether under this Bill we are in a position to register the existing veterinary surgeons on our own register here without compelling them to remain on the general register also.  I think that it should be pointed out by the Minister where we are forbidden to do it.  If we are forbidden to do so, we should have an opportunity of amending the Bill so as to make it possible for us to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has now explained the amendment.  He divided his explanation into two parts. He wants to cut down what he describes as the existing fee of two guineas by cutting off a guinea to start with and then by halving what is left. First of all, I want to point out that it is not a two-guinea fee, but whatever sum the Council determine or may appoint by order.  Until such is determined by order the two guineas is taken as something to start on.  The second guinea, to which the Deputy refers, may really not be a guinea at all, but will be whatever sum the Council find hereafter to be necessary to enable them to carry out their duties under the Act.  It will go up and down according to whatever work falls on them and whatever expenditure <Col N="2357" /> they have to incur.  As to the other guinea, the section is meant to give the Executive Council power to determine one fee for the people who want to go on to both registers, and then a different fee for people who want to go on the home register only. It was the intention that there should be no obligation on a man to pay two guineas unless he wants to be on both registers.</P>
      <P>If he wants to be on both registers he pays a guinea for the privilege of being on the outside register and pays a guinea, or whatever the Council determine is necessary, to meet the expenses here after the Council has got into its stride.  The Deputy said that, so far, people need not pay that sum.  I tried to explain on the previous occasion that it was very difficult to argue that point in a precise way, because negotiations in regard to the agreement started at a time when the situation was somewhat more complicated than it is now.  Having gone through these negotiations, I can honestly say that if we do not collect that guinea and pay it on the other side, or, alternatively, if we do not give these people power by action in our courts to obtain that guinea from those who obtain the degree of M.R.C.V.S., and who are practising here, they would take power to strike them off their own general register.</P>
      <P>That is the situation, and I think it is fair play for both sides.  If they take out an examination on the other side and get a certain degree they must submit themselves to the same conditions as all the others in the old United Kingdom who got that degree. That at present involves a payment of one guinea.  I do not know whether the Deputy wants to make another change to complicate the matter a little more, whether he wants the situation to be such that a man may take the M.R.C.V.S. degree, may get on the general register for a year and on the Irish register without any other degree, and then afterwards say &ldquo;I will not pay my guinea.  I will drop my M.R.C.V.S. degree, and I will remain as an Irish qualified veterinary surgeon, having taken only the M.R.C.V.S. examination.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2358" /> I do not think that that is fair.  If he wants to practise in Ireland, if he is concerned with having the M.R.C.V.S. degree for the sake of practising in Ireland, and if he does not want to leave the country, then we are going to make such provision as will enable him to get an Irish degree, to entitle him to be on the Irish register and to practise in Ireland. Why should a man get the degree of M.R.C.V.S. and then get on our register in an underhand way, and say &ldquo;Good-bye, I have got my qualifications and I will not pay any further fee to you&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>With regard to people who have already got the degree of M.R.C.V.S., the plea might be put up that they took out the only degree open to them at the time when they got that particular diploma; that they have attained a certain stage in veterinary science, and that consequently they are entitled to practise here.  That plea, which taken in the abstract is a fairly good one, must be met in this way, that when these negotiations were started we were impelled by the fact that the Veterinary Medical Association met twice, once in 1925 and once in 1926, and passed resolutions asking their people to regularise their position with the Royal College by voluntarily paying up money which, under the existing laws, could not be collected compulsorily. They expressed a desire to be continued in association with the Veterinary College, and stated that they had what amounted to an unanimous approval of the members who were circularised with regard to the matter.  They themselves do not regard it as a hardship that, having got the degree, they should be called upon to pay this guinea.  Later on, when we get an institution in this country, if people think fit and if it is not regarded as tricky methods or underhand practice, we will see if it is right that the degree of M.R.C.V.S. should be regarded as something entitling the possessor to an ad eundem degree.  If a man claimed that he got the degree with a view to practising for the rest of his professional life at home, then there might be some case for getting out of the payment of the guinea fee. That was not in the minds of the <Col N="2359" /> people who framed the agreement, and it would be sharp practice to deprive them of the guinea in that case.</P>
    <P>We intend the clause to give the Executive Council power to determine separate fees for those who are on both registers and those who only go on one. Therefore, it is not intended to be obligatory on all students hereafter to pay the guinea which is supposed to be collected for the general register.  It is only to be paid by people who wish to be on both registers.  As far as the other guinea is concerned, it is a movable sum according to whatever the expenditure of the Council may be. There is no intention to penalise the veterinary surgeon, whose practice is a falling one in this country and whose practice, from what I heard in the House, is likely to be a still more decreasing quantity in future.  There is no intention to penalise him for fees from which he is getting no benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what the Minister stated.  I am glad to know that the intention of the Council is to collect the fee for this general register, and then whatever is necessary for the home register afterwards. That is why the amendment is necessary.  I fixed the sum of 10/6 or whatever sum is necessary, for the first year.  Secondly, I agree with the Minister that if we had an alternative college here for qualifying veterinary surgeons for practise in the Free State, or if a veterinary surgeon were to take out the degree of M.R.C.V.S. even for practise in the Free State, the Royal College would have a claim on him for an annual fee.  I agree that there is a case for those who have taken out the degree of M.R.C.V.S., and who still continue to take it out, until an alternative college is provided.  The Minister says that as soon as the alternative college is established, then we can see that the whole of the M.R.C.V.S. degree can be taken out as ad eundem degree to practise within the Free State.  I do not know whether it is necessary to wait.  The Minister thinks that it might amount to sharp practice in regard to the people with whom he negotiated in London.  I think <Col N="2360" /> it is rather unfair to ask the present people to wait.  After all, we made up our minds by legislation before in the case of the dentists.  Men were admitted to the Dentists' Register who had no degree, and we did not say that an honorary degree or any other degree should be conferred on them in order that they would be allowed to go on the register.  We only took into consideration the fact that they had been practising dentistry.</P>
      <P>We could do exactly the same thing in the case of veterinary surgeons.  We could say that the men who had been practising veterinary surgery could continue to do so and therefore permit them to practise in the interim until a home college is set up that is going to confer degrees which will be recognised within the Free State.  I think it is rather unfair to ask these men to wait.  The Minister says that a number of the veterinary surgeons were circularised before the negotiations were started and that he got a practically unanimous reply, that they were willing to pay a guinea a year to regularise their position on the general register. That may be, but I take it that the men who were interested in that subject or interested in keeping the M.R.C.V.S. degree and keeping everything regular, were the only men who were likely to reply.  I believe the men who have no interest in the subject, who did not want to remain on the general register and did not want facilities to practise in Britain, are men who would not apply.  I think if they knew that they had to pay this fee the decision would not be so unanimous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this matter is put to a vote I would like to find out from the Minister whether he intends on the Report Stage to modify the draft of this so that it would be quite <Col N="2361" /> evident that what is intended is that there shall be a charge of not more than one guinea.  What I mean by that is that there should be a charge of one guinea until the Executive Council decides otherwise for those who want to be registered on the home register only and that for those who want to be kept on the general register there should be a further fee of one guinea.  I am not quite sure whether the Minister means that, but that is what I interpreted him to mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We also think that is what the draft means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody else is likely to agree with you. As far as I see it, the draft is inclusive of the other fee.  One of the objections I had to the Bill as a whole was that if it remained like that there was a clear inducement to all veterinary surgeons here, seeing that they had to pay two guineas fee and that they were getting an extra privilege, to get on the register whether they liked it or not.  I think that nobody would hold with the interpretation given by the Minister.  I think the interpretation is quite other than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one point.  With respect to the continuance of the fee by those who at the moment are on the general register, and have got the M.R.C.V.S. degree, I think there is a good deal of justice in what the Minister says about those who may in future take such a degree.  But I think there is no justification for it whatever if you apply it to those who have got that degree.  They are going to practise here.  The State here subsidised the affiliated college.  Fees were paid in the past to the Royal College in London, and I do not think there is any obligation whatever on the part of those who have got that qualification to continue paying a guinea to that college in the future, unless they want to be on the general register. If they are prepared to say, &ldquo;We do not want to be put on the general register, we want to be on the Irish register,&rdquo; why should they be compelled to pay a guinea a year to the foreign college?  I do not think anyone going for a degree like that had <Col N="2362" /> in mind that he was under contract with that college to pay a guinea a year to that college, even though he did not want to get on the general register.  I take it the fee of a guinea a year was to entitle him to practise in the area which was at that time controlled by the college.  That area has been diminished and we have a new area now.  Therefore, I think that while there would be justice in compelling anyone who might by that particular plan actually want to get a degree, and avail himself of a certain privilege in future, when there are other ways by which he could get his qualification, I do not think that could be held to apply to those who have got their degrees at the present moment.  With regard to the people who have been circularised, they were written to at a time when the home register was not set up.  It is only natural in that case that they should want to be associated with the particular college in which they had their degree, and also to be kept on the only register that existed, so I do not think the replies, even if there were a large number, and if they were unanimous&mdash;and the Minister indicated how many replies he got, but not the percentage&mdash;but even if we got a substantial majority to do it under present conditions, I hold it is no indication of what they would do if they knew there was a home register, and that they could get on it.  So that the great harm, or a certain amount of it, which I see in this Bill would be obviated if the interpretation the Minister has given of his intention is put down explicitly in the Bill, and secondly, if it is understood that those on the register at the present time would be entitled to go on the home register without paying any fee except the home register fee.</P>
    <P>The Minister has alluded to tricky methods.  It is precisely because I do not want to see in the future any suggestion that action taken, which would mean that this fee was to be discontinued to the British college, would be set down as being tricky that I want to see it done here and now.  This is the time to make clear the terms of the contract.  We ought <Col N="2363" /> to be quite clear about it so that there can be no accusation of bad faith in the future if it is decided here and now that it was not right that the money should be sent over to a foreign college.  I happened to get since the last debate a copy of &ldquo;The Farmer, Stock Breeder and Agricultural Gazette.&rdquo;  That is a British farmers' paper, dated March 23rd, and it has an article headed &ldquo;Save the Royal Veterinary College.&rdquo;  They want one quarter of a million pounds. They are asking the British Treasury for this money and the State has agreed to subsidise them to the extent of £150,000 provided they can get £100,000 otherwise.  They are appealing to the agricultural population in Great Britain to assist them. Now, transmitting fees unnecessarily from this country over there must appear to anybody who understands the situation to be an attempt to subsidise this college from home funds.  We have quite enough to do with our own money not to attempt the task of trying to subsidise a foreign college.</P>

We think that in subsidising the college in Ballsbridge we were doing our part for the training of the people from Ireland who got the M.R.C.V.S. degree but once we have paid for those degrees in one way in the past I do not see why we should continue paying for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In an interruption, I have just answered the point the Deputy was making.  There is no subsidy being sent to the Royal Veterinary College, which, it is stated, is in need of funds.  What we are subscribing to is the headquarters of which that is a branch&mdash;the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons&mdash;and we are only subscribing in so far as the agreement lays it down in Clause 6 (1) that there is to be paid &ldquo;the sum of one guinea in respect of every person (subject to the exception hereinafter made) who during that year or any part thereof is registered in the Irish Free State veterinary register, and is also registered in the general veterinary register, and pays to the Irish Free State Veterinary Council in respect of his registration in the Irish Free State veterinary register the annual fee payable for such registration.&rdquo;  If a man is not on the general register no guinea goes across.  The fee is being paid for something which is considered to be worth while&mdash;the holding of the M.R.C.V.S. degree.  That is all that is being done.  As to people hereafter being, say, admitted to an ad eundem degree in University College, Dublin, that can be considered, and had better be considered at that time.  Any move such as that certainly was not talked of.  I do not know how far these people may have envisaged that sort of thing happening, but as far as I know, it was not before the minds of the people who signed the agreement. What their reactions will be can be seen at the proper time.  The Deputy spoke as if there was some hardship on these people in having to continue paying a guinea.  There is no hardship. They entered into a contract with regard to the college.  They took that degree, and were subject to certain money payments.  A certain Act came along afterwards, and there is not the slightest doubt that every veterinary <Col N="2365" /> surgeon felt with regard to himself that his obligation would have been, and was likely to be, the payment of a guinea in respect of that. The only hardship is the paying of the additional sum, either 10/6 or one guinea, for being registered on the Irish Register if he wishes to do it.</P>

Supposing it is two guineas to start with for the first year: Who are the people who are going to be involved for the first year?  Really, it does not matter.  After the first year is over and the Council gets some idea what the expenditure will be, is there anything in that section which prevents the Council saying, for those who are going to be on both registers, two guineas, and for those who are only going on one, one guinea?</P>

      <P>Because we thought this exactly met the same point.  It was the draftsman's view of the proper way to get at it.  The Deputy may have a different view as to the draftsmanship from the professional people. Let us be precise about this.  The intention is the particular thing, and this can be looked into in the meantime to see whether it carries out the intention.  To make it abundantly clear we can even divide the section into two&mdash;one with regard to those on both registers with whom the agreement deals, and the other with regard to the people only going on one register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the position of the old-time veterinary surgeons in this country I sent out no circular to anybody.  The Veterinary Medical Inspection Association circularised their members and presented me with a resolution which they said to their mind represented the unanimous view of the profession. Later on, they sent me a memorial which had been circulated for signature to the veterinary profession, and which, I think, backed up that particular judgment of theirs.  That memorial asked for the adaptation of the Veterinary Acts, so that they <Col N="2367" /> would really apply to this country as before.  That was signed by about 300 members, and I do not think there are more than 300 veterinary surgeons in the country.  There is pretty good proof that the judgment of the Association was sound when you get a circular like that signed by 300 members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they not asking for a different thing&mdash;for the regularisation of the veterinary profession?  What they had in their mind when they sent out that memorial was protection for the profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to another matter which the Minister raised, I find, according to the Bill, that if a man is not registered on the home register he will not be permitted to practise here.  The Minister has some doubt as to whether such a man could practise if he was on the general register only.  Under Section 45 unregistered persons are prohibited from practising veterinary surgery or medicine. A person would be an unregistered person if not registered here and would not be allowed to practise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of interpretation.  That, I think, is the intention.  However, I want to ask this question.  Would Deputies like to have this as the situation?  That if people wanted to take out an R.C.V.S. degree and that only, they should be admitted to practise here on the same footing as those who took out an Irish degree, without going on the Irish register; in other words, that in all matters of professional misconduct and everything else there would be people with that degree practising here who would be outside the control of the Irish Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us assume that the Bill ties up every man who is entitled <Col N="2368" /> to practise here to the Irish Register. The other situation in order to save expense would be this: That you would say: &ldquo;If you want to be a member of the R.C.V.S. and be entitled to practise in this country, we will amend the legislation so that you would be deemed to be a registered person if you are on the General Register although not on the Irish Register.&rdquo;  In that way, such a person would only pay the veterinary college across the water and would pay nothing here.  Is it considered desirable that we should have in this country persons practising in that special way, not subject to the control of the Irish Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am altogether against that.  That is why I wanted to show the Minister that he was wrong even in suggesting that a man should be on the General Register and practise here without being on the home register.  I think he should be on the home register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about saving expense.  The people to whom we want to save expense are those practising here who do not want to be on the General Register.  I have in mind particularly those who have got the M.R.C.V.S. degree at present. They want to get on the home register and when they are on the home register and paying the home fee, if they do not want to get on the general register we see no reason why a fee should be taken from them.  That was our objection to what appeared to be an inclusive fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to be clear about the contract, at least as to the Minister's position in respect to it.  I do not believe that those who went up for the M.R.C.V.S. degree entered into a contract to pay an annual sum of a guinea.  To my mind they paid the guinea fee for permission to practise by being on the register.  That was for the privilege of being on the British register.  A home register is now being set up, and why should they have to pay that continuing fee to the British college, and, in addition to that, have to pay their home fee?  We think that they ought to be admitted to the Irish register from the time it is formed, <Col N="2369" /> and that thereafter they should be compelled only to pay the Irish fee.  If they want to be put on the British register, let them pay the additional fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again may I explain the machinery of it?  As to the contractual relationship that the students in the old days undertook by going for the M.R.C.V.S. examination, up to a certain date there was no obligation with regard to an annual fee.  There is a mixed situation in this country by reason of the change over.  Take the corresponding men in Scotland.  Certainly, when the new legislation was passed these men took on the obligation of paying an annual fee.  What is the annual fee for?  It is to pay the expenses of the examination, because this Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons has no money, any more than the Royal Veterinary College.  It is like a federated body of the National University.  Its main duty is to regularise examinations.  There is expenditure in connection with these, and the fees are entirely for the purpose of paying the expenses of the examinations. If a certain amount of money which is counted on as coming from this country does not come from it, then the new people from this time on who will be taking out their degree will probably have to pay not a fee of two guineas, but probably five guineas. They will be bearing the expenses of the others.  We thought it better to spread it over the whole body, particularly as 300 of them&mdash;probably the whole of them&mdash;have requested that we should put them back on the old footing with the Veterinary College. There is no money being taken from this country that is not expended again in connection with these examinations. That was inquired into closely, and the expenses of the examinations will run to at least £300 per year.  They will not collect that from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the examination fees as well.  Students who are going up will pay four fees of £5 and I do not know whether there is an additional final fee.  It will amount altogether to between £20 and £30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few remarks with regard to Section 30. This section deals with the persons entitled to be registered at the establishment of the register.  It embraces the two classes of persons registered in the general register.  One class includes every person who is registered in the General Veterinary Register immediately before the establishment of the register, and who is then resident in Saorstát Eireann. <Col N="2373" /> That is the class we have been discussing. They evidently go automatically on the register when it is established here.  I think in another section of the Bill it is stated that, even though the General Council in Britain may remove a man from the General Register, that is no reason why our Council should remove him from our register.  Under this Bill we would be legally entitled to adopt men with the M.R.C.V.S. degree on our register, and if the General Council in Britain tried to remove them because they did not pay fees or for some other reason, we could still keep them on without any change in the law.  Does the Minister agree with that?</P>

      <P>Section 30 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
      <P>(2)  No person whose name shall have been erased from the register by the Council on account of his having been convicted of treason or a felony, misdemeanour, crime or offence, or on account of failure to pay an annual fee, or on account of his having been adjudged guilty of conduct disgraceful to him in a professional respect, shall be entitled to have his name restored to the register under this section solely by reason of his being registered in the general veterinary register.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 41, to delete the words &ldquo;treason or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is hardly necessary for me to state the reasons why I put down this amendment, because this matter was argued before on the Committee Stage of the Dentists Bill, and it was decided by a vote of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Bill is concerned the words are exactly in the same sense as in the Dentists Bill.  It is true that they are in the agreement that governs this Bill, and they were not in the agreement that governs the Dentists Bill.  The Minister stated on the last day that he introduced treason into the Bill in order to cover cases where a person might be on the general register, might get removed from our register on the grounds of treason, and might afterwards try to come back to our register through the general register.  I find on looking up the agreement that that is true.  That is how treason applies in the agreement. The point that Deputy Fahy made was that treason was introduced into this agreement for the first time; it was not in the dentists' agreement or the medical agreement.  He asked the Minister what was the necessity for introducing it, and the Minister said: &ldquo;Where is treason in the agreement?&rdquo; This is the Official Report of what was said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Fahy: It is in the implementing of it, and therefore it was deliberately introduced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: There is nothing in the Bill except what is in the agreement.&rdquo;</P>

I gave as an instance that treason was included and the Minister evidently did not know it was included; he denied it was contained in the agreement.  As far as this particular amendment is concerned, we are dealing with exactly the same case as in the Dentists Bill, but in the agreement there was a difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we might as well get down to what we mean with regard to treason on this clause, as on any other clause.  The name will be erased from the register if a person is convicted of treason, felony, misdemeanour or crime.  Our objection at the time an amendment was introduced on the Dentists Bill was that the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; was used and the present Government had included far too wide a range of offences, in our opinion, under the heading of treason.  We felt that under the Dentists Bill advantage might be taken certainly more of a political opponent than of a criminal, and the same holds here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy apparently has not understood the meaning of this section, although he has put down an amendment to it.  What this section amounts to is, if a person has his name removed from the register here for treason we say that man is not going to go to England, assert his right to get on the general register there and come back here by reason of his being on the general register only.  Apparently the Deputy wants to achieve that the only man who can assert his title to the general register in order to secure admission to the Free State register after having been put off the Free State register is the person who has been convicted of treason.  In other words, the treasonably convicted person is going through an English agency to get back to the Irish register.  That is a peculiar situation for the Deputy to find himself in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to explain it.  This clause states: &ldquo;No person whose name has been erased by the council from the register&rdquo;&mdash; that is, from the home register by the home council&mdash;&ldquo;on account of his having been convicted of treason or a felony, misdemeanour, crime or offence or on account of failure to pay an annual fee or on account of his having been judged guilty of conduct disgraceful to him in a professional respect, shall be entitled to have his name restored.&rdquo;  Let us drop the words &ldquo;treason or.&rdquo;  The sense of it is this, if a man has been erased for any reason other than treason he shall not be entitled to come back by reason of his position on the general register. By the ordinary legal interpretation of these documents, having excluded everything else, you bring this into the special position that the only man who could assert his right through the general register, is the man who had been struck off the Irish register for treason, so you would have an Irish court finding a man guilty of treason, and an Irish council striking him off, <Col N="2378" /> and the only man who could get back would be the man committed for treason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reference to a later section, and the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; occurs in a later section where it is one of the offences.  If, for instance, that section were to be altered when we had passed this one, we could not get back to this one again.  As this is to be consequential to the passing of Section 34, it is obvious that this is the time to deal with the whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  That is not the way out of this.  What does the Deputy do?  He does not want treason regarded as an offence entitling a man to be struck off the register.  Therefore the amendment is going to mean taking &ldquo;treason&rdquo; out of Section 34.  If that is done, what is the effect of leaving &ldquo;treason&rdquo; in this?  There would be no effect, because a man cannot be put off for treason if the Deputy carries his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy does not clearly know what that particular amendment aims at.  Is there any reason why we should not prohibit a man, struck off for various offences in this country, asserting his right to the general register and through that asserting his right to the Irish register? The Deputies opposite want to strike out the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; and that would bring about the effect I have stated that the only person who can assert that right would be the man found guilty of treason in this country and after an Irish council found it proper to strike him off the register here.  The felony man would be prohibited but the treasonable man would not.  Deputy Ryan has talked of the wide range of offences covered in this country by treason.  I would like to know what offences he is aiming at. This is the foundation of his argument. There are many things here entitling people to work out any political vendetta of their own.  In the discussion we have had every point from a court sentencing a man to death down to the small point of striking him off the register for professional <Col N="2379" /> misconduct, but the Deputy did not go into what offences he thinks should be covered by the word &ldquo;treason.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's rule of interpretation will not apply if the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; does not occur in Section 34.  There is no quibbling whatever about it; it will not apply. I am quite willing to admit that if &ldquo;treason&rdquo; were knocked out here and left in in Section 34, then the argument of the Minister would hold, but as the intention is to wipe it out everywhere it occurs, for the reasons Deputy Ryan indicated, this is the first place we meet it in the Bill and that is why the amendment is put in here to meet it in this case, because the rules of interpretation which the Minister refers to would not apply to the persons who are not mentioned at all in the Bill.  Then it would not apply in this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that an amendment were duly tabled to Clause 34 and the difficulty which the Minister has suggested with regard to the present amendment were thereby removed I still think that Deputy Ryan has not placed fully before the House his real intention and the import and effect of this amendment. There has been loose talking, if I may put it so, with regard to the word &ldquo;treason.&rdquo;  It has been suggested, in fact, that it is something the Minister might define and the purpose of this amendment is to prevent any person being penalised who was in any way connected with an offence which some people might term of a quasi political nature.  Treason is perfectly clearly defined in the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925.  It partakes of two different characters.  It is levying war against Saorstát Eireann or attempting, by force of arms, to overthrow the lawful Government established in accordance with the Constitution here.  I do not know if Deputy Ryan seriously suggests to this House that a person who is convicted of one or other of these offences should receive any, as it were, preferential treatment over ordinary persons.  He did not fully <Col N="2380" /> understand and further I am sure it is a matter which will be of considerable gratification to this House if Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment as it stands were carried it would penalise for once and for all a person who by force of arms attempted to overawe a Minister. That is felony, not treason.  It would also penalise effectively any person engaged in military manoevres.  That is also a felony.  It would penalise effectively for good and for all a person who was merely engaged in the innocent pastime of the maintenance of a military force not recognised by law.  That is a misdemeanour.  So that the net effect of this amendment is that the person who wages war against Saorstát Eireann or a person who by force of arms attempts to upset the Government established in accordance with the Constitution is to get preferential treatment over the person who simply maintains a military force, if he is unfortunate enough to be detected in it.  The only reason I can see in favour of the amendment is that the person who, as it were, was preparing for a full attack on the life of this State and is foolish enough to be detected should be punished for all time, but the gentleman who is not detected and who succeeds in having a full-blooded war against this State is to receive preferential treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>I must again insist on my point, that this amendment has not been attended to.  Deputy de Valera's attempt to get Deputy Dr. Ryan out of his mistake has not been successful either.  Deputy Ryan, when asked what the amendment intended <Col N="2381" /> to do, replied that his aim was to prevent a man being struck off the register for treason, and that he was doing it under this section.  He is not doing it, and no quibbling will make him pretend he is.  Deputy Finlay has given us the other side of this question. Deputy Ryan does not want to have any of the penalties imposed on felonious people taken away.  The man who is treasonable is to get preferential treatment.  I suggest that Deputy Gorey's statement gives the proper line of thought of the Deputies opposite.  Let them clear their minds on the present situation.  Supposing you had in five years' time a Labour Government here, and that Deputy Lemass had been able to make a deal with them to become as big wheat fiends as himself, and get the whole country over to wheat.  Suppose the live stock people, led by the veterinary surgeons, raised an armed rebellion, would that prove to the wheat-affected Government that it was a proper thing that these people should get preferential treatment, simply because they rose in force of arms instead of trying to overawe individual Ministers?  If the Deputies <Col N="2382" /> opposite would look a little bit to the future, they might get a proper appreciation of the need for imposing penalties on people treasonably affected.</P>
