      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the provisions of Sections 14, 15 and 21 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, he will state whether he has given any indication to the Electricity Supply Board of the periods intended to be fixed by him for repayment in respect of advances made from the Central Fund to the Shannon Power Development Fund and to the Electricity Supply Board respectively; and, if so, to state the respective periods of years thus indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was indicated to the Electricity Supply Board that the periods which I would propose for the repayment of advances from the Central Fund would be:&mdash;For Shannon works 40 years, board's works 20 years, working capital, etc., 20 years, not commencing before 1st April, 1933.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state when it is proposed to complete the repayments of the Dáil Loan (Internal) 1919-1920, to subscribers in the Achonry district, in the former Parliamentary Constituency of South Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the subscribers to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-20, in the Achonry district have already been repaid.  In the remaining cases, the claimants have not furnished satisfactory evidence in <Col N="2102" /> support of their claims.  The rate at which progress will be made in disposing of these must necessarily depend, to a large extent, on the parties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that over three years ago I handed in to his Department applications duly vouched by collectors from practically every subscriber in the Achonry district, and that while a good many of them have been paid, there are a number of claims still outstanding although they were handed in at the same time and vouched in the same way as the others?  Is the Minister prepared to instruct his officials to expedite repayment in the remaining cases in this district?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is relatively a very small proportion remaining.  I could not give the Deputy the exact figures, but, I think, perhaps ten per cent. or a little over remain to be dealt with.  Some of these are held up, for instance, in nine cases because the persons who made the loan have died, and certain difficulties have arisen. The matter is being dealt with as rapidly as possible, and only a relatively small number remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if any negotiations have taken place between his Department and the Government of Northern Ireland with a view to facilitating the drainage of the River Erne, and if he is prepared to state what is the attitude of the Northern Government towards the scheme; also, will he state if the minor schemes between the two Governments will be held up contingent on an agreement being arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have written to the Government of Northern Ireland informing them that it is proposed to proceed with the exhibition and final investigation of a scheme for the drainage of the River Erne from Wateraghy to Belturbet.  A reply has not yet been received from the Northern Ireland authorities, but it is not anticipated that they will adopt an <Col N="2103" /> antagonistic attitude.  It is not clear to what the Deputy refers in the last sentence of his question, but I may state that the river Erne scheme is being considered solely on its own merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House what the scheme mentioned is?  Is it the larger scheme for the drainage of the lakes or the banking scheme of the rivers at the head?  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that very important considerations arise in respect of the lower end, at the Free State outlet of these lakes where mismanagement of the drainage would interfere very seriously with fisheries and mill owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he would consider the erection of an automatic stamp machine in Stranorlar, County Donegal, in view of the fact that no office exists there for the convenience of 800 inhabitants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Automatic stamp-vending machines are erected only on post office premises where officials are available to give them the attention they require, and it would consequently not be practicable to provide such a machine at Stranorlar.  Stamps can at present be obtained from the postman who serves the district, and if further facilities for the purchase of stamps be needed the question of issuing a licence for the sale of stamps to any suitable applicant will be favourably considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that it entails hardship on the people of Stranorlar to have to go to Ballybofey for stamps? Is he prepared to give effect to the last part of his answer by giving a licence to someone in Stranorlar to sell stamps?  By doing so it would facilitate the people of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am given to understand that the centre of Stranorlar is only 550 yards from Ballybofey.  The question of giving a licence to someone in Stranorlar will be favourably considered if we get an application from some person for a licence to sell stamps.  We could not give a licence to a publican.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that Patrick Hagan, Tamlet, Monaghan, was sentenced in July, 1927, to three years' detention in Clonmel Borstal Institution; that after fourteen months' detention he was allowed out on licence to work for Mrs. McEnery, Mortlestown, Cahir, County Tipperary, at the rate of 5s. per week; whether he has been compelled to continue in this lady's employment at the reduced rate of 4s. per week; whether he will state the legal authority for Hagan's further detention after the expiration of this three years' sentence; and whether the Minister is aware that this boy could be employed at the rate of 36/- per week in his own native district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Patrick Hagan, a native of <Col N="2105" /> Corby Rock, Tamlet, Co. Monaghan, was convicted at the Circuit Court sittings in Monaghan on the 27th July, 1928, of the larceny of the lock of a tabernacle and malicious destruction of a work of art in St. Macartan's Cathedral and sentenced to three years' detention in the Borstal Institution.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, and on the recommendation of the Borstal Association, Hagan was discharged on licence under the supervision of the Borstal Association on the 10th May, 1930, and placed in the employment of Mr. F. McEnery, Mortlestown, Cahir, Co. Tipperary, on the latter undertaking to give him constant employment and keep him under friendly supervision.  Mr. McEnery had informed the association that he would pay Hagan 5s. per week at the commencement of his employment in addition to providing him with board and lodging and this they considered satisfactory.</P>
      <P>On the 14th September last, Hagan left Mr. McEnery's employment and took up employment with another local farmer on the same conditions.  Some time later, he left this second employer without the knowledge of the Governor, the Borstal Association or my Department, and it is learned that he returned to his former employer who, while not requiring his services, agreed in the circumstances to take him back on a reduced scale of wages which Hagan was glad to accept.</P>
      <P>Hagan's sentence of three years' detention expired on the 26th July, 1931.  He has not been in detention since his release on licence on the 10th May, 1930.</P>
      <P>There is no information to show that an offer of employment at 36s. per week was made by any person on Hagan's behalf at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if it would be in accordance with the licence to transfer this boy to his own parents or if, under the terms of the licence, the person in whose employment he is at present has power to license him out to anybody else in any part of the Saorstát?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The boy is under the supervision of the Borstal Association.  The Borstal Association do not consider that it would be advisable for him to go back to Monaghan, nor does he himself want to go.  He committed a certain crime there and he does not want to go back and face his neighbours.  His parents evidently did not exercise much supervision over him.  The Borstal Association is watching over his welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what is the objection, if any, to allowing this boy to return to his own parents and will he further state if representations have been made to his Department by the administrator of the parish that this boy may be returned to the supervision of his parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question of which the Deputy has given me no notice.  So far as I know, no such representations reached my Department.  It is quite possible that they have, but so far as I know they have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If representations are made to the Minister's Department by the local clergy that it is desirable that this boy should be returned to assist in earning some money to support his disabled father&mdash;he is a one-armed man&mdash;will he favourably consider them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Borstal Association, who have to consider the future welfare of the boy.  The boy's parents obviously did not look after him, and it is probably better for him to be where he is now under the supervision of the Association.  What we have to look at is the future of the boy and the making of the boy a good citizen rather than the question of support of his parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. F. McEnery, to whom this boy is licensed, is the same age as the boy himself, that Mr. McEnery, senr., is long since deceased and that his widow is in charge of this boy?  Does he consider that the retaining of this <Col N="2107" /> boy of 20 years of age at the rate of 4s. per week now that his sentence is expired is fair to his parents?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the Borstal Association exercise supervision over this boy as well in Monaghan as in Tipperary?  Could he not be supervised by the local clergy and the Guards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been called to the report in the Press on the 11th instant of the remarks of the Circuit Court Judge at Skibbereen on the 10th instant, in his decision in an action against a national school teacher for cruelty in punishing a girl of 10 years of age, a pupil in his school, where the judge, having stated that the punishment in question was a most wicked thing, had to dismiss the action, in view of decisions in the High Court in such matters; whether the Minister would state what were those decisions; and further, whether, if the law in the matter of the administration of corporal punishment is not in conformity with his policy, he will take steps to have the law amended to render such punishment illegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to a newspaper report of the case referred to and to the comments of the judge.</P>
      <P>The present policy of my Department with regard to corporal punishment in national schools is indicated in the official regulations on the subject.  The regulations, in the modified form, of which I have recently approved, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Corporal punishment should be administered only for grave transgression.</P>
      <P>(2) The principal teacher, or another member of the staff authorised by him, should inflict the corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>(3) Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of inflicting the corporal punishment.  The boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill-treatment is absolutely forbidden, and will be visited with severe penalties.</P>
      <P>(4) No teacher should carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment.</P>
      <P>(5) Frequent recourse to corporal punishment will be considered by the Department as indicating bad tone and ineffective discipline.</P>
      <P>My Department takes disciplinary action where it is found that the regulations have been violated.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the learned judge made, on the occasion, the statements attributed to him in the report, I am not in a position to state the decisions of the High Court which he had in mind.  I am aware that decrees have been made against individual teachers for unreasonable punishment.  In the circumstances, I see no reason for amendment of the law as suggested in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt the propriety of my approaching the judge to ask the grounds upon which he based his decision.  It seems to me that it would be rather questioning the <Col N="2109" /> decision of the judge, and therefore I do not feel at liberty to take the step suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Celia, Ltd., have not made any arrangements to purchase current for traction purposes, and therefore parts (5) and (6) of the question do not arise.</P>
      <P>In order to ascertain the possibility of preparing the information requested in parts (1) and (3), it would be necessary to carry out a lengthy investigation of old records.</P>
      <P>The estimated loadfactor requested in part (2) cannot be determined until a decision has been reached concerning the number and frequency of the trains.  This decision may not be reached for some time.</P>
      <P>The loadfactor for the Dublin United Tramways Company supply, which is the chief traction load in Dublin, is about 47 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You might get a loadfactor for a single run by segregating items in connection with the run from the general supply to Inchicore, but that would take a lot of doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked the question was because of the possibility of the Minister not being able to give the estimated loadfactor for a particular period, but surely the Minister could get the ratio between the maximum current available at any given time and the amount that would be taken for a particular run, and on that basis give the loadfactor.</P>

The Minister does know what the loadfactor is for the Tramway Co. and has given a figure.  I want to know what the other loadfactor will be so that I can know what the total loadfactor will be to see what other current will be available.</P>

He is now talking about trains which are run on the Bray line.  That matter is very much in the future. The answer to that part of the question will depend upon the frequency of the service and the number of trains to be run.  No decision has been taken on that yet.</P>

There is no difficulty in that.  The Minister who is usually so helpful in his answers to many of my questions wants now to know beforehand what I am getting at when I ask a question. If he would say that he would be a little more polite in the future and a little more anxious to give information I would write to him and ask him for those particulars and what he is aiming at.

      <P>I just wish to call attention to the point that amongst the <Col N="2118" /> Acts amended are the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1930.  These Acts were continued by the Expiring Laws Bill passed last week.  In the first place, is the definition right there? Secondly, has the Minister considered the point I raised that if it was intended that the Acts should remain in operation for a longer period than one year they should be made permanent by this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as that is concerned, for the purposes of this Bill there is no necessity to make it a permanent Act, and there may have been certain objections to doing it.  I have not gone into the matter, but it creates no definite difficulty except that the Expiring Laws Bill has to include it every year.  As I said, this Act is the precursor of a codifying Bill, and the only difficulty that will arise is that the Labourers Acts must be continued in the Expiring Laws Bill until such time as they are included in the Codified Housing Bill.

      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of providing accommodation for persons displaced by the demolition of buildings under a clearance order the local authority may purchase by a compulsory purchase order any habitable house which has been vacant for a period of not less than three months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think in many places in Ireland at the moment the state of affairs prevails that I have in mind, but in case it does and houses are closed down for some selfish reasons as far as the landlords are concerned, I think the Minister should give the local authorities power to take them over and to use them.

      <P>Amendments 8 and 9 are really bound up together, and deal with the same thing.  The trouble is that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the second line of the section, it is feared, would have the effect of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  We were told here a few evenings ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that &ldquo;may&rdquo; when applied to a local body has the effect of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and it is felt that if &ldquo;may&rdquo; there in fact meant &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; it would make for delay, because the local authority might feel bound to serve that notice on persons other than the person in actual control, and that in that way it would lead to a great deal of delay to find out who those persons were.  I propose to delete the sub-section altogether.  Deputy Corish suggests that &ldquo;may at their discretion&rdquo; would meet the position.  The difficulty we have in mind is if &ldquo;may&rdquo; is mandatory it would make for a good deal of delay in finding out those people who may have an interest or who may be entitled to serve a notice.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the sub-section is that where there are a chain of owners it is desirable in so far as they may be conveniently found that they will all be advised as to the steps that are being taken with regard to an unhealthy house, because the person who is immediately in control of the house might not be prepared to suit the local authority's wishes, and the local authority might be driven into the position of taking action itself, whereas the person next or second next in the chain, if advised as to what was taking place with regard to the dwelling, might approach those people closer up in ownership, and might come to an accommodation by which the immediate owner might part with his interest to the other owner, and that local owner might meet the local authorities in their wishes, so that I think it would be undesirable to take that sub-section out.</P>

      <P>This section provides that <Col N="2127" /> the local authority shall serve certain notices on owners requiring them to do certain repairs and in the following section power is given to them to do those repairs themselves if the owner does not himself take action.  It has been suggested to me that a difficulty might arise which is not provided for here.  We will assume that the owner is willing to do it but he finds it impossible to get rid of the people who are in occupation.  Even one tenant in a block of dwellings may refuse to go out.  It may be that there is no other accommodation provided for him.  It is quite possible that that difficulty is provided for by previous Acts.  I only put it to the Minister that there is such a possibility and I would be very glad if he would give an explanation.</P>

      <P>I think there should be some stipulation that the same tenant ought to get back.  I have a case in mind where notice was served by the sanitary authority upon a landlord to get certain repairs carried out.  He immediately gave the person in the house notice to quit, and he brought back another person at a higher rent. There ought to be something to safeguard the tenants in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is in this Bill, and perhaps in any Act, power to make a tenant vacate a building in order that the owner might repair it.  This work contemplates very close touch with the local authority.  If you pass a law that will enable an owner to clear out a tenant while he is carrying out repairs and put on the owner the onus of bringing back that tenant at the same rent, I do not know whether that would be a satisfactory type of legislation.  I would be inclined to leave it to the local authority, who understand the spirit of the Rent Restriction Act as applied to the house.  I would leave it to co-operation between the local authorities and the owners of houses <Col N="2128" /> to make the necessary arrangements to facilitate the repairs in these unhealthy dwellings.  I think it will be found that the local authority would leave nothing undone to help owners who are entering in a spirit of co-operation into the work of putting unhealthy houses into a satisfactory condition.  I would sooner enter into a discussion with the local authorities as to what is involved in the suggestion of Deputy Law than to introduce a statute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The repairs would need to be very extensive before it would be necessary to put a tenant out.  It would not be unreasonable for a landlord if he did do extensive repairs to take advantage of the Rent Restrictions Act to get the amount that he is entitled to.  What I want to guard against is this: If it is necessary, and a whole lot of landlords may consider it necessary, to put a tenant out, the owner should not be permitted to charge over and above what he is entitled to charge under the Rent Restrictions Act.  In nineteen cases out of twenty, you will find people prepared to pay 100 and 150 per cent. more rent than a landlord is entitled to get.  They are so anxious to get houses that they are not prepared to take advantage of their powers under the Rent Restrictions Act.  I want to guard against that sort of thing.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Any such expenses may be recovered in a summary manner as a civil debt by the local authority from the occupier or occupiers for the time being of the house in respect of which the expenses were incurred and the person having control of the house shall allow such occupier to deduct any money which he pays under this enactment out of the rent from time to time becoming due out of the house or the part of same occupied by him, as if the same had been actually paid to such person having control as part of such rent: Provided that no such occupier shall be required to pay any further sum than the amount of rent for the time being due from him, or which, after demand of such expenses from such occupier, and after notice not to pay the person in control of the house any rent without first deducting the <Col N="2130" /> amount of such expenses, becomes payable by such occupier, unless he refuses, on application to him by the local authority, truly to disclose the amount of his rent and the name and address of the person to whom such rent is payable; but the burden of proof that the sum demanded from any such occupier is greater than the rent due by him at the time of such notice, or which has since accrued shall lie on such occupier: Provided also that in case any house or part of same in respect of which any such expenses were incurred becomes vacant before the whole of such expenses shall have been discharged the local authority may make a letting or lettings of the same for a period or periods and at a rent or rents not less favourable to the tenant or tenants than those of the former letting or lettings.</P>
    <P>The local authority shall during the whole time they are in receipt of the rents of the occupier or occupiers of any house under this enactment maintain the same in a sanitary condition in accordance with the requirements of any statute or by-laws in force in relation to same, and the expenses incurred by the local authority in that behalf shall be added to the expenses recoverable under this section, and shall be recovered as part of same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment has been suggested by the City Manager and the law agent. They are of opinion that while the provisions in Section 20 are valuable, in practice they may be proved, to some extent at any rate, unworkable.  It will be necessary to have arrangements such as are suggested in this amendment whereby the recoupment can be obtained from the occupier of the premises. I do not know whether the Minister has seen the statement sent around by the City Manager and the law agent, dated 18th November.  If he has not, perhaps I will be permitted to read it.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement.  We have had discussions both with the City Manager and the law agent, and amendment 11 is intended to meet the purpose the City <Col N="2131" /> Manager has in mind.  It gives the local authority power to require that rents will be paid over to it until such time as the amount is fully repaid; that is, having got a decision that certain moneys are due to them from the owner, the local authority can get the amounts paid over.  The main objection to the section as it stood was that it was thought a separate application would have to be made for every week's rent.  Amendment 11 avoids that; and amendment 12 gives the local authority power to keep tenants in a place if the owner, for any reason, does not do so.  It enables the local authority to rent any section of a house that becomes vacant after suitable notice of twenty-one days has been given to the owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 15:</P>
      <P>Before Section 28 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) It shall be the duty of every local authority to consider the housing conditions in their area and the needs of the area with respect to the provision of further housing accommodation for the working classes and for that purpose to review the information which has been brought to their notice by the medical officer of health or as a result of inspections and surveys previously carried out or otherwise and as often as occasion arises or within three months after notice has been given to them by the Minister, to prepare and submit to the Minister proposals for the provision of new houses for the working classes, distinguishing those houses which the local authority propose to provide for the purpose of rendering accommodation available for persons to be displaced by, or in consequence of, action taken by the authority under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) In the year 1932 and in each fifth succeeding year the council of <Col N="2135" /> every county borough or other urban district which for the time being contains according to the latest published census returns a population of more than five thousand shall furnish to the Minister, in addition to any proposals submitted by them under the last preceding sub-section, a general statement of the measures which they propose to take during the five next succeeding years for dealing with housing conditions in their area and the provision of further housing accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is taken practically bodily from the British Housing Act of 1930.  I was looking through that measure and comparing it with the Bill now before us, and I notice that practically all this Bill might be said &mdash; of course with amendments &mdash; to have been taken bodily from the British Housing Act of last year.  I thought it rather surprising that the Minister did not include this section as well.  I think there are very useful powers contained in it, and that it would be an advantage to the Department to have returns of that kind so as to be able to see the progress made over a period of years. It would enable the Department to take a census of the number of unhealthy houses and the number of houses requiring to be erected in cities and towns.  I think the powers would be valuable, and they would help to make certain that the Minister and the Department would be fully aware of the exact circumstances in regard to the housing of the people in the towns and cities.  It would also afford opportunities of bringing housing conditions directly under the notice of local authorities and officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Housing Act of 1919, Sections 3 and 4, it is incumbent on local authorities to proceed somewhat on the lines suggested in the Deputy's amendment.  In addition to that, Section 27 of the present Bill makes it the duty of every local authority to cause an inspection of their districts from time to time with a view to ascertaining whether any dwelling-house is unfit for human habitation, and they will have to comply <Col N="2136" /> with such regulations and keep such records as the Minister may prescribe. Under Section 42 we provide that if it appears to the Minister that owing to a density of population, or any other reason, it is expedient to inquire into the circumstances of any area, the Minister may require the local authority to make a report.  It seems to me that we have all the necessary powers that we require under these provisions in order to meet what the Deputy has in mind.</P>
      <P>I would rather hesitate to get into a position in which in 1932 and every fifth succeeding year we would have a big volume of statistics coming into the office all at one time.  I think with the responsibility on the Department of seeing that the local authorities get systematically after their schemes, we can work in a more satisfactory way.  I would be against getting into a routine that would bring a huge volume of statistics down on top of us every fifth year, building us, perhaps, to the more detailed problems which can be taken one by one and which will be taken one by one, not only by the local authorities but by ourselves.  I submit to the Deputy that we have here all the powers that will enable us to do everything he wants.  The Minister has power to make regulations requiring local authorities to keep necessary records up to date.  We have power to see that they will envisage their problems as a whole and make the necessary plans to deal with them.  We have power to make them do so explicitly wherever in our opinion there has been failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get into the position that there is a serious housing problem that the local authority will not deal with, no statutory provisions that we might have would help us really effectively to get after that, and I would sooner in these circumstances operate the powers of dissolving the local authority that was not attending to its statutory duties and putting in a Commissioner or a Commission to <Col N="2137" /> deal with the matter.  Anything else would only mean friction, want of economy in facing a problem, want of efficiency in envisaging it and carrying it out.  While I do not at all see anything like that, I can see dangers. If a local authority, having an obligation under the Housing Act of 1919, fails to carry out that obligation, we can mandamus them to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment, under the Labourers' Cottages Acts, we can put in a commissioner without disturbing the local sanitary authority from its ordinary sphere of duties.  I think we could put in, for the specific purpose of dealing with housing under the Labourers Acts, a commissioner to carry out the scheme and then charge that scheme to the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point.  He has talked about superseding a local authority which fails in its duty.  As far as housing is concerned, the local authority has certain powers for the purpose of dealing with it.  I do not think it is under any direct statutory obligation to provide proper housing accommodation in its area.  I agree that Deputy O'Kelly's amendment does not provide any such obligation. But it does say that the housing authority shall review the position in its area, and, when the Minister requires it, it should state what it proposes to do in the way of housing for the working classes.  That would enable the force of public opinion to operate on the members of the council.</P>

      <P>Section 27 and Section 42 provide ample facilities for finding out the position as to housing in the area, but Deputy O'Kelly's amendment suggests that in addition to these sections it should be incumbent on the housing authorities to furnish the Minister with a statement as to the plans for dealing with the condition of <Col N="2138" /> housing in the district, so that the Minister will know if the local housing authority has met its obligation in that respect, and so, too, that the public in the district itself will have the required information.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's own section is stronger than the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Kelly.  The section in the Bill says that it shall be the duty of the local authority to cause an inspection of its district.  I take it under Section 27 the Minister decides when the time is to be.  That section makes it mandatory to supply that information.  The section says &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the local authority and every officer of the local authority to comply with such regulations, and to keep such records as the Minister may prescribe.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It would strengthen the Minister's hands and the hands of the Department, and it would help to keep the position before the public if this <Col N="2139" /> amendment were passed.  The amendment makes it mandatory on the housing authority.  The Minister is taking powers under Sections 27 and 42 to get certain information as and when the spirit moves him.  The spirit might not move some Ministers very often.  They might not be anxious for additional work.  The Department might think they had enough work on hands, but this amendment would make it mandatory that, at least every five years, to supply returns and detailed reports on the housing proposals during the five next succeeding years, as to what was to be done in certain areas; and these proposals would be sent to the Minister's Department. In my humble opinion that would be an advantage.</P>

      <P>I shudder as to the possibilities one can envisage here from the point of view of the Department. I do not know whether we are to carry out every fifth year something like the ten year census such as was carried out in 1926.  We have a volume there dealing with housing.  I can see a pile of statistics and figures coming in on top of the Department dealing with every sanitary area in the country, coming into a place where there are already a terrible lot of papers and not enough waste paper baskets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to urban areas.  I am also afraid that to ask the Department to sit down facing such a load of statistics and passing them in review would result in blinding them and interfering with the work in getting on with the housing question area by area.  I am afraid that the figures and papers involved would really only blind us to the work that we should be getting through month after month and year after year.  Deputies should remember that it is already in the Minister's power to ask for a scheme.  Under the Housing Act of 1929, which I say is the foundation of the powers that we have here, it is the duty of the local authority of every <Col N="2140" /> urban district or town to consider the needs of that district or town with respect to the provision of houses for the working classes.  It is their duty to prepare and submit schemes for the exercise of their powers.  The schemes shall specify the approximate number of houses, the nature of such houses, the amount of land required and the time necessary to carry the scheme into effect.  We are providing our own way for getting information.  The local authority has already as its duty the submitting of a scheme when asked for a scheme, so that we there really cover the point that the Deputy is concerned about in this amendment. It is really that we want in a practical way to approach the problem, to deal, in a step by step way, with the general problem of each area, rather than have a five years' review.</P>

I should like, however, to say, in reply to the Minister's statement where he talks of showers of statistics being fired at the heads of the Department, that there is nothing in the amendment asking for such.  It asks for a general statement of the measures which the housing authority is to take during the following five years.  There is nothing about statistics in that at all.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that a landlord shall keep a house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. I cannot understand why that should only apply to houses in which the contract is entered into after the passing of the Act.  Why should not that apply to houses where the contract is entered into before or after the passing of the Act?  It seems to me only reasonable that the obligation should be on the landlord.  To my mind there is a danger that by putting it in this way and applying it to contracts entered into after the passing of the Act, there will be an assumption that it does not apply to houses where the contract is entered into before that, although there is undoubtedly and ought to be an implication.  I do not know whether it is already the law, but it is implied, in any case, that the obligation already rested on the landlord.  The fact that a tenant rents a house to live in would mean that there was an obligation on the landlord to keep it in a habitable state for him.  Objection might be made to making this retrospective, but <Col N="2142" /> we have many precedents in this House for doing that.  In any case, it seems to me that that is a condition which ought to apply in the case of every rented house.</P>

      <P>I am wondering is there a weakness in the last lines of the section and is there a danger that they might lower the standard of housing in a particular area.  There may be an area where the by-laws have been disregarded or neglected and not put into operation and in that way the general standard of housing accommodation may have fallen rather low. That would have to be taken into account in deciding whether or not a house is fit for human habitation.  You might have the position that in Ballinasloe a house would be deemed to be fit for human habitation which would be condemned in Mullingar.  I think there is that possibility in setting out here that the general standard of housing accommodation for the working classes in such a district will be taken into account.  There is a possibility that where all the houses are bad a house that in another district would be deemed to be unfit for human habitation would be accepted as being fit for human habitation just because the other houses were almost equally bad.</P>

      <P>I take it the general purpose is to limit the discretion of the local authority in determining whether a house is fit for human habitation. If the section were deleted would it mean that it would be at the absolute discretion of the local authority to say whether a particular house or a number of houses was unfit for human habitation?  If so, I think the section should be deleted.</P>

      <P>I think that it is a reasonable indication to local authorities in the case, say, of a particular house that is proposed to be condemned that it puts a kind of limit on their requiring the owner to go above a particular standard, if they <Col N="2144" /> are content to allow a particular standard to exist as a fair standard in an area.  I think it is reasonable that local authorities should proceed in a sensible way, and that it is not necessarily any restriction on them.  The section perhaps does not definitely apply, but I feel that it suggests a restriction on them in requiring an owner to raise the standard of his house, say, above the general standard.</P>

      <P>In dealing with a district as a whole, where unsatisfactory conditions exist it is a question of a clearance order.  Even where conditions are bad enough to require a clearance order, the local authorities under the Bill have to show the Minister that they are able to provide for the rehousing of the people whom they propose to displace, and that their resources are capable of doing it.  So that we have to measure the improvements which we want to bring about by our resources to bring about these improvements.  Unsatisfactory housing conditions will naturally exist in some places until we have the resources to deal with them.</P>

There was a sketch published in one of the papers of an area which the Dublin Corporation contemplated clearing under this Bill when passed.  It included one side of Gloucester Street and did not include the other.  Could the owner of a house or houses on that side of Gloucester Street which it was intended to include in the clearance order object on the grounds that the standard of housing conditions for the working classes in that district was the standard set by his houses, and point to the other side of Gloucester Street as an example?</P>

      <P>This section provides that where buildings included in a clearance area are used for trade or business reasonable compensation may be paid to the person carrying on that trade or business on the ground of disturbance.  In the event of the business being a licensed business and the destruction of the premises involving the cancellation of the licence what would the position be?  As far as I know the obligation imposed upon the local authority under the British Act was that if that should take place they should procure a licence for such licensee in another area.  I am now on the <Col N="2146" /> ground of compensation and I want to know on what ground could compensation be assessed in the event of the licence being taken away under a demolition order under the Act.</P>

      <P>That is the point.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that this ought to be more clearly defined in the section than it is.  What it would mean in practice would be that when a local authority cleared an area and provided people with alternative accommodation there would be immediate claims for compensation.  People would claim that they were entitled to compensation for being removed from one house in one area to another house, apart from the licence.</P>

      <P>The great difficulty arises in connection with the licensed trade.

      <P>Is there an appeal to the court in the case cited by Deputy Lemass, that is, the case of the licensed trader?  It is a good while ago since any case of that kind came <Col N="2147" /> under my notice, but many years ago cases of the kind did come under my notice in connection with the clearances of areas in Dublin.  If I am not mistaken, some very heavy compensation had to be paid for one or two licences in the clearing of the area now known as Foley Street.  If that same procedure were carried out now it would be another means of blocking the clearance of areas, because it would make the business entirely too costly.  Even as the law will be after the passing of this Act, clearances of certain areas in Dublin will be very costly, even though additional powers are given.  But if added to that there will have to be heavy compensation paid in the case of licensed traders for the extinction of licences attached to certain premises, local authorities will have to consider for a very long time whether they will move in the matter of clearing such areas or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals entirely with unfit buildings.  When we take into consideration the additional amendment we have introduced with regard to compensation in respect of the clearance of areas, and brought it into line with what was contemplated in regard to derelict areas, the compensation payable is the value of the site less the clearance, and that is all that is to be paid.  Any additional payment made under this section is payment at the discretion of the local authority.  The buildings that are referred to are buildings that are unfit and condemned to demolition.  It is really only precautionary.  Probably there may be some business buildings in that condition, including licensed houses, but the number is very limited.  So far as the money has to be paid outside what is awarded as compensation on the basis that I suggest, it is entirely at the local authority's discretion and with the Minister's consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I think it should be &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I think the trader is entitled to compensation when the local authority takes action which results in his being removed out of the place in which he had his house of business, but I am particularly anxious that the amount of compensation the local authority would have to pay should be determined in accordance with definite rules, and that the amount should not be excessive, because whatever the cost involved is it would have to be recovered from rents or rates on the premises.  Special provision was made to deal with the licensed trade under the English Act. Deputy O'Kelly mentioned the fact that under previous clearance schemes carried out in Dublin the compensation that had to be paid to licensed traders was very heavy.  The same circumstances may arise again.  If some scheme could be devised whereby persons carrying on the licensed trade in an area that had to be cleared could be provided with a licence for a building in another part of the city compensation, or at any rate compensation to the same extent, would not be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is a question of a person who is in business in <Col N="2149" /> an insanitary area, and in a house that is condemned as insanitary, I cannot imagine definite rules upon which the local authority would base the amount of compensation they are going to give for disturbance.  I feel that it would be very questionable whether we ought to put a definite duty upon them.  After all the local authority is there to look after the general interests of the people, so that it is really a matter of examining the circumstances of a particular person and, to a certain extent, giving a fair public-opinion estimate of what a person so disturbed should get.  However you qualify &ldquo;may&rdquo; I think it might be safely left to the local authority because the whole circumstances are too problematical and perhaps hypothetical to warrant our being rigid.  So that subject to any conclusion we might come to as to the doubts that might be drawn around &ldquo;may&rdquo; I would like to leave the section so that a local authority, at its discretion, could pay this particular class of expense and compensation.  I do not think we could draw the matter any more tightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the section as drawn should be allowed to remain, and I agree with him that the amount granted by the local authority under it cannot be very great, in view of the fact that it is laid down here that the removal of the people is to be from premises which are incapable of being rendered fit for human habitation, and that &ldquo;such reasonable allowance as they think fit towards his expenses in removing&rdquo; should be made.  That seems reasonable but we had better keep in mind what may arise as a result of it. The individual occupier of, say, licensed premises will not get very much in the way of allowance when removing from premises that are condemned. He will have to remove somewhere, but the case is bound to be made that he is losing something that was necessary for his livelihood.  It is not like the case of an ordinary tenant being moved from one house to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensed trader is being forced, against his will probably, to move out <Col N="2150" /> of business premises from which he has derived his livelihood, and he cannot be moved into other licensed premises. He may be able to get such premises, but it does not follow that he will.  It may be possible that a court would determine, although there is no mention of it in the Bill, that such a person is entitled to have that fact taken into consideration, and to have an allowance made to him of the value of his licence, because it was his means of livelihood, and because there is no provision in this Bill&mdash;as there is in the English Bill&mdash;for giving such licence holder another licence elsewhere. I think it is reasonable to think that the court would take that into consideration, and might put a high valuation on the extinguished licence, because it was the means of livelihood of the individual from whom it was forcibly taken.  I think the Minister should discuss that question with his Department, to see if it is necessary to bring cases of that kind specifically into the Bill.  In one of the largest areas in Dublin, which might be called a clearance or an unhealthy area, I am strongly inclined to think that there would be licensed premises, the value of which would probably run into three figures.  If the danger I see of heavy assessments of compensation for removal of these licensed premises being inflicted on the local authorities is realised, the cost of clearance in that area would be tremendous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion that under the common law, people who are disturbed in their business would be entitled, notwithstanding this Bill, to go to the court, and to get a certain amount of compensation.  I do not think it is wise to bring into the Bill a provision that there should be an allowance paid to people removed from one house to another.  I am sure that I am right in assuming that the house such a person would be sent to would be a better house.  That should be compensation enough.  In my opinion, if this is left in the Bill the powers given to local authorities might be abused, because the expenses of removal would have to be placed against the new scheme of housing that the people were going into, and in some <Col N="2151" /> way be a charge on the rents.  It would be as broad as it is long.  It is undesirable to suggest that an allowance should be given to people who are being transferred from a house in a slum area to a better house.  In itself that is compensation enough.  From what I know of local authorities I do not think it is wise to leave such power in the Bill, as hours might be spent discussing the amount of compensation that should be given.  I think the power given is dangerous, and that the provision should be deleted.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that there could be any claim in common law if a local authority, responsible for sanitary conditions in an area, comes along and says, &ldquo;This house must be destroyed and the site cleared in order to make it sanitary.&rdquo;  If there is common law to that effect, I do not know if it would be our desire to interfere with it.  The implication of this section is that there is no such common law bearing on the situation.  We may take it that for the purpose of this discussion there is no such common law doctrine. We are destroying an insanitary area.  It is simply a contingency, more unlikely than likely, that there is a business place in it unfit to be left standing.  The compensation that is going to be paid for premises according to this Bill is the value of the cleared site, less the cost of clearing it. That is the only money that is going to be paid for that site by the local authority, if it purchases it.  If instead of clearing it itself, the local authority may say, &ldquo;This is an insanitary area. I want you to clear that house.&rdquo; Having carried out that order, the owner of the site has the site, but he has less in cash by the amount of <Col N="2152" /> money which it cost to clear the site. This section gives the local authority discretion to pay such reasonable allowance as they think fit, with the consent of the Minister, towards the cost which, in their opinion, he will sustain by reason of disturbance of his trade or business.</P>

      <P>If the Minister found that the amounts paid in some cases were high, he would take steps to ensure that that would not happen again.  The matter would come under the notice of the Department, and the local authority would be informed that the Department would not give its sanction to such a high scale of allowance in future.  I am still worried by the question of licensed traders.  I do not know that I should be regarded as a defender of the licensed trade, but I am satisfied that under this section demands will be made on the Dublin Corporation for what some people might regard as extravagant allowances, because of the forced removal of persons occupying licensed premises, this removal following upon a clearance order.  I have in mind a very wide area in the constituency of the Minister and myself.  It extends from Gardiner Street down to the North Strand and from the quays up to Summerhill.  All that area is not an unhealthy area, but a very big portion of it is.  There are very wide areas within these boundaries that will probably, at some future date, be cleared as unhealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within that area and the sub-areas included within its boundary, there are a very large number of licensed premises. The owners of these premises are to be paid, with the consent of the Minister, a reasonable allowance towards the loss which a trader will sustain by reason of the disturbance of his trade consequent on his having to quit the house or building.  In estimating the loss, regard is to be had to the period for which the premises might reasonably have been expected to be available for the purpose of the trade or business.  That may or may not be long but efforts will be made to make the amount the local authority might think reasonable such a sum as would cover the value of the licensed premises.  In so far as the <Col N="2154" /> amount of compensation or allowance is increased, the cost of clearing the area will be increased.  The cost in such an area as I have mentioned will be very considerable indeed.  If this cost were added to the other costs of the clearance, the amount would be very high and the consequent loss on any housing scheme afterwards engaged in by the local authority would be very high.  Some provision is necessary to deal with cases of that kind&mdash; either a provision making licences available elsewhere or a provision for the retention of a certain number of the licences in the area.  If we are to prevent extravagant claims and heavy cost being placed on the local authority, which cost will fall upon the ratepayers later, some provision such as I have suggested is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going on the assumption that houses would come into a clearance scheme which, in fact, would not come in because they would not be in the condition that they would be marked down for destruction.  As regards the acquiring of land for the purpose of development, where houses might be cleared that were not actually condemned, compensation payable in these cases would be fixed by an assessor. The trade or business premises that might be involved in one of these clearance schemes where houses would be marked down as unfit for habitation would be more of the little huckster type, with a couple of bottles of lemonade in the window, or the coal shop type, or something like that.  Local authorities would not, I think, be confronted with the question of allowance for disturbance in the case of a licensed premises of any reasonable kind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 17:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 38, to delete the word &ldquo;temporarily.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have put down the amendment primarily for the purpose of eliciting some information from the Minister as to his policy in regard to open spaces, particularly in the cities.  This section, as Deputies will see, deals with the acquisition of derelict sites.  The first sub-section gives a local authority power to acquire, either by agreement with the consent of the Minister or compulsorily, a derelict site, notwithstanding that such site is required for such purpose.  Sub-section (2) goes on to say that a derelict site so acquired by a local authority may, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister, pending its ultimate appropriation for the purpose for which it was acquired, be used temporarily by the local authority as a playground or recreation ground for persons of the working classes and other persons.&rdquo;  I want to call attention to the wording of this.  If Deputies look at Section 38 they will see that there power is given, among other things, to the local authority &ldquo;to provide and maintain, with the consent of the Minister and, if desired, jointly with any other person in connection with any such housing accommodation, ...any playgrounds or recreation grounds, open spaces or other buildings or land which, in the opinion of the Minister, will serve a beneficial purpose in connection with the requirements of the persons for whom the housing accommodation is provided.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two distinctions between these two sections.  One is that, in the first case the provision is temporary, and in the second it is permanent. In the first case, the provision is to be general for persons of the working classes and other persons, and in the other section permanent provision is made, but the provision there is restricted to the persons for whom the housing accommodation is provided.  I think I follow the idea of the Minister, but I would like to get from him a statement as to what exactly he <Col N="2156" /> has in his mind here.  It is not very clear to me why there is a distinction in the two clauses between the classes of persons for whom accommodation is provided.  I do not attach any particular importance to the word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; one way or the other.  It is clear that if that went out other things would have to go out.  I just take it as a convenient peg to hang a discussion on for the purpose of eliciting information from the Minister as to what he has in his mind in this connection.</P>

      <P>There is nothing vital in putting in the word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; there.  It is put in as a precautionary measure.  The idea is that derelict sites may be cleared for the purposes of Part III of the Act of 1890.  They may be cleared, even though the local authority is not prepared to go on with a housing scheme right away.  There may be a danger if this was used as a playground for the public, that the public might acquire a right of way that would interfere with the local authority if it wanted to use that playground afterwards for the purposes of a housing scheme.  The word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; is supposed to introduce a precaution there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 18:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute therefore the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a local authority acquire compulsorily a derelict site for any of the purposes of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts the compensation to be paid by the local authority in respect of the acquisition of such site shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions contained in Part I of the Third Schedule to this Act and, subject as aforesaid, shall be assessed in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended by the Acquisition of Land (Reference Committee) Act, 1925 (No. 22 of 1925).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Elsewhere, in response to representations from the City Corporation, we change the compensation in respect to clearance areas.  Originally the compensation to be paid was the value of the sites cleared.  On representations made it is reasonable to consider that the compensation paid should be the value of the site cleared, less the cost of removing the buildings.  The Third Schedule is, by amendment, altered so as to indicate that that will be the compensation.  The result is that the lines upon which compensation will be determined will be the same for a derelict site as for a clearance area. Instead of putting in there the special way in which compensation would be determined in respect to derelict sites, we simply refer to the derelict site section in the same way as we refer to the clearance area section to the Third Schedule.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 24:</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1), to insert a new paragraph (e) as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) In lieu of an advance in cash an advance under these Acts as amended by this Act may be made to a public utility society on behalf of a person or persons qualified to receive an advance by means of a supply of materials suitable for the <Col N="2161" /> construction of houses and when the local authority decide that an advance shall be made in the form of material such advance may be made as soon as the local authority is satisfied that such material will be used for the purpose stated in the application for an advance.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to empower local authorities to make advances of building materials to a public utility society.  I might say that it has been put down in response to representations which we received from groups of workers.  It has been pointed out that it might be possible to find a group of workers who would be anxious to erect one, two or three houses for themselves, men who would be engaged in their ordinary work in the building industry and who would do this in their spare time.  If they were to take advantage of the Act they would require a certain amount of capital, in any case, to go on with, but, as the Bill stands at the moment, the advances are made only to them by instalments.  It is to be assumed that a certain amount of the work would have to be done before they could get any payment.  The point is that they would want capital right from the beginning, and it is thought that if the materials were made available to them it would facilitate them in their desire to get on with the erection of the houses.  The argument might well be put forward, that if you were to advance cash right from the beginning, you would not be quite sure that the cash would be used for the purpose for which it was intended.  That is the reason why the advance is only made when a certain amount of work is done. That is the difficulty we require to get over by this proposal, namely, that an authority will be in a position to advance building materials to a group of workers, who are prepared, and who satisfy the local authority in that way, to take on the building of a few houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>I think it would be found, assuming that the case were made that the labour will cost half and the materials half, that the advance would only require to be 50 per cent. whereas the Act would allow a much bigger <Col N="2162" /> advance if the advance were to be made in cash.  As I say, the amendment is put down at the request of groups of workers in the building trade, so that it might be possible for a group of men to organise the building of a few houses for themselves if they had this facility.  It is thought too that this would be an economical way of dealing with the matter, because the local authority might be in a position, especially a local authority engaged in large building schemes, to supply materials much more cheaply than the people themselves could get them if the cash were advanced to them, and if they had to purchase them themselves. So far as the actual wording of the amendment is concerned we are not tied to it.  It is quite possible that the amendment might require redrafting, but we would like the Minister to consider the principle of the amendment favourably, and have it or something like it inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As far as public utility societies are concerned they do not come under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at all They are enabled to get money under the Housing (Ireland) Act of 1919, so we are really dealing with private persons.  A private person proposes to acquire a house, and he applies to a local authority for an advance under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  Let us say the advance is going to be £450.  That advance is going to be repaid over a certain number of years.  Deputy O'Connell's amendment is to the effect that the local authority will supply him with a certain amount of building material, and a certain amount of cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act we make provision for it here.  Let us speak of private persons, because public utility societies are different. They are going to build a certain number of houses.  If the advantage of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is going to be given&mdash;let us say 75 per cent. or 80 per cent., in fact, the local <Col N="2163" /> authority is able to give an advance of 90 per cent. of the houses as valued, the 90 per cent. of the houses as valued cannot be advanced to the private person in materials.  The purpose is to help private persons by advancing up to, not necessarily 90 per cent., because the local authority can say as a matter of policy: &ldquo;We will give 80 per cent. or 75 per cent.,&rdquo; but they are empowered to give 90 per cent. of what you call the capital value of the house. They take that money on an undertaking to repay.  I do not see how the advance of that money can be made effective to a private person or to a public utility society under the 1929 Act, where they get 75 per cent. of the value of the house.  I do not see how you can mix up materials in the matter of a loan.  The materials cannot cover the whole lot.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a group of people who want to build four houses for themselves. They are building trade workers who are prepared to work in the summer evenings in their spare time.  If you give them cash, very well, but the point is that cash cannot be advanced at all.  Cash will only be advanced to them when a certain amount of the work is completed.  They are not in a position to raise any capital to begin the work without help, and what I suggest here is that they should be facilitated by having the materials at their disposal in lieu of cash.  Give them cash if you wish, but of course objection will immediately be made <Col N="2164" /> with regard to the advance of cash. We have no assurance that they will use the cash to build the houses.  That objection will be legitimately made.  It is the general principle that a cash advance is made only when a certain amount of the building work is completed. If these men are able to work up the material themselves a group of them may co-operate to build five or six houses.  They may not require any more than just the materials.  That is the suggestion made in the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been put down at the express desire of some bricklayers, carpenters and people of that kind, and I cannot personally see the objection on the part of the Minister to giving material instead of cash.  Of course it must be distinctly remembered that in sub-section (c) it says &ldquo;the total advance at any time is not to exceed 50 per cent. of the value of the work done.&rdquo;  That means that these people would only be getting their money in dribs and drabs and would not be in a position to purchase materials economically.  I think it ought to be the desire to secure that these people would be able to buy materials as cheaply as possible.  The Minister ought seriously to consider going into the matter between now and the Report Stage.  When you get people who are desirous of building houses for themselves and prepared to put their own labour into it, I believe they should get some encouragement further than the encouragement given in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that I cannot see the difference.  I listened very attentively to what Deputy O'Connell has stated, but I cannot see the difference between advancing money and advancing materials.  Materials are practically money.  If there is no security for the advance of the money, where is the security for the advance of the materials?  Deputy O'Connell says that if this money is advanced there is no security that the money will be applied to the building of a house.  What is the security if building material is given?  Building material is money at any time.  Besides, if people steal building material there <Col N="2165" /> are always people who will buy it.  It seems to me there are more difficulties here than there are in connection with cash.  As far as I can see, the cash would be more useful to the man, because he can get materials when he needs them.  It is what Deputy O'Connell is always arguing&mdash;bulk purchase. Many sites will not hold sufficient material for a house.  You want it coming in at intervals.  I cannot see the difference between money and materials, and I see much greater difficulties in connection with materials than money.</P>

It would be a splendid thing if we could give some of our fellow citizens a chance of spending their off hours in very useful as well as interesting pursuits.

      <P>(Clare): The idea is not so new as people think.  In 1913, a group of unemployed tradesmen in Dublin formed a society on merely nominal shares.  They bought material and actually constructed houses.  I was a shareholder myself.  I was on the committee, and knew the inner working of the scheme.  They constructed houses somewhere near Fairview, but then there was an epidemic of wars.  We had a few of our own and there was the big war, and these put an end to it.</P>

      <P>While I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment, I think it would be very hard to work such a scheme.  After all, a body of men going in for the building of houses must have some little credit in the country, so that they would be in a position to obtain credit from local suppliers.  The scheme would be all <Col N="2168" /> right if we were sure that the persons who got these materials would use them to the best advantage.  Would the Minister agree to the local authority guaranteeing the builders providers that they would be responsible for the payment of the material delivered to such groups of men as Deputy O'Connell speaks of?</P>

      <P>It is a bit revolutionary.  Following on our general housing policy it is now proposed that local authorities will buy building materials and distribute them as an advance to persons who will go out and build their own houses.  The implication is that they have no credit of any kind.  What we are providing here is that persons who are going to have their houses built or who are going to build them themselves can be secure that the local authority would advance them at the time the house is built a considerable portion of the cost of the house, and that the local authority may make arrangements to make instalments of the advance to them, but only up to 50 per cent. of the approximate cost of the work that is done.  That is a very considerable provision.  As I say, the other contemplates <Col N="2169" /> a very special class and a very special way of dealing with that class. I wish, particularly in rural parts of the country, that we had circumstances in which a scheme like that were possible of being worked.  I would more favourably consider any statement of the circumstances from any local authority that would show that the circumstances were such as to warrant a scheme such as that proposed.</P>

There is not much gained by an advance of capital to transfer the ownership of the house from, say, Deputy Corish to me, whereas, if there is capital advanced to me to build a new house, something new is being created.

Strictly speaking, he might not be buying a new house; he would be taking advantage of this Act to get an advance in respect of a house, and clear off his debt with the builder, and the builder would be enabled to go on building new houses.

      <P>The amendment introduced here is really meant to meet circumstances that Deputy Law wishes to meet.  Under the Registration <Col N="2172" /> of Title Act, dwellings acquired through the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act have to be registered.  There is a fee prescribed.  Land purchased under the Land Acts also requires to have the title registered under the Registration of Title Act.  The cost of running the Registration of Title Office is borne by those who get their work done there.  When you take into consideration the price people have to pay for registration of title, people who are forced to register their title because they acquired the land under the Land Acts, and when we compare that amount with what people have to pay when registering title, having acquired title with the assistance of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, we find that the people who have had their titles registered, having acquired houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, are not paying the actual cost that ought to be paid.  The amendment relative to Section 56 (2) sets out the fee of ten shillings.  There will, in fact, be substituted for that fee the actual fee that registration of title as a general rule costs as estimated by the office.  The fee will be raised.  It may not be raised to a guinea, but it will be raised to the amount necessary to pay for the average registration of title.  I suggest that Deputy Law's amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>On Section 56 I again want to raise the question that when it was decided to amend the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, the recommendations of the Town Tenants Commission were not included.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time that this report was made it was the Commissioners who were in charge of the Dublin Corporation.  In the report which they submitted, and which was printed as an appendix, they pointed out that: &ldquo;Before advances can be made it is necessary to obtain from the city architect a certificate as to the soundness of a house, from the sanitary engineer as to its sanitation, and from the valuer as to the market value of a house.  The law agent must then investigate the title, and if this is found satisfactory application is made to the Local Government Department for sanction to make the advance....  At any stage in the proceedings above detailed delays are likely to occur, if the premises on which a loan is sought do not comply with the various requirements of the Acts; and in this regard it has been found that the investigation of title and actual closing of the loan are causes of the longest delay... If certain amendments were made in the Small Dwellings Acts it is more than likely that the public would avail of <Col N="2174" /> them more fully.  With a view to shortening proceedings local authorities might be vested with full powers and discretion in the making of advances to borrowers, independent of the supervision of the Local Government Department, the transactions under the Act being, of course, subject to audit. Furthermore, it may be possible to dispense with the investigation of title by the Land Registry and substitute therefor certificate of a solicitor for local authority.  On such issue Land Registry to issue Land Registry certificate. Alternately dispense with examination of title by local authority and make the loan advanceable on the certificate of the Land Registry only. The title could be submitted by the vendor direct to the Registry without the intervention of the solicitor for the local purchaser or the solicitor for the local authority.  This would save costs and the delay of two additional investigations of title.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There were some minor recommendations dealing with the procedure for the making of loans under these Acts, which have been proved to be very tedious in operation, and which the Commission state are mainly responsible for the fact that these Acts have not operated to anything like the extent anticipated when they were framed.  We are amending and improving the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I am anxious to know why these other amendments suggested on behalf of the Town Tenants Commission and the Dublin Corporation were not accepted, that is, those recommendations about transfers.  I have personal knowledge that the costs involved in three investigations of title, when the purchase is to be made in accordance with loans under these Acts and loans from an insurance company, were very heavy.  I ask if it is not possible to remove these costs from the intending purchaser.  If it is possible they should be removed.</P>

I cannot say that I investigated all the detailed recommendations put up with a view to seeing to what extent matters may be improved in the procedure.

For instance, it may be that the valuer may see the walls of the house perhaps a few feet high.  The cost of that amount of construction may be approximately £30 or £40, but there may be £60 worth of material on the ground.  Would not the Minister take that into consideration when making an advance?  Similarly the man building houses may have the doors and window frames prepared in his own shop and not on the site.  I think that is a matter which the Minister should consider as to how much the valuer should certify for when he comes to inspect the house. The Minister may take that into consideration&mdash;whether it is fifty per cent. of the actual amount of work done or fifty per cent. of the actual amount of work done and the materials on the ground.</P>

      <P>The First Schedule to the Housing Act, 1929 (No. 12 of 1929) as amended by Section 5 of the Housing Act, 1930 (No. 22 of 1930) shall in its application to houses erected by private persons have effect as if there were inserted therein the following rule, and the said schedule and also Section 2 of the first-mentioned Act shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move the amendment in Deputy Murphy's name: <Col N="2178" /> In line 56 to delete the figures &ldquo;1932&rdquo; and to substitute the figures &ldquo;1933.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give this favourable consideration.  It proposes to extend the date to February, 1933. It proposes to extend the period by a year.  The position, as the Minister knows, is that the Housing Act expired in April of this year.  A memorandum was sent out from his Department following the statement he made in this House early in the year, to the effect that if new legislation were introduced and passed in the House during this Autumn Session houses begun since April last would get the subsidy.</P>
      <P>Some people had sufficient trust in the Minister to avail of that and to erect a house.  These, no doubt, come under the operation of the Act and will qualify for the subsidy.  But there are many people who were in very great doubt as to what the position would be, and when they asked if there was a subsidy for a house started, say, in June, July or August, they had to be told that there was no subsidy available. The position is that the Act is extended to February; but there are many people who are anxious to avail of the subsidy and who had not begun their houses, and it would be impossible for them to have their houses completed by next February.  If they had begun to build any time from 1st April last they had only the promise of the Minister that if the Government were in power and got a Bill through the houses they had started would get a subsidy.  Many of them were not prepared to take that risk and begin the houses unless they were sure that they would get the subsidy.  They did not like to speculate.  I feel that it would be only fair to extend the period for the completion of a house beyond February in order to give a number of people who are anxious to avail of the subsidy an opportunity to get it.</P>

      <P>We only intended to provide for those who were then building.  If this Bill could have been introduced at the beginning of the year, the £45 grant would have come to an end perhaps earlier than it is coming now.  The alternative arrangement of providing £20, plus £20 from the local authority, would come into operation, so that really the persons who are getting the £45 grant under the promise are getting it by way of a windfall, because this legislation was not ready at an earlier date.  The amount of money at our disposal is definitely limited, and it was not possible to find more than £30,000 to deal with the promise given.  The putting in of these figures here would mean nothing without the provision of additional money, and there is no intention to provide additional money for this superior class of houses.</P>

    <P>Section 14 of the Housing Act of 1919, to which the Minister has referred, is the foundation of our present housing legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on a different point. We are now on the question of grants. Not only was that provision made both by way of grant and by way of loan, but distinct preference was given in the regulations under the Act of 1919 and, I think, ever since to public utility societies, and that, I venture to suggest, is not done without good reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but, as Deputy Corish has pointed out, paragraph (e), sub-section (1), Section 60, provides that &ldquo;in the case of houses erected by a public utility society, the erection of which is begun after the passing of this Act, 15 per cent. of the annual loan charges in respect of such houses covers a period not exceeding twenty years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present worth of the annual grant is £45; and if the Deputy will refer to sub-section (c) he will see it is proposed to give public utility societies which are public utility societies within the meaning of the 1919 Act, a grant payable as an annual contribution towards the loan charges equal to the annual grant we are giving a local authority building houses for the working classes, when they are building houses unrelated to clearance schemes. In that section we do provide financial assistance for public utility societies. They can get a loan up to 75 per cent. of the value of the house under the 1919 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter with which I am perfectly familiar, but it <Col N="2184" /> was suggested to me that there is considerable advantage in enabling public utility societies to get a substantial grant, because they were thus enabled by means of that to cover their expenses and in certain cases to sell their houses, not to make a profit, but to keep themselves clear and to continue building other houses practically on the same capital.  If the Minister tells me that that case is met by the sub-section to which he calls attention I am quite satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this point.  The Deputy mentioned the word &ldquo;sell.&rdquo;  If public utility societies, building houses and getting this grant, sell their houses and part with them by sale it is intended that the annual grant towards the house shall cease, because the intention is to develop and encourage public utility societies in drawing capital from the State and getting this grant under the Acquisition of Small Dwellings Act in order to build houses for rental rather than to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal in what Deputy Law said, that this will interfere with the work of the public utility societies.  They have been able to carry on their operations so far and pay their way by means of the initial subsidy for the most part.  Even if there is a prospect of ultimately getting some amount in payment of debts that have occurred on account of that, that will only apply in certain cases, but in many other cases they will not be able to carry out their operations and set the houses at a satisfactory rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that Deputy Thrift has struck the real defect here.  Public utility societies, generally speaking, have no great credit.  They have a certain limited amount of credit, and the subsidy was of very great advantage to them in carrying on their work, and when finished selling their houses, then going ahead with the aid of another subsidy, and building another house or series of houses.  While the new scheme <Col N="2185" /> will eventually mean, so far as the Government is concerned, the same amount actual of capital outlay spread over a number of years, it would not be of the same practical value to the utility societies.  I am informed by those who have practical knowledge of the working of those societies that it will mean that their work will be greatly hampered, and that so far as the smaller societies are concerned probably their work will have to cease. They would not be able at all to meet their liabilities with the same prospect of building and selling houses as they have been able to do owing to the grants previously made under the housing schemes.  I think in regard to public utility societies, if the Minister could continue the grants made under the last Act, the good work done by those public utility societies so far in providing houses for the lower middle classes, and which has relieved the pressure, would be able to continue. Otherwise there would be a considerable falling off of the work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not preventing utility societies disposing of these houses, but we are anxious that, outside local authorities, there would be societies that would build houses for persons who require houses slightly better than those that local authorities build, and who would be able to take these houses at rents they can be let at.  I think a very considerable portion of our population want such houses at present, and that it is very difficult for them to acquire their houses by buying them.  If there are people who want to acquire their houses by buying them, then they ought to be able to do it through some other channel than by preventing the development of public utility societies. That would be what we want, that is, to provide houses somewhat above the local authority class of houses for renting.  Private persons anxious to buy their houses should take advantage, as they can, of the facilities given here for getting grants and forgetting <Col N="2186" /> credit under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, they ought to be able to secure them in some other way.  They might even be able to cooperate with the public utility societies in finding contractors who would build their houses, or as part even of a public utility scheme.  We do not want that development to spoil the development we very urgently wish for from the development of public utility societies.  If there are people who can buy houses from a public utility society there is nothing to prevent such a society selling these houses at a cost that to them is reasonable, but then they lose the annual grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section makes the work of public utility societies very ineffective.  I am one of those who visualises the time when the provision of houses for the working classes will be entrusted wholly to public utility societies, because the members of these societies have an opportunity of mixing with the working classes.  The fact that these societies build houses and sell them is an incentive to people to become members of these societies.  It has been stated over and over again, in this House and outside, that the mere fact of a man being a working man means that he has no money.  Never was there a greater fallacy.  From my experience of the working of Dundalk Public Utility Society, working men have put down sums ranging from £60 to £100. Some men have put down deposits of £300, who, before the creation of this public utility society would be classified as poor working men.  If you exempt public utility societies on the plea that they build houses to sell, I think you will destroy the good work that has been accomplished by these societies. I hope the Minister will bear that in mind on the Report Stage.  There are working men in this country anxious to become the owners of their houses. Ownership creates civic responsibility. There is no better way of making a good citizen than by making a man the owner of his own house.  That class of person would not touch public utility societies were it not for the fact that he was going to become the owner of his house after a certain <Col N="2187" /> period.  We were able to tap a source of wealth that very many people thought could not be tapped before the introduction of public utility societies. As the Minister is aware, we carried out a building scheme in Dundalk at a cost of £20,000.  The houses are inhabited by men working on the railway.  We paid the last penny to the builder a fortnight ago, there being a little profit left after clearing all expenses.  In the near future it is the intention to build more houses in Dundalk.  No matter what argument is put up about the State taking over the control of housing accommodation for the working classes, I maintain that, without co-operation and self-help, it will be impossible to solve the housing problem.  You must have the co-operation and the help of the community, and the best means of securing such co-operation is through the instrumentality of public utility societies.  If you exempt them from the benefits of the grant of £20, on the plea that they only build houses for sale, it will be difficult for the Dundalk Public Utility Society to carry on.  Although the houses are actually sold, the period of redemption is very long, I believe, from twenty to twenty-five years.  Another advantage in selling houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is that the expense on the societies is lowered, because the tenants who purchased simply paid their rents weekly, monthly, or half-yearly, to the clerk of the urban council, who takes over the administration of the scheme until the debt is cleared off.  There are many disadvantages in excluding public utility societies from the benefits of the grant, and I hope that on the Report Stage the Minister will consider the point.</P>

Is there any reason why they should not help them with whatever amount of control they wish to set up, as a kind of information bureau, and in getting them advances from the local authorities under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act?  I do not think that would in any way conflict with the other work of the public utility society itself.  At any rate, our policy is to get the public utility society to turn its mind in the direction I speak of.  I do not think it would be at all prejudiced by doing that, and by assisting in every way those who wish to provide their own houses to take advantage of the State loans and the State grants that we provide.  Instead of having not very solid or responsible public utility societies we would have solidly organised societies acting as a guide to private persons.</P>

I think every agency which would enable the people to get houses, particularly houses of their own, should be encouraged, and that a public utility society which builds houses to sell should be encouraged, at any rate, to some extent.  I might take the Minister's point of view, to the extent of saying that, possibly, a greater encouragement should be given to a large public utility society which would deal with a large area and <Col N="2189" /> build houses to meet the needs of the people who have to live in that area. They might possibly be encouraged to a greater extent.  Nevertheless, the Minister should not set himself out to cut off suddenly such State assistance as has been given to a class of public utility societies, particularly those which, up to the present, were building houses to sell.  There is a good deal to be said for the public utility society which builds houses to sell.  If it is a small body its administrative costs must be comparatively small.  The people with whom it deals must be thoroughly well-known to those managing the society. The risk of bad debt and everything else is decreased by the fact that it will only build houses which it thinks it can sell immediately. In that way I think its work is much more economical, under present circumstances, than that of a larger society.  I do not think the sort of assistance which the Minister thinks the larger society would be able to give under this Bill would be of any value of people who wish to have their own houses built, and who are in a position to buy them, either by availing of the facilities granted in the Act or out of their own capital immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public utility society will have its own architect and will have a number of builders on its list.  They will be able to cut down all the preliminary costs of building to a minimum. They will be able to do that much more efficiently and effectively if they are building houses, in the first instance for themselves, and afterwards transferring them to their clients.  If it is the case that the public utility society can render any of the services, which the Minister outlined, to the people in a certain area, surely the best way to encourage it to do that is to provide it with that special assistance which, up to the present, it has enjoyed to enable it to build houses, because it will be able to build a large number of houses, reduce all the ancillary costs&mdash;architect's fees and other things that arise in these matters&mdash;and pass the full benefit of that reduction on to the people who are going to buy the houses.  The <Col N="2190" /> Minister, up to the present, has not been able to justify his policy of restricting the public utility societies to the building of houses for letting only. I think a good case can be made, and has been made, for the public utility society which builds houses to sell them.  The need exists for these houses and, if I had my way, instead of cutting the grant, I would be inclined to consider the increase of it by 25 or 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I think this matter requires a good deal more consideration than it has had.  It seems to me that this scheme is ethically unsound. What we all aim at is to get the class of persons whom we are thinking of to be as saving and as economical as possible in order that these persons may be able to acquire their own dwellings as soon as possible.  This scheme actually tends to discourage that.  The more these people can set aside to get rid of their loan charges, the less they will be able to get towards paying the loan charges.  I submit that that goes quite the wrong way.  We ought to try to get the loan charges paid off by these people as quickly as possible instead of discouraging them.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister's chief concern is to provide houses for the working classes, but I might remind the Minister that when a public utility society builds 40 or 50 houses this means that the same number of houses are made available for others.  Many of the people who got houses erected with the assistance of the public utility societies in my locality left houses that they formerly occupied and made these houses available for the working classes in the same locality.  I know myself about ten people who are occupying public utility society houses and who previously occupied houses built by the urban council.  These houses belonging to the urban council will now be available for other persons.  The public utility societies are fulfilling two functions&mdash;they are providing houses for people who want to become owners of their houses and they are making available houses for people by way of letting.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister that the fact that they get the <Col N="2192" /> type of tenant that I have referred to means that the utility societies are provided with a very large amount of their assets at the initiation of the building scheme.  In the scheme to which I referred, deposits of £100 were put down. The lowest deposit was £50.  These deposits were made by working class people who had been assisted by thrifty members of their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If we suppose for a moment that an alteration in the financial arrangement has been made, the strongest case that Deputy Coburn can put is that a person with £200 or £300 cannot get the facilities which he was formerly in a position to get from the public utility societies.  So far as getting a house with a reduction of 15 per cent. in the annual loan charges for a period not exceeding 20 years is concerned he is in the same position as a person without money.  In essence, what it comes to is this: That instead of entering into possession of a house without any charge on it at once, and getting the advantage of whatever sum would be made available in bulk form instead of in annual form as here, he is at no disadvantage.  He simply postpones the purchase of the house for 20 years.  He still has his £200 or £300, and he can place that money, I am sure, with the public utility society at a price probably not less than that at which they would get an advance from some public fund.  Alternatively, if he were to put it into national savings certificates, he would get probably as high interest as would otherwise be available.  The only disadvantage there to him is that he cannot lock it in his safe, or bank the title deeds of the premises for which he has a sufficient sum of money to put down. We are leaving him with that money now.  He is still in possession of it, and he enters into possession of the same advantages as the person who has not got that money, or, alternatively, if the arrangement with the public utility society were that prior allocation of the houses would be to a person who could put down the money, then he would be in as strong a position as he was when he was put into a position to buy the house.  I do not think there is a real material disadvantage <Col N="2193" /> to him except in the one case: that he does not get into immediate possession of the house with no charges in respect to the costs of the loans provided.  He is simply liable for rates and income tax, if he is so liable.  But the advantages that he can get in connection with the purchase for twenty years are exactly the equivalent to the position that he was in last year when he could get £45 of a Government grant towards the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has come back to the point that I made at the start.  The advantage to the public utility society has occurred in this way.  It has built houses and has used all its capital in doing so.  It has let those houses at a rent.  After a time the tenant has saved enough to get that liability off his hands.  The capital has come back to the public utility society, and with it it has built another set of houses.  That will not occur for twenty years under this. Therefore, your increase in the number of houses will be curtailed to that extent.</P>

Having listened carefully and quietly to everything that has been said, I confess that I am not yet convinced that the work of the public utility societies as we have known it in the past&mdash;I am speaking now of public utility societies that I know have built houses for people of the working classes&mdash;will suffer.

Now that purchase is delayed for a period of twenty years.  But it is purchased.  The man has his money and he can lend it to the public utility society if he likes.  They can borrow 75 per cent. of their money from the Board of Works.  They will want more and this money will be available.</P>

From what the President has said I take it that the purpose of the section is to ensure that a person would have to live in a house over twenty years before he can become the owner of it.  I do not see that any advantage either to the State or to the community is to be gained from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to be cross-examined by the President.  I did not interrupt him, and if he would endeavour to follow my good example in this debate we would get on better. <Col N="2195" /> I do not see that the two things mutually exclude each other. Apparently the Minister for Local Government thinks that they do, and that it would be inconsistent with the general purpose of the Bill to make an immediate grant to a public utility society for the purpose of enabling it to build houses to sell. I suggest that the Minister should leave an option to the public utility society to take either of these two things, whichever in its opinion will best enable it to meet the immediate needs with which it is familiar.  If a public utility society wants to build houses to sell them, surely it ought to be facilitated to that extent.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  The President, I think, had in mind the individual who makes up his mind and says &ldquo;I am going to buy a house, I am going to build a house,&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;we will facilitate him.&rdquo;  There is the other class of individual who, possibly, does not make up his mind either to buy or to build a house until he sees houses being built somewhere.  He goes out along suburban roads and sees houses springing up in some particularly nice situation.  These houses are being built by a public utility society.  The surroundings please him and he makes up his mind to make his home there.  If he can possible manage to acquire one of these houses on reasonable terms he will buy it.  That is the sort of person for whom the public utility society quite legitimately caters.  They would cater for that class of person provided there were some initial encouragement from the State in the form of this lump sum of a grant down.  That kind of public utility society is completely ignored by the Bill in its present form. I think the House should consider the question of providing the alternative facility for the public utility society, and of giving it a grant which will enable it to build houses and sell them at the quickest possible rate.  In that way we would be helping materially to reduce the housing shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let it act not merely as the agent, but as the original undertaker.  Let the public utility society be the original projector of the scheme.  Consider this position. The public utility society says: We have a plot of ground here and we will build houses on it.  We have not the necessary capital, we go to the Local Government Department to get the grant.  Armed with that and with some other funds we go and we build houses without having definite purchasers in view, but, knowing that there is a widespread shortage of houses, we feel that we are going to find purchasers inevitably for these houses.  That is the class of enterprise that the Minister is deliberately discouraging in the Bill.  I think it ought to be encouraged.  A group of men having a certain amount of money will get together.  They are in touch with builders and architects.  They know that there are certain plots of ground available for building purposes.  They say: We will form ourselves into a public utility society and limit ourselves as to profits.  We are going to put up houses in this particular locality.  We have not any particular persons in mind as purchasers, but we know that once the houses are built people will come along and buy them.  That is the particular type of enterprise that ought to be encouraged and, in my view, it is the quickest way in which the housing problem is going to find its solution.  For that reason I think the Minister ought to meet the House in regard to this grant.</P>

      <P>All through this part of the Bill, what I am trying to do is to force the building of houses down from the £1,000 figure nearer to the figure at which the local authority is building.  I am trying to force the provision of housing for the type of people for whom the local authority is providing houses.  There are any amount of working class people looking for a better type of house than the <Col N="2197" /> local authority can give, a better type than that on which we intend the local authority to concentrate.  We want to force the provision of houses of this particular kind for letting at a rent. We look to public utility societies to do something like that.  If we do not get the public utility societies forced somewhat into a position like that, then we are leaving a section of the people who very badly need houses waiting on the people who are in a position to take the responsibility of owning their houses.  We do nothing here to prevent public utility societies acting as agents for private persons and getting, as for these private persons, the grants which these private persons would ordinarily get.  That is the policy there.  I think no effort on our part should be left untried at the earliest possible moment to force the provision of houses of the type of which I speak and for the persons of whom I speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister is wrong there.  I agree with the Minister that we should try to secure the provision of the greatest possible number of houses for the working class who must live, because of economic circumstances, in small dwellings.  I believe that we should use every incentive we can to do that at the earliest possible moment.  At the same time there is the other problem which the Minister himself indicated, the problem of the worker who can afford a better house, who wants a better house because of his family and who wants to own that house.  If the Minister wants to encourage the provision of houses for renting, he can do that by making the terms more favourable for the public utility society which will rent houses, but that is not a reason for cutting off altogether any State aid or encouragement from the public utility society which is going to build a group of houses to let them to certain unnamed individuals.  The Minister will only think of a public utility society acting as agent for some particular individual who has approached it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other mass of people, the people who have not yet come forward <Col N="2198" /> to the public utility society, the people who have in mind the possibility of owning their houses, who have not yet taken a definite decision in that regard but would be stimulated into taking that decision if they saw some society providing houses for them. That is the class of public utility society for which I am speaking.  I think the Minister's point could be met by giving that society somewhat less favourable terms than the public utility society which will build houses to let.  My opinion is that anybody who will build houses for people in that social grade which we commonly describe as working class&mdash;it may be the unskilled labourer, the clerical worker or others, people like that of limited means&mdash;should be encouraged.  After that, if the Minister wants to have his way, let him give greater encouragement to the people who build houses to let, but let him not cut off all State aid from the society which builds houses even for the purpose of selling them.</P>

I think it is the experience of Deputies that the people who go into these houses as tenants are not working people at all. That is true of every town in Ireland. I do not know how true it is of Dublin. On the other hand there is something to be said for not locking up capital. Another point to be considered is, will the rental which these houses command at present be the rental which they will command in 20 years' time?  I have no objection to the Minister considering this matter, but the fact is that working class people who have no means are not in a position to go into these houses at all.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of the position of public utility societies to which I would like to call the Minister's attention.  That is the position of public utility societies who are operating in rural areas.  The Minister, of course, is aware that the number of these societies is quite small.  They are not very numerous and I think it will be admitted that where these societies exist they have been doing good work under the Housing Acts, 1925 to 1930.  If grants are not made available for such societies they will for all practical purposes have to cease operations in rural areas.  The biggest difficulty that exists in rural areas for small farmers, especially uneconomic holders, is that they cannot get credit for building materials.  They have been organised into building societies and public utility societies and the society has been able to secure credit with traders and to get building materials advanced to these uneconomic holders to build their houses.  If this amendment is not accepted by the Minister it means that these people will be thrown back entirely on their own means and, as well as that, that with the amount of money that will be at their disposal, it will be utterly impossible for small farmers to take advantage of the terms of the Bill.</P>

The public utility society that is referred to here is the public utility society registered under the Friendly Societies Act, not the type of public utility society that was provided for in the 1924 Act.  Persons in rural districts now will have the benefit of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act as well as of the grants provided, so that the question of capital does not arise in the way that it might have arisen in other days, when some of the rural public utility societies might have helped to some extent.  The particular type of which Deputy Ward speaks will not exist in the new circumstances.</P>

The society could pledge its credit to the trader to supply the building material. These people are in occupation of insanitary houses unfit for human habitation.  I have experience of one of those societies and we have certainly done good work.  We have built 70 houses in the last 1½ years in the rural parts of the Co. Monaghan.</P>

I would like to make further inquiries to see if I am not justified in saying that if this goes through it will after a short period completely bring to an end the operations of most of the public utility societies.  I am sure the Minister would not like that.  He wants them to build the houses for renting purposes. I quite agree with him, but if they apply all the money that they get <Col N="2201" /> to building such houses it will go a short distance.  Then their work will stop because their capital will end.  He should give us a further opportunity to make further enquiries to make our case and let him make his.  If he puts this to a division now and if it is lost we cannot bring it up again.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary to take the final stages tomorrow. I think there is an understanding on that and that the Bill is to be sent to the Seanad by Wednesday next in order that it may be law for Christmas.  There is nothing to prevent a public utility <Col N="2202" /> society, as an agent for private persons, making use of the particular type of grant persons get here.  We are not solving the housing problem except we do something to get public utility societies and builders to move down in the scale of the type of houses they are building, and in so far as public money for capital and public assistance in the matter of either grants or the equivalent of grants are concerned, the problem is such that we are intent on forcing their application to the building industry down to that particular plane.</P>

    <P>The following amendment stood in the name of Deputy S.T. O'Kelly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>29a. Before sub-section (2) to insert three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling-house is wholly unsuitable for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier thereof and his family the Minister may, subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations made by the Minister thereunder, make to the occupier of such dwelling-house, or to a public utility society, a grant (in this Act referred to as a building grant) towards the erection on the site of such dwelling-house or on another site a new dwelling-house in substitution for such first mentioned dwelling-house.</P>
    <P>(3) Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling-house is on account of its small size or its lack of sanitary accommodation, ventilation, light or other amenity or for any other reason unsuitable in its existing condition for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier thereof and his family and the Minister is satisfied that the condition of the dwelling-house is such that the expense of improvement can be economically incurred the Minister may subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations made by the Minister thereunder make to the occupier of such dwelling-house, or to a public utility society, a grant (in this Act referred to as an improving grant) towards the improvement or extension of such dwelling-house.</P>
    <P>(4) The amount of an individual grant made under this section shall not exceed&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, this section proposes to amend Section 3 of the Housing Act of 1929. The Housing Act of 1929 provided for the making of grants to private persons building new houses.  The amendment that is before us now, I suggest, is entirely outside the scope of the 1929 Act, which, as I say, was entirely restricted to giving grants to private persons building new houses. In sub-section (2) it is proposed to secure that grants will be given for the building of houses to replace insanitary houses, where a dwelling is wholly unsuited for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier.  Sub-section (3) proposes to make grants for the improvement of existing houses.  I submit that it is a complete addition of new things to the Housing Act of 1929, and that it is not proper to insert it in a Bill which, while amending the Act of 1929, amends it in a specific thing, but does not extend the scope of the Act of 1929 beyond making grants to private persons for building new houses.  I submit that to introduce the idea of insanitary houses means that you introduce a condition which means that a grant given would not provide an additional house, but would provide replacement, and to attempt to extend the 1929 Act to include the improvement of existing housing is a thing that should not be done by an amendment <Col N="2205" /> to an amending Act.  I submit that both these things are entirely outside this amending Bill, in so far as Section 59 is really an amending Bill to the Housing Act of 1929 alone.</P>

      <P>This Bill will amend the Housing Act of 1929.  It amends other Acts as well.  Among other things, it purports to deal with unhealthy dwelling houses, unhealthy areas, and it aims at improving those places.  It also deals with individual houses, unhealthy houses, and therefore I believe this amendment, (29a), comes within the scope of the Bill.  At any rate, it has not been ruled out of order and I move it.</P>

      <P>The amendment to this Bill alters the construction very vitally of certain Acts.  This particular amendment deals with what are called insanitary houses.  The Acts which it seeks to amend are from 1925 to 1929, and they had no reference whatever to insanitary houses.  They were concerned with the provision of new houses only.  It alters the method of declaration of an insanitary house and places upon the Minister certain obligations.  I presume the Minister is not intended to go around the country whenever there is a notice given of an unhealthy or insanitary house.  It does not even set out, in respect of a house unsuitable for a dwelling, the characteristics which distinguish that particular phase.</P>

      <P>No, but I am pointing out what the amendment really means.  That particular phase of it is the business of the local authority. The Minister has no sanitary or sub-sanitary officers to give him that information, and there is no money provided for that in the Bill.</P>

      <P>If it were <Col N="2206" /> found that the amendment was in the wrong place, that would not be sufficient to rule it completely out of order.  We would have to take some steps to see that it was put in the right place.  As regards the question of the scope of the Bill, Section 59 says:&mdash;&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Housing Acts, 1925 to 1930&rdquo;&mdash; those words could not be wider&mdash;&ldquo;as amended by this Act, the Minister may, under Section 3 of the Housing Act of 1929 (No. 12 of 1929), as modified by this section ...&rdquo;  That is, as modified by this section when it will have passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For that reason the amendment seems to me to be relevant, particularly in view of the general nature of the Bill which, in another place, deals with the repair or the demolition of insanitary houses. Purely on the question of order, it seems to me that the amendment, without any regard for its merits or demerits, is relevant.  As regards the question raised by the President, that no money is provided under this amendment to enable the Minister to carry out the duties that the amendment proposes to impose upon him, that is another matter and it is not being put to me, I take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any relation there is to unhealthy areas is simply providing an amendment to the Act of 1890, and is entirely confined to local authorities.  The Housing Acts, in so far as private persons are concerned, have never concerned themselves with the question of substitution of insanitary dwellings, and it is on the insanitary question a complete and new extension of the application of the law with regard to houses in respect of private persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that these are arguments that could well be used against the amendment. This Bill is extremely wide.  It is called a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It amends various Housing Acts in a great variety of <Col N="2207" /> ways, and any attempt to carry that amendment further, as long as it can be connected in some way with what is in the Bill, is in order.  With regard to the question of the money, Deputy O'Kelly has not spoken on that particular matter.  It could be argued that the Minister's present officers would look after that particular aspect, but the Chair is not in a position to say whether they could or could not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Chair has ruled that this amendment is in order.  I am rather at a loss to understand why there was such great anxiety on the part of the President and the Minister to have the amendment ruled out.  It is certainly interesting to observe their attitude. Perhaps before the discussion is finished the President will let us know why he was so keen on not allowing discussion on this amendment.  The amendment simply asks that certain powers should be provided and given to individuals.  This relates, particularly, to rural areas where, as everyone knows, there is at present a very big proportion of insanitary houses.  In many of these houses there are very large families.  We are anxious that there would be continued the power that has been given under different Acts here in recent years in order to permit a grant to be given to people in insanitary houses.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the amendment says:&mdash;&ldquo;Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling-house is wholly unsuitable for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier thereof and his family...&rdquo;  There are many such houses, and it would help materially to improve housing conditions if grants such as were heretofore made could be made now to people living in houses of that character, particularly in rural areas.  There should be something done to provide these people with decent housing accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody here can contend that there is not a tremendous demand for improved housing conditions in rural areas, especially houses for small farmers whose valuations are <Col N="2208" /> very low.  Local authorities, rated as heavily as they are under present conditions, find it very difficult to get money to enable them to give grants to such people for building purposes. We would like to give grants to these people to enable them to build new houses or, as is suggested in sub-section (3), to improve their present dwellings in so far as they are insanitary. If they are insanitary, everybody here would rather, if we could afford it, give them grants to help them to demolish such houses and erect proper dwellings.</P>
    <P>As our finances will not allow us to do that in every case, it would be well that the grants that were made in some years gone by for improving houses could be continued.  There is a very pressing demand.  There is frequently brought up in discussion on housing matters by our own and by other Parties, this strong and insistent demand for grants for improving rural housing.  There are farmers of small valuations in the country, with small houses and large families, and they want to improve their houses.  They want to make their houses sanitary, a condition in which they are not at the present time.  The passing of this sub-section would make possible the reconstruction or improvement of their houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate closes I want to say that Deputy O'Kelly and I have been thinking on similar lines in relation to similar amendments, but this is not one of them.  There is one factor here to which Deputy O'Kelly has not referred.  He is far too keen to overlook it and he is far too honest I am sure to mislead the House in the matter.  If Deputies look at the Bill they will see that this amendment which has been put down proposes to insert before sub-section (2) of Section 59, three new sub-sections.  It lays down that for the purposes of this section the aggregate amount of the grant made is £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore £25,000 is the total amount available for grants under this Bill.  Under the proposals in this Bill a grant of £20 is to be given by the State and £20 by the local <Col N="2209" /> authorities.  Deputy O'Kelly, in this new sub-section, proposes that as far as the State is concerned the building grant should be £80 as against £20 in the Bill.  I have often in this House before now stated that I am not a great mathematician, but even my powers of arithmetic are equal to dividing £25,000 by the figure 20 in one case and by 80 in the other. Having done that I arrive at the conclusion that whatever number of houses could be built under the scheme which is proposed in the Bill when you provide £25,000, it is fairly obvious that only one-fourth of that number can be built when the amount is divided by 80.  Consequently the nett effect of Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, subject to the overriding condition that there is only £25,000 available, means that only one house can be built under his amendment where four could be built under the section as it stands.</P>
    <P>Much as we would all like to see considerable grants given to people for building new houses, still if I had to choose between a relatively small grant given to a large number of people and four times that grant given to one-fourth the number of people, I would certainly prefer the smaller grant to the larger number of people. I presume Deputy O'Kelly will say that it was impossible for him or for any private Deputy here to propose to increase the £25,000.  That is so.  I think we have to take it that that sum of £25,000 represents the utmost amount which the Minister for Local Government and the President&mdash;I mention these two because they are present&mdash;can allocate for the purposes of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, in endeavouring to persuade the Ceann Comhairle that this amendment was out of order, I want to say now again that it is entirely contrary to the whole spirit of the 1929 Act.  In the earlier Housing Acts from 1924 to 1929, as far as reconstruction is concerned, the provision for reconstruction was made in urban areas.  The intention was to provide grants for persons with large houses to divide these houses so as to provide housing accommodation for an <Col N="2210" /> additional number of families.  There was a certain amount of direct reconstruction of ordinary houses proceeded with.  The total number of such cases was only 600, and the reconstruction was entirely confined to urban districts.  At a time when we are looking again at the amount of money which we have to spend, looking again at our urban housing problem, and, as a result of what is shown to us, then reducing the amount of assistance that we can give to people who are building houses other than houses for the working classes, as a matter of fact we are approaching the stage gradually at which no assistance from the public purse can be given directly except for the housing of the very poor and for the relief of insanitary areas&mdash;when we are approaching that stage Deputies ask us to embark on the provision of moneys for the reconstruction of houses in rural areas.  At the same time Deputy O'Kelly would go further outside the scope of the 1929 Act which, as I pointed out, was for the provision of rural houses and would apply assistance to private persons with a scheme to get rid of insanitary houses in rural areas. Urban housing conditions have been pretty fully envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is very big.  We are able to approach that problem now with a definite policy of a new kind. I pointed out on the Second Reading that these grants and provisions here, in so far as they affected rural houses, got the same condemnation from the Deputy who represented Wexford as from the Deputy who represented Leitrim.  I pointed out that, whereas 80 or 82 per cent. of the people in Wexford lived in houses of four rooms and upwards, for the area of Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, and Galway, comprising 100,000 inhabited houses, 70 per cent. of those, at least, lived in three-roomed houses and under.  Gradually, as reports from the County Medical Officers of Health have been received&mdash;that is, in places where County Medical Officers of Health have been appointed&mdash;it is clear that there is a housing problem in rural areas that can be related to a condition of unfitness for human habitation, that <Col N="2211" /> can be regarded as a problem of being insanitary, that is the insanitary house problem in our urban districts. The problem is probably very big.  A policy must be framed towards the solution of that problem analogous to the policy that is now being framed to deal with insanitary houses and the very poor in our urban districts.  We have not yet had an opporunity in respect of insanitary rural housing and the housing of the poor in rural districts of looking at our financial possibilities and the extent of the problem.  That the problem is a big one is quite clear when we realise that 70,000 people in four of these western counties are living in houses of three rooms and under.  From the 1924 Act down assistance was given directly to private persons, not because it was thought the natural thing that private persons wishing to build houses should be assisted either by the ratepayers or the taxpayers, but because of the terrible shortage of houses and of very high building costs.  That assistance for private persons was applied in rural areas as in urban areas, although it was in the urban areas that the pressure of the house shortage was greatest.  The grants to private persons in rural areas have been gradually reduced in the same way in which grants to private persons have been reduced in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ward said that he knew that many of these grants were given to persons that could have and would have built their houses without these grants.  We are now reducing gradually the assistance given to private persons and approaching the point at which the ordinary private person, whether in a rural or urban district, who may be expected to stand the cost of building his own house, will be asked to do it, with, if you like, the assistance of capital provided under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act by the State.  As far as direct assistance for the building of houses by persons other than the very poor is concerned, we are approaching the time when that assistance cannot be given.  There is a type of person building in rural districts who has been getting this <Col N="2212" /> particular type of grant and who has expected it, and will be expecting it for a short period.  We are not withdrawing the grant suddenly from these people, but taking it away gradually. We cannot, however, with due regard to all interests, the interests of the poor people in rural districts, the interests of people living in insanitary dwellings in rural districts, and the taxpayer and the ratepayer, embark in a haphazard way on a type of assistance to these until the extent of the problem that requires to be tackled in these rural districts has been very fully examined, and until there is a more general public appreciation of the extent of that problem and the amount of money likely to be involved.  For that reason, I oppose the introduction of this amendment that, in a haphazard way, seeks to take out of the £25,000, provided for the type of persons expecting continued assistance in private building such as they have had up to the present, a sum for a purpose that our Housing Acts up to the present never provided for.  In so far as it relates to insanitary houses, that is a responsibility of the local authorities, and has always been their responsibility, in respect of which they are given under this Bill additional powers under the Labourers Acts to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to understand the Minister's opposition to this amendment.  The title of the Bill is, &ldquo;An Act to make better provision for the clearance of unhealthy areas and the repair and demolition of insanitary houses...&rdquo;  If the Minister only envisaged the problem in the towns and cities in the drafting of this Bill he should have set out in the title that it was not to have any application to the rural parts of the country.  In so far as the Bill as it stands is concerned, unless this amendment is accepted by the Minister or carried by a majority of the House, it is not going to cause the disappearance or removal of any insanitary house in the rural districts.  Insanitary houses in rural Ireland are not all occupied, indeed only a very small proportion of them are occupied, by the class of people who are described as belonging to the <Col N="2213" /> working classes.  Where labourers' cottages do exist in rural areas for the housing of agricultural labourers, these houses are in a comparatively decent condition, and from the point of view of sanitation and habitability are reasonably good.  There is, of course, a shortage of these houses, but they do not constitute the insanitary houses in rural Ireland.  The insanitary houses in rural Ireland and the houses unfit for human habitation are occupied by small farmers.  The Minister admits that the problem is a very large one.  Having admitted so much, presumably he knew the problem was a very large one before he introduced the Bill, and it is difficult to understand why he made no provision to deal with this large problem.  It is all very well to talk of the financial difficulties.  Why should the rural section of the population be asked to contribute, and to continue to contribute, to finance the removal of insanitary dwellings in the urban districts and the cities while no provision is being made whereby the housing conditions under which they themselves live can be improved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>What use are the Labourers Acts to the small farmer? The only thing that can be done if that man's housing conditions are to be improved is to provide a grant large enough to buy the building materials for him and leave him a little margin over for the tradesmen.  It is suggested that there is only £25,000 available under this section, and because of that fact this amendment, if passed, will for all practical purposes be inoperative.  I do not think that is so. I think that if the Minister when the £25,000 has been expended comes to the House and asks for more money under this section, the House will not hesitate to give it.  The President expresses dissent, but we find that the President has suddenly discovered £250,000, to the surprise of everybody for the relief of unemployment out of some mysterious fund that may materialise in the future.  He has found that £250,000 on the eve of a <Col N="2214" /> general election, but he cannot find anything for the housing of the class of people this amendment is meant to serve.  The Minister says that this amendment is contrary to the spirit of the 1929 and 1930 Acts.  What difference does it make whether it is contrary to the spirit of these Acts or not?  It certainly is not contrary to the spirit of the Bill before us.  The problem about the 1929 and the 1930 and the other Acts that went before them as far as the small farmer or the occupier of an insanitary dwelling in a rural district is concerned is that he has not been able to avail of these grants to get rid of his insanitary house, because these grants have not been large enough to provide him with the building material.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said on the Second Reading, that to a very large extent the class of people who are able to avail of the provisions of the Housing Acts in rural districts were not the class of people who were living in houses unfit for human habitation.  So far as the Minister's policy has gone, and in so far as the results of the 2½ million pounds paid in State subsidies for the building of houses are concerned, for all practical purposes we have as many houses in rural Ireland unfit for human habitation as we had before any of these Acts were passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it is a very big problem, that he would like public appreciation of it, and that medical officers of health should report and all that sort of thing, until we got a full and adequate idea of the size of it.  If the problem is as great as it is, even on the Minister's own admission, why not make a beginning towards its solution?  If it is such a big problem, we are all agreed that it would take a very long time to solve it.  I cannot see why this House, considering the majority of Deputies are from rural areas, should allow this Bill to pass in its present form without some such amendment as the amendment in Deputy O'Kelly's name.  Such amendment would enable the small farmers in the country occupying one room and kitchen, with as many as ten people living in them&mdash;father, mother, and children of all sexes and all ages&mdash;to be <Col N="2215" /> rescued from such conditions.  I repeat I cannot understand how this House could stand for that sort of thing when a Bill like this is before it.  There are many houses in the rural parts of Ireland that could be reconstructed in such a way as to render them fit for human habitation, if they had decent roofs and floors, if the windows were of a decent size and constructed in a way that would enable them to open and let in fresh air to the houses.  If these things were done by means of grants towards reconstruction, a very considerable improvement would be made in the conditions under which these people live.  These things could be done if the Minister would accept this amendment.  I urge him strongly to sympathetically consider this aspect of the question.  He admits it is a big question, and I think if he is held up for finance in the carrying out of it he will have the sympathy of all Deputies in the House if he comes here to look for more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of that will he be able to cash?  The Deputy says the Minister can come here and get the money.  Of course he can. No House will ever refuse money, but let me remind the Deputy that he and his Party in the last month or six weeks voted against the imposition of taxation to enable us to discharge the ordinary commitments of the present year.  The Deputy said if the Minister wanted more money he could come here and he would get it.  The strange thing about the two Deputies opposite is that neither of them seems to have studied this problem.  There is a general election coming; they have spoken with their eye to that.  How will they make this thing difficult for the Government?  I am prepared to meet any of them on this question of housing, and on this particular question, at any time and in any part of the country, either rural or urban, and to put before the people their record in the past month when money was wanted and when they would not vote it.  No one will deny that money provided under a Housing Act to be spent by building houses must be got from somewhere.  What is the problem <Col N="2216" /> we have to deal with in connection with housing?  The main source from which to get such money is taxation. None of the Deputies opposite, though they concern themselves very largely with what are called statistics, ever bother their heads about that.  When we are considering the question of housing as a problem, what is the first thing to be done?  If they read back through the gospels of the year, they will find that going against any nation a general will first of all sit down, take up pencil and paper and make out whether or not he will be able to meet his opponents with so many or whether, if they are stronger, he will have to add more.  They have that lesson, but they do not bother about that.  They do not at all concern themselves about the number of houses that will have to be provided in this country.  What figure in the next twenty years is that likely to amount to?  They never bother their heads about an estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I shall give the figures.  In the last nine years we put up approximately or helped towards the construction of 26,000 houses in the country.  Dublin's quota of that was about 6,500, so that approximately whatever is required for Dublin is about one-fourth of the housing of the rest of the country.  Dublin's necessity in connection with the housing problem is approximately 20,000 houses.  We can take it that somebody will have to provide 80,000 houses.  Who is going to provide them?  Apparently the rest of the people of the country.  Where do we find them?  According to the last census there is something like 625,000 heads of families, but as 60,000 of these, approximately, consist of only one person, we can only come to the conclusion that approximately there are 560,000 heads of families in the country.  I shall make that quite clear and plain so that even <Col N="2217" /> Fianna Fail Deputies will understand it.  560,000 heads of families for 80,000 is at the rate of seven to one. Well, go out in the street and assemble seven men and you say to these men: &ldquo;You seven have to provide one house for one of the seven of you.&rdquo;  That is the problem.  Seven heads of families in this country have to tax themselves in order to provide one house.  Deputy Ward says if we were to come to the House we would get whatever money is necessary.  We came to the House a short time ago for half a million and the Deputy and his Party voted against it.</P>

That is the first problem that 560,000 heads of families have to provide houses for 80,000 over a period of twenty years if the problem is to be solved in that time.  What is the Deputy's solution of the problem? That out of £25,000 approximately 400 people are to be helped.  Have they bothered themselves about the finances of it or whether it is a fair figure?

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. Outside the city of Dublin, three-quarters of the money that we have provided for housing, up to the present, has been spent.  This particular method of distribution is the Deputy's solution.  If we are to take 80,000 houses on that basis, it represents a sum of five million pounds approximately, or six million if it were the whole of the 80,000.  It is not the whole; it will be approximately half way between the two.  That is in respect only of the money outgoings. Now we have to examine the Bill to see how far this amendment fits into it.  The Bill deals in the first place with insanitary areas and insanitary dwellings; in the second place with the provision of accommodation for persons who have to vacate an insanitary area, and, by <Col N="2219" /> reason of the density of population, have to be provided for outside the area; in the third place it deals with the provision of houses for private persons or virgin-soil sites or anything of that sort not embodied in the insanitary area or the extension scheme which is essential to the demolition of the insanitary area.  The basis of the arrangement is that the local authority in each case will formulate a scheme and their officials will declare whether an area is an insanitary area or not.  Why is that? For the very good reason that they have officials whose work it is to look after sanitation and who are paid for doing so.  The proposal here is that the Minister is to examine and to be satisfied.  &ldquo;Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a dwelling-house is wholly unsuitable for the proper and healthy accommodation of the occupier.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is practically to become the agent of the local authorities in these cases.  That is a complete and absolute change of the whole system of local government.  What is he to do? How is he to do it?  He cannot employ a local officer for that sort of work.  He cannot be responsible for the decision of a local authority's servant.  He must employ a staff.  What staff will be required over the whole rural areas to examine all the insanitary houses? The Deputy could put down a half a dozen questions about houses in such places and ask the Minister if he had examined them.  How many questions would be on the Order Paper in connection with the administration of this scheme?  What is going to be the cost and how is it going to benefit housing to get that information?  A new system is to superimpose on the existing system that is capable of dealing with it.  If it were a local authority that had to decide that a house was insanitary, this might be said for it, that whoever framed an amendment concerned himself with a constructive policy for housing rather than with the platform effects of housing just before a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the construction of the Bill and how the Minister proposes the machinery would operate with respect to inter <Col N="2221" /> sanitary areas through the sanitary authorities and the medical officers of health.  In the amendment it is proposed that the Minister should be practically in that position.  I need not point out to anyone interested in local government the ridiculousness of that position.  If the amendment were passed Deputy Corish could perhaps ask the Minister about every insanitary house in Wexford County.  Deputy O'Kelly could ask the Minister if he had inspected every insanitary house in Dublin.  Apart from that, the definition of &ldquo;insanitary dwelling&rdquo; is to my mind not exactly in accord with what is usually laid down in other Acts. Reference is made to unhealthy dwelling houses in Sections 3, 5, 19 and 21, and there is reference to rooms in Section 22.  There are further references in Section 27 and 30, and insanitary areas are mentioned in Section 42.  In certain cases provision is made for appeal to the Circuit Court in respect of some of these declarations.  There is no such provision in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, this alters the whole method of dealing with local authorities.  If this amendment were meant to be operative&mdash;which I do not believe it was&mdash;the cost in respect of the running of it by the Department of Local Government would be approximately £1,000 a county.  Is it contended that we are going to solve the housing question by increasing the number of our officials?  Take that section which deals with the reconstruction of houses.  Two decisions have got to be made in that case.  In the first place, it must be described as an insanitary dwelling.  In the second place, some official must be in a position to give a certificate that the work has been satisfactorily done.  More cost.  The expenses in respect of the administration of this amendment would be colossal, and housing is not a service on which one can afford to expend money unless one sees houses going up.  There has been a reduction in the cost of building over recent years.  In 1922, the average price per square foot was approximately 14/6.  In 1931, it is 10/6.  The original sum made available for house-building was reduced during those years practically in accord with the drop in the percentage <Col N="2222" /> of cost.  The cost of providing one house is going to fall approximately upon seven persons.  Let us see what the financial situation is. There is a sum of £25,000 made available in this measure for private persons. That is a relatively small sum. It is fixed in the light of the difficult financial situation we have&mdash;a most unusual situation.  A most unusual occurrence took place this year.  It was found that the level of taxation did not produce the money required. Extra imposts had to be provided by law in order to produce the money which was estimated as being likely to be required in April last.  This is a time when we have got to consider the economy of every single Act that passes through this House, and to limit as far as possible the cost to the taxpayer of every service that comes before us. If we were dealing with the financial situation that obtained twelve months ago this Bill could have been and would have been more generous than it is.  But we have got to realise that a reduction in the yield of taxation is a serious indication of the condition of affairs as regards finance.  Whether we should ignore that fact and go on with expense is a matter upon which the Oireachtas must make up its mind.</P>
    <P>The Government in putting before the Oireachtas this method of dealing with the housing problem, had in mind what it was likely to be able to impose upon the taxpayers during the next five years.  The basis upon which the costs of this Act are being laid upon the shoulders of the taxpayer and ratepayer is that each will contribute his quota in the ratio of fifty-fifty towards the solution of this problem. There is no such policy enshrined in this amendment.  Before concluding, I want to say that in the year 1922 the yield of taxation was approximately £25,000,000.  The sum of money made available for local authorities in that year was approximately £1,000,000. This year taxation is estimated to yield £21,700,000 and the sum made available for local authorities this year is £3,700,000.  With these facts before the House, is this amendment designed in the interest of the taxpayer, the ratepayer <Col N="2223" /> and the person who requires a house?  I do not believe it is.  I do not believe it is a sensible or constructive suggestion as regards dealing with this matter.  It disturbs the basis of the operations of the Bill which deal with insanitary areas and houses, by placing upon the Minister the responsibility of declaring them insanitary and adding costs to the State in respect of the administration of that portion of the Bill.  Secondly, it imposes upon the taxpayer a contribution which, if it is intended to persevere, is beyond his capacity to bear at the present moment. Thirdly, if that be the contribution which the Deputies who have put down this amendment believe to be within the capacity of the country in respect of insanitary dwellings in the country, then I say in respect of slum areas in cities, towns and villages the Minister's figures&mdash;if this figure is correct&mdash; are entirely and utterly insufficient and should be increased.  Then we are faced with the problem of assembling the seven heads of families and telling them that we are imposing upon them a burden for the building of a house for one of the seven which is greater than they ought normally be called upon to bear&mdash;a burden that no citizen, looking at the problem and having in mind the condition of affairs in the country, could honestly and with due regard to all the circumstances put upon them in connection with the problem of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The best two arguments for the amendment in the name of Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly were made by the President and the Minister. If they had not spoken, one might have felt that a lot of things had been left unsaid by the supporters of the amendment.  The President's remarks at the beginning of the speech were not very germane to the amendment. They were as far removed from the subject of insanitary housing accommodation in rural areas and as close to personalities as they could be.  The President said that roughly 80,000 houses were required in the 26 counties.  Nobody has suggested, as the President tried to make out, that <Col N="2224" /> these 80,000 houses should be built in one financial year and that the contribution by taxpayers towards the cost of those houses should be levied in one financial year.  The President knows that very well.  If we were to proceed to liquidate the liability to the people of this country in respect of housing accommodation and if, starting now, we were to do it over a period of 20 years&mdash;that is, in respect both of rural and urban housing&mdash;we would be doing something.  The President visualised the Minister himself or his messenger going down under this amendment and examining a particular house and then going back later and saying that it had complied with the requirements.  The President knows very well that he has imposed upon many counties, and has the right to impose on every county, a medical officer of health costing a thousand a year.  Surely the medical officer of health is the Minister's official.  He gets a salary of £1,000 a year and should be competent to describe to the Minister whether a particular house is insanitary or not, and where it has been repaired that it has complied with the requirements in his opinion.  It is all nonsense for the President to say that extra officials would be required&mdash;an extra £1,000 per county to administer this.  Even if the President's statement were correct that it would require that to liquidate the responsibility of the State towards solving the housing problem and meeting the requirements so far as the 80,000 houses spoken of are concerned, that would not be such a terrible thing.  The Minister has his medical officers of health, and I hold they should be competent to do this with their other work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the £250,000 suddenly conjured out of thin air for the immediate relief of distress.  I recommend the President to write another letter.  If he does possibly he will get £250,000 towards the solution of the housing problem.  If he embodies in his letter the speech that he has just made here he may get some reply to it.  The President's contribution in the debate on this amendment was a complete admission of failure to <Col N="2225" /> deal with the problem.  Because the problem is too big for him or his Government he refuses to face up to it. He is prepared to allow continue the position that we have, particularly in the rural areas.  The housing shortage there, keen as it is, must remain, according to him.  There is no promise from the Minister for Local Government that he intends by another Bill to deal with that subject in a short space of time.  When a Bill was introduced, and we asked to have a proper title put to it, that it was a Bill particularly for towns and cities, we were pooh-poohed and told that it was a Bill for the whole of the 26 counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister admits&mdash;probably he has had reports from his medical officers of health&mdash;that there are insanitary dwellings in rural areas.  He has probably got a real shock from the number of complaints he has received, and realises that it is going to be a big problem to tackle.  There is a lot of talk about the £25,000.  Does the Minister contend that on his estimate that sum of money is going to touch the fringe of the problem so far as it relates to insanitary dwellings in the urban areas&mdash;towns and cities?  Deputy Law divided that sum of £25,000 by the Minister's contribution of £20 as set down in the Bill, so the result is that the amount available will only deal with 1,250 houses.  This Bill proposes not only to give no attention to the rural areas, but to limit the Government's responsibility with regard to insanitary dwellings in urban areas&mdash; cities and towns&mdash;to the extent of 1,250 houses.  If that is to be the Government's contribution towards the urban areas, then I say, bad and all as it is to do nothing for the rural areas, the Government are only making an apology in the matter of doing something in the other areas.  The Minister's confession of failure is &ldquo;I realise the sore is there, and I am not going to deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Ward points out that something must be done.  He is familiar with the conditions in the rural areas and he has described them for the House.  There are many other members of the House who also represent rural areas.  If what the Deputy has <Col N="2226" /> described is correct, then it is a disgrace for the Minister to adopt the attitude that he has adopted.  What are we taunted with?  The President turns around and asks, &ldquo;How many houses have you built?&rdquo;  I will put the some question to the Minister.  Can he say that he has even built one house? How many houses has the President built?  When we propose to deal with this problem we are taunted with these questions.  Deputy Ward has been asked how many houses he has built.  Out of his small resources and influence, from the point of view of building, the Deputy can say that he has built 70 houses.  When one compares his resources with those of the Government, I think the Deputy has certainly made a bigger contribution to the problem than they have. That kind of discussion had, I think, better be left alone by the President. I wonder how many houses the members of the President's own Party have built.  Deputy Ward has built 70 houses not out of his own pocket.  The Minister takes credit for the number of houses that the State has built, but we can turn around and say that the money that went to the building of them was not his but the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I hope the President and the Minister will cease that kind of talk and get down to fundamentals.  By means of Parliamentary questions we dragged from the Government the information that the number of families living in single room tenements in Dublin is 18,000.  We feel sad about that as everybody does.  The President says that 80,000 houses are required and because our requirements are so great let us drop the whole thing.  Our answer is, tackle the problem now and make some contribution towards the alleviation of the distress that such a state of affairs must cause.  We say to the Government, contribute something towards the upliftment and the health of the people whether in urban or in rural areas; do not pretend that by allowing £25,000 to be used for certain purposes and affecting only 1,250 houses in the cities and the towns that that is going to mean anything.  If that sum of money were allocated to the city of <Col N="2227" /> Dublin alone it would not touch the fringe of the problem that is to be dealt with here.</P>
    <P>The President talked of the damage that might be caused if questions were to be asked by Deputies week after week with regard to particular houses in a particular area.  The Minister for Local Government took steps to prevent that kind of activity developing as regards old age pensions.  When Deputies sought to take steps to see that justice was done as between old age pension claimants and the pension officers, the Minister put a stop to that.  Now the President comes along and grumbles at the thought that questions might be asked in the House in regard to a particular dwelling in the country.  Does the Minister deny my positive statement that his medical officers of health throughout the country are fully competent to deal with this matter, and that there would be no need to spend one single penny extra in the shape of official salaries if they were to be required to do what is asked here.  They are competent to certify whether a particular dwelling in a rural area is insanitary or not.  They are also competent to certify and to satisfy the Minister in cases where improvements have been carried out whether the work has been done in a proper manner.  Does the Minister deny that, or does he stand by what the President said, that these men are incompetent to render that particular service?  I hope Deputies will have the good sense to support the amendment.</P>
    <P>After all, as Deputy Ward points out, every penny that the State spends as a contribution towards housing, whether by way of grant for a new house or a grant for altering an insanitary house, comes from all classes of taxpayers and not exclusively from taxpayers of urban areas.  Unless the Minister can say definitely that he intends to bring in a Bill specifically designed to deal with houses in rural areas, he has no case for opposing the amendment.  Certainly from his own contribution to the debate and from the President's contribution they have shown absolute justification for the amendment.  If the Minister does not <Col N="2228" /> like the proposal that he shall be the final authority, he can very easily accept the amendment and leave it to the local authority to deal with it. That is an easy matter to get over. If he is going to take the attitude of saying &ldquo;because I happen to be mentioned in the Bill, the thing shall not be done,&rdquo; I think he is not going to face up, as the President has admitted he is not going to face up, to the problem.  The Minister himself must admit that he does not want to tackle the housing problem in the rural areas at all and he is only attempting to tackle it in the urban areas to a very small degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): The principal fault which the Minister found with the amendment is that it is against the spirit of present housing legislation. I think that has a great deal to recommend it because the present housing legislation, as I see it in operation, has no spirit It is a soulless thing endeavouring to move and getting nowhere.  The Minister has in this measure made building operations in the non-urbanised towns almost impossible.  He has made it almost impossible for local authorities to undertake any extensive building operations in non-urbanised towns. When we come to deal with the truly rural places we find that he refuses to accept an amendment of legislation that is long overdue.  For some time past, when we were discussing housing legislation here, appeals had been made and claims put forward from I think almost every side of the House that improvement grants should be given towards the reconstruction of houses in rural districts.  Anybody who knows country districts thoroughly knows that houses in rural areas lend themselves very considerably towards improvement, and that a good many of the drawbacks and the drabness of country life are attributable to bad housing conditions.  Roofs are low, windows are small, floors are bad and the ventilation necessarily bad and inadequate.  The space is inadequate. The raising of roofs, the raising of walls, the improvement of roofs, the enlargement of windows and <Col N="2229" /> the improvement of floors would very considerably improve the great majority of houses in rural districts. A grant towards doing all that would probably do more towards relieving this shortage of eighty thousand houses about which we hear the President talk, than anything that might be done.  That is very necessary.</P>
      <P>Appeals have been made, not alone from these benches and the Fianna Fail benches, but statements have been made from the Minister's own benches that some such measure is needed, and that some such consideration should be given.  We do know that in rural Ireland a state of affairs exists where there are probably two divisions in a house and where probably, for decency sake, two divisions are made in one room, with inadequate cubic space, wretched flooring conditions and ventilation. These things could be easily remedied by raising the wall or, possibly, as Deputy Bennett said a while ago, by providing a loft-room which would help to give accommodation in the house.  That is a thing to which the Minister should give consideration. He told us that he knows of its existence, but that he cannot deal with it. He told us that he has only £25,000 to play with.  Surely that shows the bankruptcy of the Minister's housing policy. It shows his failure to face up to the situation as it exists.  He has £25,000, and he knows that that will not touch the fringe of it.  The President, dealing with the matter a little while ago, purposely confused the issues, because if there is a question about which the President knows anything, we must admit without equivocation that it is housing.  I admit that freely, but he certainly got up not to deal with the housing situation in Ireland, but to confuse the issue and to create an atmosphere in the House against the amendment.  That is the way he dealt with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he wants money there has been a suggestion put forward from these benches before that there is a method of dealing with the housing problem on a national scale by the raising of a national loan to meet the contingency, and to meet it in a way which would eradicate the sore that is eating like a <Col N="2230" /> canker into the social fabric.  We heard a lot of talk about the impracticability of it.  Possibly the amendment is badly drafted.  Possibly it is not related sufficiently to the local authority.  I am speaking without any information as to what Deputy O'Kelly had in his mind when he said &ldquo;Where in the opinion of the Minister a dwelling-house is wholly unsuitable.&rdquo;  I should rather say &ldquo;Where in the opinion of the local sanitary authority a dwelling-house is unsuitable.&rdquo;  You could very easily correlate that with the local housing authority.  You can very easily make your assistant surveyors the people to examine the houses and make their certificate the certificate under which the improvement or the rebuilding grant would be given.  Clearly the thing could be worked and clearly the attitude of the President and of the Minister should be to accept the principle of the amendment and to redraft it in such a way that it would be possible for the grant to be given to the local authorities who declare a house insanitary and for the local assistant surveyor's certificate to be the certificate upon which payment would be made.  The building of houses in rural areas is a necessity.  The improvement of houses in rural areas is a greater necessity.  While I support heartily the amendment as far as it goes for the giving of grants for the construction of houses, I support more heartily the suggestion in the amendment for the improvement of houses because houses in the rural areas lend themselves much more readily to reconstruction than any other type of houses we have in the country at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, no matter what the President may pretend about it, would be the only thing in this Bill if it were accepted, which would give an opportunity to small farmers either to improve or build houses under the measure when it is passed into law.  No matter what statements the President is pleased to make about this amendment in order to confuse the issue, that is the fact. When previous Housing Bills were introduced here, we on this side on one <Col N="2231" /> occasion had an amendment down which was somewhat similar to the present amendment, that a grant would be given to small farmers throughout the country for the improvement of their houses.  Anybody who understands the position of housing in rural Ireland will have to admit that the greatest necessity of the moment is the improvement of dwelling-houses in the country and not the building of new houses. Take as an illustration of that the number of houses that have been built. Mind you, the Minister for Local Government and the President have tried to make all the Party capital they can out of the number of new houses built over a number of years.  Even if we take that number in its largest way, and allow the President to exaggerate the value and the number of houses in the most elaborate way, we still have to admit that the building of that large number of new houses has not touched the fringe of the housing problem in insanitary areas, because of this fact, people in most instances, throughout the country, built houses and availed of this plan, who could afford to have built them without a grant, and would have built them anyhow.  That is the position in the West of Ireland, and let nobody pretend that it is not.  A very small percentage of the people in the West of Ireland who built houses under the old housing grants built them because of the grant.  The big majority who built them probably might have delayed a year or two, but anyway they hurried on to avail of the grant.  If the amendment we proposed a couple of years ago on another Housing Bill were accepted to give £40 or thereabouts to the people who would improve their dwelling-houses, you would have a far greater percentage of insanitary housing conditions removed than you had under the Bills as they were.  That is the one big mistake in all the Housing Bills which have been passed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan has emphasised that fact as to Clare.  He knows the conditions there.  We know them too, Unless you accept this amendment the insanitary conditions in the West of Ireland will not be touched at all by this <Col N="2232" /> measure.  It is no use for the President to pretend that he is not aware of the insanitary conditions.  The medical officers of health in every county have been reporting to the Minister for Local Government the insanitary conditions of housing and the number of insanitary houses.  Can the Minister state here now that a large percentage of those houses that were insanitary have been made sanitary because of any Bill passed into law, since he came into office?  Can he state that the number of houses reported as insanitary to his Department are not now in that insanitary condition, because of any Bill that has been passed?  He cannot say that.  A number of houses remain insanitary, but new houses have been built.  That is because they refused in the past to regulate the measure that was being passed in such a way that people in insanitary houses could avail of a small grant to improve their houses.  The Minister must surely know that the number of insanitary houses in County Mayo is very large despite the fact that he may boast of the number of houses that have been built in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is not passed the same number of insanitary houses will remain.  Is it not better for the State that the greater percentage of people living in insanitary houses should be facilitated so as to avail of the grant? Get a smaller amount of money, spread it over a larger number and relieve people to a greater extent than they would be relieved by the giving of a grant for one house only.  That is the part of the Bill I am interested in.  I have discussed it with people who in the past were in the Department of Local Government and were interested in housing.  They told me that from their experience in the past of schemes under the Congested Districts Board a greater number of insanitary houses were made sanitary and improved with a lesser amount of money than has been spent by the present Government on housing, because there was that clause in the Act which enabled people to avail of a grant for the improvement of housing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should at least say that this amendment would be <Col N="2233" /> considered by him.  He should know its value and that it will touch the insanitary conditions if it is accepted. He should, in turning the amendment down, not force the members of his Party to vote against it.  It is not put down as the President tries to suggest in his usual petty fashion for electioneering purposes.  We leave that to the President.  He has discovered £250,000 in the last few days in a place where no one knew it existed and that money is to be used for election purposes.  He cannot say that this has been for electioneering purposes because it is over three years ago since a similar amendment was put down by this Party in this House.  At that time they found some other argument against it.  The only argument they can find against it now is that it is done for electioneering purposes, because the President thinks the financial appeal of the Unionists will give him sufficient funds for the election within a short period.  Why cannot they find some reasonable argument against this amendment?  We had the President's talk about the possibility or impossibility of finding of money. We had a statement from the President that this Bill would not be as bad as it is&mdash;even from the President we got an admission that it is a bad Bill&mdash;only for the financial crash.  We had quite recently this unfortunate admission from the President of the State, who is so proud of this State and its stable conditions.  We had it from him that the Bill would not be as bad as it is only for the trouble we are in financially. As well as being an unfortunate admission, it is also an eye-opener for us, because the Minister for Finance, in introducing his supplementary Budget, assured us that economy would be rigidly enforced by the Government.</P>
    <P>Now we know in what way economy is to be rigidly enforced.  It is to be rigidly enforced in attacking the estimates that are to come for social services and the estimates that are to deal with the poorest of the poor, in attacking the estimates for the money that is to be given for housing in the slums in the towns and in the country, the money that was to go to house the poor, to wipe out insanitary conditions, <Col N="2234" /> and thereby wipe out disease and slums.  The money is now to be reduced.  We are to economise there. We have got the assurance of the President that it is one of the big ways in which they are to economise.  The President after making that statement began to criticise members on this side of the House because we voted a few weeks ago against extra taxation here. He found fault with it.  The greatest justification for the vote which we gave a few weeks ago against half a million pounds of increased taxation was the statement of the President here that economy was to be practised in the social services.</P>
    <P>That, anyhow, justified us in voting against increased taxation, because we voted against that increase in taxation for no other reason than that taxation was being increased before the President or the Minister for Finance made any definite statement as to how they were going to economise, even though they told us that they were going to economise to the tune of half a million pounds.  Instead of the President having to reduce the amount that was to be given to the housing of the poor and the wiping out of insanitary conditions in the country, he could easily increase it if instead of coming down first and foremost on the services that have to deal with the poor he would economise in other directions.  When he talks of their having to economise in this way, I think we should remind him that he should find other ways, and that instead of subsidising other countries to the tune of £5,000,000 per year he should deal with the conditions here.  Even the President himself felt that his arguments were weak.</P>
    <P>Another argument used was that if this amendment were passed officials would be increased because officials would have to be sent around to see what houses are insanitary, as according to the wording of the amendment the Minister must be satisfied that houses are insanitary before they are to be condemned and new houses erected.  Is not the Minister all along being informed as to insanitary conditions of houses in the country?  What are his medical officers of health for? You do not need to increase the number <Col N="2235" /> of medical officers of health in County Mayo to find out what insanitary houses are there.  The reports of the medical officers of health should be a sufficient indication to the Minister that he could state definitely that a certain number of houses are insanitary and, therefore, give the concession that is asked for in this amendment. Surely it is reasonable to expect that. I do not think that the Minister can make any real argument against it, except the lack of funds.  I admit that that is a real argument.  But the intentions of the amendment are good. Surely these things cannot be denied in justice by the Minister.  It all comes back, therefore, to the argument that we are short of money and that we can only give £25,000.  Surely the resources of the State have not run out to that extent.  We were on the verge of a financial crash a few weeks ago and yet the Government, on one minute's notice, found £2,000,000 for the Shannon Scheme that they have all messed up.  How is it they found that?  If the Shannon Scheme had gone right that £2,000,000 would be here.  I suppose if something else would happen in another Department to show up the mismanagement of affairs by another Minister they would easily find another million pounds to put it right.  But when an essential social service comes to be tackled they can find no money for it.  They are prepared to put it aside.  I think it is deplorable, and I think it should be faced up to by the Minister.  We should at least have a definite statement from them that they do not want to tackle the question or we should get the confession of failure which their opposition to this amendment means.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because housing conditions in the rural areas are very closely under consideration by us that we oppose this amendment. Deputies on the other side have talked a lot about rural housing and what they require done for housing, and they put forward an amendment which would show very little consideration for rural housing if it were examined pretty closely.  Earlier today <Col N="2236" /> we passed Part III of this Bill, which gives power to an urban authority to declare that a particular house is in an insanitary condition and that it requires to be repaired.  We gave powers to the local authority to insist on the owner at his own expense putting that house in a sanitary condition. A terrible lot of tears have been spilt over rural housing and over an amendment which would give that person ordered by the local authority to put his house in proper repair, to turn to the Minister and get £40.  The person who would be ordered by the local authority to put a house that is in an insanitary condition in proper repair would be handed £40 out of the £25,000.  That would mean that there would be very little to give around for some of the rural schemes that Deputies talked about.  It is because Deputies have not considered the rural problem that they have come forward with a proposal like this as a solution of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The house must be suitable to be occupied by a person of the working class.  That particular part of the Bill is designed mainly to deal with tenement dwellings in the city.  The houses intended to be covered by this amendment are houses occupied by the owners.  There are very few such houses in Dublin. They are mainly in rural areas and owned and occupied by farmers. Consequently, it is quite clear that there is quite an unmistakable distinction between houses intended to be dealt with by Part III of the Bill and houses intended to be dealt with by this amendment.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) (a), line 10, the words &ldquo;provided that a farmer whose sole or main source of living is derived from land the valuation of which does not exceed £15 be given a grant of £45.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> The main purpose of this amendment is to give to small farmers under a £15 valuation a grant of £45.  This class of person cannot get any grant from any other source such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The President cannot hold that these are people who could build houses themselves or who would be in a position to do so if there was no grant at all. I think this amendment could easily be accepted.  It is confined to small holders under a £15 valuation who derive their living mainly from farming. They are the class who are very badly off in the way of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Much the same case exists in this instance as existed in the last.  These Housing Acts have been in operation now for something like seven years and a considerable inroad has been made upon the problem since 1924.  If the revenue position were better than it is, this Bill might possibly have been more generous, but that is a consideration which we cannot remove from observation at the moment.  It may be that if we see an improvement, this particular grant might be reconsidered but at the present moment I am not in a position to justify any change in the financial side of the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>The case that was made on the last amendment, as the President said, is practically the same case that could be made for this, except that this amendment is not so wide and it confines the grants to a definite class of person.  It provides for a farmer whose sole or main source of living is derived from land the valuation of which does not exceed £15.  That is limiting the persons to whom it is proposed to apply this amendment to a certain definite section of the population. Undoubtedly there might be additional funds required.  I do not know to what extent.  I do not know if anybody could tell right off what the extent would be to which money would be required at present.  But if the amendment were passed an estimate could be made between now and the Report Stage.  Again I repeat what <Col N="2240" /> one of my colleagues said speaking on the last amendment, when it is so easy to find £250,000 for other purposes, desirable purposes no doubt, it is reasonable to believe that some additional money could be found for such eminently desirable purposes as this is.</P>

      <P>The case is a good one for this amendment.  I know a considerable amount or at least an average amount about housing conditions in Dublin.  I know much less about housing conditions in rural areas, but I know enough to know that the conditions of housing in rural areas amongst small farmers is not anything like what it ought to be.  Housing in fact is in a deplorable condition in many counties. It is quite true that the present might not be the most auspicious moment in which to find money.  It is quite true that it is more difficult to find money now than it was in 1924 or 1925 or 1926. But the money was not found in these earlier years, and no real attempt was made to tackle this problem of rural housing any more than there was a satisfactory attempt made to tackle the question of urban housing.  The attempt must be made some time and the sooner the better.  The case is a good one considering the class of people it is intended to benefit under this amendment and I think the House ought to support it.</P>

      <P>The speech we have just listened to is on a par with every contribution to this debate made by the same Deputy.  He tells us that nothing has been done.  The fact of the matter is that 11,245 houses have been provided, and the Government <Col N="2241" /> contribution up to date is £712,000. As far as this particular amendment is concerned, it is practically the same as the last.  The proposal is that, whether a house is insanitary or not the £45 is to be found.  Well, it can be found out of the £25,000, but it simply means that only half the number will be provided.  As I have said already, the financial basis of this Bill is on the assumption that the ratepayers will contribute a quota of an equal amount with the taxpayers.  That basis runs through the whole of the measure.  This has nothing whatever to do with the £250,000.  There seems to be a great deal of dissatisfaction about the discovery of that particular money.  The sum of money provided in respect of housing for the last ten years is £2,500,000.  Whether that can go on at the same pace for the next ten years I am unable to say.  The finances made available in this Bill are finances which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, represent the capacity of the taxpayers to bear. That is one of the main considerations in connection with the solution of any problem.  It will be equally the main consideration for any Government other than this Government.</P>

      <P>I will discuss it on that understanding.  I am glad the President realises that the financial situation in the country has nothing to do with this amendment.  The question at issue is whether within the limits of £25,000 we are going to adopt the principle of grading our housing grants in accordance with the financial position of the persons to be assisted. The President has indicated the number of houses built under various Housing Acts.  Who are the people occupying these houses?  Are they the people who are in most urgent need of houses?  The fact is that about 50 per cent. of the houses erected are five-roomed houses costing £500 to £600 to build.</P>

      <P>A greater volume of the assistance given by the State to housing has gone to the people who, although in need of houses, were much less urgently in need of houses than those whom it is intended to assist under this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We may take that as being so by reason of the fact that about 50 per cent. of the houses were five-roomed houses, about 30 per cent. were four-roomed, and there was a smaller percentage of three-roomed houses.  All that would seem to suggest that the greater part of the money was given to better class persons who sought to avail of the Housing Acts. The purpose of the amendment is to endeavour to secure out of the £25,000 a maximum assistance to persons in rural areas who are in need of houses and who cannot afford to finance the erection of a house for themselves.  As Deputy Clery said some time ago, a large number of people got assistance under the Housing Acts who themselves would have built houses in any case even if there had been no grants available.  People who are earning a living out of agriculture upon farms with a valuation of £15 or less cannot build houses unless assisted with a substantial grant.  We believe that the proposed grant of £20, even with a grant of £20 from the local authority, will not be adequate as far as these <Col N="2243" /> people are concerned, and in their cases this measure will be inoperative because they will be unable to provide the balance necessary even for a three-roomed house.</P>
      <P>£25,000 is the limit which the President says the State can afford to give in grants under this part of the Bill. If that is so, I think it is desirable that we should try and ensure that that money will go to those who need houses most and go to them in a manner which will enable them to avail of it to improve their housing accommodation.  That is the purpose of the amendment and that is why we are proposing it.  It raises a different issue altogether from that raised on the last amendment and one which should be very seriously considered before being rejected.</P>

      <P>In the absence of information from the Government as to what their commitments are in so far as this £25,000 is concerned, it is very hard to have any kind of an intelligent discussion on the matter.  I take it that the £25,000 mentioned by the Minister and the President is in connection with houses started within the last five or six months and as to which a promise has been made by the Minister that a certain grant will be paid.  Am I correct in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass and I think that special consideration ought to be given to the small farmers whose houses are practically falling down and who, in many cases, would require to build new houses.  I also agree with Deputy Lemass that certain speculators have been provided with money to build houses, and I suggest to the Minister and the President that they themselves even never intended that these people should be helped through the medium of an Act specially introduced for the housing of the working classes.  I know of cases where private speculators have built houses and got grants of £60 and in some cases £80. They also got a rebate of rates.  They took full advantage of that when <Col N="2244" /> assessing the rents and as a result are drawing 15 per cent. profit on their money.  I would be sorry to think that that was the intention of the President in introducing these Acts which were called Acts for the housing of the working classes.  I suggest that it is small farmers and people of that type that we ought to consider in a Bill of this kind before we consider giving anything at all to people who are well able to build houses for themselves without receiving any grant. From that angle I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in connection with the amendment of Deputy Allen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that a grant of £45 should be given to people with a valuation of £15 or under, and has been attacked by the President on entirely different grounds from those on which he attacked the other amendment.  He attacked this amendment by saying that it was not specified that only people with insanitary houses could get a grant, while he attacked the other amendment because it was confined to people living in insanitary houses.  He cannot have it both ways. The last amendment was defeated because the President said it was confined to people living in insanitary houses.  He wants this amendment defeated because it is not confined to people living in insanitary houses. That is a ridiculous attitude to take up and he cannot be serious in it.  If that is his argument against the amendment, we would be willing to confine the amendment to people living in insanitary houses.  Would the President accept it then?  Of course he would not.  He would not even think it worth while to consider it even then.  Surely he cannot be serious.  Surely an amendment of this kind is not a frivolous one.  He should realise that when we laid down the valuation of persons who should get this grant and confine it to people who derived their livelihood from the land, we had in mind people living in insanitary houses.  The President, if he knew anything of the insanitary conditions under which farmers have to live, <Col N="2245" /> should know that it is people with valuations of £15 and under who are living in the insanitary houses.  Surely the President should give us credit for these intentions, but I suppose he will not.  When he cannot attack this amendment from one point of view he goes back on his previous argument on another amendment and attacks it from another point of view.  That is not a lead that should be given by the President.  The President should discuss this matter on a higher plane.</P>
      <P>In justice to everybody who is concerned with the insanitary conditions under which the people live this should be dealt with in a fair way and there should be some decent way of tackling the question of insanitary dwellings. The President's argument was that if we give a grant of £45 to people whose valuation is under £15 we will limit the number of houses to be built.  I would even approve of that.  I would prefer that less houses should be built, provided it is ensured that they are built for people with insanitary houses.  Under the President's scheme people with very good housing accommodation will be able to build houses and they will be the only people who can afford to avail of the Bill in rural areas.  Would it not be better to make it possible for people living in insanitary houses to build than to allow them to continue to live in disease-ridden houses?  It would be much better to do it by this method.  As the other amendment was defeated, it would be a good gesture and something decent on the part of the President to accept this amendment. I do not think that any Government Deputy will say that this is unfair or unjust to any section of the community anxious to build houses. It is as a matter of fact a method of meeting them and giving them a chance to build.  When the justice of the case has to be admitted, could not the President meet us and accept the amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the principle of the amendment, but, on the whole, I think it would not be fair to give a grant of £45 to farmers whose valuation does not exceed £15 and only give £20 to farmers, say, with <Col N="2246" /> a valuation of £16.  Deputies forget one very material fact in connection with the giving either of a grant of £45 or of £20, and that is that the grant is contingent on the local authority in whose area the house is to be erected, making a similar grant.  As I have said over and over again in this House, there is a limit to what this country can afford by way of subsidies and in the near future I hope to see subsidies done away with altogether and the building industry standing on its own legs.  If unemployment increases here, the building or repairing of houses will be of very little avail.  It would be better to devote any money that we have at our disposal towards giving employment rather than building or repairing houses.  My chief objection to the amendment is that it is class legislation.  Deputy Clery may laugh, but I should like him to show where it is not.</P>

      <P>I may be a Government Deputy or I may not, according to Deputy Clery, but I am always prepared to face facts.  I have done as much as anybody else to have houses erected for the working classes and o help people who needed houses badly. If this amendment is accepted, it would mean a great deal of extra work on the Local Government Department.  It will mean that officials will have to be sent round the country to see that the valuation of those who apply for the grant is under £15 and that will mean a great deal of extra expense.  On the whole, I think the Government are doing very well in providing the money they have provided, with the limited means at their disposal, in an attempt to solve the housing problem.  I think it is only by the co-operation of all classes that any definite advance can be made in regard to the provision of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the last to wish to make any distinction in the matter of housing between town dwellers and the rural population, but I would like the Minister to take note of the fact that there is much complaint particularly amongst small farmers regarding this housing grant. Houses are badly wanted for the workers in the towns, but the small farmers say that either directly or indirectly they have to pay a good deal of the money for these schemes and that they get very little advantage out of them.  Deputy Coburn spoke of the necessity of giving employment.  We know the condition under which the small farmer lives, and we know that the small farmer could hardly live on his farm unless he had a son or two to help him.  They often remain with their fathers until 40 years of age. As we know, the farmers' sons cannot now emigrate, and surely it would be giving employment if the farmer got this grant of £45 to help to build or reconstruct his house.  They could do a great deal more work upon their houses for £45 than a town dweller could do.  We have had reference to the housing of the working classes.  I consider that the hardest of all workers in the country is the small farmer.  I call him nothing but a worker, and a very hard worker at that.  There is very great need for an amendment, such as that we are now discussing.  Among the small farmers of Galway, I know many cases myself. It surely would not necessitate sending officials through the country ascertaining valuations when we know it has been the duty of the Land Commission and the Land Registry to find out the valuation of every man's farm.  Is Deputy Coburn so simple as to believe the Land Commission does not know the valuation of farms.  I do not think that it is making any great distinction, considering the operations of previous Acts, that this grant should be made to anyone with a valuation of £15 and under.</P>

A man with a valuation of £15 1s. is out, but a valuation of £15 is in.  If the Deputy takes that line obviously valuation must be perfect all over the country. We know it is not.  We know that there are cases of men with £12 valuation who are much better off than people who have an £18 valuation.</P>

It may not operate perfectly fairly as between the £15 and the £16, but it will operate to show that a man with a valuation under £15, whether that valuation be £14 or £13 or £11, will be able to get more assistance than the man above £15.

If I thought this amendment would help rural housing I would be in favour of it.  Taking the Co.

The amendment does not stand by itself, It stands with the amendment that follows, amendment 30, which proposes to delete paragraph (c) of the section, in which case the money will become available to these farmers, irrespective of whether the local authority put up any money or not.  If Deputy O'Hanlon is really in sympathy with the amendment he is bound to vote for it and the next amendment.  His whole problem would then be solved.

      <P>I move amendment 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>The paragraph of the sub-section which I propose to omit is that which restricts the grant of £20 to cases in which the local authority shall be willing to supplement that with an equivalent sum.  This is a comparatively minor question&mdash;a question of detail and of administration.  I am not myself aware why the Minister has for, I think, the first time imported this condition into a provision dealing with grants.  I am not voicing a particular or a local grievance.  I think it is only fair to say that my own county has benefited quite considerably under previous Acts.  We have had a very considerable number of houses built in County Donegal with the aid of the various grants obtainable in previous years.  I do not know the exact number but I know from my own observation that the number is considerable.  Under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, the poorer quarters of the county have benefited, I understand, to the extent of about 500 houses, at a cost of something like £36,000.  I am not voicing, therefore, a particular grievance. Further, having regard to the character of the operation of recent housing Acts, I do feel that it may reasonably be said that it is now the turn of the cities.  The main purpose of this Bill is the removal of the slum problem.  For that reason, I am prepared loyally to acquiesce in the decision already come to by which the amount available for grants in the future will be cut down to a relatively small sum.  At the same time, I do not wish to see that sort of housing outside the Gaeltacht area come entirely to an end.  It is the opinion of people whom I consulted that this restriction will act adversely on housing in the rural districts.</P>

      <P>I agree with the argument put forward by Deputy Law, but it is not our intention that by the deletion of this paragraph we shall prevent the local authority giving any assistance it thought fit&mdash;£20 or more &mdash;to encourage people to build houses. <Col N="2254" /> We should like to leave the local authority free to give such grants. Possibly some of them might be prepared to go further and give larger grants than are provided for in this paragraph.  We do think that the effect of this sub-section will be to stop house-building in several counties.  The rural elements are complaining that rates are so high that it would be very difficult to induce local authorities to expend further moneys in this way.  But that would not apply all round.  There are areas where housing conditions are bad and where rates are high.  Still, local authorities might be induced to make grants and in such areas house-building would be continued.  But if the law be enacted as suggested in this Bill, and if the grant is made absolutely contingent on the granting of a similar subsidy by the local authority, the local authority will not, in many cases, do its part and, therefore, the arrangement will fall through.  We can still leave it open to the local authorities to give this grant of £20 or more&mdash;give it, as it was before, by remission of rates on a sliding scale or in any other way, subject to the Minister's approval.  There is a widespread opinion amongst my colleagues that the insertion of this restriction will have a bad effect upon the continuance of house-building.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Law that there is anything minor about this amendment. All through this Bill, the State undertakes to provide loans to private persons, local authorities and public utility societies for building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grants that have been given to private persons are coming down on a reduced scale.  We are near the time when grants to private persons ought to stop.  The State provides capital for private persons and local bodies to build houses. Where a subsidy is being given either towards the building of houses in order to take people from insanitary dwellings, to build houses for the poorer classes or for the better paid working classes, the principle runs through the Bill that so far as there is <Col N="2255" /> a direct financial subsidy approximately half of that is given by the local authority and half by the State.  If we do that in the case of housing in order to replace insanitary dwellings for the very poor, we certainly can afford to do it in the case of private persons.  During the last seven years 467 houses have been built in the County Roscommon by private persons under the Housing Acts.  In the same period the number built in Galway was 973.  Progress can be continued in both counties at the same progress as is indicated in those figures by the local authority giving a grant of £20 from the rates.  In Roscommon that can be done by the striking a rate of a penny in the £, and in Galway by a rate of 1½d. in the £.  If, after all that has been said about the boon and the benefit it is to the various counties to have housing activity of that kind going on, the local authorities in Roscommon and Galway do not consider it worth while to strike a rate of 1d. and of 1½d. in the £, respectively, to maintain that activity, then that will confirm me in the opinion that the time has come to stop grants to private persons.  For these reasons the amendment moved by Deputy Law and Deputy O'Kelly hits at a very important matter and is not acceptable.</P>

      <P>The Minister forgot to mention that not alone do the local authorities give a grant equivalent to the Government grant, but they give more than the Government inasmuch as they give rebate of a certain amount of the rate payable on houses over a period, I think, of seven years.  In view of that I think the Minister ought to give consideration to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 31:&mdash;In sub-section (3) (d), line 23, to delete the figures &ldquo;750&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;950.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this amendment perhaps I might refer to the amendment proposing to delete sub-sections (4) and (5).  As these sub-sections stand there is a remission of two-thirds of the rates for seven years in the case of houses built with the floor area mentioned in Section 3 (d) (2).  We propose deleting sub-sections (4) and (5), and putting in amendment 35 instead. By that amendment we are securing that if a house is built, even though the local authority does not give the £20, and that, therefore, the State does not give the £20, it will still be entitled to the seven years' remission of rates if the floor area is that mentioned in Section 3 (d) (2).  I am seeking by this amendment to increase the floor area from 750 square feet to 950 square feet.  The general financial result of that on buildings in urban areas will be this: The 950 square feet is intended to force building down to the type of building that the better class worker wants, that is to say, to force builders away from the £1,000 figure.  At the moment the tendency on the part of speculative builders is to build houses round about the figure of £900.  We want to force building down towards the class, above that of the ordinary working classes, that wants houses.  That is why we reduce, in respect to urban areas, the floor area down to 950 square feet which would be about the floor area of a five-roomed house.  In urban areas the position with regard to houses will be that a house that comes under the 950 square feet category can get the £20, plus the £20 from the local authority, with the seven years' remission of rates.  That type of house will also be entitled to get a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act if the floor area is above 950 square feet and under 1,250 square feet.  There will be no grant, but there will be seven years' remission of rates.  If the floor area is above 750 square feet, and if the value of the house is not more than £1,000, then in respect of that class of house <Col N="2257" /> a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act will also be available, but the remission of two-thirds of the rates will be only for five years as laid down in the Local Government Act.  In the case of rural areas, houses with an area of 1,250 square feet can be given the grant, and in these cases also the remission of rates will be available.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if he is prepared to increase the figure in respect to area from 950 to 1,000, and whether he has any definite plan in mind in relation to the particular figure that he mentions. In Dublin, at present, houses are being built for £750.  The difference between the £750 house and the £1,000 house is very considerable. I am not personally interested in this, but from copies of plans which I have in my possession it would seem to me that a very serious disadvantage would result if the area of houses to be built was not at least 1,000 square feet.  As between the Minister's proposal and what I suggest there is only a difference of 50 square feet.  I would be glad if, before the Report Stage, the Minister would give me an opportunity of demonstrating these facts to him.  I think it is very important that houses selling at £750, which are very useful to the type of people who can afford that amount, clerks and some civil servants, should not be cut off altogther.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been the subject of a very considerable amount of conversations between myself and some of the builders in the city.  As I understand their figures, the thousand square feet house is going to be £750.  Someone must build houses between the class costing £750 and the houses the local authority is providing.  What is happening at the present moment is that builders are building high up.  Between the type of person whom the local authority is serving and the person <Col N="2258" /> whom the speculative builder is serving or the person served by the public utility society, there is a very big class of persons willing and capable of paying either rent or even buying a £500, a £600 or a £650 house.  What is happening is that that class of person is not able to get a house either to rent or to buy.  Some of them are being forced into houses costing £750 to £850, houses for which they are not economically able to pay.  It is in an attempt to induce, by a certain amount of force, the speculative builders to build houses of an area of 950 square feet, that we offer them a grant below that figure.  If they build between that and 1,250 they cannot get a grant, but they get seven years' remission of rates.  If they do not go beyond £1,000 they can get the benefit of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I think in view of the gap that exists between the houses which the builders are providing and local authorities are providing, that it is only reasonable to restrict the grant in urban areas to houses of 950 square feet or below that.</P>

      <P>It is because the local authority provides a subsidised house under the Working Classes Acts, subsidised not only from the State, but subsidised from themselves. They fix a rent that is within the capacity of the occupier, taking into consideration that he has to pay rates as well.

      <P>Section 60 to my mind is the most important section of the whole Bill.  On this section depends whether local authorities can see their way to go any further with housing in their areas or not.  The President to-day stated that if this Bill had been introduced this time last year better provisions might have been made.  He said a serious situation has arisen. There is a reduction in the yield from taxation.  That certainly is obvious to everybody.  We all admit there is a reduction in the yield from taxation and we agree that steps have to be taken by the Government with a view to balancing the Budget of this year. If there is a reduction in the yield from taxation I think everyone will agree that that applies to every citizen and that the capacity of the people for whom local councils are supposed to provide houses will be lowered also. Notwithstanding that fact the provisions of this Bill have created a situation which will render it impossible for a local authority to provide a house for a worker in their particular area at a rent which he will be able to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, I would far prefer the financial provisions under which we have been working up to this.  I know that the Minister will meet me with an argument by saying that even though the financial position is comparatively worse now than it has been under the grant system that inside of <Col N="2262" /> ten years the position will be better. But the position now, in my opinion, is something that we do not like.  Take the position as it has prevailed up to the present.  The Minister has already stated that the policy of local authorities must be directed towards the provision of houses for the lower grade workers.  If that is the Minister's desire he should have certainly provided better financial provisions than those in this Bill.  Under the old provision in operation now a house which costs £250 with a subsidy of £60 provided by the Government, and a similar subsidy provided by a local authority, could be let at 6/- a week. The same house at £250 under the provisions of this Bill, where 30 per cent. subsidy would be paid, would cost 8/- per week.  I think the Minister will agree that that is not a very desirable state of affairs.  The Minister has said that the State will provide 36 per cent. of the cost of loan charges and that the local authority would provide a similar amount.  The Minister has not explained how the local authorities' assistance is to be applied and I would like to hear that.  I also would like to hear what the Minister's conception is of what a rent ought to be in an area where wages range from 35/- to £2 per week.  I think he will find that those are the wages that prevail in most of the provincial towns in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but these are matters, in so far as they are not the subject of amendment, that might be dealt with on the Fifth Stage, especially as we are so near the completion of the Committee Stage and as we have an arrangement to take the final Stages to-morrow.</P>

      <P>The difficulty that I am in is that I am looking for information on this section.  I do not think anybody in the House is quite clear as to the implications of the financial provisions of this section.  I would hope that the Minister would agree to have the Report Stage in Committee so that we might speak two or three times, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is only right that the financial provisions should be discussed on this particular section.  If this important matter is left over to the Report Stage and we have the Report Stage in the usual way, it would probably be lost in the general discussions on the Bill. I certainly would like to have an opportunity of going into the finances of the Bill, and I know that there are other Deputies in the House in the same position.</P>

If there is agreement we can either postpone these amendments and order the Bill to be printed as now amended, or insert all the Ministerial amendments that remain and order the Bill to be printed, so that it will be available in the morning, and on the Report Stage we could take amendments 36, 37, and 40 in their appropriate places.</P>
