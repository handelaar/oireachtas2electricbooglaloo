    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Finance; the expression &ldquo;licensed bookmaker&rdquo; means a person (not being a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons) who is the holder of a bookmaker's licence issued or deemed to have been issued to him under this Act and for the time being in force;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; means any house or other building and includes a defined part of a house or other building;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;registered premises&rdquo; means premises for the time being registered in the register of bookmaking offices kept by the Revenue Commissioners under this Act;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; means the person entitled to the exclusive occupation of the premises in relation to which the word is used, and, where the context so admits, includes a number of persons jointly so entitled;</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to introduce the words &ldquo;and in&rdquo; so that it shall read &ldquo;the word `proprietor' means the person entitled to and in the exclusive occupation of the premises....&rdquo; The person may be entitled to and yet not in the exclusive occupation of the premises.

      <P>The only point in connection with that is that in certain cases it might be excessive to require a man who is applying for a licence and has not yet got it to have actually gone into the premises.  If he became entitled to the premises, then he might be allowed to apply.  It might in certain cases impose a hardship on individuals, if there was a doubt about their actually getting a licence, that they should not only be entitled to, but actually be in the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He might not have gone in.  There might be a lot of argument about what this amendment asks, but the position is that under the Bill as it stands he must be entitled to the premises.  Under the Act, no other business can be carried on in the premises once he has the licence.  I do not see that there is anything to be added to the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested to me that it might be useful if a definition of the words &ldquo;loitering on the premises&rdquo; were inserted in the definition clause.  For that purpose it has been suggested that the definition might be the word &ldquo;loitering&rdquo; means &ldquo;remaining in or about a registered premises without having any business to transact or after having transacted it.&rdquo;  I am not moving this as an amendment, because I did not receive it in time, but I bring the matter before the Minister now.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>(1)  No person shall carry on business or act as a bookmaker or hold himself out or represent himself to be a bookmaker or a licensed bookmaker unless he holds a bookmaker's licence issued or deemed to have been issued to him under this Act and for the time being in force.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who carries on business or acts as a bookmaker in contravention of this section and every person who holds himself out or represents himself to be a bookmaker or a licensed bookmaker in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to an excise penalty of five hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that amendments 4, 5 and 6 might be taken together:</P>
      <P>4.  In sub-section (2), line 51, to delete the words &ldquo;an excise penalty&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;a penalty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  In sub-section (2), lines 51-52, to delete the words &ldquo;five hundred <Col N="353" /> pounds&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;a sum not exceeding one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>6.  To add at the end of sub-section (2) the words &ldquo;or to a period of imprisonment not exceeding three months with or without hard labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The principle of the excise penalty in amendment 4 is covered by these and a number of other amendments which we propose to move.  We object to the imposition of the excise penalty for an infraction of the law in this case, mainly, on account of the fact that it carries with it, in the present state of the law in this country, the possibility of imprisonment for an indefinite term during the pleasure, if I may say so, of the Revenue Commissioners. That does not apply to the law in England or in Scotland, where there is a very definite imposition.  It is stated, for instance, that where the excise penalty, under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, exceeds £20, the period of imprisonment is not to exceed three months, and by the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1908, in Scotland, a similar limited term of imprisonment is suggested as an alternative where the monetary penalty exceeds £20.  For some reason or other the provisions of these Acts have not been applied to Ireland in the case of excise penalties.  We think that is a very undesirable position.  We are also anxious, as a matter of fact, that the imposition and enforcement of these penalties should be removed from the Revenue Commissioners and entrusted to the ordinary courts of the country. For that reason we are moving an amendment and, as we provide an alternative of imprisonment without hard labour, for a period not exceeding three months, we comply with the spirit of the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1879 as applied to England, and with the Act that applies to Scotland in removing the discrimination allowed to exist in regard to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment and, perhaps all other amendments, with one exception, to the same effect on the Paper.  The Deputy devoted most of his time to what is merely a technical point, and one <Col N="354" /> on which I have already given an undertaking to the House.  I said, so far as indefinite imprisonment is concerned, I was prepared, in connection with the excise penalties, to introduce legislation limiting the term to which people should be imprisoned in default of paying the excess penalties.  I, also, undertook that pending the introduction of such legislation no person would be imprisoned longer than the terms for which he could be imprisoned under the legislation in England. There has been a great deal publicly talked about imprisonment for life and so forth, but it is complete nonsense.  I shall read out a list of the terms served by people who have incurred fines in connection with betting duty or entertainment duty during the last two years:&mdash;Six weeks, two months, thirteen weeks, seven weeks, nine weeks, five weeks, five weeks, one month, ten weeks, six weeks, eleven days, fifteen days, one day, five weeks, seven weeks, one week, two weeks, two weeks. That is for 1929.  The roll for 1930 is, seven days, three days, two months, one month, one month, one day.  So that a great deal of the Deputy's argument is really addressed to what is a theoretical point, although there has been a great deal of talk indulged in with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the other point, that is a matter of substance.  I think it is absolutely necessary that there should be minimum penalties for most revenue offences and particularly for revenue offences in connection with the betting duty.  I think also that the remissions that may be suitable should be determined as a rule by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is also possible for the Minister further to remit the penalty if he chooses.  Most of the people at present engaged in carrying on bookmaking were engaged in the bookmaking business before the Betting Act was passed; they were engaged in carrying on an illegal occupation. The great majority of them were accustomed to breaking or evading the law and taking every sort of precaution to enable them to evade the law without incurring penalties. They are also engaged in an occupation which makes a man willing <Col N="355" /> to take a chance.  The publican who has a licence may sometimes be driven to take a chance, but taking a chance is not his profession.  Taking a chance is the bookmaker's profession and he is as willing to take a chance with the Revenue Commissioners as with a customer.  In a great majority of cases he is willing to take a risk in connection with the fulfilling of his obligations under the law.  The result is that we have here a duty which is the hardest duty of all to enforce and collect.</P>
    <P>There is one point about it that applies to nearly all revenue matters. There is not the same public opinion in regard to defrauding the revenue as there is in regard to defrauding the individual.  I do not think theologically it is always the same thing. I have gathered that an individual may quite readily hold that taxation is penal taxation and that he is entitled to evade it if he can.  It is, at any rate, true that people who would never think of robbing their neighbours and who would never think of uttering a false document to defraud a neighbour, think nothing of doing that when it is a matter of keeping some revenue out of the Exchequer. The result is that you have an enormous number of frauds carried out on the Exchequer.  There is the possibility of making detection in only a very small proportion of these cases.  It may frequently come to the notice of the revenue authorities that a bookmaker is carrying out systematic frauds against the revenue.  Hints and rumours of various sorts may come to them.  There may be absolutely no doubt that these frauds are taking place, yet to obtain detection is a difficult matter.  Very often to obtain detection a revenue officer must disguise himself as a corner boy.  He may have to frequent the place for a month until the bookmaker begins to look upon him as a regular customer and he then begins to play some tricks with the betting.  If the customer is not known to him the bookmaker will enter his bet properly; he will only do something wrong with the bets of the people whom he knows <Col N="356" /> well.  It may take a month to enable the revenue officer to succeed in securing a conviction against that bookmaker.</P>
    <P>The case then comes before the Disstrict Justice and it appears to be only one slip on the part of this excellent man who is before the Court. No evidence can be given about a great lot of matters that are within the knowledge of the revenue officials because those matters have nothing to do with that particular case.  Under our law of evidence such matters cannot be brought within the knowledge of the District Justice and he does not know what the problem is or what really is the sort of case that is before him.  We have frequently had District Justices urging remissions. There was one case in which the District Justice confessed afterwards &mdash;although I dare say his memory is only good in parts like the curate's egg&mdash;that if he had had the facts before him he would not have made the recommendations that he did make. He has now apparently forgotten all that and he has gone back; he only remembers his anger at the beginning with the Revenue Commissioners.  The position is that all the evidence cannot be placed before the District Justice and all the picture cannot be presented to him.</P>
    <P>In regard to offences between private individuals the whole public attitude is different.  The man who commits an offence against the revenue will not think of defrauding a private individual in any way.  More severe penalties are necessary if the revenue code is to be administered at all.  The standard of monetary penalty by which a District Justice will ordinarily be guided is not applicable to this sort of offence.  If you remove the minimum penalty, which is what Deputy MacEntee suggests, you will have lots of cases where a man ought to be fined £500, but where, instead, the delinquent will get off with a fine of 10/- or something like that.  That man will be prepared to put up the sort of case that can be put up.</P>
    <P>So far as the betting duty is concerned, I read out the list of imprisonments and I say that there has been <Col N="357" /> no severity exercised.  Apart from the terms of imprisonment being short, the penalties are remitted and very frequently, too, they are remitted by authorities who have some knowledge of the circumstances and who are much better able to determine in this sort of case what remission is suitable and what is necessary in the way of a deterrent than can be estimated by the District Justice.  There is no such thing as bringing an individual before the Court for a technical slip or a single offence.  Individuals are warned frequently and when a man is brought forward on what appears to be a technical offence he is brought there because there is absolute certainty in the minds of those handling the matter that he has been carrying out systematic defalcations. Anybody may make a slip, and every allowance is made for that, but when there is a systematic campaign of defalcation it may be months before the individual is brought before the Court.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that if this minimum penalty were removed, whatever might happen at the end of ten years when we would have gained experience through whatever we might go through, the immediate effect will be to make the administration of the law in this respect almost impossible.  It will lead to an enormous loss of revenue and an enormous encouragement of frauds on the Exchequer. It is not without good reason that, in regard to revenue offences both here and in England, the system of minimum penalties exists.  That matter has been subject to examination for a long time and there is a good and solid reason for it.  The good and solid reason is that these penalties must be penalties in terrorem. There is no possibility of detecting the same proportion of offences as there would be of detecting private frauds. There is not the same conscience amongst the people in regard to them and, if the revenue has to be adhered to at all, if a man is caught there must be a stinging penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to think that there is a class in the community that must be treated as outlaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="358" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a very strong case for having this particular class excluded from a fair trial in a public court.  I am not concerned with what class it is, whether it is a class of bookmakers or any other class, but such class should not be excluded from a fair trial with full jurisdiction given to the judge sitting in that court.  That principle is laid down under Section 64 of the Constitution, which says: &ldquo;The judicial power of the Irish Free State, Saorstát Eireann, shall be exercised and justice administered in the public courts by judges appointed in manner hereinafter provided.&rdquo;  If you take away from a judge the power of imposing a penalty, if the judge has only an opportunity of saying whether a man is guilty or not and if he has not the power of imposing a penalty, then the judge is exercising a purely administrative act and not a judicial act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not exercising the power of a judge and therefore this law is in contravention of the Constitution. If the Minister has a good case to make he should amend the Constitution.  He should take the Revenue Commissioners and their powers outside the Constitution but, so long as it is there, it is a grave question of doubt whether you can implicitly amend the Constitution.  We may, in this House, be doing something which is unconstitutional and the law is invalid.  If you like you can legislate for the purpose of litigation, and make an excellent case for people to carry to the courts of law.  We are to have very important points on this issue submitted to the Courts in the near future, on the question whether the Revenue Commissioners, under the Constitution, can carry those powers of excise penalties or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to minimise the penalties. I do not want to let any class in the community escape from what is due or from whatever penalty they have incurred if they break the law.  A great many of us hold very strong views on the evils of betting.  But we <Col N="359" /> do not want those people to be getting by a side wind a sort of sympathy from the community, because they are labouring under a real constitutional difficulty.  The Minister made a case showing how hard it is to detect these people.  But that has nothing whatever to do with the issue.  In any case the Revenue Commissioners have to prove in a court of law that a man has been detected in an offence against the betting laws.  They have to prove that in court.  On the point whether the officers are carrying out their work efficiently, from all I can gather, they are not merely carrying out their work towards that class of the community efficiently but they are doing it with a certain degree of harshness.  Be that as it may, at the same time they do seem to be doing their work efficiently.</P>
    <P>So far as bringing cases into court is concerned I do not think the Minister has any complaint.  The question is whether the power is to lie with the judge to impose a penalty or whether he is to use his discretion in fixing a penalty.  I do not think there is any judge in Saorstát Eireann who will not be as severe as the Commissioners and, because they have the Constitution behind them, they will carry a far greater weight with public opinion in any sentence they impose on a person who breaks the law.  A district justice, in giving evidence before the Betting Commission&mdash;evidence which was ultimately supported by the findings of the Commission itself&mdash; mentioned the anomaly of those powers of the Revenue Commissioners. He said at the Commission that it seemed absurd that a justice should be obliged to inflict a penalty for an offence which is frequently a minor one&mdash;a penalty of not less than £500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It showed he did not know a thing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty is a penalty of £500 and it is only the Revenue Commissioners have the power of reducing that penalty.  What have we seen as a matter of fact?  It is a matter of absolute public scandal where penalties and a whole series <Col N="360" /> of penalties of £500 have been imposed upon a very prominent &ldquo;bookie&rdquo; in this community and these penalties had to be reduced to almost a nominal amount afterwards by the Revenue Commissioners.  Would it not be far better if those cases had come up for review in the public courts?  When the man had been tried in the public court and had been fined, the fines imposed would be measured according to his means.  I do not know whether the Revenue Commissioners have received the mitigated fines in that case or not. Nobody knows.  It is a matter of secrecy.  It is a matter which does not come before the review of the general public.  These things should be settled in public court and subject to the ordinary machinery of enforcement, so that if a man commits an offence he should go before the public, and the ordinary machinery of law should apply to him.  It should not be a matter for private negotiation and very often of corruption.  We have seen where two officers in the employment of the Revenue Commissioners have been punished for corruption in connection with matters affecting the bookmaking community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the Judges and the court know nothing about these things.  The Judges have the general view of the community. It is not merely an offence by one class of the community or by people of a particular section who come before them.  The Judges see the terrible evils in other crimes connected with betting evils.  They see evils committed which arise out of that evil.  They see the results in various directions.  They, more than anybody else, have reason to know that they should be extremely severe in dealing with offences under the betting laws. Therefore there is nothing whatever in the case that the Minister makes that these Judges are persons who are living in the moon so far as Revenue offences are concerned.  Offences under the Betting Acts are not regarded in the same way as offences by a man who tries to do the Revenue for income tax or excise, or customs on goods brought into the country. These are regarded by the community <Col N="361" /> as matters to which no great odium attaches.  But the community generally has a very strong view that there is essential crime involved very often in connection with the business of betting and therefore they do regard offences in these cases on quite a different basis from merely Revenue offences.  I must say that the Minister from the point of view of his own Department is making a great mistake in trying to enforce these excise powers.  His Department would gain greatly in prestige and would gain greatly in the sympathy of the community generally if the public felt that the Revenue Commissioners had not these tyrannical powers.  One Deputy on these benches said privately that these powers are like a snake in the grass.  They are something that is there, lying there.  It is something that may not stir or may not move, but the power is there, and it should not be there if we are to have any regard for constitutional Government in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally am not opposed in any way to offences under the Betting Act being treated seriously.  I am, however, opposed to giving any further powers to the Revenue Commissioners having regard to the public experience in connection with the manner in which their present powers have been administered.  I am supporting this amendment on two grounds, apart from the grounds of our personal experience on the matter of excise penalties, which have been considered very carefully by the Committee appointed under the presidency of Deputy Morrissey, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that report there comes from a committee, comprised of every section of this House and every section of the Seanad, a unanimous declaration that the law as regards excise penalties should be amended.  As a member of that committee who agreed to that recommendation, I am bound by their findings, and I am not going back on any findings of which I approved. Apart from any other reason, by reason of the findings of the committee being in favour of the amendment and against the imposition of further penalties by <Col N="362" /> the Inland Revenue Commissioners, I am in favour of it.  The excise penalties which existed in England up to 1879 were then modified, as they were found to be very oppressive but, at the end of more than fifty years, we have the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners here doing all they can to hang on to a power which, at best, is a relic of barbaric antiquity, as it allows the Government to send a man to jail for an unlimited period, at the pleasure of the Revenue Commissioners and other officials, and without giving his case a fair and impartial judicial hearing.  The Minister for Finance said, at least twice, that the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are better judges as to the necessity for the remission of penalties than the district justices.  I beg respectfully to disagree with that, and I trust that he will not take me disrespectfully when I say that it is present to the mind of every schoolboy, that a district justice, knowing the district, having the man before him, and being able to inquire into both sides of the case, the case presented by the Inland Revenue and that presented by the defendant, is a better judge of a suitable penalty than a clerk in the office of the Commissioners, or even one of the Commissioners themselves sitting in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Very painful have been my experiences, which are the very opposite to what the Minister for Finance says occurs.  I have seen instances, over and over again, of harshness and cruelty on the part of the Commissioners, which would have been entirely avoided if the district justices were given the same discretion as that given to the justices in England.  The Minister for Finance appears to me to throw a slur on the district justices. Ordinarily he must admit that a Commissioner of Inland Revenue, if allowed to sit in a district court, would be better than a Commissioner sitting in an office in Dublin.  I have experience of many district justice and I found them very satisfactory. They perform their duties intelligently and impartially, and do them fairly as between the State and individuals and between individuals themselves.  I think that when you have the chief <Col N="363" /> District Justice of Dublin, who has brought credit to the Bench, to himself and to the country, coming in and giving evidence of complaints which he individually had to make against the way in which his recommendations were turned down by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, he ought to be met in a fairer spirit than that in which he was met by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The chief District Justice made a specific charge to which there is not, and cannot be, an answer.  He charged the Commissioners with having consistently turned down the recommendations of District Justices before whom cases were heard.  That is the charge that was made, but from that day to this, no attempt has been, or can be, made to answer it.  What happened?  It appears that the chief District Justice made a slip in the individual instance he quoted and then down comes the Minister for Finance hot foot, escorted by a horde of Revenue Officials and says, &ldquo;Oh, look at this; we have caught the chief District Justice out.  He gave the wrong instance.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance though loud in his denunciation, made no attempt to answer the complaints of the chief District Justice and only pointed out that the one example which he gave was inaccurate.  Not content with that, the same officials&mdash; this is a matter of public record&mdash; though six months had elapsed, did not think that the public had been sufficiently deceived by the answer which they instructed the Minister to make, and sent another official before another Committee to repeat the denunciation which the Committee had before them six months previously.</P>
    <P>I gave the Minister some instances and in one case, at all events, he was good enough to point out in the strongest possible manner how inaccurate I was.  On information supplied to him by officials of the Revenue Department&mdash;he could have got it from no other source&mdash;he denied the case which I had given him and said it was inaccurate on three separate grounds.  I had put before this House the case of an unemployed <Col N="364" /> workman who had been sent to jail for non-payment of income tax despite the fact that the Inland Revenue Commissioners had before them at the time full knowledge of the fact that they were dealing with an unemployed man who, during the six months which he had been working, had paid a sum of £26 towards his arrears of income tax.  He was a law-abiding citizen and was prepared to carry out the law. What was the answer?  The Minister for Finance rained down ridicule on me.  First, he said that this man was the owner of the house in which he lived; secondly, that the poor law valuation of the house was £42, and, thirdly, that the man had £500 in British War Loan.  I knew that the first part of the story was a concoction and so did a great many people in the City of Cork.  The matter did not arise in my constituency, but it had been published in the Press and I knew something about it.  I inquired into the other two points and I ask the Minister who was the official who gave him the information.  Take the question of valuation.  I hold that an official is not fit to be in his position if he does not know the valuation of a house in regard to which he is collecting income tax.  Knowing that the valuation of the house is £18 he comes here and instructs the Minister for Finance to state that the valuation was £42 and that it is this man's property. Well he knows that he has no interest in it and that it was as an act of charity that his wife was able to start on her own.</P>
    <P>The conduct of the officials of the Inland Revenue Commission must meet with the approval of those above them as otherwise it would not be allowed to continue.  I could give other instances showing that what the chief District Justice complained of is absolutely and literally true.  I was present one day in the District Court when a man was fined £25.  The facts as set out by the defendant, if true, constituted a complete defence. The District Justice stated that he was satisfied with the facts as put up by the defendant as being true, but he thought that they did not constitute a defence and imposed a <Col N="365" /> penalty of £25.  On looking into the matter subsequently he ascertained that the facts as set out by the defendant were true and that the man was not guilty.</P>
    <P>He sent up a recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners showing the facts, and to his credit be it said, the facts are as stated in the petition. The facts show that the defendant was not guilty, but he thought that under all the circumstances a technical offence had been committed and he recommended that the penalty he imposed be mitigated to £5.  What was the answer?  &ldquo;The law must take its course.&rdquo;  Is it any wonder you have the District Justice protesting against this imposition by the Revenue Commissioners who are unable and unfit to adjudicate or to discriminate between a poor man and a rich man, between a serious offence and a minor offence?  Believing as I do, that to give further powers to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue would be to add further scandal to the administration of law, I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also strongly to urge that this amendment be accepted.  I hope that if it is put to the House it will be carried. Deputy Wolfe might have put his forcible arguments in words in which I would have expressed my feelings on the matter.  The Revenue Commissioners are not concerned with nor do they understand even the slightest elementary rudiments of justice. What they are concerned with is the collection of money.  In every case in which they have had to deal with offenders, whether they were fraudulent offenders or were just technical offenders against certain regulations of the Commissioners, the case has always been decided on terms of the man's position&mdash;what they could get&mdash;and not on the merits or demerits of the case itself.  For that reason I strongly support the case put forward, particularly where it is an offence that should be judged on the merits, that the District Justice should be the person to decide.  You have two classes of offenders.  You have the man who makes a genuine <Col N="366" /> mistake, but the District Justice has no option.  He must impose the maximum fine and it will be mitigated only if the man can prove that he has not got the money to pay.  A man who commits a calculated fraud is treated on the same basis.  The District Justice will not compound with the man who has defrauded, but he will compound with the man who has made a technical error.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance knows that I have had considerable experience in dealing with cases of bookmakers who were in trouble.  In fact he has no excuse for not knowing because he wrote me a letter on one occasion not to interfere further with the Revenue Commissioners in the administration of their affairs.  He forgets that it was as a result of a conversation with himself arising out of a case which I had brought to his notice that he made an appointment with me to meet the Revenue Commissioners when there were nine bookmakers in jail.  Arising out of the correspondence I had to deal with these nine cases.  The Minister read out a list of the offenders and the terms served, but that did not convey anything.  Will the Minister admit that amongst these people he had in jail for not being able to pay was a man in the last stages of consumption? He died shortly after release.  I asked that the man be released because of the state of his health.  The District Justice would have looked into that case and would have sentenced him to a term, but would not have left him there in jail from day to day.  That man has since died.  I do not know if his being held there did the Revenue Commissioners any good; it certainly did not do him any good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do the Revenue Commissioners get their information and how do they act?  Deputy Little pointed out that the method under which the Revenue Commissioners have to deal with these bookmakers brings about a peculiar state of affairs.  As a matter of fact when the original Act was put into operation a whole deal took place between a certain few officials and the bookmakers, with the result that both these officials have since been reduced <Col N="367" /> in their positions because evidently things have not been carried out in a proper manner.  That is a proof of the danger of having officials of the Department dealing with matters of this kind.  A bookmaker may have acted fraudulently, and he goes up to the Revenue Office and says; &ldquo;I will pay you £50,&rdquo; and they say &ldquo;No, we want £100.&rdquo;  Then you have a compromise at £75.  That is how it was done before.  There may have been a tightening up since because the Revenue Commissioners have had sad experience in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have two ways of dealing with bookmakers. They have credit bookmakers who can act on certified returns.  The bookmaker can at the end of a day or at the end of a week figure out what his bets have been, and send in a certified return.  In other words, he gets credit until the Revenue Commissioners check his return, and then he sends in his cheque after a week or fourteen days. There is also what is known as sheet betting.  In that case the bookmaker has to buy a sheet on which he can enter a certain number of bets to a certain amount, and the duty is paid on that.  Every bookmaker is anxious to be allowed to pay on certified returns, because it makes his business easier if he is in a big way.  The Revenue Commissioners, however, can change a man from certified returns to ordinary sheet betting without giving him any reason whatever for doing so. A bookmaker will do anything to be kept on the certified returns, and perhaps he will make a complaint against a brother bookmaker.  On that complaint the Commissioners will act. Although the complaint is made confidentially, and although the man against whom the complaint is made may know nothing about it, he is given no explanation for being taken off certified returns.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to supply the House with the number of cases against bookmakers during 1930, the number sent to jail, the various fines imposed, and how they ultimately settled.  How many of these were subsequently <Col N="368" /> released without any payment at all being made?  How many were released after the Revenue Commissioners had accepted the amount offered them before the men were sent to jail?  How many men paid the fines? If the Minister for Finance wants to impress the House, or wants to impress people who are anxious to see a fair administration of justice let him give the full facts, not that A.B.C. was fined so much.  Let him tell us that this man got so many months, and that his fines amounted to £2,500.  On inquiry it was discovered that the man was not worth 2,500 pence. They kept him in jail for six months in the hope that his brother-in-law, a prominent jeweller, would pay the amount.  When he did not they let him out, or compromised by taking the money at so much per month. That is what has been happening all along.  On these benches we are not anxious to countenance or to compound a felony.  If a man has defrauded the Revenue Commissioners he can be brought into court.  Let the Department of Justice, through the district justice, sentence or fine him. There should be no further mitigation if it is proved on evidence that he was guilty of fraud.  We feel that the administration of the Betting Act, if the Minister's point of view goes through, will mean that the Revenue Commissioners will be dealing with cases without judging the merits of the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>How do the excise officers find out these offences?  The Department employs officers, who are changed from time to time.  They go around to these betting offices, as the Minister described it, &ldquo;disguised as corner-boys.&rdquo; It must have a good effect on an excise officer to hob-nob with corner-boys, in order to catch people who are attempting to defraud the revenue. Take the case of a revenue official who has been betting for a month and who goes about to these places.  I want to know who is paying for his bets, and what check the revenue authorities have on the bets he makes.  If he says that a bet represents 5/-, and if the bookmaker's returns only show 2/6, how do we know which is right? <Col N="369" /> It is on the complaint of excise officers over a series of weeks that these cases arise.  An official might have a bet on each race or seven bets in one day.  It is on the official's complaint the Revenue Commissioners proceed.  I have heard it stated by bookmakers who have been fined on the complaint of a particular revenue officer that he had not spoken the truth, but that they had no possible means of having their word taken. They maintain that mistakes were made in the case of particular bets.</P>
    <P>I think, if we are going to legislate with any sense of responsibility, we should see that justice is administered in the interests of those who are affected.  It is all very well to take the Minister's point of view, and to look upon all bookmakers as a bunch of calculated rogues.  I do not feel that way.  The Minister said something he should not have been allowed to say, that the memory of the chief District Justice was only good in spots.  The chief District Justice is still functioning, so that it is most unfair to refer to him in that manner. The Minister for Finance stated that the chief District Justice's memory was only good in spots.  He is administering justice in the courts, and sends men to jail for serious offences, generally more serious than the technical mistakes that are made in betting transactions.</P>

I want to say, as a layman, that the District Justice, so long as he is able to function, should not be spoken of in the distasteful manner that he was spoken of by the Minister for Finance in this House.

      <P>When a District Justice gives evidence before a Committee of the House on a matter which will necessarily come up for debate in the House, his opinions may be debated.  A certain District Justice, apparently, stated in evidence before the Joint Committee on the Betting Act his opinions on certain matters, then the subject of consideration by that Joint Committee.  He was not acting in a judicial capacity at all, but was giving his views as a witness. To debate opinions so given, is wholly a different thing from offering criticism of the judgment given by the District Justice, or by any other person exercising judicial functions.  I want to get that point of order cleared up, but I am not in any way objecting to Deputy Briscoe's comment on the Minister's speech.  The Deputy is completely entitled to his view as to whether any member of the House should express himself in a particular way.</P>

But when the Minister for Finance sweeps away the <Col N="371" /> opinion of that particular Justice by saying his memory is only good in spots, that is the point I object to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is that he remembered only what he wanted to remember and forgot everything else.  I object to the Minister for Finance referring to the Justice in that particular way.  I am prepared to leave it at that.  The Minister has not made it clear to the House that where a bookmaker goes before the Revenue Commissioners for certain offences, or where brought before the District Justice, he may be fined on five or six counts, on each of which the penalty may be £500.  Such a person may be fined £2,500.  If he is brought before the Revenue Commissioners he may be fined £500 for five different offences without any distinction being made to ascertain whether the five offences arose out of the one transaction or not.  There is no possible chance for a man in that particular business feeling secure except along certain very narrow lines.  If he trips and falls, or if he makes a genuine mistake, he is liable to be convicted if his complexion or colour does not agree with the person sitting in judgment on him.  That happens to be the feeling abroad.  Before betting was legalised and recognised by the State, which is getting certain revenue out of it, we must not lose sight of the fact that bookmaking was a business that was generally carried on by people who kept their business in their hats and in the bags they carried.  They had good times and bad times.  They took hazards that ordinary business people would not enter into.  They might do well to-day and badly tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners want to put bookmaking on the same basis as business houses with a tradition of years behind them.  They want to put them on the same basis as big limited liability companies that have been carrying on for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> Many of the men in this business are illiterate.  They are honest, decent men but their circumstances were such that they went into the game, as they call it, at an early age.  They are good judges of horse-flesh, and they will back their opinions at long odds as to what horses will win.  The technicalities of customs and excise regulations would be foreign to them. Very few of these people understand business in that sense.  I want to ask the Minister if he is prepared to give to the House particulars of each case and the cases referred to in his list. Is the Minister prepared to give particulars of those who were sent to jail, the nature of the original offence, whether it was a technical offence or otherwise, the fines imposed and the subsequent treatment of each case?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is prepared to state if the Department has always acted on information given by the excise officers, or if it has acted on information given by outsiders.  I had one particular case brought to my notice where one bookmaker made a complaint against another that the bet he made was bigger in amount than appeared in the other man's book.  The Revenue Commissioners acted on that information. I would like the Minister to say if he thinks he is going to get the best results, in the interests of common decency and justice, by continuing in the manner he wants to continue by this clause, or is he prepared to meet us in some way, apart from the assurance he has given?  Is the Minister prepared to give an assurance that in cases of mistakes a distinction will be made, and that the cases will be judged on their merits?  In cases of calculated fraud there should be no compounding with fraud.  We ask that in cases of genuine mistakes the men will be treated differently from those who committed fraud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that I am prepared to bring the whole law in relation to excise penalties into line with the law in England.  Deputy Wolfe misread the law, but I do not think that was intentional on his part, I am not trying to hold any powers <Col N="373" /> that do not continue in England.  This amendment goes miles beyond that, because in all the excise penalties in England there is a minimum penalty which the Justice of the Court must impose if there is a conviction.  I say that the minimum penalty is necessary in revenue law, and more necessary in these cases than in any other cases.  I think that the whole administration would become a farce if we went the length that this amendment proposes, by deleting any excise penalty, and leaving the matter entirely to the Court.  No revenue officers were found guilty of corruption.  There was no evidence at all that would suggest that the officers had become corrupt or acted corruptly in any way.  There were two officers in whose cases fault was found with the way in which they had discharged their duties.  I think I was satisfied after investigation that the officers were guilty only of indiscretion, and their punishment consisted in removal and reduction, which amounted really to extremely severe penalties.  Deputy Little suggested that the judge had no discrection.  Of course he has discretion.  He can mitigate the penalty to 25 per cent.  Deputy Little further suggested that it was unconstitutional to have a fixed penalty. Is it unconstitutional to have a fixed penalty in, say, murder cases?</P>

      <P>Generally speaking the prerogative of mercy in all cases rests with someone outside the judiciary. A great deal of attention in fact is paid to recommendations from the judiciary.  A great deal of attention is paid to the recommendations of District Justices.  Very frequently perhaps, as a rule, the recommendations of District Justices are accepted. All this pother has been to a large extent created by the evidence given by Mr. Cussen.  As I have already said Mr. Cussen, in giving his evidence, forgot what was the central fact.  He in a certain case recommended a mitigation which the Revenue Commissioners did not give. He then refused to sign a warrant for the man's arrest.  Later on he <Col N="374" /> signed a warrant when he had certain facts before him that were not before him at the trial.  He admitted that if he had these facts before him he would not have recommended the mitigation.  He endorsed the warrant &ldquo;in my opinion this man should not be kept longer than four months.&rdquo; In fact the man was only kept three months.  The District Justice in his evidence said &ldquo;I have no confidence that the Revenue Commissioners will give any consideration to a recommendation from the District Justice's Court.&rdquo;  What he forgot and left out in his evidence in the one case he cited was that he himself did acknowledge afterwards that if he had known the facts he would not have made the recommendation.  That is why I say that his memory was only good in spots.  Without intending it, his evidence entirely misled the Committee with regard to the facts of the case and with regard to the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners generally towards recommendations made by the District Justices.</P>

The two things do not hang together.  As there are separate amendments on the Order Paper dealing with them, I think the House should decide as to whether they should be taken separately or not.

He should tell the House what penalties were actually imposed by the Justice in these cases, for what amount they were actually compounded by the Revenue Commissioners and for what duration people on whom they were imposed were kept in prison.  I think we are entitled, before proceeding further, to have that information. Furthermore, I think the Minister should tell the rank of the officials involved in the disciplinary proceedings, <Col N="376" /> the offences with which they were charged and the punishment meted out to them.

      <P>Before the debate goes on, is the Minister prepared to give us information?  I have to speak, but I think it is unfair that the Minister has prejudiced the issue by stating that in a considerable number of cases men were only imprisoned for comparatively brief periods.  That is only part of the case.  What we want to know is what amount did the Revenue Commissioners accept in discharge of the penalties imposed on them by statute?  That is more important than the duration for which men were imprisoned.</P>

      <P>That particular matter has got a bearing on the Bill as far as I am concerned.  One of those officials was highly efficient and a first-class official with regard to his history, the examinations he passed and the promotion he got.  Had that man not been put in the position he was put his present situation would not have arisen.  You put an official on the basis of dealing secretly and privately with the men who, according to the Minister, are a pack of rogues.  Arising out of certain allegations made against him, certain charges must have been found; otherwise he would not have been punished to the great extent he was.  The continuance of that particular practice is all wrong. For that reason I think we should be given some information as to what the allegations against those men were. We know from information also certain details about those particular cases.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance wants time to consider.  That seems to be one of his peculiarities.  He ought really to know that the evidence upon which the case is founded when it is in his possession is a thing which would be asked for in the House.  He ought to have in his possession that evidence ready for presentation to the House.  We are in the very extraordinary position that we are asked to come to decisions upon matters in which selective evidence is offered to us in which the Minister for Finance can give or withhold the facts which are privately in his possession, exactly dependent upon whether they serve or fail to serve the particular case which he has put forward.  We have had that in relation to tariffs.  We have had it in relation to other things.  There is this careful, selective reticence in the divulgment of information as to the basis upon which this House shall come to a decision.  I object to that. I object to a Minister coming here to recommend to the House a Bill the goodness or badness of which depends upon specific evidence, and that Minister being in the position in virtue of his majority to say that he will or will not put before the House evidence just exactly as it suits his case.  That <Col N="378" /> may be judicial procedure.  That may be sound politics.  That may be statesmanship, and it may be good legislation in the definition of it by the Minister.  But in my opinion it is an outrage upon every democratic principle and an outrage upon any possibility of sound and honest legislation.</P>
      <P>As to the excise penalties themselves, I take such a law as the one which is challenged here as being merely typical of a lot of others.  I believe in the administration of all law, good and bad, so long as it is on the Statute Book; good laws because they are good laws and bad laws because in my opinion the only and most effective way under a democratic Constitution to destroy bad laws is to administer them.  What the Minister claims in these cases is the right to give or to withhold.  These bad laws which are not administered are simply snakes in the grass, kept there to be used as and when it suits particular interests and particular purposes and not upon general principles. If there is a law which is allowed to stand upon the Statute Book that law should be administered. If there is a law which cannot be administered as it is written, which cannot be given general application as it exists, that law should disappear because it creates a condition both of prejudice and of privilege, depending entirely upon the relation between the interests of those who have the power to administer it or not and the people who may come under its lash.

    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1930, be read a second time. Practically every Deputy in this House is aware that very many of our county hospitals, particularly our <Col N="379" /> county surgical hospitals, are at the present time very poorly equipped, and that because of that handicap they are unable efficiently to perform the work which they are supposed to do.  Deputies are also aware that in very many of these hospitals there is not sufficient accommodation for the patients who have to seek treatment there.  In many counties in the Saorstát the hospitals are not a separate institution.  Everybody who is acquainted with the working of hospitals will admit that to be effective an hospital should be a separate institution. In one case that I have in mind in particular you have the appalling condition that the county surgical hospital is part and parcel of the same institution as the fever hospital, the ordinary county home and the hospital for treatment of medical cases for the sick poor. Everybody will admit that that is an appalling condition and that no county surgeon can efficiently perform his work under conditions such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this Bill, when introduced, was to provide better equipment for county hospitals, in particular for the county surgical hospitals, and better sanitation and more accommodation for the patients who have to seek treatment there. There are at least eight or nine county hospitals in the Saorstát that are not provided with X-ray equipment.  No surgeon can perform his duty properly who has not the advantage of having an X-ray photograph taken of his cases before he is called upon to operate on them.  There are at least four or five county hospitals which do not boast of a proper operating theatre.  In many of the hospitals the patients are sent out before they should be sent out because there is no accommodation.  The beds are wanted for somebody else and the patients are sent out before their time. It is not fair to the patients, and it is not fair to the surgeon who is called upon to treat them.  It may be said that Boards of Health should provide such accommodation, such equipment, and better sanitation.  We all <Col N="380" /> know notwithstanding assurances to the contrary that there is pretty general depression prevailing at the present time amongst the farming community, and Boards of Health are naturally reluctant to increase their estimates to provide such equipment and more accommodation, and people in the country say they are entitled to secure some of the benefits accruing from the operation of the Public Charitable Hospitals Bill of 1930. They say if any person from the country goes to Dublin for treatment he has to pay two guineas a week in hospital.  If he is not able to pay it out of his own pocket the County Board of Health is asked to contribute the two guineas for him.  People in the country naturally say that when such a condition of affairs exists the hospitals which they help to maintain should not be the only hospitals that benefit under the Public Charitable Hospitals Bill.  They naturally claim, and with a certain amount of right, that they are entitled to something from the Bill which was passed by this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay on this question. The Bill speaks for itself, but there is one other matter that I would like to mention.  Several times, when speaking on the Local Government Estimate here, Deputies stressed the question of the treatment and care of unmarried mothers.  It has been advocated time and again that separate institutions or hospitals should be established at some convenient centre for these people.  I submit that if a sum of money were available outside the ordinary revenue of county boards of health, three or four or five county boards of health could co-operate and equip one of the disused workhouses into a hospital for unmarried mothers from three or four counties.  These people have to seek shelter at the present time in the ordinary county homes.  If that were done, it would redress a grievance which has long called for redress.</P>
    <P>In this morning's Press there was an announcement that the Minister for Justice intended to introduce a Bill to provide for the better equipment of surgical hospitals.  I expect he has in <Col N="381" /> mind the provision of X-ray equipment where such is not in existence, the provision of proper sanitation, of operation theatres, and the isolation of surgical hospitals.  Surgical hospitals should not be in the same buildings as fever hospitals and hospitals for the ordinary sick poor.  They certainly should not be in the same building with those who have, through necessitous circumstances, to seek the shelter of the present county homes.  The Minister will perhaps find it a bit difficult to define what is a surgical hospital.  In many hospitals throughout the Saorstát at the present time obstetrics is not undertaken in the ordinary surgical hospitals.  It is undertaken in the ordinary county homes.  That is largely due to the fact that there is not sufficient accommodation in the ordinary surgical hospitals. I just merely bring that point to the Minister's notice, that a hospital that undertakes the treatment of obstetrics should be classed as a surgical hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further that I have to say on this Bill, except that there may be some who will oppose this Bill because they are opposed to the principle of sweepstakes in general.  To these I would say that that would be a poor reason for voting against the Bill.  It would be a better and a more proper thing for them to introduce a Bill to repeal the original measure.  This is to place hospitals in the country, which never get voluntary subscriptions, so far as I know, which get nothing except what the people pay, on an equal footing with some of the metropolitan hospitals and the hospitals in the larger towns and cities which now derive benefit from the Public Charitable (Hospitals) Act.  Those who know the conditions which exist in the county hospitals will admit that it is necessary to provide funds from some outside source or else these hospitals will not be equipped as they should be.  Boards of health, unfortunately, do not see their way to involve themselves in further liabilities and increase their estimates to equip these hospitals as they should be, because equipment is pretty expensive, and this House <Col N="382" /> will be doing a good day's work if it passes this Bill and sees that these hospitals get the equipment that they need to carry out their work efficiently and properly.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that these hospitals will get a certain percentage of the moneys made available for hospitals in general under the original Act. If the percentage is sufficiently decent I personally would be quite satisfied. But the suggestion of a percentage would also involve that some one body in the State would have a monopoly in running sweepstakes for hospitals in general, and some way out should be found by which there would be State control of the moneys available under the sweepstakes and the moneys pooled and distributed to the hospitals on a percentage basis by somebody directly under the control of the Minister's Department.  If that condition were suggested I would be quite willing to accept it, provided the percentage were a decent one.</P>

      <P>When the Hospitals Bill was first introduced it will be within the recollection of Deputies that I opposed it.  I opposed it not because I thought there was anything immoral or wrong in sweepstakes of this nature, but because I considered that inevitably, when the thin end of the wedge was inserted, the wedge would be further and further driven in, until we would have legalised sweepstakes for all classes of objects of a charitable or semi-charitable nature.  I am afraid that this Bill, and especially some remarks made by Deputy O'Dowd in introducing it, show that my fears are in very grave danger of realisation.  It is suggested in this Bill that every county hospital, county infirmary, district hospital, or other hospital, supported in whole or in part out of poor rates, should be eligible to come under the provisions of this Act.  I take it the object of the original Act was this: to supplement the inadequate supply of voluntary subscriptions which were coming in to support hospitals which rely largely upon voluntary subscriptions for maintenance and for <Col N="383" /> carrying out the work upon which they are engaged, namely, affording medical relief to the poor.  It is suggested under this Bill that the benefit of the Act should be extended to every State-aided hospital; in other words, that the Act should come to the aid of the local rates.  I think that that is a very unsound principle. I think that if we establish sweepstakes for the relief of the general taxpayer or ratepayer we will be embarking upon a very bad financial system.  I certainly would hate to see either local revenue or public revenue supplemented by any lottery or sweepstake of any kind or description. Therefore, as this Bill stands, I must ask the House to reject it.</P>
      <P>I am not insensible to a great deal of what Deputy O'Dowd says.  I am perfectly aware that there are a great number of county hospitals which are not properly equipped.  For my part, I would be glad to see portion of the proceeds of these sweeps go towards those infirmaries or county hospitals, provided that it did not go directly to the relief of the rates.  There is a need for certain surgical appliances, X-rays and other things, which Deputy O'Dowd mentioned, and I see that these will probably not be provided for years in some county hospitals and not provided at all in other county hospitals.  For my part, I would be perfectly willing to see portion of the proceeds of these sweepstakes go simply to the surgical improvement of county hospitals or to their improvement by the building of proper operating theatres or the proper equipment of operating theatres or things of that kind.  But for many reasons I would not wish to see that principle extended any further than I have mentioned.  Deputy O'Dowd mentioned the possibility of building homes for unmarried mothers.  These would not be hospitals at all.</P>

      <P>The equiping of them for the purpose of establishing homes for unmarried mothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> That would be travelling completely outside the scope of the original Act and would open the door for the holding of lotteries for every class and sort of work.  Moreover, there is a very important matter upon which Deputy O'Dowd hardly touched and that is the question of distribution. For instance, the Dublin Union has got something like 1,800 beds.  The largest Dublin hospital participating in this sweepstake, and the largest hospital, in fact, in the City&mdash;the Mater Hospital&mdash;contains only 412 beds.  The next largest is the Cork Street Fever Hospital with 284 beds. The third is the Richmond Hospital with 250.  If you distribute the money between the hospitals which are relying upon voluntary subscriptions and the Union Hospital on the basis of beds you would have little left for the voluntary hospitals.  Almost everything would go to the Union Hospital. There are a great many other hospitals in the country.  If you enlarge the participating hospitals to three or four times the present number there would be practically nothing left for the voluntary hospitals.  In my judgment, at any rate, the voluntary hospitals have taken a certain risk of losing subscriptions, and though I do not believe the subscriptions will fall off altogether and I hope there will not be a substantial diminution in the voluntary subscriptions, still I am afraid that the hospitals will find that a great number of persons who used to subscribe to them in the past will cease to subscribe and say &ldquo;you have got enough out of the sweepstakes scheme and there is no reason why we should give anything further.&rdquo;  Therefore, in my opinion, the hospitals have taken a very considerable risk and if they took that risk, and at the same time did not get substantially what they thought they would have got when the scheme was launched, it would hardly be fair to the voluntary hospitals, because I again repeat that in my view, at any rate, it was to make up for inadequacy of voluntary subscriptions that the Dáil consented to the passing of the original Act.</P>
    <P>I should like for a moment&mdash;because it is really germane to the issue, <Col N="385" /> though it may not just for the moment appear so&mdash;to refer very shortly to the working of the present hospitals scheme as shown by the first results. There can be no doubt that the organisation and everything else of that kind in connection with the scheme was marvellously well done.  There can be no doubt that the result of the scheme in cash was very much larger than I think anybody in his most sanguine moments could possibly have anticipated. Also, the working of the sweep scheme was so completely fair and above board, so completely above anything in the nature of suspicion, the draw was so public and so excellently carried out, that I believe this hospital scheme is thoroughly well established, and that future schemes which are authorised by this Act, will continue to bring in very substantial sums of money, even though they are now meeting with certain difficulties that I need not enumerate to the House, and also that certain rivals have come into the field against them.</P>
    <P>I think, as far as we can see, that the mere collecting of the money has been admirably done.  However, the fair distribution of the proceeds among the hospitals is very difficult, and I think, under the present system, will be practically impossible for the future.  In the first scheme there was very little difficulty?  The hospitals agreed immediately as to the proportion of distribution amongst themselves. There has been more difficulty about the second scheme, and about the third there has been very considerable difficulty in deciding what proportion of the proceeds each hospital should have.  It is perfectly obvious that this would be the case, when you had a body of seventy or eighty people representing different hospitals coming together, each naturally and in the ordinary course of human nature, pressing the claims of his own hospital, and considering the needs of his own hospital rather than the needs of the neighbouring hospitals.  I am not satisfied myself really that justice to all hospitals by the present method can be done, and my intention is to introduce a measure which will be to this effect: That a <Col N="386" /> small committee should be set up which of necessity would be a committee containing experts, and that those experts should inquire into the eligibility of every individual hospital which wishes to participate in this scheme&mdash;that is every hospital a substantial portion of whose revenue was raised before the passing of the Act through voluntary subscriptions.  That committee would draw up and submit to me a scheme on the basis of which the proceeds of each sweep available for distribution among the various hospitals, should be divided.</P>
    <P>Of course, the distribution would depend upon such considerations as the amount of good work which the hospital is doing, its financial needs, what it is likely to want in the immediate future, how it stands at the present moment, what are its sources of revenue, what equipment or new buildings it might legitimately need&mdash; all these things should be inquired into and then a scheme on that basis should be drawn up.  The proceeds of the funds available for the hospitals should be paid to that body of trustees, and distributed by them among the various participating voluntary hospitals, as they, in their unfettered discretion, consider to be just.  I would suggest, and the Bill that I propose to introduce will suggest, that 75 per cent. of the proceeds of the sweep should go to the hospitals dependant upon voluntary subscriptions, and now in danger of losing those voluntary subscriptions, the hospitals that promoted this Bill, and that the remaining 25 per cent. should go amongst the County Surgical Hospitals in proportion to the population of the counties in which they exist.  Otherwise there will be, I foresee, an impossible scramble between the various boards of health, each one claiming so much that it would be impossible to make a division.  I think the fairest basis would be to distribute the sum available on a county basis, and then let the county boards of health apply the money that they receive to the improvement of the general equipment of their hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are, I know, certain other hospitals and sanatoria which do very <Col N="387" /> excellent work amongst the poor and which now cannot participate in the existing scheme.  There is another Bill coming in very shortly dealing with institutions which help tubercular patients.  I may as well mention now that, in my judgment, there at any rate are two institutions which do excellent work amongst tubercular patients.  One is the Cappagh institution and the other is the new village scheme at Peamount.  Both those are doing very good work of an hospital nature.  I think it is quite possible that schemes like those should be included amongst the bodies which are entitled to receive portion of the proceeds of the 75 per cent. which will be available to voluntary hospitals.  There may be others of a like nature, and when the Bill comes before the House they can either be included under a certain class or be included in a schedule to the Bill by name.</P>
    <P>I have roughly outlined what particular amendments I consider that this Hospitals Bill at the moment requires. I do not profess to give the House any details.  I would suggest to the House that discussion on both these Bills would remain until the actual Bill in completed form would be before the House for consideration.  I want to make it clear that on general principle money in aid of the public revenue or in aid of the local rates should not be raised by lottery or by sweepstakes.  I stand firm on that, and I think I am standing on very firm and sound ground indeed.</P>

      <P>When the first lottery was being run for the Hospitals Sweep certain people wrote to the papers that this was an excellent method of doing away with direct taxation and raising revenue for the State.  The Minister for Justice seems to be under some delusion about the enormous amount left after paying the prizes. The Minister seems to have a very poor opinion about county institutions of all kinds.  He seems to have been bitten by Dublinmania.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that a number of county hospitals, county infirmaries or district hospitals were sustained out of the rates and there was nothing voluntary about them.  I wonder is he aware that in a great number of cases special wards were constructed out of charitable donations, that wireless was installed, and that gifts of clothing to the patients were given.  In one particular case I know that an X-ray plant was installed.  There is one in Mullingar, one of the best in Ireland, which cost some thousands of pounds.  That was installed by voluntary subscription. These hospitals served the poor, and they saved the county the expense of sending the poor up to the Dublin hospitals in the case of certain diseases at great risk.  They have saved a great deal to the ratepayers in the cost of maintenance of those patients in the Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the best case for this Bill when he indicated that in the South Dublin Union there were 1,800 beds, while in the biggest of the voluntary hospitals there were only 400 beds.  I contend that through the medium of large voluntary subscriptions we were able to supply equipment of various kinds to these institutions. That equipment was of an up-to-date kind for the treatment of the poor, but the Minister said that he was afraid this money would be used towards the relief of the rates.  Our contention is that in the present state of the country and as we anticipate in the state of the country for a number of years to come, no county board of health or county infirmary committee will be able to undertake the equipment which is so very necessary in these county and district hospitals and county infirmaries.</P>

The installation of special surgical equipment and the setting up of an operating theatre, which I understand from the Minister will come within the scope of the proposed Bill, are two things which will save thousands of pounds to the ratepayers.

      <P>Do I understand the Minister to mean in the course of the discussion, that within the purview of the Bill he intends to introduce, it will be possible to discuss and determine not only the amounts which are to be allocated amongst the hospitals that are to participate in the sweepstake but also that of the total sum of the takings of the sweepstake a certain proportion will be allocated to the hospitals.</P>

      <P>I presume it would be possible to debate that.  My own impression is that it would be much better to let the promoters bear the responsibilities.  You could not very well work out in the House the details of a scheme and I think it is better to leave that matter to a specially selected Committee.  That Committee would be elected by the hospitals and they would make the best bargain they could on behalf of the hospitals.  Of course it is quite on the cards that, by increasing the proportion of the total sweep money that the hospitals will get, you might really be getting a smaller sum for the hospitals; that is to say, there is a limit to which you can cut down the attractiveness of the scheme.  The hospitals under the present scheme are getting 25 per cent. of the total proceeds.</P>

      <P>I quite follow what the Minister says, but at the same time I think it is generally agreed throughout the country that a larger proportion of the sum raised could have been given to the hospitals and that practically not one penny piece less would have been subscribed by any of the purchasers of tickets if the prizes had been considerably less than they were.  I cannot conceive a person purchasing a ten shilling ticket in the hope of getting £200,000 who would not equally purchase a ticket in the hope of getting £100,000 or even £50,000.</P>

      <P>The point is that a person will buy a ticket knowing that a certain proportion of the money accumulated in the sale of tickets, whatever it may be, is going to be divided; but if a person thinks that only one-third of the total amount subscribed will be given in prizes, then there are other sweeps that would be much more attractive and that person might not dream of investing in Irish sweepstakes.  That is my individual view.</P>

      <P>The sum allocated for expenses comes out of one fund.  I think that the persons who buy tickets have got rights and some one should look after and safeguard the general interests of the purchasing public.  There are people all over the world who buy tickets and we should see to it in our scheme that we are not a sort of grab-all people but that the persons who buy tickets shall get a very fair deal from us.  I think almost everybody in the House will agree with me in that matter.</P>

I would like to point out to the Minister that the Bill he has referred to should be introduced as quickly as possible.  I am sure, as it will be more or less an agreed <Col N="392" /> measure, that it could be put through all its stages rapidly.  It is expected that the biggest sweepstake that will be run under the present Act will be the sweep on this year's Derby.

The audited accounts of these hospitals have not been lodged, but apart from that the whole scheme has been settled; it is only waiting for formal sanction when these balance sheets which, I presume, will be correct, are lodged.

      <P>Yes.  Not only do I want to have the Bill put through all its stages, but I would like that the committee I propose to set up would have some little time to consider various proposals before the scheme is finally arranged.  They could not actually make a distribution until the money is got in, but they ought to be in a position to examine the accounts of the hospitals fully.  It is not heavy work, but still they should have time to do it.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the Minister in his statement on the question of distribution, and I suggest that these hospitals who have already got advantages out of these sweepstakes, should now abstain from seeking benefits out of future sweepstake schemes until such time as other hospitals will be given a chance, and if they do not do this voluntarily they should be made to do so compulsorily.</P>

      <P>That should be one of the matters the committee should carefully consider.  If a hospital has already got substantial benefits from these schemes and has sufficient money to carry on with, but simply wants money to bank up and put on deposit receipt, I do not think such hospitals should be allowed to participate.  If a hospital wants to get things which could hardly be considered strictly hospital work, I think such hospitals should have their claims postponed until the hospitals that require the money for the improvement of the condition of their patients are satisfied.  All these are matters of an expert nature, and I think it would require a small impartial body to examine into the structural needs of the hospitals and matters of that nature.</P>

      <P>I desire to move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the decision of the Executive Council accepting the recommendation of the Tariff Commission that a Customs tariff should not be imposed on fish barrels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 7th March, 1927, an application by the Irish Free State Fish Barrel Makers' Association for the imposition of a customs duty of 33? per cent. on all imported barrels intended for use in the packing of cured fish was referred to the Tariff Commission.  In November, 1929, the Tariff Commission reported on that application, and included in its report a recommendation that the application be not granted, which recommendation was accepted by the Government, I then submitted <Col N="394" /> this motion, which has been on the Order Paper since.  I put the motion down, not because I claimed to have any special knowledge of the industries affected by the application, but because I thought, in the first place, that it was desirable that the Dáil should be afforded an opportunity of considering the case that was made in support of the application and the reasons advanced by the Tariff Commission for its rejection.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Tariff Commission Act has been operated in a manner which deprives the Dáil of having any effective say in the imposition of protective duties in such a case as this in which the Tariff Commission recommend that the application be not granted.  In such cases, in fact, the merits of the application cannot come under review by the Dáil at all unless some private member brings forward a motion such as that which I am now moving.  Apart from that consideration, when reading the report of the Commission, I was struck by the fact that they appeared to have given much greater consideration to the evidence submitted to them by the barrel-making firms in the Six Counties, by the Belfast Fish Curers' Association, by Deputy Major Myles, and by the associations catering for the Scottish steam drifters and Scottish curers than they did to the evidence submitted by citizens of this State.  The Commission reveal in their report the same mentality as they revealed in other reports. The difficulties of the Scottish steam-drifters and fish-curers appeared to have carried much more weight with the Commission than did the difficulties of the Free State curers or the Free State fish barrel manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Somehow or other, the members of the Commission never appeared to be able to contemplate the possibilities of Irishmen fulfilling any other function than that of tinkers and handymen pandering to the comforts of foreign tourists or acting as hewers of wood and drawers of water to such foreign industrialists as think fit to avail of such resources as are to be had here. In any case, the arguments against the application of the fish-barrel manufacturers, as set out in the report, do not appear to be well-founded, and although, as I have said, I do not claim <Col N="395" /> to have any special qualification, I think it is nevertheless possible for me, or any other layman in my position, to demonstrate that the case for the application was much stronger than the case against it, and very much stronger than would appear from the report of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be well if I begin by giving a synopsis of the case against the application, as set out by the Commission. The circumstances of the fish-barrel manufacturing industry are, of course, inextricably mixed up with those of the fishing industry and can, therefore, be considered under two heads&mdash;first, in relation to the herring fishing industry, and, secondly, in relation to the mackerel fishing industry. In the case of the herring fishing industry it is stated in the report that herring fishing from Donegal and other Free State ports is carried on mainly by non-Saorstát vessels.  Most of these vessels are Scottish.  I take it that the term &ldquo;non-Saorstát&rdquo; is used by the Tariff Commission rather than the term &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; in consequence of the political implications of the latter term. However, the fact is that the herring fishing industry is very largely in the hands of Scottish people, and it was the difficulty that would arise if the application were granted in consequence of that fact, that appeared to have weighed most with the Commission. The greater proportion of the catch is not sold fresh in this country, but is pickled and exported mainly to the Continent through the port or Hamburg. Hence the market to which drifters and other vessels engaged in herring fishing look for the sale of their catches is provided by the curers, and many of the Scottish curing firms establish themselves at Free State ports during the fishing season, and it is contended by the Commission that the presence of these Scottish curers at the fishing port is essential to the prosperity of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>The curers require for their business an adequate supply of barrels at a reasonable price.  It is the practice of some of the principal Scottish curers to work a cooperage as an adjunct to their main business and make use of <Col N="396" /> their own barrels as far as possible in their curing trade.  The Tariff Commission argued that the effect of a tariff would be to deprive the Free State herring fishing industry of the services of the Scottish curers, and that in the absence of these curers the Scottish drifters would cease to land their catches at Free State ports. They, therefore, recommended that the tariff be not imposed.  I think that that is a fair summary of the case they made in respect of the herring fishing industry and the effect which the granting of the application would have upon that industry.</P>
    <P>In the case of the mackerel fishing industry, the vessels and curers from foreign countries do not participate. Again, however, the greater portion of the catch is cured for export. The market is in the United States of America and is already protected by a tariff.  The position, therefore, of Free State exporters in that market is already precarious, and any increase in their working costs would make it impossible for them to continue their trade, or, at any rate, so the Commission contend.  They argue that the free importation of Norwegian barrels tends to keep down the price of barrels produced in the Free State and thus makes it easier for exporters of cured mackerel to maintain their position in the protected market in America.  That is the second half of the case.</P>
    <P>If we take the two parts of this application separately it will probably be found more convenient.  It will be seen that the main contention of the Commission against the application is that its granting would result in the disappearance of the Scottish curing firms from Free State ports and that their disappearance would mean that the Scottish fishing fleet would not use them. It is difficult to believe that in the evidence to that effect which was given before the Commission there was not a very great percentage of bluff.  It would appear, and it has been stated to me by persons prominently identified with the curing business, that the Scottish curers and the Scottish Drifters' Association gave evidence before the Commission very largely at <Col N="397" /> the instance of the Six Counties barrel manufacturers, and made statements to the effect I have indicated, without intending that, in the event of the tariff being imposed, they would, in fact, get out of the Free State fishing business altogether.  I think that it can be shown that there would still be sufficient inducement for them to keep in the business and that, even if they did go out, their place would ultimately be taken by others who would be desirous of securing the profits which they were relinquishing.</P>
    <P>Speaking as one who has no direct knowledge of the industry, I may say that I could not find in the report of the Commission any good reason why we should seriously endeavour to keep the Scottish curers at our ports, or to keep the Scottish fishing fleet using them.  It does not seem to me that we gain any substantial advantage from that.  Even the employment given to the Irish people is very limited.  It is the practice of these Scottish firms to bring their own workmen with them and, apart from whatever benefits may accrue to the towns in which they are employed in maintaining them throughout their visit, no substantial advantage is gained.  It certainly does not appear to me that the advantage is of such a nature that we should take action which is likely to have the effect of definitely putting a number of Irish cooperage firms out of business and of greatly increasing the difficulties with which Irish curers have to contend.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the report that there is a market on the Continent for herring caught off the Donegal coast, as distinct from the general market for cured or pickled herring.  The Donegal herring is of special size and quality, and commands in the Continental markets a price which, in some cases, ranges as high as 50 per cent. in excess of the price secured by herring caught elsewhere.  It is the good quality of the Donegal herring which has brought the Scottish curers and fishing fleet to the Donegal ports.  The opponents of the application stated that if it were granted it would be possible for the Scottish fishing fleet to continue fishing in Free State waters from Scottish ports, but those with whom I discussed that matter contend that if they did so <Col N="398" /> they would have to engage in six hours extra steaming on each journey and would lose one night's fishing a week, that the loss involved would be much greater than any loss they might sustain in consequence of increased prices for barrels following the imposition of a tariff.</P>
    <P>It is not clear either that the imposition of a tariff would, in fact, make it so difficult for the Scottish curers to continue their business that they would leave our ports altogether.  The main contention of the Tariff Commission is that it is essential in the curing business to have at the disposal of curers a number of skilled workers for the purpose of opening and closing the barrels.  The barrels have to be closed and opened a number of times during the process of pickling.  One of the reasons advanced by the applicants was that the existence of cooperages in the Free State meant that the services of skilled coopers could be put at the disposal of Irish curers and they argued that if, as a result of the refusal of the application, these curers went out of business Irish curers would have difficulty in getting skilled coopers to carry on their business. In fact, the only reason why the Scottish curing firms make their own barrels is to enable them to keep in employment during the non-fishing season the coopers whom they require during the fishing season, apart from the fact that it is apparently generally agreed in the trade that hand-made barrels are much superior to the machine-made barrels which are imported.</P>
    <P>I have evidence that if these Scotch curers could rely on securing a supply of barrels within the Free State at prices corresponding to those at which they can now make them for themselves they would not, in fact, import barrels at all but would avail of the Free State supply.  A point to note in this connection, however, is that the actual number of barrels imported by curers for their own use in the manner stated in the report of the Tariff Commission is only a very small percentage of our total imports. In the year 1927, according to the figures set out in the report, some 185,000 barrels were used in the fish <Col N="399" /> curing industry here.  Of these, 38,000 were the products of Free State cooperages; 61,184 were imported from Northern Ireland; 16,277 from Norway, and only 69,549 from Great Britain.  Of that number of 69,549, a large number were imported for sale in the ordinary way, and not by the curers for use in their own business.</P>
    <P>The Tariff Commission concentrated all their attention upon the position of these Scotch curers who, by the imposition of this tariff, might be debarred from importing their own barrels, made in their own works, for their own use when engaged in the curing business here.  Deputies should know that, in addition to these importations, a large number of barrels come in for sale to Irish curers and Scotch curers here.  They are being sold in competition with the native products. The Tariff Commission do not deny that the Free State cooperages are quite capable of producing all the barrels required in the curing industry here.  It is right to say that they produce barrels of a particularly good quality.  The evidence submitted to the Commission by the fish curers was all in favour of the hand-made barrels as being more reliable than the machine-made barrels.  Of course, the Tariff Commission are always on the look out for machines.  When any application comes before them they always, apparently, go to see the largest machine for use in that industry.  If they cannot find that machine installed in some Irish works they arrive at the conclusion that Irish works are not efficient. They discovered in some Scotch works what is called a trussing machine. They admit that in a number of works they visited they found this machine. idle, and that the barrels produced by it are, in many cases, defective and, certainly, inferior to the barrels produced by hand.  They, however, come to the conclusion that because this machine does not exist in any of the Irish cooperages the latter cannot be classed as efficient.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with the manager of the largest cooperage in the Free State, and I learned from him that the fact is that this trussing machine is of very doubtful utility.  In <Col N="400" /> the case of the firm to which I refer the non-installation of the machine was not due to any deficiency in the way of capital, or for any reason except that the manager of the firm did not think much of the machine.  He was satisfied that if he installed it, and sold barrels made by it, the reputation he had built up for his products would be destroyed by the inferior barrels produced in that way.</P>
    <P>It is a fact, however, that Free State barrels are normally sold at prices slightly in excess of the price at which Scotch and Northern Ireland barrels can be imported.  There are certain reasons for that which are set out in the report of the Tariff Commission, one being that the Irish cooperages have to pay a slightly higher price for the imported raw material, the other and main reason being that owing to intense competition these cooperages are only working at a small percentage of their capacity.  It is reasonable to assume that if the whole market were reserved to them and they were thereby enabled to increase their production, they would also be able to effect a reduction in prices.  In fact, the two principal cooperages concerned in the application gave a written undertaking to the effect that the prices mentioned in the undertaking would not be exceeded while the cost of the raw material and wages remained the same. The cooperages reserved the right, however, to increase prices following any rise in the cost of raw materials or wages.  In commenting upon that undertaking the Tariff Commission remark that the cooperages did not undertake to reduce prices should the cost of raw materials or wages fall. They did not give that undertaking because they were not asked for it.  They have assured me that they are quite willing to give that undertaking.  They will be quite satisfied, if they can secure the prices now prevailing, subject only to such alterations as may be necessitated by a rise or fall in the cost of raw materials and in the prevailing wage rates.  The intention of the Tariff Commission, of course, is that this increased price which curers would have to pay for their barrels, if the tariff were imposed, would definitely handicap them in their business <Col N="401" /> and result in a reduction in the volume of fish cured and exported.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that there is a demand on the Continent for Donegal herrings as such, a demand which is not associated with the demand for ordinary, cured herrings.  The price paid for Donegal herrings exceeds the price paid for other herrings.  I should mention that herrings are sold in Hamburg and in other markets by auction. The fish when received is put up for auction and sold to the highest bidder. Within very short periods the price secured for Donegal herrings has fluctuated by more than 10/- a barrel.  The exporter of the herrings cannot be certain what price he is going to get until they are auctioned.  He does not know whether he will get 50/- or 60/- per barrel until the sale is completed.</P>
    <P>It has, however, been contended by the Tariff Commission that an exporter who is engaged in that very risky form of business will go out of business altogether if his costs of production are increased by sixpence a barrel in consequence of the imposition of a tariff.  That argument appears to me to be perfectly nonsensical. I am quite satisfied that so long as there is a demand on the Continent for Donegal herrings it will be profitable to supply that demand even if the price on the barrels has to be increased by sixpence following the protection given to the barrel-making industry here.  It should also be noted that the price of barrels fluctuates. The price of the barrel is determined very largely by the demand for them, and the demand is determined by the actual size of the catch.  No one can foretell what the catch in any season is going to be.  In some seasons the catches are very large and in others very small.  The price of barrels rises or falls in accordance with the size of the catch.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the existing cooperage business in the Free State was a direct result of the abnormal circumstances which arose in the year 1924, when there was a very heavy herring harvest.  Barrels were particularly scarce and, in fact, it became impossible for Irish curers to obtain them at any price.  They paid prices which were, in many cases, more than double those now prevailing, in order to get the barrels essential <Col N="402" /> for the continuance of their business.  When that situation arose a number of Irish curers came together and took steps to have the cooperage business established in the Free State which would ensure that if the circumstances were repeated in future they could be certain of having a supply of barrels in this country.</P>
    <P>The Department of Fisheries was also instrumental in having steps taken to that end, and are still engaged in trying to get Free State cooperages to take on apprentices, their concern being to have a number of skilled coopers always available here so that curers could carry on their business.  While the Department of Fisheries are anxious to take steps to that end, to ensure a supply of coopers here always, the whole policy of the Government is tending in the opposite direction.  The position is now that Irish cooperages are only supplying about 20 per cent. of the barrels used in the country, and that percentage is likely to decrease unless this measure of protection is afforded them.  That is the position in relation to the herring industry.</P>
    <P>I think it is unlikely that the imposition of the tariff would result in the Scotch curers vacating our ports. There still remains an inducement for them to continue in the business, even if the price of their barrels should be increased by 6d.  Remember that some of these curers use their own barrels and therefore have them at the minimum cost of production.  Others import barrels or buy barrels from Free State cooperages.  If the Scotch curers do not go the Scotch steam drifters will not go.  I do not believe the steam drifters would go even if the Scotch curers went.  I think the disappearance of the Scotch curers would mean their replacement in time by Irish curing firms, a number of which exist at the moment and are struggling to retain their hold on the industry. On the other hand the granting of the application would mean the preservation and development of the cooperage business here.  It would mean that Irish curers could be sure of having at their disposal the services of the skilled coopers which they require. It would mean that there would be always available a supply of barrels within the country to enable <Col N="403" /> business to be carried on, and we would not be dependent on the surplus available in Scotland or England in a year in which there might be a heavy harvest.</P>
    <P>In relation to the mackerel industry the circumstances are somewhat different.  The contention of the Tariff Commission in that case is that it is necessary for the Irish mackerel curers to get barrels at the lowest possible price, because their market in the United States of America is a precarious one and that any increase in the price of the barrels would have to be offset by a decrease in the price paid for their fish, or else would put them out of business altogether.  The applicants argued and produced evidence to show that barrels imported from Norway&mdash;and it is mainly Norwegian barrels Irish coopers are in competition with in the mackerel curing industry&mdash;were of very poor quality.  They were leaking, and badly constructed.  A number of those who used them had reason to regret doing so and had ceased to use them.  It is clear that these Norwegian barrels sell more cheaply than it is possible for Irish coopers to sell barrels, but the Irish coopers maintain that the superior quality of their product makes the difference in price worth while.  At the present price a Norwegian mackerel barrel costs 5/7, whereas the price of a Free State barrel is 6/3.  In any case the applicants contend that instead of the free importation of Norwegian barrels keeping down the price of Free State barrels the reverse is the case, that it was the establishment of cooperages here in the year 1924 that brought down the price of Norwegian barrels.</P>
    <P>When the mackerel curers were in the position that they could buy from Norway alone they were charged exorbitant prices, but with the establishment of cooperages here the price of Norwegian barrels was brought down.  They contend that if, as a result of the refusal of this tariff, the Free State cooperages disappear the price of Norwegian barrels will go up. That is the dire result the Tariff Commission say might flow from the granting of the application.  The fact that a <Col N="404" /> number of persons engaged in the fish curing business in Kerry and Cork were associated with the application for a tariff would seem to indicate that they did not anticipate the results which the Tariff Commission professes to foresee.  That is, I think, the whole case.</P>
    <P>The attitude of members of the Dáil in relation to this particular application for a tariff will, of course, be determined very largely by their general views on the question of the protection of industry.  The case for the imposition of a tariff on fish barrels is, of course, complicated to some extent by the fact that these barrels are the raw material of an export business. There is, however, practically no industrial product which cannot be described as being in some way the raw material of some other industry, and the question which we must ask ourselves is whether or not it is possible for us to supply this raw material to this industry without causing damage sufficient to offset the advantage which would flow from doing so.  I think we can.  I think the difficulties the Tariff Commission mentioned, and which were brought to their notice by the Scotch Steam Drifters' Association, and their friends in Belfast and Derry, are largely illusory; that, in fact, these difficulties will not be there at all, and that the Tariff Commission were bluffed by these outsiders, who were making a good thing out of Irish trade.</P>
    <P>Whatever advantage we get from their presence at our ports we continue to get even if this application is granted.  We think that although the employment to be given in the industry is not very large&mdash;it is a very minor industry&mdash;nevertheless it is of considerable importance.  We have very few opportunities of providing a livelihood for skilled workers in this country and those engaged in this industry are particularly highly skilled.  We should, I think, endeavour to preserve at all costs the opportunities for employing skilled workers that are available.  In any case the existence of these skilled workers in the country is essential to the business of fish-curing, and our concern should be to foster and facilitate the Irish rather than the Scotch fish curers.  The Tariff Commission decided it was more important to preserve the Scotch curers when they are <Col N="405" /> willing to contemplate the disappearance of the Irish cooperage business, and consequently the difficulty of Irish curers in getting coopers required in their business.  We think that the attitude of this Tariff Commission should be otherwise, and we regret sincerely that the Government should have thought of accepting the Tariff Commission's recommendation in this matter.  We think the House should pass this motion, and thus indicate that it disapproves of their action in so doing.</P>

      <P>I listened very attentively to Deputy Lemass going through the report of the Tariff Commission. We each must take our own view on every subject that comes before this House, and I am sorry that Deputy Lemass only put before us the views of the barrel-makers, perhaps I might say slightly intermingled with a lecture on tariffs generally.  I think it was a very wise decision on the part of the Government when they set up a Tariff Commission so that an independent body of men could investigate fully and decide what should be tariffed and what should not.  I do not think the Tariff Commission has made many mistakes in their career.  Deputy Lemass told us he did not know much about the fish trade.  I do not know much about it, but I do know intimately the conditions in the County Donegal.  I think he should have told us several of the difficulties to be got over.  You have got your barrel factories for the most part in Dublin.  You have got to send your stuff to the outlying parts of Donegal.  There is no direct rail communication. If you want to get your stuff to the western parts of Buncrana, Burtonport, or Killybegs you have got to go half-way round Ireland before you get there, and the carriage alone on Dublin-made barrels would be worse than any tariff.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass referred several times to 6d. a barrel. That is the first I heard of 6d. a barrel.  Application was made for a tariff of 33? per cent, and if my memory is right there never was any talk of an application for a tariff lower <Col N="406" /> than 33? per cent.  Thirty-three-and-one-third per cent. would work out on each barrel somewhere from about 2s. to 2s. 6d., with carriage from Dublin on top of that.  It would make it a very expensive barrel when it got to the far end of Donegal.</P>
      <P>My principal reason for opposing this tariff is that it is a charge on raw material.  The barrel is part and parcel of an export trade, and I am afraid the Deputy passed lightly over a couple of points that would tell very strongly when you got down into business. He said that the Scotchmen were getting a powerful price for Donegal herrings in Hamburg.  I agree and I am glad that Donegal herrings have a reputation.  But to say that Donegal herrings obtained as much as 50 per cent. more than any other herring caught within fifty miles of Donegal seems to be going too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>We could.  It is the details in business that count.  You get down to the fact that the exporters of herrings are competing in the world's market, and that the difference of 2s. or 2s. 6d. is going to make a tremendous difference where there is a glut of herrings in any country or where you have Norwegian herrings competing in Hamburg with our herrings and spoiling the price.  That is the time the tariff is going to hit you, and that is the time money is going to be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will leave the House to form their own opinion of non-Saorstát fishermen. These Scotchmen are not coming over for the good of Ireland, and if we had a body of people in our country with the energy and brains to put their capital into this we would not want the Scotch fishermen, but until that day arrives we should be glad to have them.  I will tell the House that if the Scotch boats cease to come here and in my opinion if a <Col N="407" /> great many of them would cease to come the fishermen would lose, not only the fishermen who get employment but the casual workers in the various fishing villages in Donegal. Again, I am only speaking of what I know, the amount of money that is spent by these Scotchmen per cran of herrings landed in each port.  Deputy Lemass has a tremendous array of figures.  I am sorry I have to speak from memory.  Deputy Lemass did not give us any idea of what the benefit to places like Buncrana, Burtonport, Kincasslagh and Killybegs would be, not to the capitalist but to the ordinary man who is anxious to get a job.  The average amount of money per cran spent in a district runs from 10/- to 11/- and there may be hundreds of crans a day landed in these ports.  Surely in the absence of our own fleet we would be foolish to do anything that might imperil that money being spent?  Of course, we will be told that if the Scotchmen do not come somebody else will arise in this country to catch the fish, but in the meantime while we are waking up to that position hundreds of thousands of people along the Donegal coast will suffer badly.  We are told of the enormous profits that these people make.  I happen to know these men coming over to this country and in many seasons there is a considerable loss.  I have seen the balance sheets of some of these people.  They have to face the markets in Hamburg. The price varies from day to day. They never know when they are going to be right.</P>
    <P>I would also like to correct the impression that might be left about this question of catching Donegal herrings and landing them in Scottish ports.  We are told that it makes a difference of six hours steaming and perhaps one night's fishing in the week.  They land them in Scotland.  I am not going to argue how many hours' steaming it would be from where the herrings are, because herrings shift about, and very often they are nearer to the Scottish coast than six hours' steaming.  I do know that but for one circumstance our ports in Donegal to-day would not be the centres of fishing that they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> The port of Derry before the war, and in the early days of the war, was beginning to outrival Buncrana, and Derry is not six hours' steaming from the fishing ground.  I think I would be safe in saying that one and a half hours' extra steaming would land them in Derry with a considerable saving in rail charges.  The reason why Derry is not the fishing port for Donegal herrings is because it became congested in the days of the war and the landing stages were taken over by the shipyards. Various other causes contributed to Derry not being the port, but these conditions have altered; the ground is now available, and it would not take very much to divert that trade from our county into Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have not been told in this House the number of coopers that would be employed, working full time, if the tariff had been granted, but I think if we put two coopers in the County Donegal they would make as many barrels during the season as would do the county for years under the best conditions, and are we going for the sake of bolstering up a very small number of coopers to penalise the actual fishermen? Remember, all the herrings are not caught by Scotchmen at the present time.  For months past a great quantity of herrings is being caught by the local small boats off the west coast of Donegal.  If we tariff their barrels we are going to penalise these men. The question is: are we going to bolster up a few coopers at the expense of these fishermen?</P>

      <P>The report of the Tariff Commission in regard to the application for a tariff on fish barrels is, in my opinion, a very unique production.  I believe it is a report that was influenced very largely by the evidence given by people, directly or indirectly, interested in the cooperage business outside the Saorstát.  Deputy Lemass stated that he believed the Tariff Commission were bluffed by outsiders who were making a good thing out of the industry.  I certainly agree with that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the report of the Tariff Commission and the verbatim report of the evidence given before it, I am of the opinion that if the Tariff Commission <Col N="409" /> had acceded to the request for a tariff on fish barrels it would have helped to give more employment to coopers in the Saorstát and at the same time it would not retard in any way the fishing industry.  As Deputy Lemass has pointed out, a written guarantee was given by a number of firms interested in the coopers' business that there would be no increase in price if the home market were protected.  It is well known, as far as the Saorstát is concerned, and as far as County Donegal, the constituency that I represent, is concerned, that there are tens of thousands of barrels used every year.  During the British regime something at least was done by the old Congested Districts Board, as far as the Gaeltacht area is concerned, in the way of providing employment and fair wages for coopers.  Under the British Government a cooperage was established in County Donegal.  And one of the reasons why I would like to see a tariff put on fish barrels at the present time is because I believe that if it were put on, a certain firm is prepared to come into the county of Donegal and open a cooperage works that would give much-needed employment, and that would not increase the cost of barrels to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised at the statement made by Major Myles that each one of us must take our own view of every subject that comes before the House.  Personally I think that is a mistaken idea.  I think we should take the view that would help to improve the conditions in our constituencies and in the country generally, rather than hold to our own individual views. Deputy Myles went further and said that he did not think the Tariff Commission had made many mistakes.  I hold, as far as Donegal is concerned, at any rate, that the Tariff Commission has made a very grievous mistake in not acceding to the request for a tariff on fish barrels.  Major Myles, knowingly or unknowingly, I believe misled the House.  He indicated that most of the barrels in Donegal would be manufactured in Dublin, and that in sending these barrels to the County Donegal very large freights were incurred. I quite agree with him, but if that was the only manner in which <Col N="410" /> the price of a barrel could go up it would be easily remedied.  I think the Deputy is as well aware as I am that the majority of the barrels coming in to Donegal do not come from Dublin but rather from the Six Counties.  I believe that the speech that Deputy Myles has made here to-day is a speech in favour of industries within the Six Counties as against industries within the Saorstát.  I believe, candidly, that his speech was made in favour of an industry in Derry.</P>

      <P>I qualify my remarks to this extent, that I say Deputy Myles's speech was, either knowingly or unknowingly, a speech in favour of industry in Derry City as against industry in County Donegal, because, as I have said, a guarantee has been given by a certain firm that if the tariff were granted they would be prepared to go into Donegal and open a cooperage which would give much-needed employment.</P>

      <P>Many people informed the Tariff Commission of many things in regard to this particular application, but, as I said in my opening remarks, and as Deputy Lemass said, the evidence that really counted as far as the Tariff Commission were concerned was evidence given by people outside the Saorstát.

      <P>By no means.  What I allege is this, as far as the Tariff Commission were concerned when the application came before them for a tariff on tobacco, a tariff on furniture or on butter they were mostly, if not altogether, influenced by the viewpoint of people concerned in the industry in the Saorstát.  I allege without hesitation that so far as the Tariff Commission in this particular instance were concerned they were influenced to a very big extent by people directly, or indirectly interested in the coopering business, and having business interests outside the Saorstát and who would naturally be opposed to a tariff on fish barrels if they thought it would have a detrimental effect upon themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the Tariff Commission were aware that if a tariff were granted upon those barrels an industry would be started locally in Donegal?  Was that fact brought to the knowledge of the Tariff Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot state what was definitely in the minds of those who constituted the Tariff Commission. I am making a statement, here and now, as to what I heard in my constituency and which I believe to be true.  What I wish to say is that the views of the Tariff Commission were influenced largely by people outside the Saorstát, and who had not the interests of the fishing or the coopering industry, or industry generally in the Saorstát, at heart. These people were sending 61,000 barrels from the Six Counties and 65,000 from Great Britain, and these are the people whose opinions, according to my idea, largely influenced the report of the Tariff Commission that we are discussing at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago we had a discussion in this House as to the sea-fishing Co-operative Association, when it was mentioned, as Deputy Myles said, that approximately 70 per cent. of the fish landed on the shores of the Saorstát was handled by non-Saorstát fishermen. If this sea-fisheries Co-operative Association is to be a success, in addition to catering for the fishing industry, <Col N="412" /> it should cater also for the coopering industry, which is largely allied to the fishing industry.  Deputy Myles made a remark with which I agree, that we were glad to see Scotch curers coming to Donegal and other places. It is better, of course, to see the Scotch curers coming as far as Donegal is concerned rather than that no fishing at all should be carried on, but surely Deputy Myles hopes that a day will come when the fishermen of the Saorstát will have a sufficient fleet so that it will not be necessary for Scotchmen to come.  Deputy Myles will agree with me that if the fleets that come across from Scotland were in the hands of Irishmen, and manned by Irish crews, a great advantage would accrue to Donegal, and that the fishing centres would be much better off than they are at the present moment.</P>
    <P>As I said, the reason why I support this motion is, that if it is passed it will help to give more employment in the Saorstát, certainly as far as Donegal is concerned.  Instead of importing tens of thousands of fish barrels into Donegal, I believe if the cooperage were established in Donegal, as it would be if a tariff were imposed, it would give employment and the price of barrels would not be increased if the home market were protected. It would not retard the fishing industry in any way.  I gather from the Donegal curers and from all those who have an intimate knowledge of the fishing industry that several of them supported this application for a tariff on fish barrels before the Tariff Commission.  The people who gave evidence and who had an intimate knowledge of the fish curing business would not support the application for a tariff if they thought it would act detrimentally to the fishing industry in Donegal.  They supported it because they thought it would go to help the fishing industry and the allied trade of cooperage in connection with the whole fishing industry.</P>
