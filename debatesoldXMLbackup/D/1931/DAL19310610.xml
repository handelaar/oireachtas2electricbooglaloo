      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the present medical officer and his predecessor have repeatedly reported on the unsanitary condition of Rathmore (County Kerry) Boys' National School; that the site and aspect of the school have been condemned; that the school is a danger to the health of the 140 pupils and 4 teachers; and if he will now state when it is his intention to provide a suitable site and erect a school in keeping with the increasing population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (for Minister for Education) (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find no record in my Department of the receipt of a report from the medical officer with regard to the insanitary condition of the Rathmore school building, but the reports of the inspectors show that the premises are unsuitable and that a new school is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been for some time in communication with the manager on the matter, as the provision of a new school rests in the first place with the manager.  It is also the manager who has to provide a site.  In this instance the manager has intimated that a site has now been secured.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the bottle-making industry in Saorstát Eireann has now ceased; and in view of this position, will the necessary steps be taken to remove the tariff and stamping charges which now amount, with the accompanying expenses, to about 90 per cent. on the cost price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently informed a deputation that it would be two or three months before the future prospects of the bottle-making industry in the Saorstát could be ascertained, and that that period would have to elapse before the continuance of the existing tariff could be considered.</P>
      <P>Stamping charges have no connection with the question whether bottle-making is carried on in this country or not.  So long as the Order prescribing standard bottles is in force under the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, such bottles are a &ldquo;measure&rdquo; and require to be stamped in accordance with the Weights and Measures Acts.</P>

      <P>I have very little further to say on this Estimate except that I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a document which was issued to the people who are making up kelp in the West.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I apply for admission to the above scheme and all the benefits thereof, and I undertake while so admitted to dispose of the whole of my kelp through the agency of the Department and I agree in consideration of my admission to the deduction of a commission at the rate of 10/- per ton of all the kelp sold on my behalf during the first three years of my membership.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I understand that if at any time I should dispose of any kelp otherwise than through the agency of the Department I shall thereby forfeit all my rights and shall be eligible for readmission only on a fresh application with the liability attaching to a new admission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> I would ask the Minister what necessity there was for issuing this notice for signature by those who are making kelp.  There was considerable opposition to it.  Naturally the people, especially in the Arran Islands, who sold their kelp to dealers and who got better prices from them declined to sign it.  I understand that as a result of much pressure one portion of the notice was left out, namely, that portion dealing with the demand for 10/- per ton as commission.  I do not think that it was fair to put that charge of 10/- a ton commission on people who are making kelp, and I would like if the Minister would tell us the reason for that charge and if he withdrew the demand owing to local opposition.  The latest document issued by the Department says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I apply for admission to the above scheme and all the benefits thereof, and I undertake while so admitted to dispose of the whole of my kelp through the agency of the Department.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand that if at any time I should dispose of any kelp otherwise than through the agency of the Department I shall thereby forfeit all my rights and shall be eligible for readmission only on a fresh application with the liability attaching to a new admission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A certain amount of trouble was caused over this document.  I hope that as the Minister has withdrawn Document No. 1 he will now see his way to withdraw the other.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of seaweed rights in Mayo and many poor places in Galway, where an immense amount of trouble has been caused.  Poor people who in hard times had to sell their seaweed rights and their rights to land around the shore now find themselves without rights to seaweed and consequently have to pay local landlords, if you may call them such, for permission to cut seaweed.  This is a question about which I will have a lot to say in the future&mdash;this grabbing of seaweed rights.  I know several places in the West where certain people own a large portion of the seaweed rights around <Col N="22" /> the different islands.  It is a question that should be dealt with by the Minister, but if he does not intend to do so I will speak about it in detail in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister whether he has taken any action regarding the petition sent up to him by about 100 fishermen in Galway, every fisherman in the Claddagh, in reference to the netting rights in Galway Bay.  Deputy Fahy asked a question some time ago in regard to this matter and the Minister gave a reply which indicated that he would look into it.  That is some months ago now and I hope the Minister will be in a position to give us some information when replying in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but owing to the turn it has taken and owing to a visit I paid to my constituency during the week-end I am constrained to say a few words.  It has been said in this House that there were little, if any, results from the money spent in the Gaeltacht.  I would like to give a few examples of what is being done in my county.  Twelve months ago my attention was drawn by a local priest to a particular area where the kelp gatherers were taking out seaweed.  I went down with him to the coast and I saw a man and his wife putting up seaweed on their backs, while their two little children were sitting on bags on the strand.  I went down there again this year and the same priest brought me to the same place.  I went into a house and I found the woman who a year before was putting up seaweed on her back, there, looking after household duties.  One of the little children was in a cot and the other was running about, while the father was down at the sea shore putting up seaweed with a horse and cart supplied by the Minister.  There is another area in which thousands of tons of seaweed were rotting for hundreds of years and nobody could take it from the shore owing to the absence of roads.  As a result of roads having been built by the Minister down there, I saw seaweed being <Col N="23" /> taken up by lorry from the shore.  I sent a sketch of it up to the Minister, as I thought he might get it published, but he did not.  I want to put these facts before the House because so many Deputies have said that there were no results from this expenditure. We, however, only get the &ldquo;rinsings.&rdquo; Deputies Mongan and Brodrick get most of it for Galway and we only get very little in Clare.</P>
      <P>One matter which I would like to bring before the Minister is the slow manner in which the Gaeltacht housing question is being dealt with.  We have very bad housing in the Gaeltacht down there.  I know there are many difficulties in the way of acquiring land, title, etc., but I hope that the Minister will see that in the near future the people will be provided with houses.  We are fairly well fed and clothed down there owing to the intervention of the Minister, and I hope we will be housed.  There is also the question of providing boats and gear.  I hope boats and gear will be provided so that on the next occasion this Vote is introduced I will be able to compliment the Minister on the good work he has done and be able to say to him: &ldquo;We are now well fed, well clothed and well housed.  We do not care about foreign trawlers as we have plenty of boats.&rdquo;</P>

Sin é an sompla atá á thabhairt aca-sa do na hoifigeachaí! Ach dubhairt siad &ldquo;déan mar adeirim.&rdquo;  Gan aimhreas, dubhairt Proinnsias O Fathaigh cúpla fócal i nGaedhilg.  Dubhairt sé go raibh an fheamainn ag lobhadh in sna puill san Iarthar; ach dubhairt sé nach raibh a fhios aige féin ar bh'fhíor é, gur chuala sé ó dhuine eile é ar nós na sean-mhná adubhairt fád ó: &ldquo;Dubhairt <Col N="25" /> bean liom-sa go ndubhairt bean leat-sa go ndubhairt bean liom-sa,&rdquo; agus mar sin.</P>
    <P>Sé an caitheamh is mó atá ag daoinc beaga móra orm féin thíos faoi'n tír nach labhraim ach Gaedhilg sa Teach seo.  Chuala mé go ndubhairt Teachta as an Teach seo,&mdash;Teachta a thuigeas an Ghaedhilg, Teachta atá ag leigint air go bhfuil sé i bhfabhar na Gaedhilge&mdash;gur beag an meas a bhí orm sa Teach seo mar gheall ar go labhraim Gaedhilg agus gurb é an fáth a labhraim í mar nach bhfuil mé in ann an Béarla do labhairt.  Má cheapann an Teachta seo gur céim síos orm-sa é sin, tá sé ag dul amú go mór.  An teanga atá sáthach maith do Ghaedheala Chonnamara ba cheart go mbeadh sí sáthach maith do spreasáin ar bith atá ag saothrú a bheatha ar Ghaedhilgeoirí bochta Chonnamara.  Tá bród orm nár labhair mé aon fhocal Béarla sa Teach seo ariamh agus má mhairim go mbeidh mé aois shean-athar a tháinig rómham ariamh ní labhrochaidh mé ach an Ghaedhilg.</P>
    <P>Anois focal faoi'n Chumann Iascaigh atá curtha ar bun.  Níl aimhreas nach bhfuil obair chruaidh rómpa.  Bíonn 'chuile thosnú lag ach is maith an rud go bhfuil tosnú déanta.  Tá suil agam go gcuimhneochaidh siad ar iascach na mbáid bheaga agus nach dtiúbharfaidh siad a n-am uilig do na báid mhóra.  Im' bharúil-se, do b'fhearr an iasacht airgid a bheas lucht na mbáid bheaga iarraidh le haghaidh a gcuid bád a cheannach agus eile do thabhairt dóibh ar an sean-bhealach, mar b'fhéidir cuid aca se nach ndíolfadh mórán dá gcuid éisg go dteastochadh na rudaí seo uatha le haghaidh a mbeatha fháil dóibh féin agus dá muirín.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil siad ag dul ag déanamh toibreacha le haghaidh na gliomaigh a choinneál ionnta.  Mar sin, féadfaidh siad na gliomaigh do choinneál tríd an mbliain ionnta.  Ba cheart dóibh báid ghliomaigh strainséartha atá ag teacht ar an gcósta do choinneál ar shiúl mar tá a fhios againn uilig nach ar mhaithe linn atá siad ag teacht.</P>
    <P>Tá bród orm go bhfuil níos mó tairbhe ag na daoine as déanamh na <Col N="26" /> ceilpe ná cheap éinne a mhaireas faoi láthair.  Nuair do thosuigh an tAire ag déanamh na mballaí le feamainn an Gheimhridh do chur ionnta dá sábháil, bhí an chuid is mo den tír á cheapadh go raibh sé ar mir.  Cheap siad nár bh'fhéidir í do shabháil ná í do dhóghadh mar sin choíche.  Ach &ldquo;ba ghoire cabhair Dé ná an doras,&rdquo; mar tá sé cinnte anois gur fiú ar a laighead £10 an tonna í.  Rud eile ní bheidh aon chall faitíos níos mó do bheith ar na ceilpeadóirí nach dtóigfear an méid is féidir a dhéanamh de'n cheilp sin.  Is maith liom go ndubhairt an tAire go bhfuil faoi iasachtaí do thabhairt do na daoine seo le cairteanna agus eile do cheannach.  Nuair do thosuigh an tAire ag ceannach na carraigíne anuiridh dubhairt sé nach gceannochadh sé ó dhuine ar bith taobh amuigh de Chonnamara í, agus níor cheannuigh, go bhfeicfeadh sé cé mar eireochadh leis.  Thosuigh sé á ceannach ar 1s. 6d. agus tar éis tamaill fuair sé amach go mb'fhiú 2s. í.  Na daoine a raibh sí ceannuithe uatha aige ar 1s. 6d. do chuir sé fios ortha agus thug sé an 6d. eile dóibh.  Theasbáin sé sin do na daoine go raibh meas ar a saothrú mar. roime seo, ní raibh sí ag dul ach 9d.  I mbliana do scaip an tAire e féin amach le ceannach na carraigíne agus tá sé á ceannach thart ar fud cóstaí na hEireann anois agus ag tabhairt 2s. go 2s. 6d. uirthe.  Tá a fhios agam aon áit amháin a raibh 35 bhean íocaithe réir na seachtaine á piocadh, á nighe agus á cur i mboscaí.  Cuireann sin i gcuimhne dhom go ndubhairt an Teachta O Deirg go raibh bród air chó deas an bhí an charraigín seo déanta suas i mboscaí, ach dubhairt sé san am chéanna gur cheap sé go mba cheart í bheith déanta suas i mbealach eicínt níos réidhthe ná sin le haghaidh na ndaoine bochta.  Níor dhubhairt sé cén bealach a d'fhéadfaí é dhéanamh no an bhfuil a fhios aige é?  Tá sé chó réidh biadh do dhéanamh as charraigín agus atá sé biadh do dhéanamh as go leor de na rudaí a thagann isteach annseo o thíortha eile, ach 'nós 'chuile rud atá á dhéanamh annseo cois baile againn féin níl aon mheas uirthe.  Níl tada chó saor léi agus go cinnte níl tada chó folláin léi.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Is maith an rud go bhfuil rud eicínt á dhéanamh le haghaidh na n-oistirí a thabhairt ar ais mar bhí tamall agus níorbh fhéidir oistirí níos fearr d'fháil in áit ar bith ná sa tír seo.  Tá muinghin agam gur gearr go mbeidh an rud céanna le rá arís.</P>
    <P>Focal anois faoi iascach na lochannaí. Dubhradh go mba cheart don Rialtas an t-iascach do thóigeál fútha féin.  Ceist mhór í sin.  Dubhairt cuid de na Teachtaí nár cheart cáin ar bith a bhaint de dhuine bheadh ag iascach bric gheala no bradáin&mdash;cead do bheith ag duine iascach do dhéanamh gan aon cháin d'íoc.  Cá bhfuigheadh an tAire airgead annsin le maortha agus a leithéidí d'íoc ar son saigheadh a stopadh ar na haibhneacha?  An mbeadh ar an Aire Airgid leithphighinn do chur ar an siúcra leis an gcostas seo d'íoc, agus cead ag strainséaraí iascach do dhéanamh gan aon cháin d'íoc?  Dubhairt Teachta eile nár cheart don Aire bheith ag tabhairt airgid do bhuird iascaigh.  Tá faitíos orm nach bhfuil a fhios aige cé faoi a bhfuil sé ag caint.  Tá áit amháin, Rinn Mhaoile, go dteastuigheann congnamh airgid on bhord go géar.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na dtithe, tá áthas orm go bhfuil an obair seo ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.  Tá na tithe á gcur suas go tréan.  Ní hé ceadúnas an Aire ná a chuid airgid atá ag cliseadh ortha anois ach easbadh saor.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an tAire ag dul a dhéanamh tithe do na múinteoirí sgoile.  D'iarrfainn ar an Aire tús a thabhairt do na múinteoirí a chruthuigh rud eicínt don tír.  I gceanntar Chonnamara tá na céadtha sgoláirí agus anuiridh as an méid sin ní bhfuair ach beirt sgoláireachtaí agus an bheirt sin as an aon sgoil amháin.  Fuair an sgoil chéanna seo sgoláireachtaí le dhá bhliain ach ná creidfeadh aoinne ar bith nach bhfuil aon inntleacht eile i gConnamara ach iad-san.  Teastuigheann treoir uatha agus cruthú go bhfuil meas ar a n-obair.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta O Tuibride ag caitheamh ar dhaoine as Connamara, daoine a rugadh agus a tóigeadh i <Col N="28" /> gConnamara, daoine go raibh a seacht sinnsír rómpa i gConnamara&mdash;ní fearacht cisean&mdash;a thug go mion 's go minic iasachtaí don bhocht le eisean agus a leithéide d'íoc nuair a theastóchadh sé uatha. Eisean an fear nár thug spás uaidh; chaithfeadh sé airgead síos d'fháil i gcomhnaí.  Cuireann an Teachta seo i gcuimhne dhom píobaire an aon phuirt, mar an rud adubhairt sé i mbliana, dubhairt sé anuiridh agus arú anuiridh é.  Sé an rud céanna atá le rá aige ag clamhsán agus ag gearradh anuas.  Dubhairt an Teachta seo rud eicínt faoi sgáilí.  Tá sgil mór ag na Teachtaí thall i sgáilí.  Sa taobh seo den Teach níl aon sgáile ann ach bean agus fir, 'chuile dhuine aca ag iarraidh bheith ag déanamh a gcion féin faoi'n Gheinerálaí nár chlis ariamh nuair a bhí sé ag teastáil.  Ach ma thagann an lá go bráth go mbeidh siad ag stiúradh na tíre sin é an t-am go mbeidh &ldquo;ó bhó bhó!&rdquo; faoi na sgáilí. Deirteir &ldquo;dhá leanfai an seanachas go dtí an seachtú líne gur beag a bheadh saor dá mbíonn ag caint.&rdquo;  Bhain Art O Gríobhtha agus Mícheál O Coileáin saoirse na tíre seo amach agus bhí Rialtas Sealadach againn agus annsin thainig Rialtas Shaorstát Eireann ach má thagann siad-san i réim go deo ní bheidh againn ach Rialtas Sgáilí na hEireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion that this Vote be referred back. I do that because I am anxious to find out from the Minister if, as we were promised when the Gaeltacht Housing Act was being introduced, he would make provision to give similar advantages to the small holders outside the scheduled areas as are provided for under the Gaeltacht Housing Act. When that Act was being passed we were told that if a good case could be put up for those localities which had been excluded from the schedule of the Act the Minister would consider them.  At the time I gave the Minister a list of places from West Mayo&mdash;a number of townlands which I considered should have been originally included in the scheduled areas for the reason that about 80 per cent. of the inhabitants are Irish speakers, <Col N="29" /> and they are in the very heart of the Gaeltacht locality.  The names of these places are: Aughagower South, Aughamore, Bundorragha, Emlagh, Erriff, Glanhest, Kilmeena, Aillemore, Kilsallagh, Owenadornaun and Srahmore. Most of these townlands, if not all of them, have 80 per cent. Irish speakers. The young men and the young women very largely in those localities are able to speak Irish as well as the old people and school children, and it is for that reason I feel I am fully justified in the proportion of Irish speakers I have given.  So far nothing has been done for those areas which were not lucky enough to be included in the list of scheduled areas.  I press the Minister to place them in such a position in the future, that they may obtain the advantages that other areas are deriving from the Gaeltacht Housing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a former occasion I mentioned here that West Mayo is a particularly notable district for the production of woollens and friezes.  At the time I pressed him to say if he would do something for the people engaged in the industry in that particular locality. That is a very good district for wool and there are a lot of people there skilled in the manufacture of woollen articles.  I think it is a pity that the Minister would not give them as much attention as he is giving to the people in Donegal.  As I remarked on a former occasion the woollen workers there are noted for the very beautiful material they turn out.  In the summer season, when a large number of tourists are moving around there, they sell a lot of their products to them.  I think if the Minister endeavoured to develop the industry in that locality he could do very much for it.  Every little helps, and we would expect that with the Minister's assistance naturally there would be a greater production and a better outlet would be found for woollen products produced there.  In that way we might look forward to having a thriving industry in Achill, Ballycroy, Newport, and around Westport generally.  There is a great production of wool in the Westport district.  I think the Minister should have this matter inquired into as a scheme capable of benefiting <Col N="30" /> all concerned in those areas may be evolved.  Clew Bay is famous for its fisheries, but so far as I am aware very little has been done for the sea fisheries of the locality.  Last March, when I approached the Department of Fisheries on behalf of the fishermen down there about loans and other matters, I was promised that forms would be soon available for fishermen who required assistance in the purchase of nets, boats and other equipment.  I am anxious to know if the Minister could tell us whether those forms are yet available, and, if so, how soon will they be sent out to those who are making applications for assistance.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious to find out if the Minister is considering the deep sea fishing in conjunction with the establishment of a market for fish for the local or inshore fishermen.  We in the West believe that this market could be stabilised if a continuous supply of fish could be guaranteed from the deep sea fisheries.  Naturally the inshore fishermen cannot maintain a continuous supply, and therefore they could not hope to develop the local markets and stabilise them.  To do this it would be necessary to have something approaching a continuous supply of fish.  The deep sea fisheries would greatly facilitate in producing such a continuous supply.  If the Minister can see his way to do anything in that respect along the West coast I believe that the fishing industry would be greatly helped and developed.  I am aware that there are quite a number of inshore fishermen along the coast who do a little fishing, but owing to the bad weather, and also because of the failure of the fish occasionally to turn up round the coast, there is nothing approaching a continuous supply of fish.  For that reason the markets are not at all what they could be, or what they should be.</P>
    <P>Then for want of a continuous market those who are engaged in the inshore fishing have to send their fish to Billingsgate or Grimsby, or occasionally to Dublin.  I am sure they would much prefer to sell their fish in a local market if we had the local markets developed.  They would have a better chance, too, of getting a better price for their fish, because the transport is <Col N="31" /> often two-thirds of the total amount got for the fish.  If the catch is small most of it goes in transport.  Some of these fishermen live eight or nine miles from a railway station, and between the cost of bringing it to the station and the cost of transit by rail the costs are abnormally high.  These expenses would be saved if local markets were developed, and the fishermen would be much better off.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will be able to tell us that in this respect he will be able to do something for those engaged in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if any arrangement has been made or any activities indulged in by the Minister's Department in connection with the development of the fishing on the Shannon.  That has been more or less destroyed by the electricity development.  I have been endeavouring to get another Minister to tell me something about it but I have failed.  It does not need any legislation to bring about the development of fishing on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>There is another important matter that the Minister promised me he would have an inquiry held into; that is the long line fishing on Lough Derg. When I raised the matter on his Estimate twelve months ago, the Minister promised me that he would have an inquiry held.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the mouthpiece of the demand and I made the demand repeatedly to the Minister's Department. I raised the matter here on the Estimate.  That surely was a demand. I sent a memorial to the Minister's Department.  That surely was a demand. The Minister promised me he would have an inquiry held.  A previous inquiry was held by an interested person, a person who was a member of the Association which were demanding the inquiry and who were trying <Col N="32" /> to do injury to those engaged in long line fishing.  I passed a booklet to the Minister.  I do not want to make any capital out of it but the Minister definitely promised an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it here in black and white in the official report.  I promised an inquiry if there was a demand for it from the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the local people make a public representative their mouthpiece for asking an inquiry surely the Minister ought to know that an inquiry is desired.  I have asked for the inquiry.  I raised it even a fortnight ago with the Minister's Department and nothing has been done. There ought to be some semblance of consistency in this matter.  If a Deputy acts as the mouthpiece of a section of his constituents surely the Minister ought to take cognisance of his representations.  Nothing has been done.  The Minister has not endeavoured to find out whether there was a demand or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the contrary statement and I will leave it at that. A memorial has been sent to the Minister's Department signed by the people interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been signed and sent to the Department.  I will leave it at that.  I did not hear the Minister's opening statement.  I heard a good deal about trawl fishing and large boat fishing but I did not hear very much about the small boat men.  I know that in certain districts in my county there are small creeks and coves where ten or twenty years ago there were many small boats.  We find that that type of fishing has been more or less abandoned by the Department.  The Minister gives it no consideration whatever. We have been told a lot about the activities of the Muirchu but I think we might as well have scrapped the boat altogether.  We are spending £8,000 on its upkeep.  I do not know whether we are able to catch any fish that are left after the French trawlers but if this £8,000 was spent in purchasing apparatus for these small fishermen to enable them to catch the fish that are left I think it would be more wisely spent.  The Muirchu is not able to protect anything.  It is not able to protect Lambay Island.</P>
      <P>We heard a good deal of laudation of the Minister regarding the kelp industry. A kelp committee was formed and every man on that committee did excellent work.  Anything that happened in connection with the improvement of the kelp industry is unhesitatingly due to them.  I do not know whether that committee has been called together for the past twelve months or not.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered it more desirable to take advice from his political supporters than from the members of the Kelp Advisory Committee. I do not know whether he has changed his mind regarding the desirability of having a Kelp Advisory Committee, whether he intends to scrap the committee and take advice from his political friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that there is a suggestion that kelp is to be burned on the flat. I want to ask the Minister if he has got the sanction of the Kelp Advisory Committee for that.  Has he put it before <Col N="34" /> the committee and can he say if the kelpers in the various districts are satisfied that it is the most desirable form of burning seaweed for kelp?  If he has not, then he has no right to keep that committee in existence so as to give the idea that the committee advised the burning of kelp on the flat while his Department are doing it on their own.  I happen to be one of the members of this Kelp Advisory Committee, and it has not been summoned for twelve months.  I understand that certain instructions have gone forth from the Department and that the kelpers think these instructions have the sanction of the committee, when they have not.  Either the committee should be consulted or it should not be there as a bogey to give a semblance of authority to some of the activities of this Department, which have not had the sanction of the committee. I have on several occasions referred to the necessity of providing facilities for landing small boats, such as curraghs, in various places, but nothing has been done in that direction.  I have indicated several places in my constituency where something might be done at a small cost, but the Department has done nothing.</P>
    <P>So far as the Gaeltacht Housing Scheme is concerned, I have the same thing to say.  Not one stone has been raised in Clare in connection with the Gaeltacht Housing Scheme.  There is a little bit of Fior-Gaelthacht, and there is a good deal of Breac-Gaelthacht in Clare.  Surely if we are to laud the Minister we ought to find out in what connection he is to be lauded, to discover what he is doing for those who are most in need of help.  He has done little or nothing for the small fishermen off the coast&mdash;nothing I should say up to the present.  Whatever has been done in connection with the kelp industry has been done on the advice and with the co-operation of the Kelp Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht, where the people are badly housed and are unable to carry on their domestic activities because of the want of proper accommodation he has done nothing.  I am speaking of my own county.  I do not <Col N="35" /> think I can laud the Minister in the way in which he has been lauded from some other quarters.  I do not know whether he is in a position to deal with the development of the Shannon fisheries or whether that belongs to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has destroyed the fisheries there; whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to restore them. Fishery development, however, is in the hands of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries and he ought to know something about the Shannon fisheries, which his colleague in the Executive Council has destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points I should like to refer to in regard to the matter under discussion.  For the last four years at various times I and others, representing Donegal, have made representations to the Minister to have certain slips around the seaboard of Donegal repaired.  On one occasion at least I got the Minister to visit a slip at Meenagh Cross in South Donegal.  It would not have taken a big expenditure of time or money to have that slip repaired, but nothing has been done, or will be done, if we are to go by what the Minister and his Department stated after he made the visit.  I made representations also about the slip at St. John's Point and slips at many other places but nothing has been done in any cases in which I made representations, whether because it was I who made the representations, or for some other reason, I do not know.  It is no indication of the wealth that accrues to the fishermen of Ireland to read the statistics compiled by representatives of the Minister's Department in regard to the amount of fish landed on our coast.  I venture to say not 10 per cent. of the total value of the fish landed goes directly or indirectly into the pockets of the Irish fishermen or those who work around the fishing ports, the reason being that foreign trawlers and drifters work around Irish waters, bring their catches into Irish ports, and the only money accruing to the local people is the money earned in carting fish, helping to cure fish, and in supplying <Col N="36" /> groceries and so on to crews of the vessels.  Therefore, if we are to give the part-time fishermen a chance in Ireland to get something out of the wealth that should come to them from the sea we should provide adequate slips at which to launch and get in their little boats in a proper way and not to have these men, in the depth of winter, walking sometimes up to their necks in water in order to try and make their boats safe and preserve them from the storms.  In the places I have mentioned it would not have taken very much money to do that, but the Minister was found wanting.</P>
      <P>Much money has been spent in the administration of the Department, but very little can be found for any sort of productive work.  Some years ago, the Minister promised to have a school of fishery and navigation established at the Downings.  We are still waiting for the establishment of that school. It was held by myself and others to be a necessity.  It was held by those who compiled the Gaeltacht Report that such schools were necessary if we were to have deep-sea fishermen who could compete in their own waters with the fishermen of any other nation.  Up to the present nothing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of the woollen industry I have listened to remarks passed by people in the hall of this House when the Minister had put up there the different patterns of woollens.  It struck me that many people were under the impression that no woollens were manufactured in Donegal until the Minister established this little department to deal with that matter.  That is a fallacy.  Woollens were manufactured there before the Minister and I were born.  If the Minister had lent a helping hand to the people who were doing this in Donegal, at the time when a helping hand was most needed, there would not have been any necessity for us to make a song and dance, if I might put it that way, about those patterns which are being shown in the hall.  Although it may do good, at the same time it seems to me like utilising public money for the purpose of advertising the Minister and his Department, because, when other people were producing exactly the <Col N="37" /> same class of material without getting any subsidy or help from the Minister, the Minister was leading people to believe that he, and he alone, was responsible for the production of these woollen goods from Donegal.  That was a fallacy.</P>
    <P>It has been mooted that the Minister intends to do something in regard to the embroidery industry.  That was an industry that employed a large number of girls in their own homes. It was a fairly-well paid industry and one that deserved to be helped.  All it wants, to my mind, is a little money spent in proper advertising, and I do think that any helping hand rendered by any Minister responsible to this House should be given in that way and not for the purpose of self-advertisement.</P>
    <P>There is a very important question in regard to fisheries, and that is the question of the several fisheries in the Free State.  It is a question of paramount importance not fully realised perhaps by many people in the country but very vital to the fishermen and the dependents.  Not alone does that apply in Donegal, but it applies all round the coast and to practically every estuary and inland river.  You have people operating under a charter, but whether that charter is valid or not we do not know; whether it is a vested interest that should be protected or not we do not know.  The Minister has said in effect that such and such a company operating under a charter have a vested interest, and if anybody quarrels with that he should bring the matter to a court of law.  On a couple of occasions the question has been brought to a court of law by fishermen who were prohibited from earning their daily bread. These are men who have very little money to engage in protracted legal arguments, where much money had to be spent in engaging counsel and all the rest of it.  The matter was brought into court and on one occasion the verdict was given in favour of the fishermen, and on another against them.</P>
    <P>This question of the several fisheries came up here last year.  It almost created a lot of trouble that should <Col N="38" /> not have been created.  We do not want trouble at all in this country. This particular matter of the Foyle several fisheries almost created trouble, and lest it should occur again it should have been dealt with in the interim by the Minister.  Then you have the Erne several fisheries and the Moy several fisheries, and all round the coast you have the same thing applying.  If a person or persons claim to hold a charter, or a vested interest in certain waters for inland or seaboard fisheries, that person or persons should be made to come before some court or form of arbitration for the purpose of determining whether the charter is valid or not.</P>
    <P>If it is held that it is valid and that they are entitled to the several fisheries, that it is an effective vested interest, then it may be that the Minister or the arbitrator should say &ldquo;since it is a vested interest let us acquire it for the State and compensate those people.&rdquo;  On the other hand, if they could not prove their title to the several fisheries or that the charter was valid, then it should be confiscated to the State.  The Minister or the arbitrators might suggest something else, but the reason I put this forward is that as long as you have that question of the several fisheries and chartered rights, or so-called rights, so long will you have trouble, and so long will you have numbers of fishermen, sometimes 300 or 400, as in the case of the Foyle, and 400 or 500 in the case of the Erne, claiming that they are entitled to earn their living by fishing.  You will have trouble. God knows these men earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, and they will claim that they are entitled to fish in these waters.  They are prepared to pay a certain sum to the State for the purpose of earning their living, and they hold that they should not be kept out of the waters which God put round this country, for the benefit of a few people who may hold that they have the right to these waters because it was granted to them by King Charles II or somebody else.</P>

      <P>I rise to remind the Minister of the contribution I made <Col N="39" /> to the debate on this Estimate last year.  I want him to state specifically whether or not he will put into effect the promises he made.  Speaking on this Vote on the 10th July, 1929, I made reference to a resolution passed by the Galway Urban District Council, and sent to the Minister's Department on the 21st November, 1928, and I addressed to him the following question:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he received a copy of a resolution passed by the Galway Urban District Council, requesting the establishment of a fishing school in Galway urban area for the Claddagh fishermen, and if so, what action it is intended to take in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have received a copy of the resolution referred to.  Proposals for the establishment of a smaller number of preparatory schools along the lines of paragraph 229 of the Report of the Commission on Technical Education, for providing suitable education and training for boys likely to be engaged in the fishing industry, and for the appointment, as suggested in paragraph 231 of the same report, of itinerant instructors to conduct short courses of instructions for part-time fishermen, are at present being examined by my Department and the Department of Education.  In this connection the claims of the district referred to in the question have not been overlooked.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, briefly, I want to ask the Minister if that resolution was lost or if the matter is shelved or if the people of the Claddagh in Galway are to have any hope at all that this preparatory school will ever be started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch) Fionán Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply amazed at the Deputy.  He must not have been here last week when the Education Estimate was being discussed because, in fact, if he was he would see there provision was made for this school <Col N="40" /> which he refers to and that it is actually in being.  I think the House as a whole can be congratulated on the trend of the debate this year.  I think there was a greater tendency to examine what has been done by the Department and to make suggestions for the improvements of methods and so on rather than going round looking for some little fault on which to fasten criticism.  That I think is an encouraging sign.  Before I start dealing with the different points raised by Deputies I would like to say how much gratified I was by the tribute paid to the staff of the Gaeltacht Housing Department, especially as this is the first instance in which the work of an important branch of the Department is being carried out by a wholly Irish-speaking staff and carried out entirely in Irish by that staff.</P>
      <P>The fact that Deputies who are in touch with the people have expressed their appreciation of the work of the staff is a sign that there is no loss of efficiency through their doing their work in Irish.  On the contrary, there is a gain in efficiency.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the points I will take them under their heads.  Deputy Derrig covered nearly all the sub-heads of the Vote.  I will take, first of all, the Sea Fisheries Association.  He asked questions about the expenditure of that £10,000 on the administration.  I got from the Association the items under which that is to be spent.  Headquarters have a manager, a secretary, an accountant, a clerical staff and typists.  The salaries amount to £4,475. Outdoor staff, four division officers, £2,000.  Local agents, £1,000.  Travellers' expenses, £1,000.  Rent, stationery and furniture, £1,000.  Telephones, postage and incidentals, £575; totalling up to £10,000.  I do not think, in view of the work that is being undertaken, that it is unreasonable.  At any rate, in the earlier years of an undertaking of that kind one would expect a greater proportion of overhead expenses than you have later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of membership of the Association Deputy Derrig was wondering whether it would not be advisable to get in members of the business <Col N="41" /> community.  There is nothing under the rules to prevent the admission of ordinary business people into the Association.  Of course the Association itself would be in close relation to the business interests in the industry itself, while they will have local agents who will presumably manage the Association for the local business people.  There is nothing to prevent people entirely outside the industry from becoming members of the Association, but I think it might not be extremely desirable to have too much of that kind of thing.  It would not be desirable to have the Association flooded with persons who have no real interest in the fishing industry, and who would, at a general meeting, completely outvote the members whose livelihood was dependent on the conduct of the Association.  It would not be advisable, for instance, if politicians &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or butchers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to come nearer home, went into the Association for the purpose of getting some particular kudos out of being members of the local branch of the Association.  I think the more it is confined to the fishermen the better for the Association.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig also referred to the question of the provision of boats and engines, and mentioned a crude oil engine as possibly being superior to other types of engine.  I understand the Association are perfectly alive to the value of the crude oil engine, but the position is the most serviceable boat for our inshore fisheries is a thirtythree foot boat, and as far as we could see there is not any crude oil engine suitable for installation in so small a boat, but you may take it that the Association is seeking information from all the manufacturers of engines in Europe.  With regard to the revaluation of boats, I should say that 85 per cent. is approximately the amount outstanding attributable to old-time loans&mdash;that is, old C.D.B. and D.A.T.I. loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Law asked a question as to under what conditions men would be employed by the Association.  Fishermen <Col N="42" /> will not be employed by the Association at all.  The Association will make loans for the supply of boats and they will deduct from the borrowers' earnings in order to repay the loans. The borrower will make such arrangements with regard to crew and management as will suit himself.  Deputy Derrig did not quite understand me about the £4,500 which I said was to be repaid this year to the Sea Fisheries Association.  I was merely pointing out the drop in the Appropriations-in-Aid. Last year the Appropriations-in-Aid allowed for a return of £6,500, and this year of only £2,000. That £4,500 will now be going into the Association.  In fact the total amount outstanding after the boats have been written down will go to the Association. It will be, roughly, about £22,000, and a condition of writing down in any case, that is where a man will have something left to pay, will be that he will become a member of the Association and pay in the way specified by the Association, that is, out of the earnings of the particular boat or gear that he has.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies wanted to know when the loans would be available.  I understand forms are now ready and the loans are now actually available. Deputies were concerned that the Bill should become law before we adjourn. I am pressing forward with the Parliamentary Draftsman the preparation of the Bill, and I hope to introduce it next week so as to press it through the Dáil before we adjourn.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural industries, I do not know whether I understood Deputy Derrig rightly, but if I did I think we are rather diametrically opposed with regard to policy.  My policy is to develop rural industries as cottage industries.  I think Deputy Derrig's view is that they should be of the nature of small factories with up-to-date machinery, and so on.  The dwellings in those districts are so widely separated that I think any other policy than ours would affect only a very limited number.  The industries taken up by us are those which lend themselves to manual operation.  The machines that are specified in S. 1, item 3 of the Estimate <Col N="43" /> are hand-operated machines which could be put into the cottages. If there is a tradition at all in the Gaeltacht it is a tradition of that type of work, and we are utilising that tradition in trying to revive those industries. At the same time I say we would be hampering ourselves if we should confine ourselves entirely in the Gaeltacht to industries which have a tradition.  There is no reason why experiments should not be made in starting industries other than those in which there is a tradition.</P>
    <P>In connection with the doing of the work in the cottages for which there is to be an extension of the Gaeltacht Housing Act, I presume from what I see of the problem now that it will be necessary to look for such an extension, and that we will have to come to the Dáil for a further sum of money. I have in my mind, as well as a dwelling house, a piggery and poultry house, that provision will be made for the setting up of a little workroom in which, for instance, a loom could be put and some of these knitting machines that are supplied for knitting wear.  That would enable workers in the Gaeltacht to keep the products away from the smoke and dust of the ordinary house.  Under our particular method of tackling the question of the rural industries workers can be employed who might be living at a radius of five or ten miles from the distribution of the raw material and the collection of the products.</P>
    <P>With regard to the embroidery industry, Deputy Derrig said he was not satisfied that we could hope for any success in this matter.  As a matter of fact there was a very considerable embroidery industry at one time in South Donegal, but, for various reasons, which I mentioned in my opening statement, such as the introduction of cheap machine-made lace, it has fallen into decay.  There are, I understand, hundreds of competent workers unemployed in the industry as a result of such decline, and that is our chief justification in trying to revive it.  I concede that it is entirely what might be called a luxury trade.  As I mentioned in my opening <Col N="44" /> statement, if they cannot turn out something which is far superior to anything in the way of machine made goods they might as well not go into the business at all.  Our aim is that the embroidery turned out in the Gaeltacht shall be unique, and of such excellence that it will be able to command a very high price, both for design and actual execution of the work.  If we fail in getting such results we will fail altogether.  There is no room for an embroidery industry which has to compete with cheap machine made material.  We felt that poplin ought to be an industry to suit the Gaeltacht because it is a hand loom industry, and there has been a tradition of hand loom work there.  I cannot prophesy what its success will be.  We have thirteen boys engaged at Annagry, and the reports we get indicate that they are making very good progress.  As to whether or not we will be justified in continuing at Annagry is something I could not foretell.  I think it was at least worth while making the experiment, especially as there was a factory there going abegging.  It was a disused carpet factory, and the building was there for the taking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig wanted to know what work was being done at the central depôt.  At the central depôt they look for orders for the goods and these orders are distributed amongst the centres where particular articles are made.  We try to concentrate at these classes, as they are called, on the production of one or two garments.  We let one place concentrate on the production of golf hose, knitted stockings, another place on cardigans or pullovers, while another place would go in for knitted costumes.  When orders come to the depôt they are passed on to the particular centre where the articles required are being turned out. The depôt has a traveller on the road already in this country.  We do not expect to see any great results during the summer months, but during the winter we hope that there will be a considerable sale for the products of these classes in this country.  It is expected that probably next year there will be agents and travellers in other countries.  At the depôt when the <Col N="45" /> goods&mdash;tweeds, knitted wear&mdash;arrive from the different centres, they are examined by experts and if they are not up to the standard they are rejected.  Rejected articles are sold at a cheap rate, but the other articles are branded with the Round Tower brand.  Apart from goods which are imperfect and which have to be sold at what might be called a loss, the price at which goods are sold by the depôt generally represents a profit, after taking into account overhead expenses. That will not be the case altogether at certain centres until they are working at something like full capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them at the moment.  If the Deputy puts down a question I will try to get them.  Deputy Clery, I think, raised a question about the additional staff.  There is provision for £1,000 in the Estimate for two inspectors of rural industries, as against £400 for one inspector in last year's Vote.  The proposal is to obtain two officers of first-class training and experience, one to deal with the hand-weaving industry and the other with the hand-knitting and machine industries. These are regarded as being of considerable potential value, as the original arrangement of one officer dealing with the two things did not prove satisfactory.  Deputy Clery asked what the £40,000 for the provision of raw material would be spent on.  It will be spent on yarn for the weaving of tweeds and on yarns for the knitting of socks, cardigans and knitted wear, as well as on linen and thread for embroidery and other supplies. These supplies are bought by tender and are examined as to quality by inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the kelp business, I think Deputy Hogan need not have any fear that any member amongst the kelp gatherers will be in the least deceived. The Deputy stated that we have issued certain instructions concerning the burning of kelp and he is afraid that these may be attributed to <Col N="46" /> the Advisory Committee.  I want to pay them this tribute.  The committee met twice and did extremely good work.  They served their purpose.  I have not called them together since because I did not think there was any necessity to do so.  I have not any intention of calling them together again because I believe they served their purpose at the time.  I did not know that there was any need for a formal disbanding but if I find there is I can do that.  Deputy Derrig suggested that as many of the kelp makers had associations in the past with certain buyers, they would be glad to continue their associations with these buyers.  I do not think the Deputy was quite clear about the position.  I am perfectly satisfied that he is not from the information at my disposal.</P>
    <P>I think I could nearly guess what his view would be on the matter.  One of the principal reasons for the extremely depressed state of the industry, as it was when we found it, was the fact that there existed, and still exists, a combine of big iodine manufacturers. These persons were able to exercise complete control over the industry, both here and across channel and, indeed, in other countries as well.  They actually divided up the coast amongst themselves, arranged where each person was to buy, and fixed the actual price to be paid for kelp in the country as a whole.  The Deputy may have in his mind some person living in the country but if there was such person he was acting only as an agent of the combine.  The members of the combine are for the most part resident in England. The kelp makers have had pretty hard experience in dealing with this combine in most cases.  I am glad to say that the attempt made by the combine last year to break up the organisation of the kelp makers met with very little success and I hope that this year it will meet with even less.  The members of the combine got an opportunity to come to the Department.  All buyers of kelp were invited to the Department to discuss arrangements for buying last year.  The French buyers, who are not members of the combine, came to the Department and we came to mutually satisfactory arrangements.  The British <Col N="47" /> combine, however, refused to have anything to do with us and tried to buy against us.  We intend this year, as far as we can do so, to see that they will buy our kelp from us and, if they do not, that they will not get any kelp at all.  I do not think that there need be any sympathy with them because their attitude towards the kelp gatherers in the past was rather harsh.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Tubridy made some accusations with regard to certain agents in the Connemara area.  I asked him for details or to supply me with the name of the person affected.  He did not do so and said that he would ask for the permission of the person, but I have not yet got particulars of the case.  I am sorry that the Deputy is not here at the moment because I would suggest to him that, if the person concerned is afraid to give his name, he surely should not desire to have the matter ventilated at all in the House.  When such matters are reported to the Deputy I think that a better way than ventilating them in the House would be to come to the Department and explain the matter, so that they could deal with it.  Otherwise the raising of such matters here would really mean that if he did not give his name the person would suffer just as much.  I do not think that there is anything in that, because there are obviously ways by which a particular person could have a remedy.  Deputy Dr. Tubridy also wanted to know why we have a person in Gorumna as agent who is not an Irish speaker.  The Deputy referred all the time to a man, but I have found out that our agent there is a lady who is an Irish speaker and a native of the place.  I made inquiries this morning as to who our agents were in Kilronan and Inisheer and I was informed that both of them are Irish speakers but the man in Kilronan cannot write Irish.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing in the Gaeltacht, Deputy Derrig wanted to know how much of the money which was sanctioned had been paid.  I gather that about £16,000 has been paid out of the £80,000 that has been <Col N="48" /> sanctioned.  That is the proportion up to now but during the summer, when houses will be built more quickly, the rate of payment of the grant will rise correspondingly.  Grants will be paid according as persons qualify to receive them.  The quicker they get on with the work of building the better will I be pleased.  Deputy Dr. Tubridy wanted to know why all these inspections were necessary.  Our system is that there is an inspection first before the work is started, in order to ascertain what particular type of house is to be built, what material has been bought, and whether the foundations have been dug.  Inspection is necessary before payment of the grant.  As the house is going up there is an inspection and a further portion of the grant is then paid.  That is necessary, even for the sake of the person who is getting the house built, as it is an assurance to him that the handy-man whom he has employed is doing the work properly when the inspector passes the work.  It is also an assurance to the Department that, when a grant is sanctioned for a house of certain dimensions, these conditions have been carried out and that the person who is building the house did not afterwards cut off some things for which he got a grant.  As I say, these inspections are necessary and, in most cases, are very helpful to a man who is having a house built.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Connell inquired as to the rate of interest charged on loans under the Gaeltacht Housing Act. The rate is five and a half per cent. He also inquired as to what is being done to assist people in the Gaeltacht to take advantage of the scheme of combined purchasing as regards materials. Quotations have been invited from the principal suppliers in the country for the whole of the materials required under the Act.  These tenders were received last week and are being examined.  We are not in a position to accept any tender.  We are not the persons who are building the houses.  All we can do is to place these on the list and advise persons who are building to get their materials from the different persons in order. <Col N="49" /> Last year, pending the completion of the combined purchasing system, provisional arrangements were made with merchants in different places which turned out very satisfactory, as the persons who were building the houses got very reasonable terms.</P>
    <P>In regard to teachers' residence in the Gaeltacht, Deputy Derrig rather confounded the position of the teacher with that of an ordinary civil servant. The teacher is in a different position. He cannot usually be shifted about from one place to another at will, whereas most civil servants can be transferred from one place to another according as the exigencies of the Departments require.  The teacher is not employed by the State but by the manager of a particular school, and when he has got his position he cannot be removed except for grave misconduct. The problem is not so much one of keeping good teachers in the Gaeltacht as of enticing good teachers to go there.  It is all very well for us to be altruistic and tell people what they should do through patriotic motives and that good teachers should remain in the Gaeltacht.  When, however, a teacher in the country with a growing family feels the economic pinch he is naturally anxious to improve his position.  If an opportunity comes to him of getting an appointment in a school in the neighbourhood of Dublin, it is very hard to expect him, if there is not some reasonable compensation given to him, to withhold an application for such a position by means of which he would have an opportunity of educating his children more cheaply than in the Gaeltacht. At any rate I think there is a case for the provision of this small sum.  In some cases it will go to teachers already in schools in the Gaeltacht. At any rate it will have the effect of enticing other teachers to go there. These residences will become the property of the State and will be rented to the teacher while he, or she, remains a teacher in the school.  The teacher will be liable for some rent and also to keep the building in repair during his or her occupancy.</P>
    <P>I have no idea what the rent will be.  That is a matter between the <Col N="50" /> Education Department and the Board of Works.  I am only concerned with getting the site, and putting up the building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy and other Deputies referred to minor marine works. Deputy Carney and, I think, Deputy Hogan of Clare also dealt with this matter.  The position with regard to minor marine works is that, as everybody knows, there are a huge number of applications constantly coming in for these works.  Some of them are genuine applications, for which a good case can be made, but in many cases, the application is an entirely flimsy one. In parts of the country persons in the past have been accustomed to getting grants for putting up slips for boats and piers on a certain local demand. Very often, in a considerable number of cases at any rate, there was not justification for the expenditure.  I have been myself on at least two piers which are entirely dry-land piers.  A boat was never pulled up on them, and they were being used as promenades by the people of the locality.  We have to be extremely careful to see that money is not expended in that way. I will admit that, in most of the cases put up nowadays, there is at least a prima facie case.  We have now a committee to examine all applications that come in, and to examine side by side with them all the existing works on the coast, so that we will have a full picture of the problem.  They will place all applications in the order in which they should be placed, in the order of urgency, and they will probably state in regard to many of them that there is no real necessity for building them at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to inland fisheries, Deputy Derrig mentioned the fall in the value of these fisheries last year. I think that can be better explained by the fall in prices in Great Britain than by the fall in the quantity caught. The price fell in Great Britain from 2/6 to 1/8.  That had the effect of stimulating the consumption of salmon to an extent at home that probably had not been reached for a considerable time before.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said by various Deputies about the general <Col N="51" /> usefulness of hatcheries, with which I entirely agree.  The Department is always ready to help local hatcheries, and even where we can, to help local anglers associations in various ways by securing for them, at cheap rates, fry which they can let into the local streams and rivers.  The principal drawback and the difficulty which presents itself to us occasionally in the establishment of local hatcheries is the difficulty of getting good local men who would look after the hatcheries.  It is not an extremely technical job.  It is to a certain extent technical, but it is very hard to get the type of person who will exercise the necessary care.  Care is more necessary than any technical knowledge, and I understand the most dangerous time is when the fry is being let into the river.  I understand that it is quite easy to kill the great majority of them at that period if the temperature of the water into which they are being released is not very near the temperature of the water from which they are being taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig was anxious to know why these State grants to conservators have not now disappeared since the Act of 1925 provides that the rates on the value of fisheries should go to the Board to help them in the policing of rivers.  The position is that many of these boards do not benefit greatly by the 1925 Act.  The fisheries have been of very little value from the rating point of view.  In several cases we had to continue the grants that existed formerly.  In many other cases&mdash;take the Limerick Board and the Cork Board&mdash;you have very extensive rights of public fishing for which there are no rates paid but which, at the same time, have to be protected.  These also have to get some help from the State in the way of a grant.  I might also mention that the 1925 Act is a temporary provision.  I hope to have it extended, of course, and made permanent, but the provision in the 1925 Act to hand over the rates on the value of fisheries to boards only lasts for nine years, and it will expire about the year 1934.  There is a case still for <Col N="52" /> continuing these grants to boards, many of whom have not got an increase to any extent in their finances, while many others have large public fisheries to protect for which they get no rates.</P>
    <P>I was asked what was the provision of £400 for a trout hatchery.  There has been a proposition before us for some time to establish a trout hatchery on the Corrib at Oughterard. I have had considerable difficulty with that.  As a matter of fact, I wanted the hatchery which we were to establish to be a special State hatchery, but the Corrib people are afraid that if Corrib fish are let into other rivers in the country the Corrib will lose three-fourths of its amenities, and that the attraction will be taken from the Corrib and bestowed on the rivers into which Corrib fish are let.  I think there is a case there for a smaller special hatchery for the Corrib than I at first contemplated.  The question of a State trout hatchery has been examined for a considerable time.  Scientists in the Department have examined various sites.  One fairly well favoured is another portion of the Corrib.  Others have been examined in the south and on the Boyne, but we have not yet decided which is the most suitable site. I think there is a case for a State hatchery, and that it will justify the expenditure on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to cases in which sea trout are caught on brown trout rods.  He mentioned that if a salmon trout was sufficiently foolish to take the bait of the brown trout, the man who caught it would have to throw it into the river dead or alive. The law is in that position at the moment and if a man is caught in possession of a sea trout he is liable to certain penalties.  I would like to meet Deputy Anthony as he is usually very reasonable in his demands but I think it would be utterly impossible to make any concession there because if you change the law so that if a person who genuinely caught a salmon trout on a brown trout fly, would get off without a penalty, well then everybody who caught a salmon trout would put forward the case that he was fishing for brown trout.  The fines for the infringements <Col N="53" /> of these Acts are very severe and practically in all these cases memorials are sent forward to the Minister for Justice for a reduction.</P>
    <P>I promised that when such an appeal would come up if I were satisfied that there was a genuine case of a man fishing for brown trout and getting a salmon trout&mdash;if that were absolutely established to my satisfaction&mdash;I would be prepared to recommend the Minister for Justice to reduce the fine substantially or to remit it altogether.  As far as changing the law is concerned that could not be done.  It would make the thing impossible for the boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>The question of several fisheries has been raised.  The question of the several fisheries, the question of the confiscation of the rights of persons who own several fisheries, and so on, has been canvassed a good deal.  Confiscation is a fairly big word and it is something which I, personally, would not be prepared to consider at all.  As to whether or not these persons have a title to their particular fisheries, I think that that is not a matter for me to question.  I think some interested person must be the person who will question these rights of several fisheries.  It is not my business to go round the country and question the title of any man as to whether or not his title is good in law, any more than it would be the job of the Minister for Agriculture to go round the country and question the title of a man to his land.  If a man thinks he has a right to fish in a certain place which another person holds as a several fishery there is a way for him to challenge that right.  That is an expensive way, but it is not my job to discover whether a man has a right to a several fishery.</P>
    <P>The question of several fishery purchase is one that would need very great consideration now because at the moment, where the fisheries have gone with the land to the riparian owner I understand that the fisheries have suffered very considerably.  I understand that the riparian owners themselves do not seem to have a proper appreciation of the value of what they have, and that each one is rather <Col N="54" /> more determined to take what he can out of the place adjacent to his particular piece of land, than that they should come together and conserve the whole fishery so as to get something out of it.  In other words, it is a case where the man down the river is scooping all he can and leaving as little as he can for the man above him.  I am afraid if you had the fisheries divided up into small pieces you would have a similar thing happening all over and it would not be good for the fishery. I must say that the Deputy who raised that matter did not suggest anything of the kind, but it would be tantamount to that.  I cannot see how the State would be able to preserve these fisheries if the State were to take them all over.  To preserve them would cost a great deal more than it costs the individual proprietors to preserve them at present.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corish who raised some question about the election of the conservators.  I think his point was that persons with sporting rights, the rod fishermen in the river, had all the weight of the board as against the working fisherman, at the mouth of the river.  As a matter of fact, all river basins are divided so as to have two electoral areas, one for net fishermen at the mouth of the river, and one for those above, the rod fishermen.  Those above are supposed to be equally provided for in these boards of conservators.  There are other persons, members of the boards of conservators, ex-officio members, the proprietors of certain fisheries, who might be said to throw in their weight with the rod fishermen.  But, as a rule, the election of the boards, as it stands at present, is not on entirely too bad a basis.  That is a question which we can thrash out more fully when a Bill dealing with that matter will come before the House in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear tributes from all parts of the House paid to the work done by the Gárda Síochána in the matter of the protection of the inland fisheries.  I myself have paid a tribute in previous years to the Gárda Síochána.  I am very glad this year that I waited until I got that tribute <Col N="55" /> from the House as a whole.  Deputies from all Parties have paid that tribute to the Gárda.  It is a well-deserved tribute.  The boards of conservators report that they have got the most invaluable assistance from the Gárda Síochána.  In very many barracks men are told off specially for this work. These are men who have specific knowledge of the subject.  I think I have dealt with all the points raised.</P>

      <P>I would not like to say that.  I would say that probably in 90 per cent of the cases it would not be to the advantage of the fisheries as a whole, and that in a short time, it would be of no real value to the farmers themselves.  Remember, I said before, when replying on this matter, that where you had A, B, C, along a river, A having the fishing rights, B not having them, C having them, and so on, you might as well give them all the fishing rights because anyhow the fishery is being ruined, in the hope that when they all have the fishery rights, they might <Col N="57" /> form some kind of an association by which they would conserve the fisheries and probably let them to their advantage. The Deputy must not take me as being entirely against the granting of fishery rights to the riparian owners.  If I found in any case that there was an inclination towards grouping of that kind, I would be rather more inclined to let them all have the fishing rights.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That there shall be charged, levied, and paid for and upon every licence (in this Resolution referred to as a moneylender's licence) to act and carry on business as a moneylender issued under any Act passed or to be passed during the financial year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1931, an excise duty at the following rates, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on a moneylender's licence expiring on the 31st day of July, 1932 &mdash;ten pounds.</P>
      <P>(b)  on a moneylender's licence expiring on the 31st day of July in any year, other than the year 1932, and taken out within six months before such expiry&mdash;ten pounds.</P>
      <P>(c)  on any other moneylender's licence&mdash;fifteen pounds.</P>
      <P>(2)  That where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that there is in force an excise licence to carry on the business of a pawnbroker at any premises in respect of which one or more moneylender's licences is or are taken out by the individual or individuals carrying on such business the Revenue Commissioners shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where only one such moneylender's licence is so taken out, remit or, if the duty has been paid, repay one-half of the duty on such licence, and</P>
      <P>(b)  where two or more such moneylender's licences are so taken out, remit or, if the duty has been paid, repay one-half of the duty on such one of such licences as is first taken out.</P>
      <P>This is simply a repetition of a resolution passed last year, and on foot of which a section was inserted in the Finance Bill with a view to imposing an excise duty on moneylenders who might be licensed under the Bill introduced by Deputy Little.  As the Moneylenders Bill did not pass last year the section of the Finance Bill would not be operative, and it is proposed to put a similar section into this year's Finance Bill in expectation that the Moneylenders Bill will have passed before the end of the present financial year.</P>

    <P>This is a Resolution imposing an excise duty on bookmakers' premises on licences that may be issued under any Bill passed in the present year. The section in the existing Finance Acts only provides that an excise duty shall be payable on premises licensed under the Act of 1926.  The 1926 Act will be repealed as soon as the Bill which is at present going through the Seanad is passed and this enables the same duty to be charged under the new Betting Bill.</P>

      <P>(1)  That in lieu of the duties of customs chargeable under Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), there shall be charged, levied, and paid on all preparations made from or containing cocoa in any form imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th day of June, 1931, a customs duty at the rate of six and three-fifths pence on the pound, in addition to any duty which may be chargeable in respect of any spirits or saccharin contained in any such preparation but in lieu of any duty which might otherwise be chargeable on any other ingredient contained in any such preparation.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though preparations made from or containing cocoa in any form were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which five-sixths of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory <Col N="62" /> effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This Resolution proposes to increase the duty on chocolate confectionery from 6d. to 6 3-5d. per lb or, taking the preferential rate, which is really the operative rate, from 5d. to 5½d. The Resolution is consequential on the increase in the sugar duty by ½d.  On a previous occasion the sugar duty was increased by ¼d., but it was not at that time thought necessary to make any change in the duty on confectionery or on chocolate and cocoa preparations.  Now, however, that the position, as compared with the position prior to April, 1928, is that the duty on sugar is up by ¾d. per lb., that has decreased the margin of preference which the chocolate manufacturers have.  This increase of ½d. does not just exactly restore the protection position as it was prior to 1928, but brings it very near it.  There are large classes of chocolate which contain, roughly, 50 per cent. of sugar and 50 per cent. of cocoa.  In these cases the margin of protection which the product had in 1925 was 4½d.  It is now 4?d.  The increase, therefore, by ½d. per lb. will leave them the one-eighth of a penny better off from the point of view of protection than they were in 1925.  Other classes of chocolate, however, contain as much as 75 per cent. of sugar and only 25 per cent. of cocoa.  In the case of these classes, the effective protection in 1925 was 4¼d. per lb.  It is now reduced to 3 11-16d.  The increase of ½d. in the duty would still leave them one-sixteenth of a penny worse off than they were in 1925.  The other classes will be about one-eighth of a penny better.  We simply introduce a figure that, as far as we could do it, restores the position of the chocolate manufacturers in the matter of protection to the position in 1925 and neutralises not merely the effects of the recent increase of ½d. in sugar, but also to a large extent the previous increase of ¼d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be entirely speculative, because it is really a question whether or not the failure to adjust this duty would increase the imports of foreign-made chocolate. Certain manufacturers here have urged that they would not be able to compete if we did not adjust the duty and that considerable quantities of foreign chocolate would come in.  If their contention is correct, we would actually lose duty by this increase.  On the other hand, we have not fully accepted their view, but I think it may be taken, having regard to the possibilities on both sides, that there will be scarcely any appreciable change in actual revenue as a result of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether the proposal meets the wishes of the manufacturers or whether any representations were made to him to change the basis of the duty from a flat rate per lb, to an ad valorem rate.  The flat rate works out of course to afford a much greater protection to the manufacturers of the cheaper classes of chocolate and a much lower rate of protection to the manufacturers of the better class, and it is largely the better class which continues to be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>These representations have frequently been made, apart from any effects of the recent increase in the sugar duty, and we have refused them because of the difficulty in administration, and because of the need for extensive sampling of the various consignments, many of which might be small.  Generally speaking, we would <Col N="64" /> not be prepared to adopt that basis because of the cost, of difficulties and delays that would be involved in the administration of it.  As regards the present increase, I think the chocolate manufacturers would like more, but I think we are giving them sufficient to put them, broadly speaking, in the position in which they were before, and I do not propose to do any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the higher grade chocolate the protection afforded by this duty is practically negligible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true it has not been very effective, but I would not say it is negligible.  It is true that in certain grades the home manufacturers have not succeeded in getting the market, but it has given a fairly considerable degree of protection, and if they want more, they must make a case before the Tariff Commission. As Minister responsible for the revenue collection I would oppose in the case of this particular article an ad valorem duty.  An ad valorem duty was in existence before when chocolates and other sweets were charged on their sugar content, and the difficulty and cost of administration was very considerable.  When we put on a flat rate on chocolate and sugar confectionery, it had the effect of producing a saving in staff and expenditure in collection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how that could really be so, because in regard to a number of the higher priced chocolates, the method of packing, and that sort of thing, represents a very considerable factor in the sale value of the chocolates.  Does the Minister disregard that altogether?  If he does he is giving the foreign competitor a very decided advantage over the home manufacturer, which arises in a number of ways.  First of all, as a general rule <Col N="65" /> the foreign manufacturer with a big concern is able to manufacture most of his packing material.  The home manufacturer has to buy his packing material, and because he is buying in small quantities, he has to pay higher prices than the foreign manufacturer. I suggest that the Minister should also consider it from this point of view.  If the ad valorem basis were adopted, then, not only would the whole of the sugar and chocolate manufacture be taken into consideration, but also the value of the packing in which the chocolate is delivered.  If that were done I think a good many of the difficulties in regard to sampling, which the Minister has experienced in administering the duty, would disappear, because so far as the higher grade chocolates are concerned, at any rate they are on more or less established lines and in qualities, the price of which are known not only here, but on the other side of the water, and which in any event could be easily ascertained.  If the Minister would consider, so far as packed chocolates, ready for delivery,&mdash; and that is the way most of them are sold now&mdash;going back to the ad valorem basis, I think he would find these difficulties would disappear.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, Section 5, lines 33, 39, 50 and 54, to delete the words `three-fourths' and substitute in each line the words `sixty per cent'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, under the Bill as it stands 75 per cent. of the divisible proceeds goes to the voluntary hospitals, and 25 per cent. to the county hospitals. The effect of the amendment would be to devote 40 per cent. to the county hospitals and 60 per cent. to the voluntary hospitals. It is calculated by some of the Deputies who opposed a similar amendment on the Committee Stage that there would be a very large amount of money available for distribution amongst the hospitals.  Deputy Sir James Craig said that there would probably be about £63,000 available for each county and that that amount would be a very large sum.  It is, of course, true that the amount would be large but it would not be too large. On the same basis, if Deputy Sir James Craig's prophecy is correct, the voluntary hospitals would have for distribution amongst them £5,000,000. They have already distributed amongst them over £1,000,000 so that they would have six millions available for distribution as compared with the £63,000 per county or one and a quarter millions in all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked how a county would use £63,000.  According to the Bill, the board of health would not be permitted to relieve the rates in any way by the expenditure of this money so that practically it all would have to be spent on building and equipment. It would be very much more difficult to answer the question, how the voluntary hospitals would, on the same basis, spend £6,000,000.  Speaking in support of the 75 per cent. basis, Deputy Sir James Craig and others said that the voluntary hospitals wanted to build, to pay their debts, and to put money aside for investment so that the yield from such investments would be there to maintain the hospitals afterwards.  In other words, they have no great hope that these hospitals will be entirely supported by voluntary subscriptions in future.  If that is going to be done on a large scale and if the voluntary hospital is to do all the building it requires, to pay all its debts in addition to putting sufficient money aside to yield an annual amount for its maintenance, it <Col N="73" /> will, in fact, be no longer a voluntary hospital.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Sir James Craig and others who spoke in favour of that system of distribution will not be doing any great service to the idea of voluntary hospitals if they achieve what they are out for under the sweepstakes scheme.  Again, it is claimed that the voluntary hospitals in Dublin and other cities are giving free treatment not only to their citizens, but also to people throughout the country.  It has been pointed out here fairly definitely by many Deputies from the country that that is not so.  As a matter of fact, people who go to such hospitals for treatment from the country are compelled in all cases to pay a certain amount per week, usually £2, and, if unable to do that, the board of health of their county has to pay that money, so that in that respect these hospitals are not doing any great service so far as the country is concerned. They may be, and, in fact, are a great service in the sense that Deputy Dr. Hennessy explained here during the Committee Stage&mdash;namely, that they are teaching institutions to a large extent where medical students can study and attend clinical lectures.  These hospitals are useful in that way.</P>
    <P>Another point made in their favour was that they do a great deal in regard to the treatment of special diseases, and that people from all over the country who are suffering from special diseases go to such hospitals in order to be treated by specialists.  It has also been contended that they can only be treated successfully by means of the special equipment to be found in such hospitals.  I remember reading an article in a medical paper some time ago in which the writer warned his readers against diagnosing extraordinary diseases.  He said that it should always be remembered that the ordinary disease is much more common than the extraordinary.  That is true here.  There is much more ordinary disease treated in the county hospitals than special diseases which have to be treated in the city hospitals.  It was also stated that the people of Dublin were under a double obligation inasmuch as they had to maintain the hospitals <Col N="74" /> by voluntary subscriptions, and, in addition, had to pay rates for their own union hospitals.  Again I say that that is not correct.  It is not the people of Dublin alone who maintain these voluntary hospitals, but the people from all over the country who subscribe voluntarily towards them. There are people living in various counties who subscribe voluntarily to the hospitals in Dublin, and who have, in addition, to maintain their own county hospitals through the rates.</P>
    <P>It has been stated, and, I suppose, with a certain amount of truth, that the voluntary subscriptions have fallen off since the sweepstakes were inaugurated.  I am sure that is true, but in spite of the huge amount obtained by the voluntary hospitals from the sweepstakes, I saw for the last few days the streets of Dublin infested, if you like, with people who were selling flags for these voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not included in the Bill it shows that it pays them to remain voluntary.  Taking the Dublin hospitals, there are general hospitals in the city and a few special hospitals, and all of these hospitals are not included in the Bill.  Some of them are seeking money from voluntary sources, and some of them are still sending people out in the streets to sell flags.  The county hospital in Wexford, Wicklow or any other county would have very little chance of getting money by that means.  The bigger part of this money that is gathered in for the sweepstake, the money spent on the administration, the organisation, etc., of the sweeps, is spent here in the city, and none of it goes to the counties at all.  The money spent on the enormous staffs, the enormous salaries that are paid them, and the enormous amount, above all, that is spent in free entertainment, after the drawing of the sweep, are all spent in the city.  On the other hand, take the county hospitals. You have there poor buildings, <Col N="75" /> badly in need of repair.  You have very poor equipment, which I cannot say needs replacement, because, in many cases, it is not there at all.  We want equipment for the county hospitals&mdash;instruments, etc.  They are maintained by rates.  The ratepayer must pay for the maintenance of these hospitals. On the other hand, a voluntary subscriber may, if he so wishes, cease subscribing to the support of the voluntary hospitals.  That should be an argument, in my opinion, for giving relief to the ratepayers rather than to the voluntary subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can deny that the county hospitals, and with them I include the Dublin Union Hospital, are responsible for the treatment of 75 per cent. of the ordinary diseases of the poor, almost 100 per cent., one might say, of the very poor.  Even here in the City of Dublin nobody will deny but that the very poor are treated in the Dublin Union Hospital.  Our counties have gone to considerable trouble under the scheme of hospital amalgamation. They have gone to considerable trouble to get a competent staff, and they have paid what, in their opinion, amounted to a liberal salary.  It was not perhaps as liberal as should have been paid to the very best men, and they have got very good competent men in those county hospitals. When they got these very good staffs they put them into buildings that were much more like prisons than hospitals to treat their patients.  In spite of that, I say they have done remarkably good work for the last few years. They are doing work now in the county hospitals that was not expected a few years ago.  They are doing all the operations that could be expected from a competent surgeon.  I am very doubtful, if the most eminent physicians and surgeons were put into buildings such as these county hospitals are, they would do any better.  We were told on the Committee Stage that these men were paid, and that, on the other hand, the surgeons and physicians in the voluntary hospitals give their services free.  That is true, but, on the other hand, I think we all know that it is the highest aim of a young <Col N="76" /> physician or surgeon here in the city to get on the staff of a voluntary hospital.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already about the money that is spent out of these hospital sweeps, apart altogether from the question of medical treatment&mdash;the various sums that are paid to run the sweeps and the large amount that is paid for entertainment, and so on, after the draw.  I think it would be only fair, then, that there should be a liberal amount of this money given to the various counties for building decent hospitals, etc., for the twofold purpose &mdash;first of all, to see that we have decent hospitals in the various counties to treat the sick, and secondly, so that we can give some employment in the country as well as the employment that is given from the money that is spent here in the city.</P>
    <P>I believe that the forty per cent. that was asked for here is not just, because it is not sufficient for seventy-five per cent. of the population.  As the Twenty-Six Counties represent, apart from the cities, seventy-five per cent. of the population, forty per cent. is not really a just percentage.  I move that three-fourths be deleted and that we substitute sixty per cent.</P>

    <P>This whole question of the division of the money between the voluntary hospitals and the county hospitals has been debated at considerable length.  I think it would be only labouring the question to go further into it.  Were it not for those who inaugurated the sweep and carried the Bill through the House, I think the scheme would have been a failure.  If it had been a failure we would not be discussing here to day the division of the money, but how we would make a success of the scheme. Now that it has been a success we ought to agree that a certain amount should go to the county hospitals.  The ratepayers are contributing to the big hospitals in the cities, and also to their own district hospitals, but the voluntary hospitals in Dublin have a certain duty to perform, and I think it is only <Col N="77" /> right that they should get a higher percentage than the county hospitals. If at any time the county hospitals are in need of funds for extension of their buildings or any other purpose, it would be an easy matter to resurrect this Bill.  The Dublin hospitals will have to depend on the interest accruing on their investments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing both of these figures against twenty-five per cent.  My difficulty is that no reasoned case has been put forward to justify the particular figure which is in the Bill.  It seems to be an entirely open question.  The only argument that was put forward was that by Deputy Sir James Craig, which was a preposterous argument.  He gave us a particular case of a voluntary hospital, and in this particular case we are all in the one body, because we all are in favour of the voluntary hospital.  We want everything that can possibly be done for them to be done.  He put forward the case of a hospital which was receiving from voluntary sources £400 or £500 a year.  Due to sweeps, it pulled down all its buildings.  It got £80,000, and because it has got £80,000 he went on to say that it must get more.  In other words, every penny of capital expenditure that we give involves us in the necessity of providing more.  That is the only argument that was put forward, and it is a preposterous argument, that to those who hath shall be given, and be given because they have got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second argument is that they are justified in getting this amount of money because any amount of money they get involves them in further expenditure which is to be found within this particular source.  On that basis you can justify any amount.  I want to see some scheme put forward to show how this five million pounds is going to be administered by the voluntary hospitals, so-called, because they have ceased to be voluntary hospitals now, to produce benefit for the community. <Col N="78" /> It is not a question that we are arguing against some case which is bad.  No attempt has been made to put forward any such case.  There is simply an empirie figure of seventy-five per cent. That is to involve, roughly speaking, five millions, and because certain hospitals were in at the beginning they are still to get more; each and every penny they get is an argument for giving them more.  Honestly, I do not think that that is an argument which ought to be offered to this House.</P>
    <P>Another point is this.  You have these voluntary hospitals.  They came in on the basis of maintaining twenty-five per cent. of their beds as free beds. We are now going to endow with five millions of money institutions for the purpose of charging for seventy-five per cent. of their beds.  Is there any principle of reasonableness in the seventy-five per cent.?  On that basis, because seventy-five per cent. of the beds are paying, seventy-five per cent. of the total amount of the proceeds should go to these hospitals.  I am asking for any reasonable basis.  It seems to me that it is the duty of those who are responsible for the Bill to show that reasonable basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan said that the voluntary subscriptions had already fallen off. They have.  I can give you a number of instances.  The Cork Harbour Board used to subscribe every year&mdash;I think illegally&mdash;a certain sum of money for the hospitals in Cork.  The whole of that money has been withdrawn.  A public body has openly and deliberately withdrawn its subscriptions to the hospitals on the ground that they are now receiving from this source an amount of money which makes them perfectly free from any claim whatever to voluntary subscriptions.  If you are to go on that basis, it means that the whole of the voluntary subscriptions will go. The other argument is that those who did come in first because they had the enterprise&mdash;I think it was Deputy Carey said it&mdash;to start this particular money-collecting institution had a vested interest.  If that is the argument that is behind it.  I think that that ought to be the claim upon which they base it.  Certainly this House, I think, will not accept the idea that <Col N="79" /> there is that vested interest on the part of those who were first to come in, merely because they first came in, unless it can be shown that they have an actual need for the recurrent sums which are coming to them, and that they had a better use for all those sums than any alternative source. There are three figures before the House, twenty-five per cent., forty per cent. and thirty-three and one-third per cent.  I do ask those who are responsible for this Bill to give us some logical basis upon which they justify the proportion of the total which they think should go to the hospitals which this Bill and the machinery behind it are ridding of their voluntary subscriptions.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill the amendment by Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly for 50 per cent. to the country hospitals was, on a free vote of this House, defeated by six, notwithstanding the fact that six Government Deputies and one Independent Deputy voted for that amendment.  Deputy O'Kelly personally was in favour of the Minister's compromise of 33? per cent. This controversy is not good for the sweepstakes, and it is not good for the future success of the sweepstakes.  It is not good for the hospitals, whether city or county.  I think Deputy Ryan would be well advised to agree to the compromise of 33? per cent., because I may say here and now that if he does not agree, there is grave danger that on a division the 33? amendment may be beaten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse every word that Deputy Ryan has said with regard to the good work of the county hospitals, district hospitals and infirmaries.  I am delighted that they are to participate in the funds that these sweepstakes will provide, and so develop the good work that they are doing at the present time, work that I hold is equal in every respect to the work done in the city hospitals.  They are undoubtedly handicapped for want of equipment, and because of the fact that they are still forced to rely on primitive methods. The amount that will come from the sweepstakes will certainly give them a <Col N="80" /> large sum.  Let there be no doubt that it will do so to the advantage of the ratepayers, but not by way of relieving the ratepayers of their liability.  The ratepayers are quite prepared to maintain whaever improvements are made by the capital expenditure provided out of the proceeds of the sweepstakes.  They have never shirked any responsibility when called upon to provide money for any thing that was necessary in order to cope with disease and sickness.  In no county in Ireland have the ratepayers shirked their responsibility in that respect. I feel that we ought to agree to what the Minister was prepared to accept, the compromise of 33? per cent. It was stated here that 25 per cent. would provide £60,000.  You may take it that 33? per cent. will provide at least £70,000.  It is quite problematical that by 1934 there may not be quite as much money going around, but I do throw out a strong suggestion here now that we ought not to take a division on this matter, and that we ought to accept the compromise of 33? per cent., which will yield, by 1934, £70,000 for the county hospitals, undoubtedly much more than they ever had the faintest hope of getting.  I do appeal for the withdrawal of this amendment, and I ask Deputies to agree to what the Minister is prepared to give.  I want again to stress the point that if this amendment is pressed there is great danger that the 33? per cent. may be defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Capt. Redmond Capt. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Capt. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Shaw that there is grave danger of the sweepstakes not going on so successfully as they have up to the present, especially if this amendment is carried.  We are now discussing something entirely outside the original proposals contained in the Bill introduced by Deputy Craig. That Bill was introduced to set up sweepstakes for the benefit of voluntary hospitals.  Say what you like, county hospitals are supported by the rates.  Some objections were made to the original proposal on the ground that it was the thin end of the wedge towards State lotteries.  I think it must be admitted in all fairness, that <Col N="81" /> if it is just and proper that the ratepayers should be relieved by the method of sweepstakes, the taxpayers have as good a right to be relieved by a similar method.  The real difficulty that we are in to-day seems to be this&mdash;that this proposal to give any sort of relief whatever to county hospitals takes away from the original principle embodied in the original Act.  Not only that, but it threatens to damage the propects of future sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shaw has said that if the amount to be given to county hospitals is to be raised to 60 per cent. the sweepstakes may be damaged.  I go further and say that already there is a great possibility that the coming sweepstakes will not be as successful as the previous ones.  The great bulk of the money for these sweepstakes has come from outside this country. When it gets to be known outside this country that a large proportion, especially anything in the nature of 60 per cent. of the surplus, is to go directly or indirectly to the benefit of the ratepayers, then I do not think it will mean that the sweepstakes will meet with the same support elsewhere as in the past.  Apart altogether from that, the Minister has made an innovation. He has introduced an entire innovation in the sweepstakes position. He has proposed to give a certain amount to hospitals which are certainly not wholly on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The amount he is proposing now to give&mdash;33? per cent.&mdash;seems to me to be not on the mean side.  If the Minister is prepared to adopt this new principle, because it is an entirely new principle, foreign to the conception and the terms of the original Act; if he is prepared to adopt this innovation and give relief to the hospitals which are not voluntary ones entirely, I certainly think that 33? per cent. is ample in amount, and that to offer any more would be to endanger seriously the prospects and success of the future sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the county hospitals cater for the very poor.  That is so, but, with all respect to Deputy Dr. Ryan, I suggest that the very poor <Col N="82" /> are more to be found in the City of Dublin than they are even in the rural districts of Ireland, and that there are no hospitals that contribute so much to the public health of the very poor as those hospitals that are known as voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin.  Again and again we have heard the argument that these hospitals in Dublin cater for the people of Dublin.  I again say that they do no such thing.  I have seen no hospital rolls produced to show that these hospitals relieve a large percentage of merely Dublin citizens. I would very much like to see some of the hospital rolls to find out whether exactly the contrary is not the case, and whether the majority of the cases are not cases from outside the radius of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do think that in view of this innovation that has been proposed, this addendum or change of principle that has been adopted as apart from the principle contained in the original Act, it would certainly be a grave danger for us to go to the length which Deputy Ryan has suggested, and allow the enormous proportion of 60 per cent. to go in what would be considered, and in my opinion rightly considered, elsewhere as being in relief of the rates payable by the ratepayers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to say a single word in this debate, but representing the City of Dublin, I think that the drift of this debate is much to be regretted.  I think this House should consider the national needs of the country before the local needs of the country.  Speaking as a representative of Dublin City, I think that Deputy O'Kelly did not serve the national needs of the country, and he certainly did not serve the needs of the City of Dublin when he introduced this amendment.  It seems to me that this debate resolved itself into an effort on behalf of Deputies who represent the county constituencies to obtain money by means of sweepstakes, not for the improvement of the hospitals, but merely by way of relief of the burden of the rates that have to be borne by the people.  It has been stated here by Deputy Shaw that the ratepayers <Col N="83" /> have never shirked responsibility for the maintenance of county hospitals.  It has been stated here by many speakers in this House that county hospitals, in the matter of equipment and in some other ways, are in a very bad way. If these county hospitals are in a bad way whose fault is that?  Where are the funds that support these hospitals coming from?  Are they not coming from the ratepayers of the different districts?  If the ratepayers of these districts were doing their duty to these hospitals, surely they would be in a sound position to carry on their duties as medical institutions?  I hope that the Minister will stand firm by the 25 per cent. in the Bill.  A very fair offer of 33? per cent. was made to the House by the Minister in order to prevent a division.  That offer was rejected, and I hope the rejection of that offer will enable the Minister to come to the conclusion that 25 per cent. as the proportion to which the county hospitals shall be entitled shall stand part of the Bill. In my opinion Deputy Redmond was right when he said that they were being over-generously treated by giving them that proportion of the money.  I also agree that once it becomes public property, as it will become public property, that this money received from the sweepstakes is going to be devoted, not to improving the health of the poor of the country, but by way of relief of rates, it is going to have a very injurious effect on the amount of money which will be received from the sweepstakes. I believe with Deputy Redmond that when English subscribers realise this fact the sweepstakes will be seriously injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey as a sporting man always thinks that nobody will put a shilling into these sweepstakes except in the hope of winning a prize.  Speaking for those who have subscribed in this country, I believe that that condition of affairs does not exist.  Although I am willing to admit that a large percentage of people subscribe with the hope of winning one of the large prizes, I say that no negligible proportion of the people subscribe with the double object in view, and especially with the object of helping <Col N="84" /> the poor.  I believe that if the English people realise that we are going throw a large part of the liability which should be on the rates on to the English people who subscribe it is going to lessen the volume of support which the sweepstakes receive. I also believe that the British Government will take more drastic measures, if they can possibly do it, and I believe they can, to prevent the inflow of money by way of subscriptions. Under the 25 per cent. in the Bill the sum of £1,000,000 will go to the county hospitals.  That to me seems a stupendous sum of money.  They are only, as one medical man said, in the majority of cases, a one-horse show. They are institutions with a single doctor or two doctors.  I know that one institution mentioned, the Galway hospital, is rather in a bigger way, but that institution stands out as an exception to the bulk of the institutions with which this Bill is about to deal.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that it is not the intention to relieve the rates by the inclusion of the different amendments on the paper.  Anybody who has read the speech of Deputy Kennedy can only come to one conclusion, and that is, that if that speech represents the point of view of the county Deputies it is relief of the rates that county Deputies are looking for, rather than the relief of the hospitals.  In the course of his speech Deputy Kennedy said that a maternity ward was needed in the county hospital at Mullingar, for which an estimate of £10,000 has been submitted, and that an up-to-date sewerage system is needed for which an estimate has been put in.  Is that what the people of Mullingar want? Do they want this money to go for the introduction of sewerage systems and schemes of that sort?  Is that the way they are going to help the poor? Is that the way this money is going to be spent?  Is that the object for which the scheme was originally launched?  It has been stated here by a Deputy who is a county medical officer of health, who knows more about this question than I do, and who knows the position of the hospitals in <Col N="85" /> the City of Dublin and the position of the county hospitals, that the hospitals in the City of Dublin should be regarded as national institutions, that they are doing national and not local work.  Anybody who is connected with the City of Dublin knows that the work of these hospitals has been national and not local.  I have been informed by medical men in this House that a great number of the larger hospitals in this city take in 40 per cent. of free patients, and that no question is asked, when it is necessary for a patient to go in for medical treatment, as to where he resides.  He is taken in regardless of where he is living.  These are facts which I believe no Deputy will dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I dispute them.  The county boards of health pay for the maintenance of the patients sent to the Dublin hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that point in a moment.  It has been stated by medical men in this House that the area for which the Dublin hospitals cater at present extends over 100 miles from Dublin.  That would cover a very large portion of the country.  Then you have the other hospitals in Cork and Limerick operating in a similar manner.  Deputy Shaw tells us that local bodies contribute to the upkeep of the patients.  Will the Deputy say that the £2 per week contributed by the local bodies keeps a patient in a Dublin hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that £2 per week does not pay for the maintenance of any patient.  Has it not been stated by medical men in this House that when serious cases come up for treatment in the city of Dublin hospitals, anæsthetics and dressings and things of that kind alone cost over £3 per week, leaving out the question of maintenance?  In my opinion county hospitals are quite efficient for the treatment of normal diseases.  I am perfectly willing to admit their competency in every way, but that is an argument in favour of the 25 per cent. The cases that come to Dublin to be treated are not ordinary cases.  Ninetyfive <Col N="86" /> per cent. of them are serious cases which need the skill of surgical and medical specialists, and that skill is at their disposal.  In the county hospitals medical officers are paid by the State for dealing with cases.  In the Dublin hospitals the specialists who attend these patients, for which this magnificent sum of £2 is paid, are men who are at the top of their profession.  If a patient went to them in the ordinary way he would have to pay a fee of from £25 to £50 for similar treatment. I can speak from experience of that. These patients sent up by the county institutions are treated for £2 per week and receive the services of these eminent specialists, who do not get one penny of remuneration.  I ask the House not to take a local view of the matter.  What really matters is the steps that we are to take to help the poor.  If there is one man more local in his ideas than another in this House it is Deputy Ryan, who moved this amendment.  I have never seen the Deputy take a national view-point upon any question introduced in this Assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is: which of these proposals are we to adopt for the benefit of the hospitals of the country, whether they are to have 25 per cent. or 40 per cent?  I have no hesitation in saying that if the House were to adopt 40 per cent. as the share that was to go to the country hospitals, it would certainly have done a very serious injury to the poor of Dublin and to the poor of the whole country as well.  I have just been informed of one institution in Dublin City that has fifteen medical experts, every one of them giving their service without fee or reward.  For any question that arises in that institution for consideration you have specialists in every branch of disease to which human nature is heir.  When a particular complaint comes in from the country to that institution some one or other of these specialists knows that complaint intimately. It is quite impossible for that degree of medical knowledge to exist in county hospitals.  I am making no <Col N="87" /> reflection upon the county hospitals when I say that, because it would be impossible for them to have that degree of medical knowledge or skill.  If we are going to spend this huge sum of money, surely we ought to see to it that we spend it in such a way that the greatest quantum of medical skill will be placed at the disposal of the poor of the country?  If you spend this large sum of money on a one-man or a two-man hospital in the country, is it suggested that the same quantum of medical skill will be available as by the expenditure of a similar sum of money on a Dublin hospital?  Anyone who considers this from the broad national point of view, can only come to one conclusion, namely, that it would be a great error to divert such large sums of money to the needs of the country.  One million pounds is what the county hospitals will get by giving them 25 per cent. under the Act. In addition to that million pounds you have the funds of the State coming in in aid of these hospitals which the voluntary hospitals in Dublin have not got.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn spoke from the same view-point on which he usually starts on this particular matter. Because much is given to the Dublin hospitals they are entitled to more, he says.  The real facts of the case are not summed up by the statement of Deputy Flinn.  The real facts are simply these: If the Dublin hospitals did not receive this money from the sweepstakes they would be unable to carry on.</P>

The House must recognise that if the county hospitals never received one single penny from the sweepstakes, they could still carry on.  That is the great dividing line that should guide the House in deciding the proportion to Dublin and the other cities, Cork and Limerick, and the proportion that should go to the county hospitals.  I have no hesitation <Col N="88" /> in saying that if we divert the large sum of money that Deputy Ryan asks for, it will be wrong, or even if we divert the money that Deputy Shaw wants&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill has been so changed since we last debated the subject that I do not recognise it.  The debate has turned altogether into a question as to what proportion the county hospitals are to get as against the voluntary hospitals.  As the Bill as amended in Committee now stands, there is not one word about the county hospitals getting anything.  It is quite within the compass of the Bill whether you give twenty-five, thirty-three and one-third or fifty per cent. that the county hospitals will not get one penny under the Bill.  That is how the matter stands now.  Anyone who reads Section 6 will see that it is within the province of the Minister for Local Government to provide fifty per cent. for the county hospitals, and then to go and build hospitals here in Dublin with that very fifty per cent. without coming to the House to ask for its authority. I complain that the Bill is entirely changed from what it was when it was originally brought in.  It was then definitely laid down in the Bill that the proportion of the division was to have regard to population. In the Bill as it stands now with Section 6 in it there is no restriction whatever upon the Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Local Government might allow you to give fifty-fifty, and then say &ldquo;I take the whole of the fifty for the county hospitals,&rdquo; and afterwards build a sanatorium in Dublin for cases of tuberculosis in Ireland and apply all <Col N="89" /> the money to that.  He can say, &ldquo;I will bring all the insane people up to Dublin, and house them in a big institution there.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately there are too many of them already, but the Minister may if he likes add to the number.  That is the situation under the Bill.  Our whole debate is futile. I want a guarantee from the Minister that there will be money given to the county hospitals under the terms of the Bill, whether it is twenty-five, thirty-three and one-third or one per cent.  There is nothing in the Bill since the new Section 6 was introduced to guarantee that anything will go to the county hospitals.  I voted for fifty per cent. when there was some hope that something would go to the county hospitals, but the Bill will now have to be materially changed beyond the amendments on the Paper before we can be sure that the county hospitals will get a penny at all under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude in this matter is still the same as it was when we were discussing it on the Committee Stage.  We listened to-day to more hypocrisy and to statements closely resembling those that might be made by people who would benefit by mental hospitals.  It was suggested by Deputies, and stressed by some of them, that it was going to do grave injury to the success of the sweepstakes outside this country if it was known that the basis of the division of the money was to be altered. Can anybody imagine anyone in England or America, or anywhere else, making inquiries from someone selling them tickets as to what proportion of the money would go to the city hospitals and the county hospitals in Ireland? The suggestion is one that might come from people who would be justly termed lunatics, and no one else.  There would be no such question in anybody's mind, and there would be no question as to whether the money is going to the relief of the poor of the provinces or in Dublin.  No questions <Col N="90" /> are going to be asked whether the money is going to hospitals in Dublin or the country.  Any suggestion otherwise is a fool's suggestion, and cannot be made seriously.  Another thing talked about is the enterprise of certain voluntary hospitals.  There is no enterprise in reality in these hospitals.  The enterprise is in the people outside who promoted the whole thing.  The first we heard of this matter was in 1923.  There is no enterprise in the hospitals.  They are the people that allowed their names to be used in the first instance, and that was the extent of their enterprise.</P>
      <P>What would damage the prospects of future sweeps is if an unreasonable amount was taken out of the fund and given to the hospitals. That stage is got over and we have preserved the public confidence.  This has no effect on the public confidence and it is utter hypocrisy to make the statement that it has. There are a few cities besides Dublin that are also going to get special treatment.  It seems to me from the speeches of Deputy Redmond and others that they are all arrayed on behalf of the voluntary hospitals because of the natural tendency to get as much as possible for their constituencies.  It is a question of the city hospitals being arrayed against the country hospitals.  According to Deputy Byrne poverty exists nowhere except in Dublin.  A great case has been made that a million and a fraction is more than enough for the country but no one has attempted to make the case that six millions is too much for the voluntary hospitals.  The Deputies and the Minister for Justice sit quite and listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of medical attendance for mental hospitals has not been entered into at all and the mental hospitals' charge in the country is a huge one.  When the county hospitals send a patient to Dublin £2 a week is charged and the case is being made that that does not defray their expenses.  The Dublin patient can get accommodation free and surely if the citizen of Dublin gets everything for nothing we ought not to be making <Col N="91" /> the case that £2 is justified in the case of a country patient.  I want the House to look at this in the light of the new conditions.  Six months ago we did not visualise the sweeps being as successful as they are.  A much lesser sum was thought of.  That sum has been multiplied by almost three and still the representatives of the City consider that the altered circumstances should not be taken into consideration at all.</P>
    <P>I understood some of the Deputies to state that the proposition was to give the country hospitals 60 per cent. The case made was that the country hospitals should get 40 per cent. Deputy Byrne made a mistake.  Deputy Redmond made a mistake when he thought 60 per cent. was in the amendment. We do not need to tell them at this stage that it is only 40 per cent.  In my opinion that is not too much and I am going to vote for it.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters I would like to have cleared up.  I do not think this debate has helped the future success of the sweepstakes. There has been a very thin veneer put on the case.  The case is that it is for the relief of the rates. Deputy Gorey, with his usual candour, has made that plain.  I agree with Deputy Gorey and I do not think, even if it is diverted to the counties and away from the voluntary hospitals, that it would influence, to any considerable extent, the purchase of tickets or the mentality of the man who buys sweepstake tickets, but it will influence very strongly the action of the British Government.  The British Government are aware of the fact that these sweepstakes are in relief of local rates, and there is a very strong feeling in England that if you support sweepstakes in Ireland for the relief of the rates that they ought to have sweepstakes in England for the relief of their voluntary hospitals.  It is the Government you have to reckon with, and any Deputy who thinks that the British Government, if challenged, cannot make it an illegal act in their country, and make it impossible, I think are counting on too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> A great deal has been said about what the Dublin hospitals charge for patients sent up from the country.  I wonder how far will the £2 go in the maintenance of any Deputy in a hotel here in Dublin, apart from any medical or overhead charges?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>You must be an unpretentious man.  Deputy Ryan speaks of 75 per cent. of the patients being distributed throughout the country. That is an arbitrary figure.  The majority of the population will be found in the big towns and cities in Ireland, where voluntary hospitals are there to cater for the needs of these poor people.  I would like to say a word on behalf of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and other big towns in Ireland.  These are the principal subscribing people who, through taxation, are made to subscribe to agricultural grants and other things for the relief of the local rates in the counties.  These people in the cities subscribe the bulk of that taxation, and I think they should get credit for it.</P>
      <P>I have not too much sympathy with Deputy Shaw in his attitude on this case.  Westmeath is a rich county, and if Westmeath did as much as the neighbouring county, Meath, Deputy Shaw need not indulge in any special pleading for grants for the county hospitals; but Westmeath County, to my own knowledge, failed very badly to do its duty to the poor of the hospital.  I know how the Minister came to offer an increase on the 25 per cent. originally agreed upon, and I must compliment those Deputies on their strategy&mdash; I mean, those nominally his supporters &mdash;who spoke against the Bill here.  It made him feel that he could hardly command a majority in the House with the result that it was left to a free vote.  Nevertheless, he did command a majority for 25 per cent.  I think, as the President said in another case, that there should be no sympathy with those who put out a grasping hand when they did not accept the offer of 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately the scope of the Bill is very limited.  I do not quite agree <Col N="93" /> with Deputy O'Hanlon that it should be as limited as it is.  I very much regret that it is limited, and that some of the money could not be devoted to medical research.  I believe it is impossible to do it now, but if ten per cent. of the money could be diverted for medical research it would be of great national benefit to this country. We are dependent on subscriptions from American millionaires for any little medical research that is done in this country.  I do not think sweepstakes will help us to get any money for medical research.  Probably enough has been said on the matter, but I think if the House had stuck to twenty-five per cent. it would be quite ample. I believe the new arguments and the new amendments will not help the success of the sweepstake.  As I said, these are simply a challenge to the British Government, and I believe that when the British Government takes this thing in earnest and considers the arguments put forward here, they will take such steps as will make the success of the sweepstakes very doubtful.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that they could not be.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill I stated that it was very lamentable that this discussion should have been conducted in the terms in which it was conducted. I think it very lamentable that we should have a certain number of Deputies on one side finding fault with and attacking the Dublin hospitals, and I thought on the other hand it was very lamentable that certain persons had attacked the county hospitals and county infirmaries.  My view is that they do admirable work in their own particular sphere, and I do not think attacks on either are proper, right or justifiable.  I am afraid Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;though he has no doubt studied the Bill&mdash;never went to the trouble of studying and working out this particular scheme, because from start to finish he never spoke of anything but <Col N="94" /> the Dublin hospitals, and he seemed to consider that it should be a case of Dublin on one side and the rest of Ireland on the other.  It is nothing of the kind.  Not only do the Dublin hospitals benefit, but hospitals in the City of Cork benefit.  If you are taking any money out of Dublin by carrying Deputy Ryan's amendment, you are also taking money out of Cork, out of Limerick, and out of Waterford.</P>

      <P>Deputies could not be expected to know, but I am bringing it forward to show that the standpoint of Deputy Dr. Ryan, that it is Dublin hospitals alone that benefit, is entirely unjustifiable, and has no basis.  If you are going to knock out Dublin hospitals you are going to knock out a considerable number of country hospitals also.  Every one of these county hospitals that come under the voluntary scheme can show that there is voluntary aid and that they supply a certain number of beds to the poor.  It has been said that the Dublin hospitals get too much under this Bill, and the question has been asked:&mdash;&ldquo;Why should they get such enormous sums?&rdquo;  We are told that they charge large sums for country patients that come up for treatment. That is not invariably true.  They charge, I know, when country patients are sent up by boards of health, though there are many patients, I know, of my own knowledge, not sent up by boards of health, but sent up by doctors or other individuals.  I myself, and some of my relatives have got patients into Dublin hospitals and they <Col N="95" /> have not been charged.  To say that every country patient who goes to a Dublin hospital is charged £2 a week is not accurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my experience goes a person who goes to a Dublin hospital pays the amount of money he is able reasonably to pay out of his own pocket, and if sent by a board of health, the board pays.  As far as I know, that is the arrangement. As to the proportion between the different classes of patients I cannot speak. Supposing the Dublin hospitals and the other voluntary hospitals are put into a sound financial condition; they are not out for making money; they have no shareholders and no dividends to pay.  They have nothing to do but to keep the hospitals fit and efficient for the benefit of the sick. If, in struggling along&mdash;and a great number of them are battling for life, and some, apart from this money, are not even battling successfully for life&mdash; they charge £2 a week for a patient, if they are put into a sound and solvent position, you will have a very reasonable case for going and saying&mdash;&ldquo;Why are you charging so much for a patient?  You are solvent; you are able to give free treatment; why do you not do so?&rdquo;  But hospitals on the verge of bankruptcy cannot be asked to give free treatment to patients in the fashion which hospitals on a sound financial basis can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to country hospitals, it has been said their means are limited.  I think that we should stand, as far as we can, for principle.  Our principle should be that this money should not go in direct relief of the rates.  There are certain things that people ought to have done out of the rates, that have not been done out of the rates.  It is the class of improvements which would not be done out of the rates that we should consider under this Bill.  Any expenditure of money which goes to the direct relief of the rates would be bringing in an entirely new principle, and would be giving an entire justification to what Deputy Dr. <Col N="96" /> Hennessy said, that people outside the country would not look on this scheme as being run for the benefit of voluntary hospitals, or for the benefit of the sick poor, but would regard it as being run for the benefit of the individual ratepayer, and in the public estimation it would stand on a completely different basis.  I have been asked how the 25 per cent. basis was arrived at.  In the present condition of our knowledge it must be only a matter of surmise what the needs of the Dublin hospitals are, or what the needs of the county hospitals are.  I have spoken to several doctors and to other persons connected with the various county hospitals, and I have asked what amount of money these hospitals reasonably required in order to put them into what they considered would be first-class condition.</P>
    <P>I discovered that the sums which were mentioned to me as necessary for a county will probably be doubled and trebled under the 25 per cent. arrangement. I think that 25 per cent. is, therefore, more than enough for the needs of these hospitals.  It may be that when the schemes are put forward by the various boards of health to the Department of Local Government we will have such information before us as will enable us to know practically with certainly what are the needs of the county hospitals, over and above those needs which one might reasonably expect should be paid out of the rates.  Over and above these, what are the needs?  No doubt we will know when the schemes have been put forward and examined by the Department of Local Government.  On the other hand, when the Committee of Reference will have examined the needs of the voluntary hospitals, we will be in a better position to decide what these needs are.  If it turns out that the hospitals sweepstakes have been such a tremendous success that more than the legitimate needs of both the voluntary and non-voluntary hospitals can be satisfied, then, of course, this House will have to consider what steps it will take with regard to the sweepstakes altogether.</P>
    <P>At present, however, when it is <Col N="97" /> almost certain that there will be more than enough money to go round, it appears to me to be lamentable that this desire to get money should be so strong, that there should be jealousy because some hospitals may get more than others, and that we should have a debate like this attacking the management of the Dublin hospitals&mdash; prejudicial to their good name, and also, to some extent, to that of the county hospitals.  It is difficult to know now what each county will get, because, as Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out, the population basis has been done away with.  Take, for instance, a county like Louth.  I leave Galway out, because it has only lately, only to-day in fact, come under the voluntary scheme.  Take Louth or Waterford. There large sums have gone to the voluntary hospitals which do the big work in those counties.  Further sums will go to them, and consequently the needs of Waterford or Louth will be comparatively small, either under my proposal of 25 per cent. or Dr. Ryan's amendment of 40 per cent.  Apart from the big hospitals in the city, I think there are only two or three others, and they would be comparatively small, that would have a claim to this 25, 33? or 40 per cent., as the House decides.  That would leave a much larger sum available for counties in which there are no hospitals receiving sums out of the portions of the proceeds set aside for the voluntary hospitals.  As I say, this is a matter upon which it is very difficult to make up your mind with anything approaching mathematical certainty.  We have not, and we could not have, before us the necessary facts and figures.  I am personally satisfied that the needs of the county hospitals, other than those participating on the voluntary basis, will be more than met by the 25 per cent. arrangement.  I think that the 40 per cent. proposal is hopelessly and entirely wrong.  There has been talk about compromise.  I tried compromise, and it failed.  I think the 25 per cent. would be enough, and I ask the House to vote against this amendment. If the House thinks that 33? per cent. is a proper basis, then that is a matter for the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to make clear that, so far as I am concerned, the attitude which I have taken in regard to the amendment has not been actuated by any prejudice against the Dublin hospitals.  The principles on which I move are these.  The distribution and allocation of funds to the county hospitals will be the subject of central supervision; the expenditure will be carefully considered and approved by responsible people in the Department of Local Government and Public Health; and, therefore, there is much less chance of this money, which is coming to us so easy and which there is a natural human temptation to spend rashly and without due prudence, being expended without careful supervision.</P>

      <P>And they will only be subject within limits to the Committee of Reference who may report to the Minister for Justice.  They are entitled to make certain inspections and that sort of thing but the body which will really determine the matter of allocation, as between hospital and hospital, is going to be the Hospital Committee and not the Committee of Reference.  I am afraid that that is how the proposal of the Minister is going to operate.  There is another point which I would emphasise and that is the point made by Deputy Dr. Hennessy.  There are some people whose attitude in this debate has been largely determined by the rosy prospects, the extravagant pictures, which the Minister, Deputy Sir James Craig, and others, have put before the <Col N="99" /> House as to future sweepstakes.  We hear people talking of sweepstakes going to make available for the hospitals sums of two millions and upwards and they talk as if these sweeps would go on until the Act expires.  We hear people say that there are to be no less than nine more sweepstakes and, as a result, there will be so much money available, not only for the Dublin hospitals but also for the county institutions, that they will not know what to do with it.</P>
      <P>My opinion is that very shortly they will come to an end because they are creating a problem in other countries for those charged with the administration of the law there which will inevitably compel the authorities responsible there to make representations here. These sweepstakes are not, and will not be, regarded abroad as private ones.  They are really public sweepstakes run with the consent of, and regulated by the Government here. Ultimately I believe that they will create a big diplomatic issue between this and other countries.  Therefore, if we are to maintain good relations with other States, we cannot try to organise and legalise what will be gambling bootlegging.  That is what it amounts to.  They will develop a bootlegging industry in sweeps in this and other countries, just as a bootlegging industry in liquor was created in America owing to prohibition.  These sweepstakes will not be unlimited. The term during which it will be profitable to run them will be limited, and therefore in regard to whatever money comes to us now, every care should be taken to ensure that the community as a whole will get the best possible results.  It is for that reason, and in the belief that the expenditure of the money allocated to county hospitals will be carried out with great prudence that I support the amendment allocating 40 per cent. to such hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not going to draw a red herring across the track. Last week he was willing to accept a certain figure.  This week, because something quite extrinsic to that figure is put forward, he will not accept it.  It is quite inconsistent. I am in a peculiar position in this matter, because I happen to represent a constituency where the interests on both sides are involved.  We have in Waterford City certain hospitals which are already under the scheme, but then there are other institutions in the county.  On the whole, it is not like as if we were now starting out on the commencement of the distribution of the funds.  All the institutions <Col N="101" /> that have participated so far have been very fairly treated.  They have got a considerable amount of money out of it, and I do not think any of the hospitals, either in the City of Waterford or elsewhere, are going to suffer if we raise the percentage for the county institutions.  There is this aspect, however, involved, that there are some very poor people who would not be sufficiently seriously ill to be put on the rates, and who would not for that reason have money spent on them in sending them to central hospitals, whether in Dublin or in the City of Waterford.  These people, at the same time, may require a considerable amount of attendance.  I would like to have seen it possible to have portion of the money spent on the dental treatment of children, but one cannot send a number of children 15 or 20 miles in order to get that type of case attended to out of the rates.  It is that sort of case, the case of people who are very poor, I have in mind, and if cases are not sufficiently serious to justify their being sent to a central hospital at the public expense, they could be dealt with in the decentralised institutions. The more the medical services are decentralised the better I think it will be.  I do not think it would prevent any serious cases from coming to the central hospitals, or would prevent any doctors from becoming expert, as they are in certain diseases.  On the other hand, the more we bring medical services to the people the better. Some time ago I had a conversation with a journalist who does not belong to this country.  He told me that he was going to write an article&mdash;I do not know whether he has done so yet&mdash;in which he would emphasise that the idea behind the Hospitals Sweepstakes was to build up one of the best medical services in the world.  I put that forward in answer to Deputy Dr. Hennessy.  The more we spend on district medical services the more we are going to carry out that idea.  I regret that the Minister has closed his mind like a rat-trap on this question.</P>

      <P>I would like to be satisfied that the Committee of Reference would have full power to inquire into all the facts relating to all the hospitals, voluntary and otherwise.  Of course, in regard to the sweepstakes that have been held up to the present, the Minister told us recently that he inquired in a general way into the amount allocated to the different hospitals, but unless for grave reasons he would not interfere with the allocations made by the Hospitals Committee So for all practical purposes the Hospitals Committee decided the allocation.  I have a list of the amounts allocated to the different hospitals under the different sweepstakes up to this, as published in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; some days ago, hospitals in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I do not know anything about the hospitals in places outside Dublin, but it did appear to me in regard to some hospitals in Dublin City that the allocation did not appear to be fair.  I rather gathered that some of the Deputies of the House here thought that I, in suggesting a different allocation of the available surplus of the sweepstake money, that the county hospitals should get a higher proportion than originally proposed, that I was by that fact doing an injury to the Dublin hospitals. I suppose I was, to some extent, but I would like to be taken in no way as being hostile to the Dublin hospitals.  I wanted to see a fair proportion of division between the city and the country hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some knowledge of some Dublin hospitals.  For 25 years I have had close association with the Mater Hospital. Speaking for myself, I can say with regard to the very poor that I <Col N="107" /> never failed to get a patient into that hospital when a patient needed attention. I never once failed.  I mentioned that to people in Dublin in recent times, and I was told that I was evidently an exceptional person.  That was true with regard to me and the facility with which I got people into that hospital.  I can only speak of my own personal experience.  That is true of the Mater, and to a limited extent of other hospitals.  Certainly the Mater never refused a patient that I wished to get in.  I now say that as to that hospital, which is one of the biggest in Dublin, and has probably the biggest number of beds, there is only 4 per cent. of the surplus allotted to it, while other hospitals that have not half the number of beds get a considerably higher percentage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I may possibly help him if I explain how the percentage is arrived at.  Various representatives of the hospitals came together, they then decided that they would draw up a principle upon which the money should be allocated.  They did draw up a principle; they applied it, and the hospital representatives agreed.  The unanimous report came to me.  One hospital was very angry; it said it did not get enough; another hospital was not very pleased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was given a list of the hospitals here and the arrangements set out for the next sweepstake.  The hospitals have now certain deductions taken off the percentages previously arranged to be given to them in order to provide 5 per cent. for the Galway Hospital.  The figures are: Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, 6 per cent. less 1.25; the Meath Hospital, 6 per cent. less .75; the Richmond, 6 per cent. less .75; the Coombe, 6 per cent. less .75; the Temple Street Hospital, 4 per cent less .5; the City of Dublin Hospital, 6 per cent. less .5, and the Cork Street Fever Hospital, 6 per cent. less .5.  The amounts these hospitals will get will be proportionately reduced.  Comparing these figures as they stand with the reduced amounts, it does appear to me that there is a strong case for reconsideration of these percentages by the Committee of Reference, especially taking into account the number of beds and the number of free beds.  I am told, with regard to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, that nobody is ever refused admission there no matter from what part of Ireland they may come.  I am glad to hear it.  They may be able to put up a very good case for a higher percentage than has been given to that hospital.  The same applies to the Meath, the Richmond and the Coombe. They have all got a high percentage.  I do not know anything about the percentage of the poor, but there is a very strong case for a close examination by an expert committee that the Minister will put up to go into these percentages and see that there is, according to the number of beds given to the poor and according to the financial and other requirements of the hospital, a just division of the available surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may speak of Section 6, I want to say that I called the Minister's <Col N="109" /> attention already to the wording of that section, and asked him if it would not be possible to do for the local authorities what has been done for the Hospitals Committee in another part of the Bill.  In Section 5 of the Bill the Minister brought in an amendment to the effect that the Hospitals Committee ought not to be ignored. The Hospitals Committee should be consulted when the proportion that they should allot to the hospitals was being discussed. There is an equally strong case for consultation between the Local Government Department and the local authorities.  The local authorities are not to be ignored altogether in this matter either.  If there was a case for an amendment being brought in specially, so as to make it necessary to consult the Hospitals Committee before the allocation of the funds, I think there is an equally good case for consultation with the local authorities before allocating the funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he would consult his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and see if some amendment could not be brought in to that section.  I would like to know if he has consulted him, and if it were not possible to pay that courtesy, if it were nothing else, to the local authorities.  The same applies to the first paragraph in Section 6, where it says &ldquo;it shall be paid to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and shall be applied by him in such manner as he shall think fit....&rdquo;  There is no reference whatsoever to any consultation with the local authorities as to whether they are to be allowed to have any say as to how that money is to be spent.  The same applies to sub-section (2) (a) of Section 6, which says: &ldquo;such application may be made conditional upon the fulfilment by such local authorities of such conditions as the said Minister shall think proper to impose.&rdquo;  There is no question of consultation with the local authorities there.  I think that is unfair, and not at all just to the local authorities, that the Bill is to give absolute power to the Minister to impose his will upon them as to how this money should be <Col N="110" /> disposed of without consultation of any kind with the local authorities. Of course, the Minister has the final say.  He has the money, and as long as he has the money the local authoriites will have to make up their minds to fall in with his views before they get that money.  I think the least that ought to be done is that the compliment or courtesy should be paid to the local authorities before any scheme would be adopted by the Minister and imposed on them without consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the last part of the Deputy's statement is concerned, of course the local bodies will get no money from the Minister for Local Government until the scheme has been before him, and naturally that will have to be presented by the local body concerned.  As far as the sub-section is concerned, &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister shall think proper to impose,&rdquo; that is obviously to ensure that the money shall be spent according to the provisions of the Act; for instance, if money is got for one particular thing that it shall not be expended on doing something else.</P>

There is no harm in anybody ever being heard, but there is no analogy between that and the local bodies, because it is not suggested by the Deputy that all local bodies should come together and put their case before the Minister for Local Government, whereas all the hospitals will be represented at the same time, and will be able to put their <Col N="111" /> case, if it is a consultation&mdash;that they shall be heard, each one putting his own case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving amendments 2 and 5.  I think they will have to be looked at together.  The first point is that by amendment 2 I want to prevent the recovery of fees by unregistered persons, and there is a certain <Col N="114" /> amount of detail given with regard to this.  I want to have it that no person shall be entitled to recover in legal proceedings a fee or charge for different things, and then I follow with certain conditions, unless such person was a registered veterinary surgeon at particular times, and the times are when the operation was performed or the medicine supplied.  I put in a second sub-section whereby I want to establish that the person who sold the veterinary medicine is in his present position. Then in amendment 5 I want to amend Section 45 by putting at the end of it this new sub-section.  Obviously, under Section 45 as it stands, it is unlawful for any person to practise or to represent or hold himself out, whether directly or by implication, as practising, or being prepared to practise veterinary surgery or veterinary medicine, unless he is registered.  I want to say that nothing in the section shall render it unlawful, and after that I have got the draftsman to draft a formula which was spoken of, without being definitely agreed upon, on the last occasion on which we had this under discussion. The formula is this, that I would like every farmer, or any person who keeps animals for profit, or the servant of any such person, to perform operations or administer medicine to an animal of any class, whether owned by these persons or anybody else, provided that the performance of the operation, or the administering of the medicine, was incidental to the care and management of stock, and provided always that the person does not hold himself out in any of these forbidden capacities. These are my amendments. Deputy O'Connell has an amendment to delete certain words in sub-section (1) of my first amendment.  I think the short explanation of it is that it is to delete any reference to the supply of veterinary medicine.  He further proposes to delete the last line or a little bit more of the last amendment&mdash;to delete all words after the words &ldquo;veterinary surgeon&rdquo; in the last line but one.  I do not know what the exact intention of deleting the last words in that section is, but I see the point with regard to the omission suggested in my new amendment in sub-section (1), and <Col N="115" /> would be prepared to agree to this, leaving the other thing over for the moment, if the Deputy would then consider the advisability of omitting all my proposed sub-section (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I see that the Deputy is proposing that.  I am agreeable to that, but I still want to hear the reasons for the suggested omission of the words at the end of amendment 5.  I think the first part of my first amendment covers Deputy Ryan's amendment.  I do not know whether he agrees with that, but I think it is exactly the same.  I am not sure whether he is prepared to agree to my amendment with the omissions suggested by Deputy O'Connell.</P>

I agree that the Minister in his first amendment has covered what I had in mind, and I agree with what the Minister has in his third clause, but I do not altogether agree with the second.  I think he is giving a little bit too much liberty in the way of dispensers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the point on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The difficulty I saw about it was, and it is there still, that a person might go to a chemist's shop, or another shop where medicine is sold, and then the word &ldquo;prescribe,&rdquo; or the significance of the word &ldquo;prescribe,&rdquo; would be very considerable, and that was my trouble.  It is even made stronger by putting in the word &ldquo;recommending.&rdquo; It is quite a common thing for a man to go into a shop and tell the symptoms from which a beast was suffering, and the person selling medicine, whether a chemist or a man who stocked farm medicines in his shop, might recommend a particular medicine for that.  It <Col N="116" /> is quite a common thing in the country. I want to make sure that the farmer could not get away with it by simply pleading in such a case as that, &ldquo;You recommended it, and therefore I need not pay you.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no great enthusiasm for my own sub-section (2). I put it in simply to have it discussed, because the matter of the chemist was raised when we were last debating the question.  I said I would get an amendment drafted to bring them in, but it gives them too much power. I think there is considerable objection on the part of the veterinary profession to see this amendment passed as it is.  People do not want to have it so widely extended, but I think Deputy O'Connell's amendment meets the case.  He still refuses to allow an unregistered person to recover at law charges for veterinary advice given.</P>
      <P>That is all right.  I agree with that, but then if you omit all reference to the supply of veterinary medicine we will leave it as it is.  I am quite willing to accept the Deputy's amendment to omit the words he has suggested should be omitted in Part I and all of sub-section (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say what I had in my mind.  I do not think it was stressed in the debate, and that is the number of veterinary surgeons in the country.  There are only six veterinary surgeons in the whole of the County Mayo for 28,000 farmers.  If these farmers had to depend on the veterinary surgeons where would they be, and it is a common thing to get advice from the local people.</P>

      <P>In the proposed new sub-section to delete all words after the words &ldquo;veterinary surgeon&rdquo; in the last line but one.</P>
      <P>I think the difficulty there is about holding himself out.  I do not want him to hold himself out as a registered veterinary surgeon, but as practising veterinary surgery.  Suppose one of those people who do perform surgical operations, or what is known as surgical operations, on animals, said to somebody that he was prepared to do this, that and the other, and to perform some particular operation, would he be holding himself out as practising?  It is the registered man we want to save and nobody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think &ldquo;holding out&rdquo; is a rather technical term and amounts almost to advertising.  I think that is what it comes to.  I do not think that a man who announces, when he hears that an animal required certain attention, and says &ldquo;very good, I have a servant who is very good at that,&rdquo; or for the servant to say, &ldquo;I'll attend to it,&rdquo; does so, that that would be against the law, while putting a notice in the paper, saying so-and-so is prepared to perform this and that operation, would be holding himself out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is your objection to that?  We must not regard this at all from the ordinary medical point of view, such as Deputy Sir James Craig or Deputy Ryan would regard it in their profession.  We must remember <Col N="118" /> it is an entirely different matter when we are dealing with animals and human beings, and we must keep before our minds the number of veterinary surgeons in the country.  As I pointed out, in the whole of Mayo there are only six veterinary surgeons to 28,000 farmers.  I think the protection is quite sufficient as it is.  I think there is a danger, as I say, on the point I make.  With regard to advertising, I do not know whether there is any legal definition of &ldquo;holding out&rdquo; as the Minister says.  I think it might be held that a man who suggested that he was able to perform these operations, whether he put it into the papers or not, was holding himself out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the distinction I make.  I think that advertising would be definitely &ldquo;holding out.&rdquo;  Conduct of a particular character might amount to holding oneself out.  But I think the test generally taken is advertising. We do not prevent him practising, but we are preventing a man advertising himself or holding himself out by newspaper advertisements, circular, or letter sent round to the people.  I think all that would amount to holding himself out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the question of advertising is the important thing.  I would like to see in every district men capable of doing small operations.  It would be a very serious matter if there were in a district five or six people advertising themselves as capable of doing some operations.  That could not be tolerated at all, whereas I would be quite pleased to see people capable of doing the thing allowed to do it.  It is different sending round letters, putting notices in their houses, or sending notices to the newspapers that they were capable of performing certain operations.  I think that should certainly be debarred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  Under the agreement entered into between the Irish Free State, Northern Ireland and Great Britain as to the registration and control of medical practitioners, and embodied in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927, representatives of the Universities and Medical Corporations in Ireland, and representatives of the Registered Medical Practitioners in Ireland, continue to form part of the General Council of Medical Education and Registration. The British Pharmacopæia is prepared under the direction of this body.  The Pharmacopæia is the list of medicines and compounds in most general use, particularly those whose safe and effective use requires that the manner of their preparation and the weights and <Col N="122" /> measures in which they are to be mixed shall be precisely stated and followed. Under Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act (Ireland), 1875, it is an offence to compound any medicines mentioned in the Pharmacopæia except according to the formularies contained therein.  As a result, however, of the passing of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927, the Medical Acts of 1858 and 1886 have, with certain exceptions, ceased to have effect in Saorstát Eireann.  I am advised that, as a result, we are without a Pharmacopæia having statutory application. This Bill proposes that the British Pharmacopæia shall be the Saorstát Eireann Pharmacopæia, subject to such modification as may be made therein by rule made by the Medical Registration Council set up for Saorstát Eireann under Section 3 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give very much explanation as to the necessity for this Bill.  I suppose there is a necessity for it.  I do not know what great use can be made of the Bill. The Minister did not indicate the forces that were brought to bear on the Government to get them to introduce this Bill or what use can be made of it.  Most of the medicines prescribed under it will be in the British Pharmacopæia.  I am sure that Deputies like Deputy Dr. Hennessy would be opposed to any great departure from the British Pharmacopæia. Seeing that a great number of our medical practitioners will have to seek a living in another land, if they are trained on the Pharmacopæia in use in the Free State, one that is altogether different from the British, it would be a great hardship on them if they were asked to emigrate afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the next stage of the Bill I would ask the Minister to consider whether anything can be done to deal with the question of patent medicines. I believe it could be dealt with under the Bill.  The Minister read the sections of the Principal Act that are being dealt with under this Bill. These sections talk of prescribing according to the formularies of the <Col N="123" /> British Pharmacopæia and so on.  We all know that patent medicines have departed altogether from the formularies of the British Pharmacopæia. A great claim is made on the public as to the cures that can be effected in the case of certain diseases by these patent medicines.  Many people are deceived by the advertisements that appear.  The result is that a great deal of money is spent on patent medicines.  I think that something ought to be done on the Committee Stage of the Bill to deal with that matter.  Under this Bill people are going to be prohibited from prescribing except according to the formularies of the Saorstát Pharmacopæia. We could also, I suppose, prohibit people from prescribing by advertising in the Press or otherwise, claiming that they can cure certain diseases and so on.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary, as one may gather from reading the newspapers, the value that is sometimes claimed for these patent medicines.  For instance, if you have a pain in your back they have a patent medicine that will cure that no matter what the pain may be due to.  A few days ago I was in a garage and a man asked me could I give him a cure for indigestion.  I said to him:&ldquo;If my car will not go can you tell me what is wrong with it without seeing it?' Of course, he could not.  Neither could I prescribe for indigestion without examining him.</P>
    <P>It is really not fair to allow the public to be duped by the advertisements that appear in connection with patent medicines.  The public are being duped to a great extent.  Certain of these medicines are used for different ailments and a great deal of money is lost.  There may be one per cent. of bad cases in which there is an improvement as a result of their use.  When news of that gets around it may be that another circle of people will, perhaps, believe in the remedy spoken of because there seems to be a slight improvement in the case of one sufferer. I would be glad if the Minister would consider that and see if anything can be done on the Committee Stage.  I <Col N="124" /> also want to point out to the Minister that there is a slight mistake in the Bill.  I have looked up the authorities and find that in one of the enactments to be repealed it should be chapter 57 instead of chapter 59.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Ryan with regard to patent medicines is rather far away from what we are dealing with here.  What we propose to secure by this Bill is the setting up of a pharmacopæia for Saorstát Eireann.  Taking the British Pharmacopæia as the basis, what we propose is that the Medical Registration Council here shall have power to build up their own pharmacopæia by any modifications they wish to make. I am afraid the Department of Local Government could hardly undertake, in a Bill of this kind, to go into the question of what should be said about patent medicines.  When the Saorstát Pharmacopæia is properly established, and a responsible body set up for dealing with its extension and development, it might be asked to consider the position with regard to patent medicines. It might, on its own initiative, consider that question and make any observations that it wished to make.</P>
      <P>The Pharmacopæia will deal with vaccines, therapeutics and substances generally.  The question that the Deputy has raised is one that might quite properly come before the body I have referred to when it is set up.  I think that if the Deputy further considers the matter he will see that nothing useful with regard to patent medicines could be done on this Bill.

      <P>There is one question I forgot to ask the Minister.  This Bill proposes to amend the Pharmacy Act of 1875.  Under that Act there was a provision dealing with registered chemists&mdash;for removing them from the register.  I think there is no such provision now.  I wonder could the Minister say what exactly is the position?</P>

      <P>The position with regard to pharmacists generally is that a Bill is being drafted, and is at present under reconsideration by the pharmacists.  It has for its object the institutionalising of the pharmacists, and the setting up of a professional council to deal with registration and the educational side of the pharmacy business.  That has been worked out more or less on the lines of the Dentists Act.  The matter that the Deputy refers to would more properly arise on that Bill when it comes before the House.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might shorten discussion if I were to make a brief statement.  Arising out of certain statements and suggestions made here on the Second Reading of the Bill, I had a conference with the representatives of the Central Midwives Board.  They propose to deal with some of the suggestions that were made here.  As far as I can understand, they propose to deal with the suggestion contained in the Deputy's amendment by an amendment of their regulations.  They submitted to me a draft regulation that they are prepared to make, subject to coming to agreement with myself in the matter.  They must have their regulations approved by the Medical Registration Council. What they propose is:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Consolidated Rules the Board may admit to the Roll of Midwives and issue a certificate of such admission to any woman&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) who prior to the first day of <Col N="126" /> June, 1927, was granted a certificate in midwifery on examination, by a lying-in hospital recognised by the Board, after a course of training of at least three months in the case of a trained medical and surgical nurse, and at least four months in the case of a sick children's nurse registered on the Register of Nurses under the Nurses Registration (Ireland) Act, 1919, and at least six months in any other case; or</P>
    <P>(b) who before the first day of January, 1924, was or had been a midwife in the permanent employment of a Poor Law Authority, if such a woman shall within twelve months after the making of this Rule qualify at such examination in midwifery as shall be prescribed by the Board for the purpose.</P>
    <P>That is that in the case of those people who did not take these steps after June, 1927, to get put on the register, by an amendment of their consolidated rule, they would allow such a woman to go up for an examination that they would prescribe, and that would be suitable for the circumstances of the people for whom this amendment in the rules is intended, and that they would pass an examination within twelve months after the passing of the Act.  I think that would meet what the Deputy has down in his amendment.</P>

      <Col N="129" /> This Vote is almost entirely statutory. The first three items are definitely so, and they all show decreases.  The fourth item is more or less a token Vote.  There may be certain expenses still to be incurred in connection with these, although there is no evidence yet that there will be any heavy expenditure at all.  The next item, sub-head E, shows an increase this year.  On sub-head L (a) the amount of money required to make good the deficit in working the Sligo and Belmullet steamer service was due to the fact that there is less traffic going on this subsidised service around the coast.  If that continues we will have got to the point when it is clear that a subsidised service is no longer required. &ldquo;Other services,&rdquo; covered by C amount to £50 to meet possible losses in connection with certain experimental services run by the Sligo and Belmullet steamer service around the coast in certain parts of Donegal.</P>

We have not enough experience of the service to be able to estimate with any degree of accuracy. <Col N="130" /> Representations were made by certain merchants along the Donegal coast that they would give sufficient cargoes to make the cost of bringing a steamer around by Donegal pay.  If that does not work out we will have to withdraw it.  That £50 is to meet an odd loss here and there.  It was not to subsidise the service for the area.  It was simply meant that this steamer would make a certain number of trips.  There was almost a guarantee given that there would be cargo to meet the extra fuel and the extra cost, and we are trying it out on that basis.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,487 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for payments under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc.; and for other purposes connected with Irish Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sum of £4,487 is divided into two parts; half of the estimated loss is given under the heading of what was one-half of the estimated loss during 1931, £3,862, and then half of the estimated loss during the period from 1st January to the 31st March, 1932.  That is the entire sum we propose to give in regard to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly railway for the working of the Burtonport and Carndonagh Railways in this financial year.  Deputies will remember that there has been a subsidy for many years past in this concern, and that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly people, running a Government <Col N="131" /> line on a particular basis, have, in recent years, been unable to meet their working expenses, and have been kept going by advances made by this Government and the Government of Northern Ireland.  At the beginning of this year the Government of Northern Ireland indicated that they did not propose to give any subsidy whatever this year.  In these circumstances we felt that we could not be expected to bear the full cost on the three Government lines.  We considered that if there was any subsidy given it should be shared on a fifty-fifty basis, seeing for one thing that the headquarters of the line is in Northern Ireland, and that the greater part of the traffic originates or ends in Derry.</P>
    <P>A critical situation in the company's affairs was reached in March, and pressure was used by the directors on both Governments.  I had taken my stand in previous years, when I had been first in the field to vote a subsidy, always on the condition that owing to the indication given by the other Government I could promise nothing.  To an extent the pressure was relieved, as far as I was concerned, and pressure was apparently exerted on the other Government.  Towards the end of March a new scheme was put up by the directors of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.  It amounted to this, that they were to be granted permission to discontinue the running of passenger trains, which was previously an obligation upon them, and that they would be granted a certain sum of money which was to be strictly limited, to acquire road transport which they would operate in order to supplement the passenger services where they were discontinued, and that they would bear the entire cost of the road transport themselves. They guaranteed that they would keep the loss on the working of the reorganised railway and on the passenger carrying buses to £7,724, and that next year and every succeeding year the amount would not exceed £5,000. When that scheme was put forward the Government of Northern Ireland agreed to the payment of half the <Col N="132" /> amount of the maximum loss incurred this year, £7,724, and half of the £5,000 for at least one year.  On getting information that the Northern Government had agreed, I also agreed and undertook to introduce a Supplementary Vote to give this amount of money.  I am asking the House to grant £3,862, half the estimated loss this year, and £625 which is our portion of the estimated loss of £5,000 during next year.  The other conditions of the arrangement I have tried to carry out.  The first was that they were to be allowed to discontinue the passenger train services and to supplement the old passenger services by motor services.  They were to bear the losses on motor transport themselves. A certain similar agreement was made with the Company except that no further financial assistance would be considered by this Government in connection with this railway.</P>

      <P>I fully realise that certain difficulties confronted the Minister with regard to the negotiations to which he referred, and which resulted in the closing of the passenger services on this line.  I would point out to the Minister that in giving a subsidy for the current financial year he is giving a subsidy to a company which is closing down the passenger section of the railway service and indirectly subsidising the road service of the same company.  I presume the motor buses under the new arrangement have been purchased out of funds, portion of which may have come indirectly from the subsidies provided already.</P>

Before I consent to this Vote I want to know from the Minister whether he has made any examination into the possibilities of the situation so far as they may affect future transport facilities in that <Col N="134" /> county, whether there is a danger of a total closing down of the railway system and of it being superseded by motor lorry system as far as carrying goods is concerned, and a motor bus system as far as passenger traffic is concerned.

      <P>There has been a certain examination made of the railway and transport situation in northern Donegal.  At the moment it looks as if the best solution there would be a passenger bus service and having this railway as it is at present, operating only for the carriage of goods.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get out of order by going into the purpose of the Private Bill which I ask leave to introduce.  I would like to say to the House that the Bill is a non-contentious measure, purely to alter a sub-section of an already existing Act, to remedy a defect which was in that Act, and which was not noticed when it was going through the House, a defect, furthermore, which the Minister has not recognised as yet. It deals with the administration of poor law relief in the City of Dublin.  Under the Local Government Act of 1931 the number of the Dublin Union Committee was fixed at five, of which the quorum was to be three.  The Minister knows himself, a deputation having waited on him from the Dublin Corporation, that this number is not large enough and will have to be increased in order to bring about efficiency in the administration of poor relief.  The Minister knows, I am sure, that difficulty has been experienced on several occasions to get a quorum.  It is anticipated, now that the holiday season has started, that greater difficulties will arise.  The chairman of that body has already intimated that she is going on her holidays.  Other members may also be going on holidays or, if a member falls sick, there is a danger of the whole administration of poor relief breaking down owing to the lack of a <Col N="136" /> quorum.  In the Private Bill which I introduced, the only possible element of contention was in the exact number of the Committee.  So far as I am concerned, I am not out to stick rigidly to the number mentioned in the Bill. If the House thought a lesser number or a greater number would bring about greater efficiency I would accept that number.  What I cannot understand is what is at the back of the Minister's mind in opposing the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is nothing contentious in the Bill.  It is purely designed to bring about an increased number on the Dublin Union Committee to ensure that there will be a quorum and an efficient administration. As a matter of fact, the Minister knows that when the Dublin Union Committee meet, as they do every Wednesday, it is a full day's work for them.  All the corporators give their services free. They do not even get car fare. Amongst the members is a representative of the Labour Party, who, I feel, should not be called upon to give a full day, as he has to do, in order to get through the work.</P>

I oppose the introduction <Col N="138" /> of a Bill by Deputy Briscoe here for the purpose of increasing the number of members of the Dublin Union Committee, and I do so for these reasons. At a time when the Dublin Union Committee is in communication with the Minister for Local Government with regard to their position, and before they have come to any conclusion themselves as to what size of a Committee could most satisfactorily deal with the business of the Dublin Union, Deputy Briscoe introduces a Bill to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>Standing Order 82 provides special machinery whereby the first reading of a Bill may be opposed.  It is a pretty rare happening. It has happened that Government Bills have been opposed.  It happened last week on the Juries Protection Bill.  It has happened on occasions to Private Deputies Bills.  The idea of the Standing Order is that if opposition to the introduction of a Bill is made, the proceedings shall be resolved quickly.  What seems to be happening this evening is that points of order are unduly protracting the proceedings.</P>

      <P>I will reduce my objections in this case to general grounds, such as Deputy Davin, apparently, would like to have done. Where a local body is discussing with the Minister for Local Government any aspect of the better organisation of their business, and where negotiations and discussions are proceeding, I would oppose the first reading of any Bill dealing with that matter brought in by any Deputy, unless I thought that its introduction was likely to help in the matter under discussion.  I cannot see discussions going on in a reasonable and bona fide way between any local bodies and the Minister for Local Government that could be helped in any way by the introduction of a Bill by a private member.  That is precisely what Deputy Briscoe is proceeding to do.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Civil Service Cost-of-Living Bonus.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the discontent prevalent amongst the lower grades in the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should set up a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and report on the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus and its application to Civil Servants' salaries and wages.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Anthony).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 4th of March I moved this motion.  On that occasion, I think, I occupied something like three-quarters of an hour when speaking to the motion.  I do not want to repeat the arguments I used then, but I wish to emphasise one or two points and to remind the Deputies, because of the time that has elapsed, of one or two salient features in that discussion. I pointed out then that it was essential, if we were to have a satisfied or contented Civil Service, that there should be a cessation of these cuts in salaries which have been in operation by way of a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus, pending an inquiry into their method of application.  I pointed out on that occasion that whilst you had an index figure, perhaps at 70 or 80, that that in no way represented the real cost of living so far as it applied to the civil servant.  I might have then developed that particular phase of my argument and easily proved that that index figure did not in any way represent the true cost of living in this country.  For that reason I stressed then, as I do stress now, the fact that these cuts should cease until such time as we have an inquiry into the method of their application. I want to remind the House also that this cost-of-living bonus came into operation in 1920 as a means of partially compensating the civil servants for the increase in the cost of living. It was acknowledged at that time that the cost of living had gone up very considerably, and even though the civil servants to an extent enjoyed a kind of relative prosperity, because of the <Col N="144" /> economic conditions operating at that time, because of the fact that the index cost of living then represented the position more accurately than the index cost of living does now, they did not cavil at its method of application.  But other reasons have operated to make that index not a true representation of the cost of living of the civil servant.</P>
      <P>There is one section of that service to which the application of this cost-of-living figure applies with rather disastrous effect.  I refer to the lower paid civil servant.  We all know that a ten per cent. reduction whilst it might mean a very slight reduction in the case of a higher paid Civil Servant becomes a very serious factor indeed in the lives of those in the service of the State who have basic salaries of, say, £150 and under per annum.  It may appear to some persons a very small reduction indeed to suggest that they should submit to a five, or six or ten per cent. cut in their salaries, but at the beginning of the month when those civil servants receive their salaries that reduction takes on quite a different complexion. To the man, especially the man with a wife and family to keep, with a fairly high rent to pay, this reduction represents a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit again as I submitted before that this index figure is not a true indication of the civil service cost of living.  I have knowledge and I am sure every Deputy in this House shares that knowledge with me that many of those young and rather lower paid civil servants have embarked in house purchase schemes for reasons which are obvious to most of us.  We know that it was difficult in Dublin for the young married civil servant to procure a house to house himself and his wife and family, if he had any, in any kind of decency or respectability. Such a civil servant found that rents were most exorbitant and the only method by which he could procure reasonably comfortable shelter for himself and his family was to purchase a house on the instalment system whereby he had to deposit a certain amount either with a utility <Col N="145" /> building society or some other commercial or enterprising people who were prepared to sell him a house on the instalment system.  Many of those civil servants embarked on those house purchase schemes, and the annual increments to which they are entitled are completely negatived by those reductions in their cost-of-living bonus year after year.</P>
    <P>There is an instability, there is an uncertainty present in the minds of all those civil servants to whom I refer. That is not, I submit, a healthy or a proper state of affairs to exist in the Civil Service of this, or, for that matter, any other country.  I emphasised and gave many figures to demonstrate that the civil servant in this country was not the pampered individual that some people on public boards and some representative people in this country think he is, or at least represent him to be.  For instance, an officer of the Civil Service with the combined wage&mdash;that is to say, prewar wage and bonus-amounting in March, 1921, to £5 1s. 6d. per week, has now a combined wage of £3 6s. 1d. That represents a loss of £1 15s. 5d. per week.  It cannot be said that such a servant is the pampered pet of the Free State.  Neither can it be said with any degree of truth, equity or justice that he should be counted on as the faithful servant of the State. It is very poor encouragement, indeed, to the young man or woman who has entered the service of this State by open competition to be told at the end of a number of years that, instead of improving his position, that position is gradually to be worsened.  It is quite manifest that their emoluments are gradually lessening.  I say that, having regard to the facts which I stated a moment or two ago, that their annual increments are negatived by the reduction brought about by the reduced cost-of-living bonus.  Can we as a State expect all that should be demanded and is demanded of the servants of the State&mdash;the greatest amount of trustworthiness, of probity, of honesty, and of loyalty if you like to the State from those who are year after year reduced in their income? They are reduced in their cost-of-living bonus, and this works out a <Col N="146" /> reduction in their wages and salaries. Not only that, but these civil servants are faced year after year with still further reductions.  There appears to be no finality to it.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, it is strongly rumoured that instead of something good accruing as a result of this motion a further reduction will take place in the cost-of-living bonus of these deserving citizens of the State. These civil servants claim that their present financial position is such that they are unable to afford any further reduction.  Whilst I believe that the official mind frequently dominates the actions of Ministers, at least that they pay perhaps more regard to certain highly-placed officials, to their judgment and advice, than they as Ministers should, yet I appeal to the Minister in this case to use his own commonsense and sense of fair play.</P>
    <P>I am not going to use an argument that has been commonly used about the salaries of Ministers.  I believe in the main they are worth their salaries, but I want to know how would they feel if, every year, they were told that because of this mythical figure, arrived at by a process that I cannot understand, because of an artificial reduction in the cost of living represented by that figure, they as Ministers must receive less by way of salary.  I would be the first to defend the salaries of Ministers, because I believe that the labourer is worthy of his hire, but I want to see that generally applied.  I say with all the seriousness that I can command that this has caused an amount of discontent in the service.  A lower paid civil servant, a struggling young married man, may have engaged in such schemes as I have mentioned. He may have undertaken a house purchase scheme, or perhaps, following the advice of Ministers, been prudent and foreseeing enough to insure himself and his wife and family.  He may have made provision, acting again on sound advice, for the future of his children in the way of education and so on.  How is he, under the circumstances I have related, to continue to fulfil his obligations in that way if he is faced with reduction in salary year after year, instead of feeling that he could look forward, as one year succeeded <Col N="147" /> another, to an increase in salary, up to and including the time when he would have reached the maximum in his particular grade?  Instead of looking forward to an increase in salary, he is now a disgruntled person, who feels that the whole Dáil, the whole Executive at any rate, are up in arms against him, and want to deprive him of what he considers to be his rights.  Surely, in view of what I said on a previous occasion in this House, and what I have only now attempted to summarise as briefly as I possibly could, if there is a necessity for economy, and there may be certain economies possible, why should those economies operate in such a way on the lower-paid members of the service?  If we are to economise in that way, let us begin at the top and work down. Again, I say that I do not want to be interpreted as suggesting that we want to reduce the salary of any Minister. At the same time, I submit that these civil servants have contributed already more than their quota to these economies. The lower grades of the service in particular, I think, have been victimised in a very cruel way, and there appears to be no indication from the Minister for Finance that there will not be further victimisation.  I suggest it is a matter that the Minister and the House should consider very seriously before they inflict further injury on these lower paid civil servants.</P>
    <P>What does this motion ask for? Does it ask for anything extraordinary? Does it ask that these men should be paid more than a living wage?  I suggest it does not.  It simply asks the Executive Council to examine the position.  It is in very plain and simple English.  It asks that a commission of inquiry should be set up to investigate and report on the present methods of computation of the cost-of-living bonus and its application to civil servants' salaries and wages. I am anxious to know what objection, if any, can be raised by the Minister, or by any Deputy who has any spark of humanity left in him, against such a motion as this.  It asks merely for an inquiry.  In a word it says, let us <Col N="148" /> examine.  That is all that is asked. It does not even ask that a stop should be put to the system which creates such ill effects, such dissatisfaction in the service, and which in my opinion is a most immoral practice on the part of the Department&mdash;the continued infliction on the lower paid members of the civil service of a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus.  If the Minister came to the House and asked us to examine proposals, some of which might not be acceptable to any of us, I feel that we are liberal-minded enough to say that we would not condemn these proposals without first examining them.  But, apparently, the attitude of the Department of Finance in this and other allied matters is one of the jack-boot.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the position of civil servants in relation to organisation.  And when I say organisation I do not refer to it in the way in which the term is used in connection with trades unions for instance.  I refer to a combination, if you like, of the civil servants who believe, when they have a grievance, that the right place and the right atmosphere in which to have it examined is by the method of a representative council.</P>
    <P>But here again we find that this method of expressing their views is largely denied to civil servants.  I say largely denied, because very likely the Minister will tell me there is such an organisation in existence, and there is a means or an avenue through which these grievances can be examined and by which every question relating to the Civil Service can be explored and dealt with.  But what is the actual position?  So far that representative council is an effete body through which none but some of the brass hats of the service can get any sort of satisfaction at all.  So far as the rank and file are concerned, there is no avenue of approach at all.  I suggested last March, and I spoke as one with considerable experience in the matter, that the Whitley Councils in England had done a lot of useful work, and that in these matters it might be well for the Minister to examine the position with a view to ultimately taking a leaf out of their book.  It was found <Col N="149" /> in England that in the Whitley Councils&mdash;and that is what I want to impress upon the Minister&mdash;that they had a safety-valve method of expression, and that also should be found for the Civil Service of this country through a council.  Call it by any name you like, but let us have a representative council in every sense of the term, and let that word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; not be a misnomer.</P>
    <P>Now we have a number of people affected by these continual cuts in this cost-of-living bonus.  Postal officials, clerical officers, writing assistants, have all been affected, and unless the Minister will set up this Committee of Inquiry for which I ask, I really do not know what other avenue there is open to those people to get into direct and close personal contact, if you like, with the Department of Finance in order that their grievances may be remedied. There are something like 20,000 public servants who are affected in this way.  They feel that they are being unfairly treated, and they also feel, as I feel, that the Minister should, if he is not prepared to do it himself, in co-operation with the representatives of the Civil Service, establish or set up machinery to deal with this and other kindred questions. I have complained of the cost-of-living bonus and the way it has been applied, and the severe and undoubted hardship it is to the lower grades particularly. I have suggested that it does not press so heavily on the higher paid civil servants.  There are many thousands in the service who were relatively fairly well-to-do some half a dozen years ago, and who find it difficult enough to live, to pay their just demands, to pay very high house rents in Dublin and Cork and other large centres, and all those people have been very severely hit now, particularly in the case of the young married civil servants and civil servants with other responsibilities, and who, though not married, may have to keep a house, and support a mother, sisters or other dependents.  The responsibilities, instead of being lessened in the case of married people particularly, have been increased.  The cost of living really shows little or no reduction. <Col N="150" /> To-day house rents are as high, if not higher, than they were in 1920, and I can give the Minister several authentic cases in support of my statement. There has been no material change in the cost of living.  Ask any housekeeper who, after all, is in the position in the household that the Minister for Finance occupies in this House.  She is Chancellor of the Exchequer in her own household, and from inquiries that I have made from such people I found very little or no difference in the cost of living since 1920.  Yet the cost of living index figure that is published at varying periods shows a considerable reduction.  My own personal housekeeping expenses have not gone down one whit, and yet thousands of civil servants are told that because the index figure, which is arrived at by some extraordinary method of calculation, shows a reduction, then the civil servants' cost-of-living bonus must go down accordingly.</P>
    <P>Now, I leave it to any Deputy to give me conclusive evidence to show that the cost of living is reduced to the extent represented by the cost of living index figure.  Personally, I feel it has not been reduced one whit, but even if I were wrong in this respect and if it has been reduced by a few points, yet I have not met one citizen who has suggested that the cost of living has gone down to the extent represented by the cost of living index figure published here from time to time, and just as automatically as that figure appears in your official gazette, just as frequently the civil servant is reduced in his salary or wages.  I want to bring back to the minds of Deputies some of the things, though not all the things, that I stated in the previous debate.  I feel there are many Deputies drawn from all Parties in the House who are anxious to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear an expression of opinion from Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies in that particular regard, just as I would like to hear an expression of opinion from Fianna Fáil.  Of course, I know in advance what their feeling is on that matter.  I want to ask Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal <Col N="151" /> Benches what do they propose to do about it, and what do they propose to say to their constituents?  Apart from election propaganda, what is their opinion on this matter?  What will they say to the people in the towns and villages of their constituencies about this motion?  Members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who hail from County Cork, have told the civil servants that they are in entire sympathy with them.  I would like to see that sympathy translated into practical results in this House.  It is one thing to go down the country and say to the civil servants that you are in entire sympathy with their demands; to indicate to them that you think they are not treated properly by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not indicting the Government in this matter; I am indicting a Department of the Government, and I am endeavouring to enlist, if possible, the sympathy of the Minister.  I will also have a word to say with regard to the honesty of people in the public life of our country.  If a division takes place on this question&mdash;I hope that there will not be a division&mdash;the least Deputies may do is to stand by the statements they have made.  I repeat that I trust there will not be a division.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;compromise,&rdquo; but if the Minister will merely indicate that he is prepared to make an investigation into this matter, I will be prepared to take that as a good gesture and I will be quite satisfied.  I believe civil servants will be quite satisfied, too.  There are more persons than the Minister and the higher permanent officials concerned in this matter; there are numerous members of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I want from them a straight and honest answer to a straight and honest question.  Are they going to turn down the reasonable request of large numbers of deserving men and women in this country who simply ask for an opportunity of proving their case?  They are prohibited from making a case here, except some Deputy will take up the cudgels for them.  It is not popular, in the sense in which we hear it translated on some occasions, to take up the cudgels on <Col N="152" /> behalf of civil servants.  There is no phrase more frequently or more wilfully misinterpreted in this country than the phrase &ldquo;cost-of-living bonus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies going to turn their backs on the men and women whose case they promised to examine?  Will they say to these people: &ldquo;We promised you one thing in the county Cork or the county Dublin, outside Leinster House, but when we come back here we must simply obey the crack of the Party Whips because it suits the Minister and some of the higher officials?&rdquo;  I want to see some honesty displayed in that connection.  I have no doubt that there are numbers of Cumann na Gaedheal Deputies who would be glad to have a chance to vote for this motion.  I ask them to give visible evidence of the faith that is in them. Let one, two or three of them stand up in this House and ask the President or the Minister to permit a free vote on this matter.  If that reasonable and reasoned request is acceded to, I hope they will act according to their consciences and they will not slavishly go into the Lobby against their own convictions.  I hope they will not feel themselves compelled slavishly to obey the Party call as they did the other night and on other occasions. When the Hospitals Bill was under consideration here, although those in authority said there would be a free vote, some of the country Deputies voted against their own convictions. I mention that matter now in the hope that those same Deputies will profit by their mistake on that occasion.</P>
    <P>If the President or the Minister agrees that there should be a free vote, I hope these members of Cumann na nGaedheal will exercise the God-given right of using their own judgment. I hope in this matter that I will get the support that I have been led to expect.  I am not altogether making this request as a sort of chance shot.  I have had some conversations with certain members of Cumann na nGaedheal who feel that they would like to support this motion because they have a decent sense of justice <Col N="153" /> and equity.  Summed up in a few words, the motion asks for an examination of the position.  I feel that it would be discreditable to an Irish Government to turn down such a request. If we were dealing with an alien Government, one of the greatest impeachments we could make against it would be to say that it even refused to examine a proposal.</P>
    <P>I will again remind the Minister that one of the biggest assets the State can have and hold is a contented Civil Service.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that the civil servants should be pampered or petted or spoon-fed.  I do suggest that they are entitled to the fulfilment of the promises made to them.  I may say, by way of illustration, that the increments that many of the lower paid civil servants are getting to-day are completely cancelled by the reductions that are made in the cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat an example that I gave early in the course of my speech. An officer had in salary and bonus a wage of £5 1s. 6d. a week in March, 1921, and has now been reduced to £3 6s. 1d.  In other words, he has suffered a loss of 35/5 per week.  I ask Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, whether they come from the cities, towns or villages, to examine their consciences and put it to themselves whether they could be loyal servants of the State if their wages were reduced by 35/5 a week over the period to which I have referred?  I appeal with confidence to every Deputy who has a sense of equity and justice to deal out that justice to a number of deserving citizens, to people who cannot make themselves vocal here, and who have to seek the only avenue open to them by getting some Deputy, Independent or otherwise, to take up their case.</P>
    <P>The number of civil servants in Cork is relatively small.  Dublin, as we know, is the heart of the Civil Service, and in Dublin they count for something&mdash;I mean by way of votes or in any way you like.  I have no particular axe to grind.  I am making an <Col N="154" /> appeal for them on the merits of the case that I put before the House on 4th March last and again to-night.  I appeal again to that sense of equity and justice which the members of Cumann na nGaedheal have proclaimed time after time on public platforms. They have either to vote for this motion&mdash;I do not say this by way of threat&mdash;and carry out the promises they made to several of these civil servants throughout the country or go back dishonoured.  If they fail to fulfil their promises they will go down unwept and unsung.</P>

      <P>As I listened to Deputy Anthony I thought of an advertisement which has become popular in the newspapers recently, the significant feature of which is a gentleman who is able to face both way at once, and who in doing so exclaims &ldquo;Crikey! That's Shell&mdash; that was.&rdquo;  We had Deputy Anthony, in introducing this motion ostensibly in favour of civil servants reciting a long litany of the injustices which the civil servants in the lower ranks particularly suffer, and at the same time telling us that he did not blame the Government: he only blamed a department of the Government.  He told us that if economies had to be made, then they had got to be made at the top, but that he did not want to reduce the salary of the Minister. It seemed to me, listening to the Deputy's speech, that he was really rather anxious to deprive the House of the opportunity of discussing this motion on its merits.  It is upon its merits as it affects the community as a whole, and not with any special advertence to the position of any particular section or class in the community, that we on this side are supporting the motion, and are demanding that there should be an investigation and report on the present method of computing the cost of living bonus, and its application to Civil Service salaries and wages.  Not only does the present cost of living index apply merely to civil servants, <Col N="155" /> not only does it affect inequitably and unfairly civil servants in the lower grades, but it also has its reactions in all the industrial relations between employers and employees throughout the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>In that connection I would like to remind the House of a statement issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce on 23rd August, 1922, in relation to this report.  The conclusions set forth in the report, this announcement declares, &ldquo;represent the closest approximation which is practicable to the cost of maintaining in particular months of the current year as compared with July, 1914, the same standard of living for a family dependent on wage earnings in places with 500 or more inhabitants.  The inquiry applied to the whole of Ireland and its basis is, therefore, broad enough to be reasonably dependable for any practicable purpose to which a calculation as to changes in the cost of living can be usefully applied.&rdquo;  First of all it would appear to me that the fact that this inquiry was based on the conditions existing throughout the whole of Ireland rather than on the conditions which exist in those centres where the largest numbers of civil servants are employed, and have to live would of itself render the present cost of living index an unfair, uncertain and inaccurate way of maintaining the possibly inadequate standard of living which civil servants in the lower grades enjoyed prior to August, 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very fact that the basis is too general, is too widespread, would render the present cost of living index an unfair, inaccurate and unjust way of regulating the salaries and wages in the Civil Service in accordance with the cost of living of that particular section of the community.  Let me remind the House that the present cost of living index was instituted as a result of a report originally made to the Chairman of the Provisional Government in Ireland on 4th August, 1922.  That report was made by a committee <Col N="156" /> which was appointed on 10th June, 1922.  A reliable cost of living index is very difficult to compile.  I would like to point out to the House that there is no necessary relation between the items which constitute, and those that are required to provide a minimum standard of subsistence or comfort.  The total cost at any date of the commodities covered by the index figure may be less than the cost of subsistence.  In the case of the Irish cost of living index, I believe the total cost of the commodities covered by that index is, in fact, less than the total cost of subsistence.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>If the index is to show changes in the cost of living and exclude changes in the standard of living, the commodities covered must remain unchanged, not only as regards quality but as regards quantity, over the period covered by the index.  The inquiry upon which the present index is partly based&mdash;I think I will be able to show later its relation to the British index and the basis of that index&mdash;is admitted by statisticans, by the Board of Trade and by every person who is familiar with the problem in England to be entirely unsatisfactory for computing or indicating the change in the cost of living of the industrial workers in England to which it was originally related.  But in this particular case of our index I should like to say this, that the British index was compiled at a time when conditions were very stable in England, when it was possible to get that extended time basis during which there was only a slight variation in the cost of particular commodities covered by the index.  But in our case the basic inquiry was set on foot between the 10th June, 1922, and the 4th August, 1922, at a period when the civil war had begun, when all transport was dislocated, when there was no possibility of having a necessary or an accurate inquiry into the cost of any article of subsistence in the Twenty-Six <Col N="157" /> Counties, and where, at any rate, there was certainly no such uniformity of price over the whole Twenty-Six Counties as would enable reliable statistics as to the cost of living to be compiled.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Cost of Living Committee itself is an admission of that.  They state on page 11 that no less than 5,000 copies of a certain form were despatched to national school teachers all over the country, accompanied by detailed instructions as to the method in which they were to be completed.  Of those 5,000 forms only 308 were returned so complete that the Committee was able to use them for the purpose of its calculation.  Now, I think the discrepancy between the number of forms sent out and the number of completed forms which were ultimately available, on the Committee's own admission, was so abnormal that it is of itself a sufficient proof that the cost of living index in its present form is a non-reliable barometer, a non-reliable guide as to how the cost of living varies from time to time within the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There is one other difficulty in connection with the compilations of the cost of living index to which I would like to direct the attention of the House, because I think it has an important bearing on the matter.  The value of the cost of living index depends entirely upon the degree to which the groups of commodities upon which it is based are truly representative of the actual living conditions in the country.  Early attempts at compiling an index of this sort were based on comparatively few commodities of ordinary consumption&mdash;mainly food, heating and lighting.  Afterwards it was found that these were unsatisfactory, and the index was widened to cover furniture, housing, clothing, and in some countries, taxation.  Difficulties arose in connection with the computation of every one of these, but they arose particularly in connection with the computation of the cost of housing, and because of the wide <Col N="158" /> variation in the cost of housing throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, the method which was adopted in order to fix the proper loading for that item in the index was, I think, entirely unreliable. It was unreliable in view of the fact that civil servants are subject to transfer from place to place, that in many cases they are unable to make a permanent home, and that in very few cases are they able to live in houses which were governed by the Mortgage and Rent Restrictions Act. In many cases they are compelled to pay for their houses more than the standard rent, with the necessary increases permitted by that Act.  Therefore, while it may be true to say that, so far as the general mass of industrial workers in Ireland are concerned throughout the towns in Ireland, the loading for the commodity, rent, to put it that way, was fairly accurate; nevertheless that loading had absolutely no relation to the conditions under which civil servants have to secure houses.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is one other factor that I think the House ought to bear in mind when discussing this motion&mdash;and we are now discussing the reliability of the present cost of living index&mdash;and that is that in selecting commodities for the groups and determining their separate loading great difficulties are created by reason of the fact that consumption relative to the commodities is not the same for all sections of the community, and not the same for all individuals in any section or class.  For instance, industrial workers generally spend a larger proportion of their earnings on food and a smaller proportion on miscellaneous items, such as education, travelling, housing, insurance, medical and dental advice, than do other classes, such as clerical workers, and the importance of that arises from the fact, according to the report of the Committee on this question, that the budgets which form the basis of the index were received from a varied class of households.  That will be seen from the following list: Labourers, fishermen, messengers, servants, pilots, barmen, building contractors, carpenters, motor drivers. <Col N="159" /> The only class in the community from whom the attempt to secure a representative household budget was not made appears to have been civil servants, to whom the cost of living index <Col N="160" /> is applied in full force and rigour.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
