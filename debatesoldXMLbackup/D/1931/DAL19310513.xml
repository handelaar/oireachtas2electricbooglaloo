      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) for Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Census of Production, 1929, the latest year for which a census was taken, there were four tanneries at work in the Free State.  The number of persons, including proprietors working in the business, clerical and wage-earning staffs, was 53, and the number of hides tanned in these factories was 9,730. Information is not available as to the numbers that were Irish hides and those that were foreign hides.  Only <Col N="1100" /> the quantity in cwts., and not the number, of hides imported into the Free State are available.  In the year 1930, 3,676 cwts. of raw hides and skins were imported; they practically all came from Great Britain.  39,826 cwts. of tanned hides and skins were imported in the same year.  In 1930 there were imported from Great Britain into the Port of Limerick raw hides amounting to 2,533 cwts.  It is not possible to say how much of this was English market hides and skins.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of holding any inquiry into the Shannon Fisheries.  The Electricity Supply Board in operating the Shannon Works will, so far as is consistent with the maintenance of the power supply, take steps to minimise flooding, but I have no functions which could lead to my holding an inquiry into such a <Col N="1101" /> matter as the relief of flooding from the Shannon and its tributaries.

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has got perhaps greater responsibility in connection with matters of finance and its Budget than most other Governments on account of its lengthy term of administration.  It is possible in that case to make examination of the various years back to 1922-3, and take an aggregate figure in connection with those matters.  It would appear from statements in the House and outside that the public in certain cases are being led to believe that the Budgets have not been balanced over those years.  It would, of course, relieve the time of the House to a very considerable <Col N="1111" /> extent and shorten my speech if it were accepted that they were balanced.  However, as it is not accepted we had better take this opportunity of correcting any misapprehension that might exist in people's minds in connection with that matter. I mentioned on the last day that the dead-weight debt amounted to about fifteen and a quarter millions.  The Minister for Finance gave the exact figures.  He distinguished as between the dead-weight debt, the gross liabilities of the State and the various items which he had set out in order to show the assets and the balance between these left the sum of fifteen and a quarter millions that has been mentioned. The question is, what were abnormal items over a series of years back to 1922-3?  The first item is the excess on the Army Vote, from 1922-3 to 1928-9, of over one and a half millions per annum.  In taking a figure of that kind it must be borne in mind that the figure in the first year, if it were not for the circumstances of the period, would have been relatively smaller than one and a half millions. It is a fair figure to take.  The sum there altogether is about £20,000,000. The cost in connection with commandeered premises amounts to £360,000 odd, that for compensation for property losses £1,230,000, compensation stock £1,500,000, and personal injuries £760,000, giving a total of about £21,000, or £22,000 short of £35,000,000. The difference between fifteen and a quarter millions and that sum, together with other receipts, has been met out of taxation.  That is the case in connection with the balancing of the Budget over that series of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing has been fairly obvious not alone in connection with this Budget, but with previous ones&mdash;namely, it has been discussed by the Opposition after the manner and style of criticism of a British Budget.  Whether that is an advisable procedure on the part of those who claim Gaelic culture is a matter for themselves.  They can examine their political consciences on that.  The usual procedure takes place in connection with the various <Col N="1112" /> items that are set out as being suitable items for the imposition of extra taxation. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned in the last couple of months a petrol tax.  As if to show the very catholic tastes of their party, some members opposite criticised that as being likely to be a burden on agriculture. They took the extraordinary figure&mdash;their Leader took it on the last day&mdash;in estimating the cost in the average small farmer's household as from 15/- to 30/- a year.  He has apparently benefited to some extent by the discussion which took place here, as on Sunday last he limited himself to 10/- in respect of that service, but his very worthy lieutenant took a larger figure&mdash;namely, 15/-.  If that happened over here we would be told that there was a crisis in the Government. Some Deputy put down a question to-day for the purpose of ascertaining what proportion of imported sugar was used for manufacturing purposes. My information on the subject from a fairly reliable authority is that about one-sixth of the total consumption is used for manufacturing purposes.  We would therefore have to take one-sixth of the £315,000, which the Minister estimated, and that would amount to a little over £50,000, leaving a sum of £265,000 to be raised this year.  Assuming that the agricultural population forms half of the entire population the sum levied off agriculture for this purpose would be about £130,000 for the coming year.  There would, of course, naturally fall on agriculture some of the increased tax on petrol.  Assuming that it was about 20 per cent. the balance in favour of this tax towards agriculture is very considerable.  On the last day Deputy de Valera stated that I had mentioned a sum of £1,000,000.  Deputy Lemass permitted himself the same sort of liberty.  I have no recollection of ever having mentioned such a sum.  Deputy de Valera said he believed he read it.  I hope it was not after dinner that he thought he read it.  I never read it myself.  I never mentioned such a figure, and it exists only in the imagination of the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. He writes as a rule very correctly. The statement was made that I committed the Government to a sum of £1,000,000.  I did not.  No sum was mentioned.  The discussion in connection with the Budget ranged to some extent round the question of direct and indirect taxation.  One of the weaknesses of the various speakers of the Opposition in this connection, is the prejudice with which they set out to attack or criticise a particular section of the community.  It would appear that they wished to convey the impression here that if there were enemies of the State in this country, they were the people who were paying income tax.  The number of persons paying income tax in this country is not as high a percentage of the population as it is in other countries.  It falls very largely upon manufacturers, business people and so on.  Whether they consider that business should bear such a burden or not, Opposition Deputies do not tell us.  I do not suppose they will tell anyone.  Speaking to the manufacturer they will say: &ldquo;We are only speaking for political advantage; we have to keep our eyes on the people outside.  We do not intend to impose any further burdens if we do get power.&rdquo;  That is not the way to do business.  The main question here is: Is there an unequal portion of the taxation levied, taken from those who are unable to bear it? That is the real question.  In 1922-23 the taxation per head of the population amounted to £8 14s., in 1923-24 it amounted to £8 10s. 4d., in 1924-25 it amounted to £7 16s. 4d., in 1925-26 it amounted to £7 5s. 4d., in 1926-27 it amounted to £7 1s. 10d., in 1927-28 it amounted to £6 17s. 2d., in 1928-29 it amounted to £7 0s. 6d., in 1929-30 it amounted to £6 18s. 7d. and last year to £7 1s. 4d.  On the basis of the Estimates for this year, it will be £7 2s. 9d.  In 1922-23 the percentage <Col N="1114" /> of indirect taxation was 72 per cent. It has been gradually decreasing and the estimate for this year is about 68 per cent.  There is a difference there of 4 per cent.  In other words while Deputies opposite might claim that the privileged class in this country, manufacturers, businessmen and so on, have escaped their burden, the fact is that they were bearing more than their burden in 1922-23.  While it would appear that the taxation in respect of large incomes was much heavier then than now, it must be borne in mind that the 68 per cent and the £7 2s. 9d., now includes a sum of £1,350,000, £600,000 of which was imposed in 1926 and three quarters of a million this year for relief of another service very much akin to a national service. That is local taxation.  It is not extra taxation in the sense that it is an extra imposition.  It is an imposition upon the central taxation in relief of local taxation.  To that extent allowance must be made in comparing the taxation per head of the population back to 1925-26 with any figure from 1922-23 up to 1924-25 and including that year.</P>
      <P>In connection with the question of indirect taxation, it must be borne in mind that a considerable number of the taxes imposed were taxes which fell proportionately heavier on the class of the community better able to bear it than on those more lightly taxed.  Take a case in point.  A man with an income of, say, seven or eight hundred a year buys a motor-car for £200.  The tax on that is very much less than on a car costing five or six hundred pounds purchased by a man with £2,000 a year.  Although it is called indirect taxation, it is very much akin to a direct tax.  The same applies to other commodities.  The tax on wearing apparel and other things falls very much more heavily on those who are better able to pay than on the poorer classes of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government policy has been designed during those years to fix, as far as their judgment and their wisdom might allow them, the burden of taxation on those capable of bearing it.  In that connection the taxation on the agricultural community has been <Col N="1115" /> gradually lightened.  In this year it will be very considerably helped by reason of the extra grant which amounts to practically one-third of the rates falling on agricultural lands this year.  The sum in question, £750,000, has been criticised.  It must be borne in mind that in addition to that sum a sum of £350,000 has been given in relief of unemployment.  This £750,000 roughly works out at £30,000 per country.  It is a small sum to a party which concerns itself only with the mention of millions, but it is a very considerable sum to the persons concerned, and it is well received by the agricultural community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to make reference to the peculiar reception afforded, not alone to the Budget and to our finances this year, but every other year, and to the criticisms that fall from the Party opposite.  I have here an extract from a statement made by Deputy Lemass two or three years ago.  It is reported in the &ldquo;Waterford News&rdquo; in its issue dated 1st February, 1929.  The statement reads: &ldquo;In the last Budget £1,100,000 was imposed, and it was found impossible to collect £1,000,000 of that.&rdquo;  Of course, there is no truth in that statement.  &ldquo;In the coming Budget, in order to meet the deficit, the Government would have to impose about £3,000,000 extra taxation.  That would ruin the country and the Government would probably take the coward's way of throwing the burden of government on their opponents.&rdquo; The Deputy has no recollection of making that speech?  I say with great respect, and apart altogether from <Col N="1116" /> politics, how inadvisable it is to make statements of that kind.  If it were true it is the concern of Deputies opposite just as much as it is ours. There are certain things that ought to be removed from the arena of party polities.  One is doing damage to the good name and financial fabric of the State.  I give that advice now without intending to be offensive in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>The President could not be offensive if he wanted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I could show great form that way if I liked.  Let us remember that on this question of balancing the Budget this country is in a very happy position this year.  Within the last few weeks we have read in the Press that very well established countries have not been so successful.  We have only to think of a country across the water where great difficulty is being experienced in making things right.  In the United States there is a deficit, and in Germany, too, I think. In Italy, during the first months of the year, there was also a deficit.  That is the world situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be unusually complacent about it, but our position here is very fortunate.  It is God's providence that it has so happened.  Let us not do damage to that.  Let us accept it as a dispensation of Providence, be thankful for it, admit that it is true, and thank God for the good things He has sent us.  There is one rather personal matter that I would like to mention before I sit down.  It is that during the last seven or eight years, if there is one Minister more than another who has been criticised in connection with administration, it is the Minister for Finance.  He gets all the discredit for every imposition that has to be made.  Other Ministers perhaps derive some popularity either for themselves or their Departments in virtue of the money the Minister for Finance has to make available for them.  The Minister for Finance has the disadvantage of having to collect it, and as such gets more than his share of public odium.  I think it is due to him that after five, six or seven years' continuous balancing of the Budget he should be personally congratulated on <Col N="1117" /> the soundness of the administration of his Department, and for the real success he has attained in the office of Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I would give to the Deputies opposite one of the most remarkable examples that has occurred within the last few months in the world's history. His most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain has given that example.  On taking his departure from the country, he said, on being reminded that he was leaving his family behind, &ldquo;I am leaving them with good Spaniards.&rdquo; On the question of recognising the alternative Government that was set up, he said, &ldquo;I recognise that Government, that is the Government;&rdquo; and then again when there was a question of making a struggle or bowing to the will of the people, he adopted the wise way.  I recommend these statements not only to the Deputies opposite, but to other people in this country who, whether it is due to a lapse from ordinary wisdom or not, apparently have not yet got the conception of confidence in their fellow-countrymen that they ought to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The President reminded me, and I suppose other members of the House, in the speech that he has just made of a statement he made in 1922, one of the years to which he has just referred.  He made a fairly lengthy speech on that occasion, and in conclusion he said that, &ldquo;At least if I have contributed nothing to this serious debate, I have left the Dáil in better humour than I found it when I got up to speak.&rdquo;  In the same way, on this occasion, the President speaks and gets the Dáil into good humour.  He referred to a monarch who has just resigned his kingship, and quoted him as saying that, in resigning, he was bowing to the people's will.  I hope that the President and his Cabinet will bear that in mind, that if the people of this country wish to change the present form of Government, they also will bow to the people's will.  With regard to taxation, it seems to me that the idea of the Executive Council and the Minister for Finance is just to shift it from one form to another.  They make no <Col N="1118" /> suggestion as to being able to effect economies in expenditure, economies which would not need a change in the form of taxation from one commodity to another.  The President referred to a change in the form of taxation, from direct to indirect, and tried to argue that was giving relief when in fact it is not.  I am going to quote for the President and the members of the Executive Council the damage that continuous changing in the form of taxation is doing.  It is not so long since the &ldquo;talkie&rdquo; pictures came into being.  The result of that was that those engaged in the showing of pictures&mdash;picture-house owners&mdash;had at great expense to instal new plant, and in addition to make alterations in their premises to meet this new form of exhibiting pictures.  The new machinery they had to import bore a tariff duty of 33? per cent.  If the Minister for Finance looks up the returns for the last few years he will find that the Exchequer benefited handsomely by that particular change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new tax on the &ldquo;talkie&rdquo; pictures will, I am reliably informed by those connected with the trade, mean the closing down of a great many of these houses.  In saying that I am not arguing in favour of keeping open picture houses or that I agree with the closing down of them, but I give that case as an illustration of the difficulty there is in this country of getting down to stable conditions.  That branch of the trade had, at great expense, to transform its business in order to cope with the new improvements introduced. The Government benefited by the tax imposed on the importation of machinery.  Now they are going to impose a tax on films which, in the opinion of the people connected with the trade, is going to kill that particular business.  That is one illustration of the fact that there is no stability. The same applies to the tariffs the Government put on.  Any industry in the country which had a tradition behind it, and for which there was an agitation that it should get protection by means of a tariff, got no protection, so that in the end it was wiped out of existence.  In the case of two industries protection was given much in the <Col N="1119" /> same manner that a schoolmaster would give promotion to a child: so long as you behave yourself and do certain things we will keep the tariff there to protect you, but if you fail to do certain things the tariff will be taken off.  Any trade or industry will require more than five years' protection to nourish itself into strength.  Not until the Minister realises that there will have to be some stability about the moves he makes with regard to taxation, whether it be direct or indirect, can there be any hope for industry to get on its feet.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the 4d. on petrol, which we are told does not affect the very poor in the sense that it is the owners of cars that will have to pay more for their petrol.  But it will affect the poor that use buses as a means of transport and convenience when going to and from their work, because it is very unlikely that the bus owners are going to pay that extra tax and not put up fares.  If the bus proprietors have to pay higher taxation in the shape of the petrol tax, they will not continue to keep their fares at the same rate, and an increase in the rates of bus fares for people going to and from their work is going to be a big thing at the end of each week.  On the other hand, take a man who owns a car.  A business man who only uses his car going to and from his business, and moderately otherwise, will consume at least ten gallons of petrol a week.  In the consumption of ten gallons of petrol per week this 4d. per gallon extra tax will mean an extra imposition to him of something like £12 a year.  I can picture the outcry there would be if for every motor car an additional £12 of road tax per owner was imposed in this country.</P>

Fancy the feeling of any motor car owner who would be told that he would have to pay £8 13s. 4d. more per year in the shape of road tax.  I cannot quite understand why Ministers have not some vision with regard to this tax. Why does not the Minister for Finance say: &ldquo;We want to make those who can best afford this extra tax bear it; we do not want to impose any extra tax on those who can least afford to bear it and we do not want to kill any industry and especially a little industry which is developing on certain lines?&rdquo;  We all know that the bus transport industry is progressing in this country.  We can all see that. A lot of capital has been expended in building up road transport by bus.</P>

      <P>Local people have invested a lot of money in the building of bus bodies and putting them on the road for bus transport.  We have asked the Ministry for Industry and Commerce to bring in a traffic Bill if for nothing else but to eliminate wasteful competition.  If the Minister for Finance said that he was going to reduce the extra road tax on the buses to repay the Road Fund from the extra rates by way of taxation on petrol he would be putting no extra burden on those bus owners or if he said: &ldquo;We will regulate traffic so that the buses will not be competing with the railways and both suffering,&rdquo; then we would have some idea that there was going to be some stability and that bus transport was going to be allowed develop side by side with the existing traffic.  Instead of that he puts an extra tax upon the buses so that apart from competition they have to face what is going to exterminate <Col N="1121" /> all the capital sunk in the development of the business and it is going to be thrown aside and wasted.</P>
      <P>Now with regard to the halfpenny tax on sugar the President and the Executive Council decided to come to the relief of one section of the community for whom the relief is essential and necessary.  In order to do that he has taken the money necessary out of the pockets of another section of the community.  It is all very well saying that the agricultural community in the country must get this relief.  We all admit that, but what about the people in the cities like Dublin and Cork where you have a working community, great numbers of whom are not working?  The Minister said we were thinking about putting a tax on tea but we considered that tea was an essential commodity and one which could not bear the tax.  I tell the Minister so far as I am concerned that I consider sugar a greater essential than tea.  It affects far more people because it is a more essential portion of the diet of children, not to mind grown-ups, yet the Government impose this halfpenny tax on sugar which to the children of the country is an essential of their lives.</P>
      <P>Had the Ministry considered getting this relief for the agricultural community by other means than by obtaining it from the persons who are to get the relief in part and then from the rest of the community who are going to get no relief, it might have come to the conclusion that at least a proportion could have been got by other means, such as by means of saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President quoted a speech of Deputy Lemass which appeared in some Waterford paper some time ago. If I were to waste my time looking up speeches made by members of the Executive Council and members of the Government Party I could collect sheafs of speeches made by those people outside which would be very ridiculous.  The Minister for Finance went on one famous occasion to a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on the eve of the flotation of his second loan.  He outlined at that meeting how he was going to use the money and he told his audience what <Col N="1122" /> he would do.  If I brought up that speech now and the promises it contains it would be quite as ridiculous as anything that might be quoted by the President from Deputy Lemass. On the eve of the flotation of the second loan the Minister talked about the many houses that he was going to build, and about paying off the Shannon scheme and a lot of other ridiculous nonsense, none of which ever came to pass.</P>
    <P>The President talked about meeting the agricultural community who told him that they were satisfied with the new form of relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the whole of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but such opinion as he got he considered quite satisfactory. I suppose it was the agricultural community that met him in the fifty motor cars on the Kerry border&mdash; those small farmers in their motor cars that told him about it.  The President talked about the income tax and indirect taxation.  Does the President forget that industry does not suffer at all from the imposition in the shape of income tax, because that tax is only paid on profits, whereas in regard to indirect taxation people must pay whether they make a profit or not?  I was reading the President's speech yesterday, although I heard him on Friday.  He then stated that the reason he wished to speak was that he wanted a Press report for the week-end. Fancy the President of the Executive Council speaking on one of the most important items of the Budget telling us that he wanted a good Press report at the week-end.  I had hoped the President would be a person of so much importance that he would be given a good Press any time he spoke.  The sooner the Minister for Finance realises that the type of mind he wishes to express is changed the better for the country.  He said that the reason he had fixed upon sugar for a tax was that the price of sugar had fallen, and therefore it could best bear the extra tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say if a commodity happens to fall in price the people are entitled to get <Col N="1123" /> the benefit of the fall, and the Government are not entitled to keep the price up to meet their extravagant expenditure. Members of this Party have stated their point of view on all those things.  The Government should give us their reply, and should not base it on a garbled misrepresentation as given in the Press.  I do not attach any importance to Press reports, particularly in Dublin.  I have seen where the Press reported motions as having been passed in the Corporation when they were not passed, and vice-versa, when it suited them and suited the party they supported.  So far as reading extracts from the Press here is concerned, and saying these are ridiculous statements, I claim that the Government should judge the criticisms in the House and face up to them.  I hope the Minister, when he is meeting the trades that are going to be affected to the point almost of extinction by his new taxes, will look at their point of view and will see that the taxes will at least be stable and not changed from one week to another. The Minister should tell us when he will give us some information about the Economy Committee and the reductions which they are going to make.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has stated that the Budget has always been balanced. If I went through the financial statements for the last six or seven years, I could show the Minister several millions of abnormal revenue which were calculated as normal revenue. When the Minister talks of abnormal expenditure, he should also remember that there is such a thing as abnormal revenue.  When the Minister puts sales and other receipts into normal revenue, such as the proceeds of the National Land Bank or the assets of the Haulbowline Dockyard, he may balance his Budget, but if he takes these items out, he will realise that his Budget has never been balanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget was originally and wrongly described as a farmers' Budget.  If the farmers read the official reports of the speeches made in this House by the leaders of <Col N="1124" /> the Government Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, they would quite clearly see that there is no difference between the proposals and promises of the Government on the one hand, and of the Fianna Fáil Party on the other hand. The only difference we can see between the present Budget proposals of the Government and the previous proposals and promises of the Fianna Fáil Party is the difference between two different political sections in this House who propose to administer the same policy, and if you like, the difference between the Minister for Finance, who is finding £750,000 and the proposal of Deputy de Valera that he would find £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>So far as the allocation of the money is concerned, there is no difference between the present proposals of the Government and the proposals put to this House by Deputy de Valera on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is rather interesting to read extracts from some of the speeches of some of the leading members of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter.  President Cosgrave read an extract from the &ldquo;Waterford News&rdquo; of three years ago containing a statement made then by Deputy Lemass.  I am sure that Deputy Lemass will now realise that he is not the prophet that he thought he was at that time.  Deputy Lemass, speaking on the hillsides of Wicklow on Sunday last with his eye on the Kildare constituency, is reported as having made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If the Government grant were to be limited to £750,000, then it should be so allocated that the greater part of it would go to the men with the small farms.  The suggestion put forward in the Dáil by Fianna Fáil was that the men under £15 valuation should be completely de-rated, and that all others should get relief equivalent to the complete de-rating of the first £15 of their valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a suggestion which was made after he had read the addendum to the Minority Report of the De-Rating Commission.  Deputy de Valera, speaking on the same day in Carrick-on-Suir, when endeavouring to explain away the previous proposal which he put before this House, said: <Col N="1125" />&ldquo;Their proposal was to relieve every farmer of half the burden which he had to bear.&rdquo;  See the difference between Deputy Lemass at Baltinglass and Deputy de Valera at Carrick-on-Suir on the same day.  I would ask the farmers in County Wicklow and elsewhere to find out if they can what in reality is the position and policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers read these sentences in their context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It took Deputy Lemass nine years to find out good reasons as to why he would change his policy with regard to the Treaty; it only took him one month to change his policy on de-rating.  As I said, the things that really count so far as the farming community is concerned is the extent to which they are going to get relief from the present Budget proposals of the Government.  I am inclined to think that the manner in which this £750,000 is proposed to be allocated is likely to cause confusion in the minds of some of the people who are expecting relief.  The Minister in his statement said: &ldquo;The Government has decided that the new grant is to be allocated 50 per cent. on the old basis and as to the remaining 50 per cent on the basis of the population of the counties.&rdquo;  Are we to understand that it is based on the total population of the county or that there is a possibility of allocating that portion on the basis of the farming population of a particular county?  If the allocation was on the basis of the farming population of the county it would in my opinion give more relief to the people who need it most at present.  I would be glad to know from the Minister on what basis the allocation is being made in the second instance.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be far better if the Government could see their way to make that allocation on the number of farmers in a particular county.  I have been endeavouring to find out even on the basis the Minister has now stated the amount of money which should go to a particular county.  For instance, take Leix, <Col N="1126" /> where there are 8,692 occupiers of agricultural holdings.  According to the method of allocation proposed by the Minister in his Budget speech 88 occupiers of holdings in that county with a valuation over £200 will receive over £2,000 while 4,112 occupiers of holdings under £10 valuation will receive only the small sum of £1,107. That clearly proves the contention put forward by Deputy O'Connell on behalf of this Party on the motion moved by Deputy de Valera that on the present basis of allocation and also on the method proposed by Deputy de Valera large holders who are not so much in need of relief as the small holders will get most of the money.  I invite criticism of the figures if the Minister can criticise them as far as they apply to that county.  In that county there are 5,460 farmers out of which 2,246 have holdings consisting of less than 30 acres.  From personal experience of the conditions there&mdash; and I am sure that Deputies who represent similar constituencies will agree&mdash;I say that it is the small holders who are mostly in need of relief.  There is nothing in the Budget proposals of the present Government nor in the proposals of the Fianna Fáil Party that would bring these people anything in the nature of real relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the policy of the Government and taking into consideration the statements that were made by Ministers before the Budget was introduced, there was every reason to hope after the announcements made by the President and by the Minister for Finance that the policy of the Government presumably would be largely guided by the recommendations of the Majority Report.  What do we find? In his Budget speech the Minister for Finance has partly but with thanks turned down the recommendations contained in the Majority Report. He was sensible enough to realise that the majority included an unnecessarily large number of civil servants and that if their names were taken from those who signed the Majority Report in reality it would turn out to be a minority report.  The Government refused to adopt that Report <Col N="1127" /> after all these people had spent a considerable amount of time preparing it.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies, and in particular I think Deputy Allen, proceeded to throw a good deal of cold water on the recommendations of the majority of the De-rating Commission.  I would not be inclined to agree with them that the Report and recommendations should be entirely overlooked.  The Report suggested an extension of improved marketing conditions, particularly in the direction of grading and packing and in the standardising of produce.  They also recommended an extension of the provision of credit at a cheap rate.  These are things which Deputies should bear in mind, and which are very important to the farming industry.  As a case in point, if one wants to find support for their recommendations dealing with better marketing methods, it is only necessary to look at the present position of the dairying industry.  There is no more glaring case for setting up, if necessary by compulsion, a central marketing organisation for the purpose of protecting the interests of dairy farmers, and the only thing I am sorry for&mdash;and I speak on behalf of the Labour Party&mdash;is that the Minister for Agriculture did not take his courage in his hands and before the recent collapse of the Irish Associated Creameries, bring in legislation to compel every creamery to join a central marketing organisation.  That portion of the Majority Report does not go as far as I would like, but as far as it does go I think it should not be overlooked, and that attention should be paid to the recommendations.  They also recommended an extension of the provision of credit at a cheap rate.  I believe that without cheap money the farming community cannot build up their industry and cannot work the land to the best advantage.  The present depression is due to the fact that we have not cheap money, or, more correctly speaking, we have not proper credit facilities for the farming industry. I would like to know from the Minister for Finance whether he believes that the method of making <Col N="1128" /> money available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation meets that part of the recommendations in the Report of the De-rating Commission. I would not say that six per cent. is cheap money for the agricultural community, and from what I know of the working of the Agricultural Credit Corporation I believe the Act might be amended in order to provide money more freely for those who want it, and certainly the rate of interest should be lowered.  I would like to hear the views of Deputies interested in farming on this question.  Perhaps Deputy Heffernan would oblige by telling the House if he believes that that part of the Majority Report is met by the facilities presently provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Minority Report, which many people look upon in reality as the Majority Report of the Commission, what do we find?  We find them giving good reasons in the final recommendation for providing immediate relief to the extent of £1,200,000. They recommend that this sum could be met in approximately equal shares by the proceeds of a duty on imported petrol and an increase of the standard rate of income tax.  The first part of the recommendation has been only partially met, as the Government are only providing £750,000 instead of the £1,200,000 recommended.  It is also only partly met because the Government have only agreed to carry out the recommendations to the extent of proposing to put fourpence per gallon on petrol, and they refuse, without giving any good reason, to increase the standard rate of income tax.  The policy of the Government in refusing to increase the standard rate of income tax must really be judged by the people from the point of view of the wisdom of increasing it and thereby affecting only a few hundred thousand people or whether every citizen is hit by the imposition of a proposed tax of a halfpenny per pound on sugar.  In his Budget speech the Minister for Finance, referring to the reasons why the Government could not accept the recommendations in the Minority Report, seemed to think that an increase in the existing income tax rate would <Col N="1129" /> prevent the development of industry. I would be prepared to go so far as to say that certain new industries that have been set up and that are struggling for existence might be exempted from income tax, but that does not force a motion being brought in whereby the general community would have to carry the burden owing to the imposition of a tax of a halfpenny per pound on sugar.</P>
    <P>Looking at the effect of the tax on sugar one could gather from the speeches made by Deputy de Valera, by the President on Friday last and here again to-day, that there is a considerable difference of opinion as to the extent to which that tax will affect the general body of the people of the country, and, in particular, how it will affect the poorest section of the community. It is generally believed by those who have made a careful study of the Budget proposals that there will not be relief to any great extent, if at all, to the farming community who occupy holdings of a valuation under £10.  The tax of a 1/2d. per lb. on sugar will counteract any good effect that might otherwise come from the relief in rates as a result of the Minister's proposal. It is generally estimated that a family living in a holding of £10 valuation and under would receive a relief of 13/6 this year.  A family of five living in such a holding would pay on an average 15/- additional in sugar tax.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister for Finance furnish the House with some figures which could refute these statements made here repeatedly during the discussion on the Budget.  There is no doubt about it that a certain minimum quantity of sugar is consumed in the house of the average farmer, and the small farmer is really carrying the biggest burden, so far as the population is concerned.  That case is made by referring to the census population figures for a country like, say, Mayo, a county of small farmers with low valuations. Contrast that with a county like Meath, where you have an average valuation of £49.  If there is anything at all in the statements made, these would go to show that a farmer with a valuation of £10 or under gets no benefit, and is not likely to get any benefit as a result of the Budget proposals. <Col N="1130" /> That is a very serious thing for the country as a whole.  We have in this State at present 210,000 farmers with a valuation under £10.  That is 55 per cent. of the population of the whole State.</P>
    <P>I have heard many protests from the Fianna Fáil Benches, and I have read many of their speeches in the country protesting, and rightly so, against this unfair tax of 1/2d. per lb. on sugar.  I would ask the farming community and the population generally to judge as to the real value behind those protestations by the members of that Party both in the House and in the country. When it comes to a question of carrying their protests into effect in a matter of this kind, it all comes down to the strength of the arguments put forward here; to the strength in which that Party will go into the Lobby in support of their protest or proposal. What do we find in the case of the Fianna Fáil Party?  When the division was called in this House to protest against the imposition of this tax of 1/2d. per lb. on sugar, seventeen members of the Fianna Fáil Party were absent or refused to vote.  That is to say, one-third of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were absent.  I would like the small farmers of the country who have been listening to the eloquent speeches of the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party to inquire as to why the full membership of that Party were not here to vote in the division lobby against the imposition of that tax.</P>
    <P>One other matter referred to by the President in his speech on Friday and again to-day was the very favourable position of the Free State so far as borrowing in the money market of this State, or indeed in any part of the world, compared to the position which other and much longer established States enjoy.  He said that we were in the position of borrowing at a more favourable rate than some countries with a much more favourable tradition and much longer established.  That is quite true, but what is the use of the President getting up here and repeating his statement in parrot-like fashion and doing the same thing at all those State receptions which he holds throughout the country when he will <Col N="1131" /> not make use of the borrowing powers which we have for the purpose of promoting housing schemes and carrying out development schemes which would give useful employment to those people who are waiting for work?</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne, the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, will probably give the explanation which the President now refuses to give. There is no use in crying from the house-tops and telling the poor people, the unemployed, and people of that type the value of the borrowing powers of this State when the people who enjoy that borrowing power will not use it in the right direction or to proper advantage.  I want to refer to a matter affecting the application of the petrol tax, and I would like the Minister to say whether it is his intention to apply the tax in the manner in which it is being enforced at present? If my information is correct, I am given to understand that the powers which are now being used and which will be used until the Revenue Bill becomes law, are powers handed over under the Revenue Act of 1901, Section 7.  Under that particular Act, I understand that it is possible to impose duty upon various commodities which contain only a very small percentage of petrol content.  I understand that hundreds of consignments of paint, boot polish, weed killer, disinfectant, ink and turpentine and articles of that kind are at present held up at the ports in this State in view of the fact that the people to whom those articles are consigned refuse to pay the excessive minimum duty demanded by the Customs authorities under the terms of the Act referred to.  It seems ridiculous that a small consignment of boot polish or a can of turpentine or varnish is held up simply because the parties concerned refuse to pay this very excessive tax.  Some of these parties are very poor people, some of them are painters who are depending on these articles for a living, and because they will not pay the minimum duty of 2s. 6d. demanded by the Revenue authorities at present, their business is inconvenienced.  The demand of 2s. 6d. really represents the <Col N="1132" /> equivalent of a tax of 4d. per gallon upon 8 gallons of petrol.  It is simply ridiculous to impose a minimum duty of that sort, especially when some of these consignments, not very valuable, would not contain more than a quarter gallon of petrol.  I would like if the Minister would look into the matter, and let the House know whether it is possible for him to say that the tax on petrol in reality was intended for the purpose of revenue on petrol, and not for taxing these very small consignments which contain a small percentage of petrol or turpentine, or whatever it may be.  At any rate, if it is intended to charge this duty upon particular articles such as I have referred to, the minimum rate should be considerably lower than what it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I would also like to bring under the notice of the Minister.  That is the concession which he has given in his Budget proposals to relieve the entertainments tax on theatres.  I understand that as a result of the introduction of the talkie films into the cinemas in Dublin 300 musicians have lost their employment.  I was informed as late as 3 o'clock to-day that in the cinema theatres at present there is only one full-time musician employed. I would like the Minister to consider whether it would be possible to extend the concession now proposed to be given to the theatres, to the cinema houses who may in the future give employment to musicians as against the talkie films that are being so much used just now.  The professional musician has been absolutely wiped out in the City of Dublin as a result of the introduction of the talkies.  I think there is a case there for the consideration of the Minister.  It is of the same kind as the case to which he has already given sympathetic consideration. What I am stating applies to the cinema theatres of the city and the country as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> As regards the proposal to give £750,000 towards de-rating, I am sorry that the money is not being spent in a constructive way.  I agree with many other Deputies that the small farmer is being fooled.  I do not think he will say &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;  I have got every sympathy with the small farmer and the farming community in general. At the same time, there are other sections of the community for whom I have also got sympathy.  I would like to refer to the workmen in the cities and towns who very often have to pay one-third of their wages for the privilege of living in one room in a slum.  I am sorry that the Minister has not made any provision in his Budget for the relief of housing so as to get the people out of these slums.  There is one other little matter that I would like to speak to the Minister about. That is the duty on spirits.  The Minister I think said in his Budget speech that the revenue from spirits would be about £60,000 below his estimate. I do not know whether his estimate shows a decrease on the previous year or not, and if the Minister could at some time or other let me know what was the actual revenue derived from spirits, differentiating between home made spirits and imported spirits, for the years ended March, 1930, and 1931, I would be very much obliged.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing his Budget in 1928, my recollection is that he said if the decline in revenue from the liquor trade were to continue it would have disastrous effects, especially in regard to spirits for which relief seemed to be most urgent. The revenue from that source has decreased and will decrease unless the Minister makes some alteration in the duty.  I trust that he will recollect what he said in 1928, and take steps to adjust the duty, and thus safeguard one of our oldest industries and at the same time give the ordinary man the privilege of occasionally enjoying a glass of spirits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we introduced the million motion, and the reasons we gave for distributing it on a flat rate according to the rates paid, were that the Government were delaying any relief to agriculture.  We wanted to see relief given at once, and the reason why we voted against the Labour amendment was, as Deputy de Valera stated, that the Labour amendment could not be put into operation at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Ninety-two per cent. of it could not, because a Cumann na nGaedheal Government certainly would not agree to what would be a fair percentage in tillage and the rest of it.  They were going to plead all sorts of excuses for not putting it into operation.  If Deputy Davin would like to search his mind, or if he would look up column 2176 of the Debates of <Col N="1135" /> the 26th March, he would see that Deputy de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This motion of mine is not intended to be a substitute for a considered scheme of de-rating.  It is purely a temporary measure introduced to give timely assistance, because we are of opinion that immediate assistance is wanted.  It does not indicate, as far as we are concerned, the lines on which we would propose a de-rating scheme if the duty of proposing such a scheme devolved upon us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When concluding the debate on that motion, Deputy de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to make another point clear.  It is said that I did not point out where this money was to come from.  No, I did not.  Deputy O'Connell did not point out where this money was to come from.  He indicated that he did not want it to come by way of indirect taxation on the section of the community which is least able to bear it.  With that we agree, and if there was any proposition that it would put such a burden of indirect taxation on the section Deputy O'Connell wishes to protect, we would vote against it.&rdquo; (Col. 2306, Official Debates, 26th March.)</P>
      <P>There Deputy de Valera states first of all the reasons for which we introduced the motion, and secondly, he clearly shows that we would oppose any from of de-rating that would bear hardly on the small farmers.  The reason for introducing the million motion and putting it through at once on a flat rate was because any other system would have meant delay.  The Government would have seized upon any scheme that we might have brought forward, and said that the De-rating Commission would have brought in their report before it could be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Cosgrave worked himself up into a sort of religious fervour to day.  He always succeeds in doing that whenever he has something to cover up.  He always condemns anybody who decries, as he calls it, the good credit of the country.  He and the Minister <Col N="1136" /> for Finance like to get the country in their arms, so to speak, and say: &ldquo;Hit me now with the country in my arms.&rdquo;  The Government will have to realise that if they make a mess of things they are going to be criticised for so doing.  They set up a De-rating Commission one and a half years ago. They carefully picked the members of that Commission.  The majority of the Commission reported in favour of what is known as a grass policy, or as the Hogan policy.  They gave the farmers a lot of advice as to what they should do.  Their advice was that the farmers should carry on with the Government policy; they should engage in intensive farming, and that would be the best way to end their troubles.  The height of impudence was reached when these gentlemen, the most of whom draw their salaries out of public funds&mdash;and they are pretty substantial salaries, too&mdash;said: &ldquo;... but it must be recorded that it is in our view clearly desirable to induce and assist agriculturists to improve their position by their own efforts rather than encourage them to look to other sections of the community for direct monetary assistance.&rdquo;  There would be a great deal less need for de-rating or any other system of relief if some of the persons who signed that Majority Report could be induced to assist themselves rather than continue to look, as they are looking, to public funds for their salaries.</P>
    <P>The Ministers waited for the report signed by these gentlemen.  For the last two years, whenever any by-election was in the offing, they allowed Deputies like Deputy Connolly to mention a sum of two millions which the Government proposed to give for the relief of agriculture.  Before the last by-election in County Dublin there appeared in one of the papers here, after the correspondents had their usual weekly interview with the Minister for Finance, a statement to the effect that one million was, for certain, going to be given to agriculture. President Cosgrave accused us of telling lies when we said that he mentioned a sum of one million pounds. The million was mentioned by several Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies and <Col N="1137" /> by inspired political correspondents after an interview with the Minister for Finance.  There was no contradiction of it for a month or so after the Dublin by-election was over.  Then a report came out to the effect that nothing was going to be done for the farmers.  That was another inspired report from the same political correspondent. It was in those circumstances we introduced our million motion.  Whatever little benefit may accrue to some of the farmers from this grant of £750,000, it will certainly be due to the pressure brought to bear by Opposition Parties upon the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke against de-rating. I would like to make some reference to the method by which it is proposed to raise this £750,000.  It is well known that the majority of the Ministers are against any relief for agriculture.  They are placing their whole hopes for the future prosperity of the country on getting a few foreigners with some dividends to come here.  They are encouraging a few tourists and they are turning the population of the country into lackeys to serve these people.  Undoubtedly, this scheme outlined by the Minister to raise £750,000 by taking it from large numbers of people who are least able to afford it, is going to disgust the whole country with giving relief for agriculture.  It is not de-rating; they are not instituting any scheme of de-rating. The 210,000 small farmers who are going to get 7.9 of the relief grant, about £90,000, will have very little to thank the Government for when they get relief to the extent of only 8s. 5d. per head.</P>
    <P>President Cosgrave tried to make light of the amount the small farmers are going to pay.  I would like the Minister to give his estimate of what the small farmer under £10 or £15 valuation is going to pay in the way of sugar tax, and also what proportion of the petrol tax he assumes the small farmer will have to pay in the coming year.  The Government should have made those calculations before they announced any tax.  I hope the Minister for Finance will have the figures when he is concluding this debate.  I <Col N="1138" /> think the estimates made by Fianna Fáil, placing the figure at 10s. or 15s., are about correct.  If the average small farmer with five in family, has to pay 10s. extra each year for sugar, it will not be much benefit to him to receive only 8s. 5d. by way of relief. President Cosgrave spoke on the first day about Fianna Fáil throttling the farmers in order to get the land annuities out of them.  At the present time the Government are throttling the farmers and getting the land annuities out of them in order to send them to England.  They are also screwing taxes out of them in order to pay the expense of sending the land annuities to England.  They are throttling the people of the country in order to raise rates and taxes which will go to pay the salaries of all the friends of the Government&mdash;the people they have shoved into the different offices.</P>
    <P>The farmer has reason to grumble under the conditions that now exist. The farmer would not have much reason to grumble if the people who owe land annuities were forced to pay them into a central fund and if the total amount so collected were devoted to relieving taxation and particularly if at least two millions of it were devoted to the de-rating of agricultural land.  I hope that the Minister when concluding will give us the figure I have asked for, namely, the proportion of the sugar tax which the small farmer will have to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to take part in this discussion but for the fact that since the debate opened it has been practically monopolised by Deputies from Dublin, Cork, and the South generally.  Another factor which prompts me to speak is the extraordinary silence on the part of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies from Donegal.  Naturally I expected that they would take part in the debate to justify to their constituents their action in walking into the division Lobby and voting in favour of the imposition on their constituents of an additional halfpenny per pound on sugar.  Before going into details as to how the Budget will affect Donegal there are a number of items touched <Col N="1139" /> on by the Minister which I would like to dwell upon.  I believe that the Budget statement read by the Minister for Finance was remarkable for two things.  In the first place it was remarkable for certain proposals which it contained and, in the second place, I think it was remarkable because of the matters with which it did not deal, matters connected with the improvement of social services.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to express my deep disappointment and the disappointment of the Labour Party at the absence of any proposals on the part of the Government to improve the social services in the Saorstát. One would have thought, and I certainly hoped that when the Budget was being introduced the Minister for Finance would have outlined the Government proposals in regard to that very important question, the provision of pensions for widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although that question is being examined by Government Departments for the last two years no official pronouncement has been made in regard to it, consequently the widows and orphans in the Saorstát are at a disadvantage compared with those in Great Britain and the Six Counties. Another question with which I believe the Minister should have dealt is that of housing.  It is recognised that so far as the rural portions of County Donegal are concerned there is great necessity for the erection of additional labourers' cottages.  One would have thought that the Minister would have outlined his policy and let the House and the country know what the Government propose to do in regard to building additional labourers' cottages, to be let at rents which the slender purses of our labourers could afford to pay.  Previous speakers referred to the Budget as &ldquo;a rich man's Budget.&rdquo;  I believe that that designation was correctly applied to it.  If we take the question of the remission of the tax on racecourse betting we find that the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;I propose to insert in the forthcoming Finance Bill a section remitting the tax on racecourse betting.&rdquo;  I do not know what <Col N="1140" /> prompted the Minister to remit that tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Shaw is more interested in racing and race-horses than Deputy Anthony or any other Deputy here.  It may be asserted by the Minister, or even by Deputy Shaw, that the remission of the tax will be an incentive to the horse-breeding industry and that it is going to improve that industry, but the Minister stated that although he was going to give a remission of the tax on racecourse betting he was without hope of any important direct results.  No doubt the book-making fraternity desire relief, but I believe that they are sufficiently sportsmanlike not to want that relief at the expense of poor people who, in order to help in the remission of that tax, will have to pay an additional halfpenny per pound for their sugar.  Dealing with the question of dog-racing, the Minister said that he had not gone to the dogs.  While he may not have gone to the dogs, I think there is no doubt that he succumbed to the bookmaking fraternity in regard to this particular question.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another reason why this Budget should be designated as a rich man's Budget is the statement of the Minister in regard to the question of the reduction of capital duty.  He said that as a result of representations made to him by the Chambers of Commerce he had decided that the capital duty payable by companies on their formation be reduced from £1 per cent. to 5/- per cent.  That represents a financial loss to the State of £5,000. Apparently again the Minister or his Department succumbed to these wealthy magnates who compose the Chambers of Commerce, but unfortunately he did not succumb to the representations made by the agricultural workers for the building of additional labourers' cottages.  The question is, who is going to pay for the £5,000 which is going to be lost to the State as a result of the reduction of capital <Col N="1141" /> duty?  It is the labourers, the small farmers, the fishermen, the agricultural workers, and the town workers.</P>
      <P>One of the worst aspects of the Budget, in the opinion of the Labour Party, is the proposal to levy an additional duty of a halfpenny per pound on sugar.  As a result of that tax the Exchequer, according to the Minister, is going to benefit to the extent of £315,000 per year.  As I said in my opening remarks, I was somewhat surprised at the silence of the Government back-benchers who voted in favour of this tax.  They did not attempt to justify their attitude, possibly because they could not do so.  It may be said that this additional duty on sugar will not have a big effect generally on the people.  I admit that it will not have a big effect on comparatively wealthy men, but it will have a big effect on the small farmer, the farm labourer, the fishermen and the under-paid worker in the town.  It is recognised that sugar is a valuable food asset.  The tax will mean that the poor will either have to purchase less sugar or do without some other necessary commodity.  It is most unfair of the Government to levy this duty, because it really is an attack on the most helpless class of the community, the poorer sections of our people.  We have been told by the President and other speakers that certain proposals have been put forward in the Budget for the relief of agriculture, but when one analyses them, one is astonished to hear the argument seriously advanced that these proposals are going to be of any benefit to the small farmer.  In a frantic endeavour to make the Cumann na nGaedheal barometer rise, it is true that the Government have allocated a sum of £750,000 for the relief of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to recall to the minds of Deputies the fact, as Deputy Aiken pointed out, that a few weeks ago a motion was moved asking this House to agree to a grant of £1,000,000 for the immediate relief of agriculture.  We find that the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, the Independent Deputies and last, but by no means least, the <Col N="1142" /> so-called Farmers' Party Deputies voted against it.  What prompted the so-called Farmers' Party to vote against the grant of £1,000,000 for the immediate relief of the agricultural community is absolutely beyond me. I suppose that those so-called Farmers' Deputies have been told by the Government in the words of Jimmy O'Dea &ldquo;Leave it to us.&rdquo;  Yes, leave it to us and we will fix the thing up for you! They have fixed it now to such an extent that as a result of the action of the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, the Independent Deputies and the so-called Farmers' Party Deputies on that occasion, the farming community and especially the small farmers will be at the loss of the sum of £250,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the manner in which this £750,000 is going to affect the agricultural community in thickly populated and congested districts such as County Donegal, according to figures which I propose to give and which I challenge the Minister for Finance or any other Deputy to refute. I propose to point out that, instead of being a benefit to small farmers the proposal contained in the Budget will act detrimentally against the interests of small farmers in Donegal and other congested areas.  I would even go further and say that under the proposals made in the Budget practically no small farmer will benefit.  I do not think I could give a better illustration than to quote some figures as far as Donegal is concerned. Before doing so I might say these figures were compiled by Government Departments.  The number of persons in rural houses in Donegal according to the statistics is 146,552. The number of houses in rural areas in Donegal is 30,893 which makes an average of 4.74 persons per house.</P>
    <P>The share of the grant coming to Donegal according to the statement made by the President to-day would be £30,000 but according to the figures which I have compiled that share would be approximately £34,000.  The cost of the additional sugar duty to rural residents in Co. Donegal will be approximately £21,096 which leaves a <Col N="1143" /> balance to credit of Donegal under the Minister's Budget of £13,000.  Out of the 26,896 holdings in Donegal, 80 per cent. of them or 19,177 of them do not exceed £7 valuation.  The estimated remission as far as that county is concerned under the Budget proposals will work out at 2/7 in the £ which would mean that a farmer of £5 valuation will get the benefit of 12/11 per year.  While that is so, the person with such a holding will be obliged to pay 15/- additional for his sugar.  Where then do the benefits of the proposal contained in the Minister's Budget come in?  Take the small farmer whose valuation is £2 10s.  He is going to benefit by the Minister's proposals by 6/6 per annum but if he has a family of five he is going to pay 15/- more for his sugar.</P>
    <P>In County Donegal there are 24,548 holdings with a valuation not exceeding £20.  They will receive for remission of rates £15,500 or 12/3d. each. In County Donegal there are 701 persons with valuations exceeding £50 each.  They will receive under the Minister's proposals £8,960 or £12 15s. each.  That means that while the small farmer with the £5 valuation is going to receive approximately 12/11d. he will have to pay 15/- additional for the sugar he uses, whereas, the larger farmer with the valuation in excess of £50 will receive £12 15s. I do not think that even this £12 15s. is enough for even the large farmer. Not alone the small farmer but the large farmer has been very badly treated in County Donegal.  Deputies are aware that Donegal is surrounded by Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh. Let us compare for one moment the position obtaining in these counties as regards the farming community as compared with the position obtaining in Donegal or any other county in the Saorstát.  According to a statement made in the Six County Parliament on the 20th October, 1930, under the Local Government Rating and Finance Act for the year 1930-31, the farming community in Co.  Antrim will receive a sum of £197,854, in County Armagh they will receive £108,338, in County Down they will receive £202,648, in <Col N="1144" /> County Fermanagh £79,936, in County Derry £134,445 and in County Tyrone £179,617 while the farmers in Donegal, large and small put together, will only receive approximately after the deduction that is made for the tax on sugar £13,000.  How does that compare with the position of the farmers in Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh?</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Minister for Agriculture spoke in Ballybofey, Donegal, and in the course of his remarks he referred to the question of the unity of Ireland.  He said that he believed there would be unity in this country when the material conditions in the Free State were as good as elsewhere. Did he tell the people in Donegal that the farmers in Derry, Tyrone or Fermanagh, which surround Donegal, were in a much better position than were the farmers in Donegal, due to the fact that the Government, in which he was Minister for Agriculture, was withholding benefits from Donegal which had been given to the other places to which I have referred?  I believe that any benefits that are going to accrue to the farming community as a result of the Minister's proposals will only accrue to any appreciable extent to the grass ranchers in Tipperary, Meath and Limerick.  I notice that on Sunday last the Minister for Finance addressed a meeting in his own constituency (Monaghan), and that the Chairman of it used some very straight talk to the Minister. Senator Toal, who, I understand, was the Chairman of the meeting, in the course of his remarks dealing with the Minister's Budget, is reported in the Press as having stated:</P>
    <P>Senator Toal, who presided, spoke of the advantages of de-rating and said that as Mr. Blythe put a tax on sugar the benefit of de-rating would therefore be lost to the people who are least able to bear taxation.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Chairman of the meeting which the Minister addressed in his own constituency realised that any benefits that were going to be derived as a result of the so-called relief to be given to the farmers would be nullified by the Minister's proposal to tax sugar.  I now turn to the Report of the De-rating Commission, where we find it stated on page 69:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> It must obviously be a cardinal feature of any scheme for the relief of the agriculturist by de-rating agricultural land and farm buildings that the taxation imposed to provide the cost of relief should not prove as burdensome to him as the rates from which he is to be relieved. Otherwise, the relief would be quite illusory.</P>
    <P>Even that statement of the Commission proved the contention that I have made, that as far as the small farmers are concerned they are going to be put in a worse position than they were in prior to these proposals being made.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, said: &ldquo;Our present economic position is good,&rdquo; while the President in his speech to-day said that &ldquo;the country is in a very happy position.&rdquo;  I wish that either the President or the Minister for Finance would take a trip to the congested areas of Donegal and see the poverty that exists amongst the small farmers there. If they did so, they might possibly change their minds.  No doubt for some time past they had been fraternising with comparatively wealthy people, such as &ldquo;Lord Do Little&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lady Do Less&rdquo; at Cumann na nGaedheal banquets, and when they say that the country is in a happy position, that the economic conditions are good, I can state without fear of contradiction that that is not true so far as the small farmer, the fishermen and the unemployed people of County Donegal are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by the Minister that, as far as this country is concerned, there is no economic crisis.  I say there is, and that it has been there ever since the Government took up office.  There is a financial crisis in existence so far as the poor people of this country are concerned, the people who, I hoped and believed, would have got some relief as a result of the Budget.  As far as the Minister's Budget statement goes, it has come as a disappointment not alone to the town and city dwellers but as a staggering blow to the farming community, and more especially to the small farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the introduction last week of the Budget by <Col N="1146" /> the Minister for Finance, we had an atmosphere created throughout the country by Ministers and Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies which misled the farmers and the agricultural community generally into the belief that something definite and beneficial for them was going to be done in the Budget.  Prior to that we had an atmosphere created by the Government Party in connection with the De-Rating Commission.  During the past two years the Minister for Agriculture mentioned, time and again at meetings throughout the country, that he could not open his mouth so far as de-rating was concerned.  All he could say was: &ldquo;We have appointed a Commission of experts to go into that question and I am not at liberty to talk about it until they have dealt with it.  They are considering their report, which is going to be a very complete one, as they have gone into all the details.  When the report of the Commission is put before us we will consider it and do what is best according to the report for the farming community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council apparently could not think for itself during the two years that the Commission was sitting.  The Commission was composed of men with a magic wand.  We were led to believe that the Commission was going to bring in such a favourable report that an immediate improvement would be brought about in farming conditions.  But anyone who has read the Report cannot enthuse very much over it.  I am surprised that Deputies who have practical experience of farming, and of the difficulties the farmer has to contend with, should get up in this House, or in any part of the country and compliment the members of that Commission on, as they allege, the very excellent report they have turned out. In my opinion, the report is not a credit to the members of the Commission. From end to end of it there is no definite solution suggested by the members of the Commission for the improvement of agricultural conditions. The members of that Commission simply repeat a lot of platitudes. What all the members of the Commission are agreed upon is that <Col N="1147" /> de-rating would be bad for the farmer, that unless you put on the farmer, and keep on his shoulders, the burdens of the rest of the community he is going to become lazy; he is not going to produce more, but is going to be more or less a drag on the State. The idea that one gets from reading the Majority Report of the Commission is that if the burden of taxation was lightened on the farmer he would become careless, that he would become easy-going in his methods of farming if more money was put into his pocket through de-rating.  That is the idea you get running through the report from beginning to end.</P>
    <P>I, for one, cannot agree that the report is a credit to the members of the Commission.  They were able men and had at their disposal all the evidence that could be made available as regards farming, the production and marketing of agricultural produce and so on.  They got evidence from practical farmers, and had at their disposal other sources of information. In view of all that, I do not think that the report is a great credit to them.  To my mind, if you put into a desk in any school a school-boy in the sixth or the seventh standard and asked him to write an essay on the difficulties of farming on the one hand, and the possibilities of successful farming on the other he would write as practical, and much nearer to the point, a report on the conditions of farming in this country as is to be found in the report of this Commission. The one idea which the members of the Commission who signed the Majority Report seem to have at the back of their heads all the time, was that whatever else they could not do, there was one thing they must not do and that was issue a report which would in any way embarrass the Government. They pooh-poohed the idea of giving the farmer relief in rates or that he would produce more if his taxation were lightened.</P>
    <P>In twelve or thirteen points, which they set out in the Report, they suggest methods by which the farmers of <Col N="1148" /> this country could work more, produce more, and make the State richer.  I will deal with two of these points.  The first is, &ldquo;encouragement of the best method of the feeding and management of livestock&rdquo;; the second is &ldquo;the promotion of poultry-keeping and the encouragement of the best methods of rearing and feeding poultry for egg production and table purposes.&rdquo;  These are the two main clauses in the Report that the Commission issued.  That is all that we have got from this Committee of experts, of supermen selected by the Government.  That is all they have been able to produce after all the evidence that was taken and the sources of information that they had at their disposal.  That is what they offer to the practical farmers of this country.  I say that they need not give instructions to the farmers down the country as to how they are to feed or produce livestock.  These men are quite capable of managing their own business.  They can do it without any advice from the Minister for Agriculture. There is no need either to give instruction to the housewives of the country as to how they are to raise poultry or produce eggs for marketing purposes.</P>
    <P>The idea of those who issued the Majority Report seems to be that farming must be done in a clocklike fashion.  I hold that the Commission went beyond its terms of reference, and that instead of dealing with these matters they might have turned to the question of considering how economies could be effected by eliminating waste in the Civil Service to which they belong.</P>
    <P>They might find if they went on to discuss in detail the Committee on Economy of which Deputy Heffernan was Chairman that investigations disclosed that the Service was made up of the most luxuriously paid body of loosely organised civil servants in the world. And if they wanted to eliminate waste, as they wanted to do in the case of the farmer, they would find a great deal of it to be eliminated from the Government service.  But they preferred instead, and with their usual red tape, to instruct the farmer as to how he <Col N="1149" /> should feed his livestock, keep his poultry, and market his eggs.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing in the whole report that can be commended, and there is no farmer in the whole country who could not have told the Government that one thing years ago, but they would give no heed to his advice, and that is where they state that one means of benefiting the &ldquo;agricultural industry would be the extension and provision of credit at a cheap rate.&rdquo;  That is the only one thing contained in the Majority Report that can be recommended.  All the rest can be put aside as a good deal of red tape trash.  There is no doubt that the report is disappointing to the people of the country, but it was not an embarrassment to the Government.  It was a god-send to the Government just before the Budget time, because the farmers were expecting something definite from the report on de-rating, either full de-rating or at any rate partial de-rating, and they were disappointed. And then when the farmers were in a state of uncertainty and chaos the Government comes in, and the problem that this Commission of supermen failed to solve with their magic wand the Executive Council, which is not composed of supermen but men with feet of clay and faces of brass, found a solution, and the sum of £750,000 was to be given to the farmer as a farmer, and was to be taken back from the farmer as a taxpayer.  If the Minister for Finance, in coming to his solution as to how agriculture could be assisted, fell into the error of the British tax-gatherer, and simply giving that relief of £750,000 had to rob Peter in order to pay Paul, it would not be very commendable. But the Minister for Finance is a wiser man than the old British tax-gatherer.  He did not rob Peter to pay Paul, but being an erstwhile advocate of the Irish language and a bilingual constitution, instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul he robbed Peter to pay Peadar instead, and so he gave to the farmer as a farmer and took from the farmer as a taxpayer.</P>
    <P>He went further.  As far as the small farmers are concerned he takes <Col N="1150" /> more back from them in the taxation on sugar alone than he gives in actual relief out of the £750,000.  I think Deputy Davin quoted figures to prove this here to-day.  The small farmer whose valuation was from £10 downwards comprises the big majority of the people working in this country.  They will only get on an average from 10/- to 14/- relief in taxation out of this grant.  And the same small farmer, with an average of from five to seven members in his household, will pay in sugar taxation an average of from 11/- to 16/- I have given a margin of from 10/- to 14/- in the relief that the small farmer will get, and from 11/- to 16/- in what he will have to pay in sugar. I have left the margin so wide because I think it is the fairest way to put it. There is one very definite thing, anyway, and that is, that the small farmer with a household of from five to seven members will pay actually more in sugar taxation than he will get in relief of rates.</P>
    <P>On the question of the sugar taxation, of course, it was interesting to know what was the President's point of view on that matter.  On Friday, in his little trashy speech, he attempted to tell us why the sugar taxation was imposed.  His excuse was that even with the halfpenny per lb. addition sugar would be still cheaper than it was two years ago.  That was rather an illuminating point of view from the President.  If that is to be followed out to its logical conclusion such articles of food as are necessary for the poorer people to use should be kept up on as high a level as they were years ago by extra taxation.  That would justify putting a tax on every other commodity of life which is reduced in price owing to production and would justify it being kept at a higher figure by taxation.  Even with the tax sugar is still going to be cheaper than it was two years ago, and that satisfies the President.</P>
    <P>He did not make any mention of the fact that the income tax is 1/6 lower to-day than it was a few years ago, and that not due to any world conditions either but due to the action of the President and the members of the Executive Council.  They deliberately reduced <Col N="1151" /> the income tax by 1/6 in the £ lower than it was a few years ago, and they deliberately increased the price of sugar to the poor simply because world conditions have favoured them to the extent that sugar was coming down. Why not if he makes that argument about sugar make it also about the income tax?  If he talks about sugar being still cheaper to the poor than it was two years ago he should take into account the fact that the rates in the County Mayo, even under the administration of the super Commissioner whom they have sent down to administer the affairs of the county, have increased by 3/11 for the past three years.  And part of that increase, amounting to 8d. in the £, was imposed by the Commissioner sent down by the President.  I would like the President of the Executive Council, when he comes to make his trashy little statement in the House for the purpose of rallying the weak members of his own Party, that he should consider other parts of the country beside the income tax payers in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the County Mayo under the Government scheme 13,364 holdings not exceeding £4 valuation will receive an aggregate share of the grant amounting to £7,100, which works out at 10/7 per holding.  7,639 holdings of a valuation exceeding £4 and not exceeding £7 will receive in the aggregate £8,800 or £1 3s. 0d. per holding. As against these two figures 12 landowners with holdings the valuation of which exceeds £300 will receive between them £1,310 or £109 3s. 4d. each; and 28 landowners with holdings exceeding £200 and not exceeding £300 in valuation will receive £1,420 or £50 14s. 0d. each.  The average area of the small holdings in Mayo which do not exceed £4 in valuation works out at just over 15 acres, while the average area of the holdings between £4 and £7 valuation is about 24 acres.</P>
    <P>The method in which he takes money out of one pocket of the farmer in order to put it into another by imposing a tax on sugar, is deplorable. <Col N="1152" /> There is also the very unfair method of distribution.  The farmer who is worse off, who has to keep a large family, such as the small farmer in Mayo, and who is hardest hit by emigration being stopped is the man who is hardest hit by extra taxation.  He has to cater for his family despite the obstacles put up by the Government, while the big farmer, who is not hit by the stoppage of emigration and who, as a rule, has a small family, is facilitated by the Minister in his Budget.</P>
    <P>You have the very questionable attitude of the Minister in remitting the tax on betting.  I would not mind the tax on racecourses being abolished, provided it would be some definite good for horse-breeding, but on the Minister's own admission it is going to do no good whatever to the horse trade or to the race meetings in this country.  The Minister in his statement dealing with the remission of the betting tax, said: &ldquo;I am quite satisfied that the tax did not do any serious direct injury to Irish racing, and that in itself it had only an inconsiderable psychological effect.&rdquo;  Those are the Minister's own words.  If it is not going to do any injury to horse racing why this remission of tax amounting to £25,000?  If any other members of the community came to the Minister and put up arguments about a certain tax being remitted, and if the Minister thought it was of no use, does anyone think he would remit it?  There is something sinister behind the Minister's attitude in this matter.  It is not that I object to the remission of this tax, if I thought it would do any good to horse breeding in this country, but the Minister says it will not.  It is quite all right to give relief to the farming community, and it is quite all right to put on extra taxes, but we find that for this £750,000 which is to be given to the farmers, the farmers have got to pay an additional price.  It is rather interesting from a Government point of view that when they want £300,000 extra in order to give this £750,000 to the farmers they must immediately go and tax the commodity which the poor use, sugar.  They could not provide the money except by extra taxation. <Col N="1153" /> But we find that the Government, in the last financial year, provided £216,000 for army officers in gratuities and salaries without extra taxation. Not alone that, but they provided £216,000 for army officers without coming to this House at all for the money. Now they have immediately to go and tax the farmers' breakfast table to provide £300,000.</P>
    <P>Here is an interesting sidelight on the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal. Not alone are they taxing the farmer for the relief they are giving him, but the farmer has to sacrifice his local authority.  Whatever little power the farmers or the agricultural community had in local councils, they have got to give up those powers.  Those councils have got to be scrapped.  They have to pay this as an additional price for the relief of the agricultural community. It was no surprise to us that the Government policy was to quench out the local authorities and prevent their having any voice in the taxation of this State or in running this country economically.  The Minister for Local Government has been doing that quite successfully for a long time, but not as successfully as the Government would wish.  He was leaving a bad odour behind him.  Now the Minister for Finance is going to quench out those local authorities and throw in at the same time the bribe of a little relief in rates.  I do not believe the country will accept that.  Members of this Party are not going to allow the Minister to pass off the bribe in that way. If local authorities are going to be abolished, if whatever little power farmers have is to be taken from them, it is not going to be taken without every possible opposition we can give in this House.</P>
    <P>There was one undignified remark in the Minister for Finance's statement. He referred to members of the local bodies as a pack of wind-bags.  It is quite all right for the Minister for Finance to say that.  If he were a wise man he would realise that some of those whom he calls &ldquo;windbags&rdquo; have come into his own Party from local bodies.  He would look at Deputy Sheehy, one of the local wind-bags down in Cork, and he would look at Deputy Davis, the ex-chairman <Col N="1154" /> of the Mayo County Council, who has come into his Party and is chairman of it.  I do not like those slighting remarks about wind-bags on country councils.  The members of the county councils might have their faults, but they have worked very hard and unselfishly.  They have worked without remuneration.  There was a time when the Minister for Finance and his Party depended very much on the wind-bags of the local councils.  It is adding insult to injury now to address them as a pack of wind-bags.  I think the Minister, in his closing statement, would be doing good to himself, his Party, and the country as a whole if he withdrew that statement.</P>
    <P>Of course we are asked to pay a tribute to the Minister for Finance because of the wonderful work done in balancing the Budget.  The President in his closing statement on Friday and again to-day paid that tribute and said that all of us, apart from politics, should be all good sheep for one day and go down on our knees to the Minister.  On Friday he said &ldquo;I should like to say, however, before closing now that Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Anthony and Deputy Nolan all paid a well-deserved tribute to the Minister for Finance in connection with his long and favourable record as Minister for Finance.  Deputy Redmond was the first to notice it and he has perhaps this advantage over Deputies opposite that he has had experience of two representative institutions.&rdquo;  As to Deputy O'Connell's, Deputy Anthony's or Deputy Nolan's opinion of Mr. Blythe we do not mind.  As to Deputy Redmond's opinion of Mr. Blythe or the President's opinion of Deputy Redmond we do not mind much either.</P>
    <P>There was a time in the recent history of this House when any statement low, mean, or scornful was not bad enough for the President to address to Deputy Redmond.  I read in the records of this House certain statements addressed by the President to Deputy Redmond not so many years ago.  Evidenty Deputy Redmond has distingushed himself sufficiently of late years to become an object of <Col N="1155" /> the President's admiration.  Because of Deputy Redmond's experience in two representative institutions his opinion is to be valued higher than the opinion of any other Deputy.  We present the Deputy and his opinions to the President.  I must say that the President is very often as much at error in his choice of company as he is mean in his choice of words. Deputy Nolan talked about the President of course and also about the Vice-President, who is Minister for Finance, and stated that if the Budget was introduced in any other Parliament there would be applause from every side of the House.  The Deputy remarked that the Minister had balanced his Budget, that there was no deficit, and that the country was not bankrupt.  Might I ask what did Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies expect?</P>
    <P>Have the members on the Front Benches and the Minister for Finance been taking these Deputies into their counsels during the past year, telling them that the country is going bankrupt, and that we were &ldquo;down and out,&rdquo; or was it that Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies were realising that since the Government took office they have succeeded in piling up a debt of two millions every year?  Is that what was troubling Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies?  Were they troubled because the Government, since they came into office, have handed over to England, in round figures, £40,000,000, or were they perturbed that that could not go on or that the country would go bankrupt? Were these the worries that so troubled Deputy Nolan and other Deputies that they were terribly surprised to find that the Minister for Finance, in introducing his Budget, has shown that the State is not yet gone bankrupt?  While our opinion of the Minister for Finance is not a good one, we realise that the country is not gone bankrupt, and that it is quite possible to introduce a Budget which is, to a certain extent, a balanced Budget, we realise that despite the financial bungling of <Col N="1156" /> the Minister for Finance the farmers through all these years have worked hard and have paid up.</P>
    <P>If this country is not bankrupt, if the Budget is balanced, and if our credit is good at home and abroad, that is due to the men who carried the burden of taxation, the farmers, the workers and the income tax payers, and it is not due to the Minister for Finance or to the policy of the Government. This country could not go bankrupt while there is in it such an industrious community.  The country could only go bankrupt if the farmers refused to do what the Minister for Agriculture asked them to do, to tighten their belts.  They tightened their belts and paid up every penny demanded of them.  The income tax producers also paid up when the thumb-screw was put on.  For those reasons the country did not go bankrupt. We pay no tribute to the Minister for Finance, but we pay tribute to the workers, the farmers and others. We should not pay tributes to those who do not deserve them and neglect those who do.  I think Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches should not be carried away with this Budget. They know as well as I do that whatever taxation is imposed, in the long run, is going to fall on the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>One other matter might be worthy of mention.  In last year's Budget the Minister enforced a tax of £10 on travelling shops.  There was a clamour amongst residents of towns a few years ago about this matter, and the Minister for Finance was urged to tax these travelling shops out of existence. As a result of that clamour a tax of £10 was imposed.  During the past year there are a greater number of travelling shops than ever on the road. That has proved that the people who carry on these travelling shops are making them pay despite the tax.  The amount of the tax is thus passed on to the consumer.  The Minister should take some cognisance of that.  It is the breakfast table of the poorest that is being taxed.  If the Minister wants <Col N="1157" /> to collect an easy tax it is all right to continue the present arrangement, but if he wants to take the extra burden off the poor he should either increase the £10 tax to an amount that will put these shops out of existence or remit it altogether.  The consumer is paying the present tax of £10, and that is an unfair burden.  There has been general disappointment at the Budget, and nothing that the President, or even Deputy J.J. Byrne can say in its favour is going to fool the people.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation.  I quoted the Minister for Finance, who described members of local bodies as windbags, and I instanced members of local bodies on the opposite benches, and asked if the Minister specially referred to them.  I did not call Deputies windbags, but if I had accidentally thought of the Deputy who has just spoken I might have done so.</P>

      <P>My opinion of the Deputy is not very high.  He is an inexperienced man, and he is presuming on his inexperience.  He has presumed to attack men in this House who are old enough to be his father, and who were in politics before he was born.  These attacks will only react on the Party sitting on the opposite benches.  Speaking on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, we have the greatest respect for the Chairman of our Party, Deputy Davis, and for the father of the House, Deputy T. Sheehy.  Anyone who listened to the speech of Deputy Clery could only come to one conclusion, that if there was an authority in the House on what constituted a windbag that authority rested in the person of Deputy Clery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clery told us here about the dead-weight debt of the country.  He told us about it being £15,000,000. He did not tell the House what caused <Col N="1158" /> that dead-weight debt.  He did not refer to the statement that the President made in his opening speech today when he dealt with the abnormal items in the Budget.  Will the Deputy deny that there would be no dead-weight debt only for the action of the Party to which he belongs?  They were responsible for £35,000,000 of a dead-weight debt.  That dead-weight debt is due to no other cause whatever but to the action of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Deputy without a single interruption, but when he is touched on the raw himself he cannot bear to listen to the facts.  We all know what Deputy Clery is.  He is one of the most scurrilous members of this House, and he is the most scurrilous Deputy on any public platform.  He is a man who is no acquisition whatever to his Party nor to the country.  Was there ever such nonsense uttered in the House as the nonsense to which we have just listened from Deputy Clery?  The Deputy told us that the Government was giving a grant of £750,000 to the farmers in relief of rates, but that they were taking it all back again by way of an indirect tax.  To quote his own words, &ldquo;It is quite all right for the Government to give £750,000 in relief of the farmers and for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to take it away again by way of taxation.&rdquo; The Deputy belongs, I understand, to the teaching profession, but I never knew of a boy at school who would say that deducting £265,000 from a grant of £750,000 given by the Government wiped out the £750,000 grant. Why will not the man talk common sense?  We are here to listen to commonsense and to talk commonsense and not nonsense.  That is what Deputy Clery has been talking for the past half-hour, and we on these benches were sick and weary sitting listening to him talking nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party has done it.  I do not want you to accept me as an authority on the question.  I will quote an authority that will be accepted by this House, despite the jeers of the Party on the opposite benches.  In the second interim report of the Banking Commission here is the statement that was made as to what had been done for the farmers in this country: &ldquo;In our opinion no country in the world, so far as we are aware, has made better provision for the farming community than the Government in the matter of direct assistance and indirect assistance to agriculture.&rdquo; That is a statement made by an authority that this House will accept before the authority of the Deputy who has just sat down.  If the Deputy looks at the Estimates for the coming year he will see what is revealed there.  I represent a city constituency, and I am aware that the Vote for Industry and Commerce in this year is £110,000.  That is the Vote <Col N="1160" /> which is dealing with matters which give employment to over 15,000 hands extra in the last few years.  What is being given to the agricultural community in the Estimates for this year? Over one-sixth of the available income of this State has gone to the relief of agriculture.  Here are the figures. Annual grants: £1,364,000 to the farming community; beet sugar subsidy, £162,000; forestry, £69,000; Land Commission, £697,000; Department of Agriculture, £596,000&mdash;making a grand total of £2,888,000 for the farming community in this country.  In addition to this £2,888,000 the Government are finding £750,000 this year in relief of rates, so that in this year the Government are finding the sum of £3,638,000 for relief for agriculture for the farming community.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the farming community are the largest contributors to taxes in this State; that they form 60 per cent. of the population of the country.  What, in fact, are the returns received from the agricultural community by way of taxation?  It may be news to Deputy Clery, who spilled this long, doleful story, this pitiful story, that the farmers contributed £8,000,000 and the rest of the community contributed the balance to the Exchequer.  This 60 per cent. of the population got by way of return practically £15,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as one who represents the City of Dublin, I stand wholly behind the Government on this Vote.  We in the cities and towns know very well the value of farming to this country. We know very well that if the agricultural community goes down the rest of the country goes down with it, but we in the cities get tired of listening to the long story that is being daily pitched by the Fianna Fáil Party. We are tired listening to their story, and especially from the particular point of view as to the distribution of the money that has been granted. The Government have taken two methods of distributing this grant; 50 per cent. in the usual way and 50 per cent. on the basis of population. I see men on the benches behind Deputy Clery who represent the agricultural community, men who know more <Col N="1161" /> about this question than he does, and these men really appreciate what the Government has done in passing this Vote.  If Deputy Clery were honest enough to admit the fact, he knows very well that any inequality in the distribution of this money that may arise is due entirely to the basis of taxation as it exists, and no matter what Party deals with de-rating, inequalities of distribution are bound to arise.</P>
    <P>We had a clear instance of this amongst the business community in Dublin.  When we required money to forward the interests of the city the money was raised upon the rateable valuation of the business men, and every man had to contribute according to the basis of his valuation. Some had contributed £50, and others £1.  What is the real logical basis upon which this money can be paid? The amount of rates for which a man is liable.  I suppose Deputy Clery would want to come down to the man with the £7 15s. valuation and say to him: &ldquo;We will give you £20,&rdquo; because there are people receiving £20 whose valuation is greater.  The Deputy referred to various places in the country and endeavoured to point out how ill-distributed this money will be when it is spent.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Clery represents Mayo.  Mayo has been specifically dealt with by Deputy O'Connell and it has been dealt with at great length by Deputy MacEntee. The strange thing about it is that everybody who deals with Mayo has a different sum as that which the farmer will receive.  Deputy MacEntee told us that the small occupiers would receive 22/3 and that the nabobs of Mayo would get £6 14s. 0d.  Deputy O'Connell told us that the small farmers would get 6/6.  I do not know which of them to believe.  Certainly both of them cannot be correct.  But there is one thing that stands out, and there is that the County of Mayo is going to get £55,000 solid cash and no empty promises, and the farmers of Mayo are too level-headed a people to refuse to accept that for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>We were told here by the Fianna <Col N="1162" /> Fáil Party that they stood for a whole-hog policy of de-rating.  What I want to ask the members of the front benches of Fianna Fáil is, if they stand for a whole-hog policy of de-rating, will not exactly the same inequalities in the distribution of the money arise under a whole-hog de-rating as under partial de-rating? Fianna Fáil knows as well as I do that no matter what Party distributes this money to the farming community these inequalities of distribution are bound to occur and cannot be removed.  If Fianna Fáil stands for a whole-hog policy of de-rating, and they have gone to great pains to show how unevenly the distribution of the money will be, I would like to ask them to explain to the farmers, especially in the constituencies of Meath and Mayo, how this inequality of distribution is to be wiped out under whole-hog de-rating. Supposing the Fianna Fáil Party were distributing this money to-morrow and that they were in a position to give full de-rating, what would happen, for instance, in the two counties of Meath and Mayo?  County Meath has 5,500 farmers and they would share under whole-hog de-rating £106,886.  The average sum distributed to the farmers in Meath under a full de-rating scheme would amount to £19 per head. In the County Mayo there are 28,200 farmers.  Their share would be £76,000 and would amount to £2 4s. 0d. per head.  Under a scheme of full de-rating the average farmer in Mayo would get 44/- per head, while the average farmer in Meath would get £19.  Yet Deputy Clery says that this is an inequitable scheme of distribution. What this House looks for is plain common sense, and if Deputy Clery does not possess plain common sense he certainly ought not to impose this nonsense that he has been endeavouring to impose upon the people.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the great bone of the whole thing, the sum of £265,000 to be raised by a tax on sugar.  The rich man's Budget!  The poor man is the slave under this Budget!  Deputy Clery spun a long story about the poor man.  Whether the interests of the poor man are as dear to him as his own interests I have a great inclination <Col N="1163" /> to doubt after the speech he has made to this House.  He told us here, and we have been listening to it since the debate started, that it would amount to 3/- per head of the population of the Free State, and that the cost of living was going to go up to a tremendous height.  I read yesterday that the price of tea is going to be reduced by 4d. per pound, and I venture to say that when this tax is carried out to the full there will not be a single halfpenny increase in the cost of living, and there is no man with the national interests at heart who will not pay a well-merited tribute to the Minister for Finance for raising three-quarters of a million of money at such little cost to the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell, who certainly, in my opinion, is a fair-minded critic, told us that this would cost 3/- per head to the community.  If we take the population at 3,000,000, it will amount to no such sum as 3/- per head. At the highest amount it would be only 2/- per head.  So that these fine deductions of Deputy O'Connell are altogether wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Work it out yourself.  A sum raised at 3/- per head would amount to £450,000.  Deputy O'Connell can check me there if he wishes. The sum that the Minister for Finance wants to raise is £265,000.  Why do not Deputies, in criticising the Budget, speak fairly?  They are putting another £85,000 by way of taxation on the community that the Minister for Finance is not looking for, nor ever expects to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to say one other word before I sit down.  I think I have bursted the bubble of Deputy Clery. We heard a lot of talk about the rise in the cost of living of the poor of the city.  I suppose if there is any section of the community that contains more poor than any other, it is the section that I represent.  I say that the people in the City of Dublin are not such fools as not to realise that the Government Party has done a great deal to cure, as far as they could, the unemployment problem that exists in this country. <Col N="1164" /> They further realise that the imposition of this negligible tax is for the national good and the people of the City of Dublin have never stood against the national good.  When their electricity undertaking, valued at two-and-a-half million pounds, was being taken away, they did not complain. That was the contribution that Dublin gave to the national good, and they are net going to boggle over a sum of £265,000.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who were talking about raising the cost of living want to put a tax on the loaf of the poor man.  I think the party that wants to put a tax on the loaf of the poor man is not confined to Fianna Fáil. They are represented in other Parties in this House.  I cannot understand why those who want to put a tax on the loaf of the poor man are raising such a hullabaloo over the raising of a sum of £265,000.  The Minister has done well for the country and the country appreciates it.  As the President said, he receives all the odium because he is the collector of taxes, but as a sound level-headed Northman he has done well for the country and the country appreciates him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly time that this debate was wound up when Deputies like Deputy J.J. Byrne get up and advise the farmers of this country as to what is in their interests and what is not.  However, Deputies like Deputy J.J. Byrne have their privileges and I suppose they have to get leave to air their views.  I venture to say that the Minister for Finance has somewhat altered his view concerning this Budget since his visit to Monaghan during the week-end.  I think he has come to realise, if he did not understand it in advance, that his Budget is nothing like a popular Budget and that if he does not make some attempt to undo the damage that has been done matters will look very serious for him.  The total estimated expenditure for the coming year amounts to £26,365,250.  We appear to be definitely up against the position, with the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council, that there is no prospect of a reduction <Col N="1165" /> in taxation.  There is to be no reduction in the various matters that Deputies, more particularly on this side of the House, have referred to from time to time during the past three or four years.  The Army pensioners are to remain, the Civic Guard is to be maintained at its present strength or at increased strength. Salaries of more than £1,000 a year, including Ministers' salaries of £1,700 a year, are to continue.  Nothing whatever can be done apparently in the line of economies.</P>
      <P>I can understand the position of the Minister for Finance in so far as the question of the land annuities is concerned, in so far as the question of the Royal Irish Constabulary pensioners is concerned, and also as regards his surrender of our claim to over-taxation since the Act of Union when he was making his ultimate financial settlement with the representatives of the British Government. I can understand his attitude in these matters.  He has been the signatory to these transactions and it would be expecting too much of him to admit that he had blundered in this matter of Ireland's finances; that he had committed the country to financial liabilities that were not embodied in the Treaty and that we are under no obligation to carry out.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be too much to expect him to admit he had mismanaged our financial affairs in that way.  I do think he must be convinced by this time that he did actually blunder.  If he is so convinced, or if he has any doubt about the matter, I think the least he might do is to make way for a Minister for Finance who would endeavour to undo the financial mess into which the present administration has brought the country.  We find that for an expenditure of £750,000 for the relief of the agricultural community it is actually necessary to impose fresh taxation.  To my mind there is no justification for that.  We have repeatedly pointed out where economies could be effected that would result in a saving of a much larger sum.  I think <Col N="1166" /> if the Minister for Finance gave any serious consideration to the matter at all he would realise that.  Of course the position may be that these people are hanging on to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and that they cannot shake them off.  If that is the position they should make way for others, and if that is not the position there can be no justification for not effecting the necessary economies to give the miserable relief that they propose to give in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I will remind the Minister for Finance that the demand for relief was coupled with an equally insistent demand that there would be no increase in taxation in order to provide the necessary money to give that relief. We actually find the Minister imposing a tax on an essential article of food, an article that is in universal use.  This article, sugar, is consumed, perhaps, even to a greater extent in the homes of the labouring classes and small farmers than in the homes of people who can better afford to bear the burthen. When we criticise the proposed method of relief we are accused of being against de-rating.  I think the President made such an accusation; other members of the House certainly did. It ought not to be necessary to reply to that, and I do not propose replying to it in detail.  I will say very definitely that we are in favour of de-rating, but we are not in favour of whole-hog de-rating if it means the putting on of additional burthens of taxation in order to finance it.  We do hold that the land annuities ought to be retained, the R.I.C. pensions ought to be retained, and that agricultural land ought to be completely de-rated out of these moneys.</P>
    <P>I notice that, so far as the Press reports go, when the Minister for Finance was in Monaghan on Sunday he did not explain how his relief scheme was going to work out in the county.  I am sure, though there were not many farmers represented at the meeting, they would be interested to know how this relief for rates on agricultural land was going to affect them. If my conception of how we are going to be affected in County Monaghan by this relief scheme is not correct, I <Col N="1167" /> would like the Minister to make any corrections that may be necessary.  I do not wish to mislead anybody in the matter.  It appears from the calculations I have made that Monaghan County would get £20,587.  The number of holdings in Monaghan not exceeding £15 valuation is 7,714.  The number of holdings exceeding £15 valuation is 4,763.  The 7,714 small holders would receive between them £5,696, and the 4,763 large holders would receive between them £14,891.  In other words, the 7,714 small holders would receive approximately 14s. 6d. per holding per year, and the 4,763 large holders would receive approximately £3 2s. 6d. per holding per year.  These figures are approximately correct.</P>
    <P>It must be very evident that the average-sized family on a holding in County Monaghan under £15 valuation will consume, presumably, about half-a-stone of sugar each week.  Let us suppose they consume half-a-stone in the week.  We find then that they will actually contribute more per year by the tax on sugar than they are going to get by way of relief of rates.  The actual result in County Monaghan of this relief to the farming community is that the persons under £15 valuation, labourers and town dwellers, are being taxed for the purpose of relieving the larger holders.  If you go down the valuation list below the £15 mark &mdash;down to £5 and below £5&mdash;the anomaly becomes more evident.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the Budget speech that this relief was to be made the excuse for abolishing local government for all practical purposes.  We understood from the Minister that he wished to get rid of the wind-bags.  I was listening to that speech and I was wondering how many of the wind-bags would be invited to meet the Minister in Monaghan.  I was not a bit surprised to find that, regardless of the political views these wind-bags might be supposed to hold, they were nevertheless all welcome at the Minister's meeting.</P>
    <P>I did not observe that he told any of them what he said about them in the Dáil.  I did not notice that he <Col N="1168" /> mentioned that these people were only wind-bags.  His attitude appears to be considerably altered towards them, and his attitude towards local government and local representatives appears to be considerably modified since he went down amongst his constituents.  We do not often see him there, and if every visit would have an equally good effect on his outlook, I think it is rather a pity he does not come more often. According to the reports appearing in the daily Press on last Monday, the views of the Minister with regard to public representation appear to be considerably altered.  He is reported to have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Amongst other reasons why the Government had not agreed to complete de-rating was that they believed that if there was complete de-rating local government would have to be abolished, as county councils, with 90 per cent. of their revenue provided by the Exchequer, would be tempted to be extravagant.  The Government, however, believed local government was a necessity.  There were certain things they felt which might be better done by a central authority, but in actual practice, with the rigidity, delay and red-tape of the central authority, work would be less efficient, and they thought it better that the system of local government should be maintained. What the Government was aiming at was reform that would make the system more businesslike and efficient. If they had councils, say, of 55 members, it was going to be hard to get work done owing to the size of the council and the loquacity of members.  He did not say they were going to impose on county councils the Dublin or Cork system of managerships, without modification. Obviously there would have to be modification. and the object was to give control in all essential matters to elected representatives, and only to alter the system in such a way as to get the work done expeditiously and with economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is very different to the statement made by the Minister for Finance here on the 6th May, in column 777, regarding his attitude towards local <Col N="1169" /> administration and local bodies.  He made that statement before he went to Monaghan, and presumably before the wind-bags put a gun to his head and threatened to blow out his political brains.</P>
    <P>If the relief which it is now proposed to give is not to be neutralised within a few years it is necessary to make substantial alterations in the system of local government which will check the tendency to fresh expenditure.  In any case it has long been apparent that our present system has grave defects which militate against efficiency. Accordingly it is proposed to introduce at a very early date proposals for the reform of the county council. The work of the boards of health will be drawn into the county council, the size of which will be substantially reduced.  At present even when a council has only a normal number of windbags the whole time of the meeting is frequently wasted on a few unimportant items.  The consequence is that many of the men who would make the best type of local representative are increasingly unwilling to serve as members of councils.  With a reduction of the number of members it is anticipated that the number of windbags on the various councils will decrease more than proportionately.  It is proposed to introduce a managership system for counties somewhat similar to that in operation in Dublin and Cork.  It is believed that the reforms contemplated will not only tend to prevent unjustifiable increases in expenditure but will in many cases enable sound economies to be effected.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Monaghan windbags have considerably altered the Minister's attitude towards local administration and that we are not going to have imposed on us anything like the system existing in Dublin and Cork.  If, as I said at the beginning, his visit has had that effect upon him, I would be glad to see him coming oftener.  There is another aspect of the sugar tax, to which I would like to draw attention.  The Minister for Finance and the President appear to be badly served by the Department of <Col N="1170" /> External Affairs.  In column 1091, on the 8th May the President stated: &ldquo;The Minister mentioned that the price of sugar this year was 6/4.  Two years ago it was 12/4.  The imposition of this tax will leave the sugar cheaper than it was two years ago.  That, however, is a matter that Deputies are anxious to forget or else to ignore.&rdquo; I wonder was the President or the Minister for Finance aware of the formation of the sugar combine about which we read in the Press this week? A message from Brussels states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The International Agreement for limiting the export of sugar was signed yesterday by the delegates of Cuba, Java, Germany, CzechoSlovakia, Poland, Hungary and Belgium. The agreement, known as the Chadbourne Plan, applies to those countries, controlling in the aggregate 80 per cent. of the total export of sugar and nearly 50 per cent. of the world's production.  It is to remain in force until September 1st, 1935.  An International Committee, to be established at the Hague, will control the carrying out of the plan. Only three exporting nations of importance&mdash;Russia, the Dominican Republic, and Peru&mdash;are not parties to the agreement, and the adhesion of the two last-mentioned nations is regarded as probable.  The present price of sugar is 1.25 cents a lb.  In order to cover the costs of production and ensure a small profit the price will be increased to 2 cents a lb.  The agreement provides for special measures to be taken to prevent non-importing countries from producing sugar surpluses and creating competition with the Chadbourne plan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance or the President is getting any real return from the Department of External Affairs I am sure that Deputy McGilligan would inform them in advance of this combine whose formation will, no doubt, bring about an increase in the price of sugar.  It has already been increased in my part of the country by a considerable margin over the tax.  I submit that that is a further reason why this essential article of diet should be left out of the <Col N="1171" /> Minister's purview when looking round for something to tax.  If the Minister had the real interests of the poor at heart it is difficult to understand how he could find it in his heart to put a halfpenny extra on a pound of sugar and at the same time to remit the entertainment tax, which brings in £9,000; the racecourse betting tax, which brings in £25,000, and the stamp duties on capital, bringing in £5,000.  It is quite true that these amounts would not be sufficient to finance a de-rating scheme, but it is difficult to see why he remits the tax on these particular classes of the community. Take, for example, the racecourse betting tax.  The Minister does not affect to have any sympathy with betting, but when he relieves the tax on racecourse betting he relieves the men who can afford to go to a racecourse, spend the day there, and put their money on horses, but there is no relief for the man who cannot afford to go outside his own town, who perhaps puts a shilling on a horse with a local bookmaker.  Although the amount from these three sources is only £39,000, I think that the Minister would be in a stronger position if he retained those three taxes instead of increasing the duty on sugar.  The poor have not a keen interest in the three items on which the Minister gave a remission, but they have a very keen interest in the taxation of essential articles of food.</P>
    <P>Members of this Party have been twitted by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture because we are against this tax on sugar and stand for the protection of Irish industry.  Boots, clothes and flour have been quoted as outstanding examples. Deputy Byrne complained of unfair tactics being adopted in debate, but I think that it is utterly unfair on the part of Ministers to mislead people on that particular matter.  There is no parallel between a tax on sugar and a tax on boots and clothing.  If we are in favour of production for Irish industry it is for the purpose of increasing employment and of enabling our industries to be built up, and of having our requirements so far as possible <Col N="1172" /> produced by our own people.  I cannot see how a tax on sugar will increase employment or build up industry.  It is not intended for that purpose, but is purely a revenue-raising tax, and can have no other effect.  If we could succeed in building up new industries by protective tariffs or by a tax, as the Minister for Agriculture prefers to call it, and to use our surplus population in producing goods to meet our own requirements, and if we had two people for every one person we have now consuming home-made articles, it would be the most rapid way of relieving agriculture.  You could halve the amount of taxation and produce the same amount of revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture seriously meant that there was any comparison between the tax on sugar and a tax put on for developing industry, but they probably made the point to deceive the people. I suggest that it is scarcely fair tactics, and that it will very likely harm the future efforts either of the present Government, or of any future Government, to build up our industries.  I always understood that the Minister for Finance was a protectionist, that he belonged to the Griffith school of thought, and I had at least to wait for this debate to be assured that he had changed in that respect.  If he has not changed in that respect and that I have misunderstood his contribution, or that he disapproves of the attitude expressed in this matter by the Minister for Agriculture I would be very glad to hear it, because I do not wish to misrepresent him.  I do complain that it was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Minister for Agriculture to create or to intensify opposition to the protectionist policy of this Party, and even to the partial protection policy of the Party on the opposite side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very noticeable thing in this debate for the last few days has been the twitting of members with statements made sometime previously either in the House or elsewhere. One of the most notable has been the pronouncement made by Deputy Byrne about the dead-weight <Col N="1173" /> debt when he was correcting Deputy Clery's figures in regard to the President's estimate of thirty-five millions. He said that were it not for the activities of the Party opposite that thirty-five millions would not have to be paid. I am sorry Deputy Byrne is not in the House now, but I hope when he is reading the Official Reports he will take my advice, and that every other member of Cumann na nGaedheal will do the same.  It is about time that this thing was stopped, because they are only throwing dirty water on themselves. The Minister for Agriculture admitted frankly in Galway some time ago that they had no apology to offer that they started the civil war.  That explains the thirty-five millions. Deputy Byrne, and other Deputies as well, should get that into their minds, and should not be throwing it over on the Fianna Fáil Party.  He claims full responsibility for it, and he can pay the thirty-five millions if he likes. Since the debate was started Deputies have had to listen to this kind of talk and this kind of criticism.  I think it would be much better if there was some useful criticism or some useful suggestion made in order to pull this country out of the mud and the mire in which it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal opinion of the Budget is that it at last shows the Executive Council and the whole Cumann na nGaedheal Party in their true light.  They tell us that they want to give £750,000 for the relief of agriculture.  I am of opinion that when you want to give relief there must be distress.  I would like to remind the Executive Council, and the President particularly, that both in this House and outside it even in other countries, he repeatedly stated that this country was turning the corner, that it was prosperous, that there was no distress, no unemployment and that it was one of the grandest little countries in the world. If that is true and if the President is right in stating that both in America and Ireland, why do we want this £750,000 for the relief of distress?  The President has made these statements repeatedly both in the House and in other countries.  Every <Col N="1174" /> member of the Executive Council likewise has made them.  As late as last Friday we had something similar from Deputy Shaw.  In his contribution to the debate he stated:</P>
    <P>The Free State is one of the few bright spots in a very dark world, and the Minister for Finance by his wise financial policy in handling the nation's finances is entitled to the thanks and gratitude of the people.</P>
    <P>This is one of the bright spots, according to Deputy Shaw.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the Deputy can see the bright spot, but I know there are people who cannot, and this Budget is not going to make it very bright for them.  So much has been said about the Budget, and there has been so much criticism of the petrol tax and the sugar tax, that I am not going to delay the House in adding very much to these criticisms.  Suffice it to say that in Galway and in the Gaeltacht area particularly people who are being asked to pay an extra halfpenny per pound on sugar are going to be the losers at the end of the year.  In 75 per cent. of the cases the valuation of these people does not exceed £5.  On that basis, assuming that the remission of rates would be about 3/- in the pound, they will benefit only to the extent of 15/-, and certainly they are going to spend more money on the additional sugar tax.  As has been pointed out by several Deputies, the poorer people are, the larger are their families.  That is a certainty, and anybody travelling through Galway or Mayo will frequently find families of six, eight, and ten.  When it comes to supplying these families with sugar the expenditure will certainly be more than fifteen shillings extra in the twelve months.  With a £5 valuation the relief will only amount to about fifteen shillings.  It has been proved conclusively there are many valuations in these counties that are much less than £5.  The Budget is no relief to these people.  It is a further taxation on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to delay the House by covering the same ground over <Col N="1175" /> which other Deputies have travelled. There is, however, one suggestion I would make to the Minister, and he can put the money to whatever use he wishes.  I understand that a year or two ago a request was made that a reduction should be granted in the duty on motor cars.  Now that the Minister has put a tax on petrol, I would like to put this aspect of the case to him. I am sure the Minister will admit that in Southern Ireland there are at least 1,000 garages which are doing a fairly reasonable business in the motor trade. It would be reasonable to assume that in each of the garages we have at least six second-hand cars.  As every Deputy in the House knows, the majority of garage owners, if a man goes in to purchase a new car, will offer him a good price for a second-hand car.  He may think he is getting a decent price, but, as they say in society circles, the garage owner is getting a good whack out of the new car, so that he can afford to give the purchaser a good price for the old one.  In the majority of cases the tax on these old cars is really prohibitive.  As I said before, a few years ago the Minister was asked to give a reduction in that tax.  He did give some concession, but whether that concession is still in existence I am not sure.  If we take an average of six cars in each of these garages&mdash; the average, I agree, would be higher in the case of the cities&mdash;and that there are 1,000 decent, well-equipped garages in this State, that means that you have lying up 6,000 second-hand cars.  I believe the principal reason why these cars are not running is because the tax on them is prohibitive. There is a lot of capital sunk in those garages, and I think it would only be fair that the proprietors of them should be relieved in some way.  My suggestion to the Minister is that the horse-power tax on these cars up to, say, the year 1926, 1927, or 1928 should be reduced by half.  If the Minister were to agree to do that, I believe he would be making it possible for these garage proprietors to sell the cars they have lying up.  Incidentally, he will be making it possible for himself to get more money from the petrol tax <Col N="1176" /> because of the fact that the new owners would be running the cars.</P>
    <P>At present, these second-hand cars are a white elephant.  They are no use either to the Minister for Finance or to the garage proprietors.  I make that suggestion to the Minister if he thinks it feasible to reduce the tax on these cars by half and thereby enable garage proprietors to put into the development of their business the capital that they have sunk in their garages.  I am sure that all parties are anxious for the development of business.  I think that if my suggestion were given effect to it would act as a great stimulus in the business that we are dealing with.  It would result in enormous good to the country.  The revenue would be considerably increased as a result of the increased number of cars on the road.  It is possible, too, that some of the taxes which have been the subject of some very severe criticism in the course of this debate could be reduced.  I am not going to delay the House by going over the ground already covered by a number of Deputies in respect of the petrol and sugar tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a very long debate like this a great deal that is said must consist of repetition, either with or without variation. Consequently it will not be necessary for me to go over in great detail the arguments that have been used.  Deputy Davin said that there was no substantial difference between the Fianna Fáil proposal in regard to de-rating and the proposal the Government have laid before the House. There was a difference in allocation, a difference which will be definitely to the advantage of the poorer districts because the allocation proposed in the Fianna Fáil motion was one which took no account in any way of the needs of the counties as distinct from one another.  The proposal that we have made will definitely give a bigger allocation to those areas which are poor and which have the larger population. It is impossible, by any system of de-rating, to assist people in proportion to their needs, because those that are the more needy, if you like, pay <Col N="1177" /> the smallest proportion of rates and consequently can only be relieved to that extent.  If Deputies had all the interests in those who are the poorer amongst the farmers that they allege they have, and a special interest in the poorer farmers, they would not lend their support to a claim for de-rating at all.  They would recognise that it is only beyond a certain level of wealth that substantial help can be given to any farmer through de-rating.</P>
      <P>As to the suggestion that has been made that de-rating ought to have been by way of total relief on the small valuations, there is at once this objection to that proposal.  If you are going to relieve all farmers below £15 valuation, as has been suggested, from rates, that means that you are going to relieve the land of two-thirds of the farmers of the country from rates.  That, I believe, almost as much as complete de-rating, would involve the abolition of local government as we now know it.  Undoubtedly we have at present amongst the local government voters a considerable number of people who are not liable to any appreciable extent for rates.  If you were to add something like two-thirds of the farmers of the country to those who would have no liability for rates, then obviously you cannot carry on local government as it is at present.  At any rate, if you are to carry on local government in its present form it would mean a change in the franchise, a change which would substantially alter the real character of local government even if you maintained to some extent the outward forms.  At any rate, it would be utterly impossible to carry on local government as we now have it with efficiency or with any regard to economy if you are going to relieve such a large proportion of the people altogether from the payment of rates.  One of the choices that has to be made in connection with de-rating is that local government in its present form must be sacrificed if you go in for total de-rating, either of the whole of the farming community or some substantial section of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the salient features in the reports of the De-rating Commission was the importance that was attached <Col N="1178" /> to the maintenance of local government. I personally think that local government control by elected representatives of the people in the various counties is necessary, and that a great many things which theoretically might be better done by the Central Government in reality and practice would not be so well done because of rigidity, delays and the impossibility of varying administration to suit local conditions. I therefore rule out altogether the proposal that has been put forward, that a certain substantial proportion of the farmers should be relieved completely of rates.  As a matter of fact the Deputies who have been arguing to do that argued against the method of de-rating altogether so far as these people are concerned.  There is considerable inconsistency in their arguments in that respect.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that a very large proportion of the grant of £750,000 would be taken back from the farmer by way of the sugar tax.  Undoubtedly some proportion of the grant will be taken back by way of the sugar tax, and also some small proportion of the amount raised by the petrol tax.  But the estimates given of the extra amount that will be thrown on the small farmer's family have been ridiculously exaggerated.  If we leave out of account the sugar used in the manufacture of sweets and in jam factories, the total consumption per family of sugar would not give as high an average for the halfpenny tax as 15/-.  It would not give an average beyond 12/6.  There is no doubt that the small farmer's family does not use the average amount of sugar.  The small farmer's family uses sugar practically for tea only.  In the better-off household there is jam-making, there is the manufacture of puddings and cakes, and there is considerably more sugar used there than in the small farmer's family.  I admit it is extremely difficult to get the average, unless one examines the household accounts or the grocers' accounts over a large number of cases, and it would be extremely difficult to say what the small farmer with £5 or £10 valuation consumes in sugar in the year.  But suppose the war-time ration of half a <Col N="1179" /> pound of sugar per person were taken each week.  Suppose we say that to the average family of that sort the consumption would be three-quarters of a pound, which would be 50 per cent. more than the war-time consumption, the extra cost would be very little more than half the figure of 15/- which Deputies mentioned as a result of the new taxation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, just as all the figures we have heard with regard to the charges that will be thrown upon the small farmer's family by a halfpenny tax on sugar have been grotesquely exaggerated, so all the benefits of de-rating for the small farmer have been minimised.  There are counties in which as a result of the new grant the farmer with £10 valuation, for instance, will get 36/-.  In a county where a farmer might get 36/- as a result of the distribution of the new grant if he had a £10 valuation, then the farmer with £2 10s. Od. holding will get 9/-, and even that particular farmer, in my opinion, will be better off, because I think, for the farmer of that size, the estimate of 7/6 extra to be paid as a result of the sugar tax is an over-estimate.  Probably 5/- or 6/- would be much nearer than 7/6.  But there is no use in Deputies suggesting that we could get results out of de-rating which cannot possibly be got out of it.  If Deputies do refuse to have regard to the question of production, and other aspects of de-rating, and concentrate solely on the question of burden, then they ought to make up their minds that de-rating in any form is a thing they should not stand for.</P>
    <P>We cannot deal with the question of taxation merely on the basis of popularity or merely on the basis of burden, although burden has to be taken into account and is an important matter always.  But you cannot base your taxation proposals on that, because if we want the country to get on and to get rid of the evils which do exist in the economic system, we must look, not to what people will feel about it, and not merely to the inconvenience that people may experience as a result of taxation, but to the question of <Col N="1180" /> production.  It would be very easy to levy a certain tax which would be popular and easy to carry out, and which would seem in the first instance not to injure the poorer members of the community very much, but which would, in fact, injure those members of the community very seriously by checking production and stiffing business enterprise.  Under the system that exists here and in most other countries, it is the duty of the Government, and it is recognised by Governments of all countries&mdash;even those of the most left-wing tendency&mdash;to have regard to the question of production, to encourage an increase in production so far as they can, or, at any rate, to try to avoid steps that would cause a decrease in production.</P>
    <P>There is no tax at all that is going to leave unaffected any section of the community.  Even taxes that cannot visibly be passed on, and which theoretically are not passed on, affect other members of the community and the poorer members of the community.  Any tax that is taken into the Exchequer must lessen the resources of the people from whom it is taken; it must lessen the employment given by them, and in very many cases a tax that would seem hardly to be passed on at all would inflict as much injury on the working community as a tax that seems to be passed on.  The real moral in respect of that is that for anything like this question of de-rating, both sides have to be taken into account, and we have frankly to weigh it up, recognising that the imposition of new taxation is an evil, and we have to see whether the psychological and other effects of giving de-rating are going to counterbalance that.  I hold that the giving of relief to agriculture, and to ease the financial position of agriculture, is not radically different from giving protection to a manufacturer to enable him to carry on his business with greater ease.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked me for some detailed figures of the spirit revenue. I shall send them to him, but I have not got them at hand at the moment.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies talked about taking the tax off racecourse betting.  A <Col N="1181" /> Committee sat on that on which Parties on all sides of the House were represented, and that Committee some time ago unanimously recommended that course.  I do not think, therefore, that the proposal to remit that tax can be looked upon as entirely a Government proposition.  It is a proposition that appears to have support elsewhere throughout the House.  I explained the reason for giving it, and the circumstances in which it was given, and I really do not think that I need add to that at all.  Whatever burdens are placed either on those who are not interested in agriculture or on smaller agriculturists by taxation that is necessary for the purpose of giving de-rating would be increased in proportion as the money expended on de-rating was increased.  If there had been a substantially larger sum voted, then the difficulty of raising the money would be increased, and the burden on the various people would have to be increased.  Now there is no doubt that directly the urban population gets nothing from it, but if there is any improvement in agricultural production as a result of this measure of relief, then some of that will come through the urban population.  It is a fact also that the various protective measures which have been carried have given direct assistance to the urban population, and have been of no direct assistance to the agricultural population.</P>
    <P>I think that in all the circumstances and having regard to the slump in prices which has occurred, this contribution towards assisting the agriculturists is quite fair and is quite justifiable.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of discussion about the general Budgetary position.  I think that has been sufficiently dealt with by other speakers.  A very large proportion of the costs of the Civil War, both the costs in respect to compensation and the military costs, has been paid out of revenue.  The taxpayer contributed quite substantial sums in the earlier years which might reasonably have been borrowed.  There has only been a very trivial increase in the dead-weight burden of national debt in recent <Col N="1182" /> years arising out of any sort of cash transactions.  Even last year, as I pointed out, there would have been no increase in national debt except for one or two transactions, one of which at least placed no extra burden on the State as a whole but rather reduced the burden on the taxpayer although increasing the nominal total of national debt.  The operation of the Land Act, which has recently been passed, and the activities which will be carried out under that will, during the present financial year, lead to a very substantial increase in the dead-weight burden of debt, but at the end of the year this particular spurt in connection with land operations will have come to an end, and while there will be still need to issue bonds to a certain extent under the Land Acts from 1923 down to the present date, those amounts will be small.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, items of expenditure for which we have been borrowing will come to an end, and if the present Budgetary policy remains absolutely unchanged there will begin to be an actual reduction of the present relatively small dead-weight burden of national debt.  Our position in that respect is immensely superior to the position in most other countries and our real position is reflected in the credit of the State.  The people who have to lend money&mdash;at any rate some of them&mdash;examine very carefully our estimates and accounts.  I discovered myself, when we were issuing the Second National Loan, part of which was floated in America, that the representatives of American banks with whom we were dealing had examined every item of our accounts with the greatest detail.  As a matter of fact they knew the accounts better than, say, the Deputies who criticise on the opposite side.  Having carried out that examination and being aware of the facts they were prepared to put our loan on the market on terms which were very favourable.</P>
    <P>Deputies need not try to go behind what is the general verdict in regard to what is our financial position.  It would be really more useful both from the point of view of the House, and from the point of view of the country, <Col N="1183" /> if they were not to regard it as a duty to try to paint things black.  We have our difficulties and there is no use whatever, no benefits either to the Party that does it, or to the country as a whole, in attempting to blacken the financial position of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke) James A Burke">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that with the permission of the Dáil I will continue the usual practice of taking Vote 10 (Office of Public Works) and Vote 11 (Public Works and Buildings) together, as they cover practically the same ground.  On Vote 10 not many points require notice.  It will be observed that there is a small increase on sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages, and Allowances&mdash;and if the details are examined it will be seen <Col N="1185" /> that this is due in the main to three items&mdash;an improvement in the scale of pay of temporary engineers engaged for arterial drainage work, the addition of a temporary draughtsman to the engineer's branch, and the addition of six temporary junior architectural assistants in the architectural drawing office.  The first of these points, the improvement in the pay of temporary engineers engaged for arterial drainage, has been for some time pressed upon us by representatives of the engineering profession, and was once or twice raised in this House.  The scale of pay has been somewhat improved&mdash;the maximum raised from £250 to £350&mdash;in order to give a little inducement to these young engineers to stay at this job for a few years when they have got the experience which makes them useful. The engineering draughtsman and the six temporary architectural assistants who are being added to the staff are required for the various new works we are undertaking.  These works are shown in Vote 11.</P>
      <P>Sub-head B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash; shows a small decrease on the whole, but it includes a new item for travelling expenses of the National Monuments Advisory Council.  This Council was appointed under the National Monuments Act, 1930, Section 21; it held its first meeting on the 10th September last, and has already shown itself a very active and energetic body. It has produced proposals for a general archaeological survey of the national monuments of Ireland, which are now under consideration by the Minister for Finance.  These are all the points I think it necessary to mention on Vote 10.</P>
      <P>In Vote 11, sub-head A&mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings.  It continues to be necessary to purchase sites and buildings for housing the Gárda Síochána, for the new Preparatory Colleges, and for other purposes, but we hope to be able to reduce the expense a little this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head AA&mdash;Annuities.  As explained on previous occasions, this is an annuity in repayment of an advance for the purchase of the site of the College of Science and Government <Col N="1186" /> Buildings, and the erection of the college; it comes to an end in 1933.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B&mdash;New Works.  There are some points of special interest here. The new works on the Oireachtas buildings may interest Deputies.  The extension of hot-water heating is a small matter of economy; it will nearly supersede the use of coal fires in the offices, and will secure the rooms from deterioration when unoccupied. The heading &ldquo;New Restaurant, Members' Rooms, etc.,&rdquo; refers to a connected series of works for improving the accommodation for members.  The part to be begun in 1931-2 is the erection of a two-storey building facing Kildare Place, of which the principal purpose is to provide rooms for the Opposition members. Work No. 4&mdash;renewal of statues on the Dublin Custom House&mdash;is a small matter in money, but will, we hope, have a considerable effect in restoring the appearance of the building to what it was before it was burned.  There were formerly four statues on the roof facing the river; they were so badly damaged by the fire that they had to be removed, and the front looks rather flat without them.  Work No. 11&mdash;reconstruction of the Four Courts.  We were somewhat delayed by the unfortunate dispute in the Dublin building trade, and it is doubtful if we shall be able to finish the work, as we expected, in time to move the courts in during the long vacation.</P>
    <P>Now as to the barracks for the Gárda Síochána, Works Nos. 17 to 101. The form in which the Estimates are drawn up to meet the requirements of this House, showing every individual new work separately, makes it rather hard to see the general position.  As I explained last year (on 8th May, 1930, col. 1555 of the Report), there was a partial suspension of work on these barracks in 1929-30 for the sake of economy.  Any stoppage of that kind has far-reaching effects.  When you are dealing with a great number of comparatively small buildings you must keep on continuously finding sites, negotiating with landlords, preparing plans, etc., etc., unless you wish to have great delay.  The consequence <Col N="1187" /> of the stoppage in 1929-30 was that we have only been able to spend £30,000 in 1930-31.  In the coming year, 1931-32, we hope to get into something like full swing again and spend £58,000.  It is very desirable to get this business of housing the Gárda finished so far as it ever can be finished&mdash;that is, to provide a reasonably satisfactory barrack in every station.  There are over 800 stations outside Dublin.  Dublin is a separate matter.  The first problem was to find a barrack of any kind in each station; that was substantially done by 1925, but many of the barracks were wretched places, fit only for temporary use.  Since then we have been building, buying, renting, and adapting houses, and we have got rid of most of the worst barracks, but there are still some bad ones, and a good many more cases in which a better barrack is desirable.  It will probably take three or four years more to finish the job.</P>
    <P>Work No. 102&mdash;Grants for National Schools.  This is an important part of our duties.  The sum provided for grants is the same as last year, and the work of building and improving schools is going on at a good pace.</P>
    <P>Works No. 105 to 110&mdash;Preparatory Colleges.  These are large and important buildings.  It will be observed that Coláiste Brighde at Ballyconnell, Co. Donegal, is nearly finished.  Some additional work will be necessary in order to improve the water supply.  It is occupied.  Coláiste Einne, at Furbough, Co. Galway, is hardly begun, as the vendor of the land has so far failed to get a satisfactory title on which we can safely build.  Coláiste Ide, Dingle, Co. Kerry, is finished and occupied.  Coláiste Muire, Tourmakeady, Co. Mayo, is occupied, though there is some work still to do, mainly in the grounds.  Work will, we hope, begin in 1931-32 on the new preparatory college at Ballyvourney in Co. Cork, and on the preparatory college to be made by adaptation of part of the buildings of the former Hibernian Military School in the Phoenix Park. There is also a larger undertaking, the new training college at Galway, <Col N="1188" /> already sanctioned by the Dáil; we secured the site during 1930-31, and hope to begin building in 1931-32.</P>
    <P>Passing on to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Work No. 127, the completion of the General Post Office in Dublin was delayed by the building trade dispute, but is now proceeding. Work No. 129 is important. There is only a token Vote for it, because we do not expect to get to work this year, as a great deal of planning and preparation will be necessary. The proposal is to erect in Pearse Street, adjacent to Westland Row Station, a large building in which letter-sorting, parcel-sorting, and, I believe, other services can be concentrated, with considerable consequent economy in the working of the postal service.</P>
    <P>Work No. 137&mdash;the erection of the high-power wireless station&mdash;is important. We are at present engaged in finding a site.  For the Department of Defence we hope to finish the work proposed at Baldonnel Aerodrome. It was delayed by the building trades dispute.  We are continuing the restoration of the Michael Collins Barracks at Cork (Work No. 142) for the rather large force of reserve battalions and permanent staff stationed there.  The items for which this year's Vote provides are (a) quarters for unmarried officers, (b) mess and canteen for sergeants, and (c) district offices.  The two items for dining halls and food stores, etc., at Kilbride and Kilworth rifle ranges (Works Nos. 143 and 144) are very necessary, if the troops are to take full advantage of the facilities for rifle practice in those rather remote and inaccessible places.</P>
    <P>I think no other new work calls for special notice, nor do I wish to make any observation on any other sub-heads of the Vote except those for drainage maintenance and arterial drainage&mdash; Sub-heads J (1), (2), (3) and (4).  Sub-head J (1)&mdash;Drainage Maintenance&mdash; shows a decrease to £1,000.  It is not expected that any fresh scheme of restoration will be undertaken in the year 1931-32.  The estimate of £1,000 is for expenses of charging orders, etc., in districts already completed. Sub-head J (2)&mdash;Arterial Drainage&mdash;<Col N="1189" /> shows an increase of £7,000, indicating that we expect to do a little more work and spend a little more money in 1931 than in 1930.  The provision represents, of course, only the free grants by the Government.  I went pretty fully into this matter of arterial drainage last year (8th May, 1930, cols. 1558-1565 of the Report), and gave a great number of figures.  I do not propose to go over them again, but I will give those relating to schemes actually submitted to the occupiers for their votes.  I stated in May, 1930, that up to that time 46 schemes had been submitted to occupiers of land; the corresponding figure is now 57.  The number of schemes accepted by the votes of the occupiers was then 32; it is now 42.  The number of schemes on which actual work on the lands had begun was then 18; it is now 24.  The number of schemes in which the works were finished was then 5; it is now 18. These few figures indicate the steady progress of the work.</P>
    <P>As regards the Barrow drainage, sub-head J (3), as I explained last year, the small Vote of £5,000 for the Barrow does not by any means represent the amount of work to be done; we expect to spend some £48,000, but most of this will be loan money, and will be charged to Vote 8&mdash;Local Loans.  The scheme is going on well, and will, we expect, be concluded in about three years from now.</P>
    <P>The estimate of £5,000 is for the free grant only; the total estimate for the year is £48,000, of which £43,000 will be provided from the Local Loans Fund (Vote 8), and £5,000 on this Vote. The expenditure during 1930-31 was £62,000.  The lesser expenditure anticipated during 1931-32 is not because we expect to do less excavation, but because we expect to do it more cheaply, and the reason of this is that a smaller part of it will be on the Lower Barrow (between Athy and Monasterevan), where the bottom is hard and the river large, and a greater part on the Upper Barrow and the tributaries, where the work is easier, and, therefore, cheaper per cube yard excavated.</P>
    <P>During the year ending 31/3/'31 an output of 588,616 cubic yards of soft and rock excavation has been effected, <Col N="1190" /> bringing the excavation total for the year practically to the equal of all previous output.  The greater part of the excavation of the main river has now been done, and excavation has been begun and has progressed well on the following tributaries:&mdash;The Finnery River, the Stradbally River, the Figile River, the Upper Barrow.</P>
    <P>In addition, under-pinning and repairs have been carried out to the Town Bridge and Spa Lane Bridge, Portarlington, and some smaller bridges.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on the work up to 31st March, 1931, was £289,000. Owing to the operations of the mechanical excavators, eleven of which are employed, the unit costs of the excavation are kept low.  They vary in different circumstances, but a great deal of work is now being done at 1/3 per cube yard.</P>
    <P>In winter the average number of men employed is about 220, and in summer, owing to double shifting the machines, the number rises to about 520.</P>
    <P>The beneficial effect produced by the works already upon the flooded and damaged lands has been most pronounced.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J (4)&mdash;Purchase of Machinery. We are still increasing our small stock of drag-line excavators. We bought two in the financial year 1928-9; in the financial year 1930-31 we estimated to buy five, and have done so, and we estimate to buy five more in the coming year 1931-32.  It is the use of these machines which enables us to carry out work under the Arterial Drainage Acts as cheaply as we do.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else to call for comment by me.  If there are any other points on which Deputies want information I will be quite willing to enlighten them.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name that the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.  The Minister for Finance has complained outside the House that he has not got much assistance from the Fianna Fáil Party in showing him where economies might be effected.  As we have a strong sense of responsibility on this side of <Col N="1191" /> the House we think the Board of Works is one of the great spending Departments to which the House might be asked to turn its attention.  The House will notice that the overhead expenses in connection with the office amount to something like £101,000, whereas the expenditure on public works and buildings for the coming year is estimated at £678,282. It will, therefore, be seen that this is one of the most important Departments of the State as far as public expenditure is concerned.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the attitude of the House in dealing with this Department ought to be to examine it very rigidly and see whether economies could not be effected, and even if our criticisms have no effect this year, perhaps in the future they may have. Furthermore, in the present position, when money can only be got for a very urgent purpose by means of extra taxation, it seems to me that it should be the duty of every member of the House to point out where non-productive expenditure, especially, can be reduced.  I think there are some items in the Estimate before us that can be classed as non-productive expenditure. Even in the case of productive expenditure there is always the point to consider whether the present is the most opportune time to carry out certain works, whether you will get the best value for the contemplated expenditure at the present juncture.  This Department, it seems to me, has gradually increased its overhead charges since the Free State was established. In 1923-24 the overhead expenses of the Office of Public Works came to something like £73,131.  During the present year Deputies will notice, as regards salaries, wages and allowances that figure of £73,131 has increased to £99,000.  The total expenditure on the Office has increased from something like £90,000 to £113,000.  There is a slight increase this year under the head of salaries, wages and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the ordinary staff of the Board of Works there is a special staff maintained for the purpose of dealing with loans under the Land Improvements Acts and the Land Act of <Col N="1192" /> 1881.  This is a feature of the work of this particular Department which we had expected was going to disappear in the course of time.  I remember we called attention to it two or three years ago, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out to us that in the course of time this branch of the work would disappear.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, would indicate to the House what is the amount of the loans for which his Department is responsible.  I think it is probably a very considerable sum.  Even so, as we now have a special Corporation for dealing with agricultural credit, and as we have the Land Commission, on the other hand, dealing with the question of land settlement, and as we have the Local Government Department for dealing with the question of housing, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will have to make a very strong case indeed to show why this service should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The number of officials in the Department has increased at a considerable rate, and at a greater rate than the expenditure.  I think the number of officials has increased something like threefold since the State took over this Department.  The Department was no doubt busily engaged for some years back on large work, as, for example, the Custom House.  I understand that the Custom House is now practically complete, and that we may not meet it again in the Estimate. We have also the Four Courts, and I think the Four Courts will be completed in another year.  We are asked to vote £35,000 for the Four Courts work this year.  There is also the G.P.O., which, I understand, may be completed next year also.  In view of the fact that these exceedingly heavy works will soon be completed, I think it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to justify to the House the heavy overhead expenses that this Department is costing the country.</P>
    <P>Turning to the other side, to the question of economy, I want to refer to the question of non-productive expenditure. I think the expenditure on the Gárda Síochána barracks cannot be justified at the present juncture. <Col N="1193" /> Last year the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out to us that the estimate for work in this connection had only reappeared in the Estimates that year, having been cut out in the previous year as part of the economy drive. When the work was recommenced last year the total amount estimated for was only £37,000 on twenty-four new barracks, and seventeen other barracks which were to be adapted or improved.  This year there are about 64 new barracks estimated for, and about twenty barracks for restoration or adaptation, amounting to something like £70,000 in all.  The question is whether that £70,000 is an absolutely necessary item of expenditure at the present time, and whether it is work that could not be deferred.  It seems to me that nothing has changed during the past few years.  If there were good arguments in favour of holding up this class of work then the same arguments should hold at the present time, and while there are urgent works of more importance, in my opinion, to the community being held up, that such a large sum should be voted for the building of new barracks in particular seems to be unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>There are small increases in connection with some of the sub-heads which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain.  There is in connection with maintenance and supply&mdash; sub-head C&mdash;an increase of nearly £1,500, and in the case of furniture, fittings and utensils an increase of over £1,000.  I think that in the case of what I might call standardised services of that nature&mdash;maintenance and supplies of furniture and fittings to Government Departments&mdash;there ought to be very good reasons indeed given to the Dáil before expenditure in excess of what we voted last year should be granted.</P>
    <P>There are two items also which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some information on.  There is, first, sub-head CC&mdash;Compensation in lieu of restoration of lands taken over under emergency powers.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could tell the House what is the basis of granting <Col N="1194" /> compensation in such cases I think it would be valuable.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head E&mdash;Compensation for Premises Commandeered by the Army&mdash;I am anxious to know whether that sub-head is likely to disappear in the near future.  It seems to me that compensation that has to be paid in this connection ought now to be almost completely accounted for.</P>
    <P>Then we turn to the question of drainage.  The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that there is only £1,000 available for drainage maintenance this year.  Last year we voted £6,000.  I think he indicated last year that one of the chief works of the future which he envisaged was drainage work on the River Corrib. Deputies from the area will, I am sure, be interested to know whether that work is completed and what responsibility the State will have in future. Are we to understand that the State is now completely free of responsibility with regard to the drainage in that area?</P>
    <P>As regard arterial drainage, there is an increase of £7,000.  It seems to me, however, that the improvement that the Parliamentary Secretary has read out in the number of schemes which are being executed does not indicate sufficient progress for that £7,000, for which we are now asked, making a total of £36,000 for the coming year.  Last year, he told us that 500 petitions had been examined, and of these 500 petitions 308 were still alive.  Of these, 240 had in fact been investigated by his valuers.  The chief complaint of Deputies last year was about the slow progress of the work, that in spite of the fact that there seemed to be hundreds of schemes well in hands, only 18 works had actually been begun.  This year, the Parliamentary Secretary reports that 18 have been completed and that there are now 24 upon which work has been begun. But that is only six more.  I would like to know what is the total number of schemes which the Parliamentary Secretary eventually hopes to see in operation.  I understand that last year he reported to the House that there were some 90 schemes which would be passed and that the Minister for <Col N="1195" /> Finance had sanctioned grants in 76 cases.  Are we to take it that in these 76 cases, of which only 24 show signs of actual progress in regard to work done, the blame is on the local bodies in all cases for failure to continue this work?  As well as the 90 schemes, however, which the Department of Finance seem to have more or less sanctioned, there were a considerable number still to be investigated. For example, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that there were 59 on which, although the valuers had reported&mdash;and we must take it that there was a case for going ahead&mdash;they had not reached the stage of being submitted either to the Department of Finance or to the local authorities. There were some 60 cases of that nature</P>
    <P>As regards the Barrow drainage, the House, I am sure, would be glad to know when the Parliamentary Secretary expects to complete this work. £5,000, he told us, has been voted and £43,000 is being got out of borrowed moneys.  Am I correct in that?</P>

      <P>£648,000 in all.  I do not think I have anything further to say except again to press the view, as this is one of the big spending Departments, that it is our duty to demand that all economies possible should be made.  No economies have been shown. There are certain items where I think expenditure might be cut down.  There are other items where it seems to me, by virtue of the fact that the work is not proceeding as expeditiously as all Parties in the House would like, and as the big works that the Department had in hands in the city of Dublin are now on the verge of completion, a real, substantial effort should be made by the Ministry to effect economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items in connection with this Vote to which I would desire to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that he will have them remedied. For instance, under the heading of harbours I see that there is an additional sum of £9,000 voted towards <Col N="1196" /> improvements for Buncrana harbour and pier.  I understand that this sum of £9,000 is part of a sum of £18,000 which was handed over to the Saorstát Exchequer under what is known as the Ireland Development Grant Fund, after the signing of the Treaty. As far as that £18,000 is concerned, which will be devoted to improvement of Buncrana harbour and pier I understand that Buncrana Urban District Council are asked to contribute a sum of £6,000.</P>
      <P>What I desire to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to is this: quite a considerable time ago I understand the Buncrana Urban District Council, and the Buncrana Harbour Commissioners, requested the Board of Works to supply them with plans in connection with a new pier, together with the bill of costs and the bill of quantities.  Neither the plans, the bill of costs nor the bill of quantities has been supplied to the Buncrana Harbour Commissioners or the Urban District Council.  The people in Buncrana maintain that, as the ratepayers of the urban district are asked to contribute £6,000, in all fairness they should be supplied with copies of the plans, the bill of costs and the bill of quantities.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary now that his attention has been drawn to this matter will take it up with his chief engineer right away and see that these things are supplied without further delay.</P>
      <P>I did not know that this Estimate was going to come up to-day.  On tomorrow's Order Paper a question will appear in my name asking for the total expenditure in connection with the new works being carried out at Buncrana harbour and pier up to and including 31st of March this year.  It is possible that the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to furnish that information tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Harbours, etc.,&rdquo; I notice that a sum of £19,226 is asked in connection with Dun Laoghaire Harbour, a sum of £2,100 for Howth Harbour, and a sum of £1,219 for Dunmore East Harbour.  I understand that these sums are a statutory obligation, and that the <Col N="1197" /> money has to be voted to these harbours each year.  I think, however, that the time has arrived when this matter of State-owned harbours should be investigated.  I believe that while Dun Laoghaire, Howth, and Dunmore East may have claims, there are other harbours in the country on which these or like sums could be expended to better advantage.  In my constituency, for instance, we have Killybegs Harbour, which is very much in need of money for improvement, and also the landing places at Kincasslagh.  I understand that there was also an application made in respect of Thorn, at Letterkenny. While the expenditure in regard to Dun Laoghaire, Howth and Dunmore East might be justified to a certain extent and is statutory, I think, at the same time, there are other harbours and piers and landing places in the Saorstát upon which the money could be expended to much greater advantage. As far as Dun Laoghaire is concerned, I realise that a large amount is repaid by way of tolls and dues.  As far as Howth is concerned, seeing that fishing was a comparative failure for years, there is very little money coming back from that harbour in the way of dues, etc.</P>
    <P>I notice a sum of £1,200 is asked for in connection with the Dublin Custom House for the renewal of statues.  I think Deputies will generally agree that this is an absolutely unnecessary expenditure.  Money is being spent upon repairing and renovating the Custom House, but I do not see why the taxpayers of the country should be called upon to expend £1,200 on ornamental statues.  They may be all right to look at, but, after all, I think the £1,200 could be spent in a much better fashion.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into these matters and have them corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if any progress has been made as regards the Commission set up under his Department to deal with the question of coast erosion.  During the last few winters there has been very considerable coast erosion along the Eastern and Southern coasts of Ireland, particularly <Col N="1198" /> in Wicklow and Wexford. Local bodies have made repeated applications to the Government for assistance in some scheme to alleviate the situation.  I think some officials were down and they investigated the various spots where erosion had taken place, but so far there has been no practical help forthcoming, and no practical suggestion has been made by the Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to Nos. 1 and 2 in this Estimate, under the heading &ldquo;Oireachtas,&rdquo; I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary is making provision for an extension of the heating system.  I hope he will also consider the question of ventilation.  The new premises here are very defective in the matter of ventilation.  As regards No. 2, the amount involved is very considerable&mdash;£29,200.  I was astonished to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that a large proportion of this money is to be spent wholly for the benefit of the Opposition&mdash;to provide members' rooms and other improvements for the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that Deputies belonging to the Government Party are equally in need of accommodation.  There is no spot in the whole institution in which a Deputy can sit down quietly and examine a Bill without being interrupted with the conversations on either side of him amongst Deputies and their constituents.  The Ministers can retire at any time to their private rooms, but the ordinary private Deputy has not a single spot in the whole building where he can sit down quietly.  When it comes to the question of approving of the plans for these improvements I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the points I have submitted.  Under this Estimate also it is permissible for one to refer to the old problem of the front of Leinster House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago the Minister mentioned that the cost of improving the lawn in front of Leinster House would be too great, and he declared <Col N="1199" /> that in the circumstances it would not be worth while making any improvement there.  I have personal ocular experience of similar work elsewhere. A few weeks ago I saw a somewhat similar object being removed at no cost whatsoever to the State.  The only requirements are two stout ropes, and there is plenty of free labour to do the rest.  I think the Minister was really evading the matter when he was talking about the question of cost.  I suppose it will be many years before the Parliamentary Secretary will eventually succumb to the popular demand that this lawn should be improved.</P>
      <P>I wonder is there any principle of selection with regard to the erection, or the re-erection of Gárda barracks. I almost fear to speak of 98&mdash;Gorey ex-R.I.C. Barrack&mdash;Restoration.  I think it is seven years since I put down a question as to when that barrack in my home town would be reconstructed.  I notice that No. 98 is still in the Estimates and not a single penny of the £3,000 estimated for the work has been spent.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what is the principle of selection&mdash;whether it is due to favouritism amongst Deputies, or what exactly is the manner of priority.</P>
      <P>I will now come to No. 141&mdash;Baldonnel Aerodrome&mdash;Reconstruction of Barracks.  The Parliamentary Secretary said they were spending a very large sum of money on the reconstruction of the barracks at the aerodrome. It is rather curious that they should be spending a large sum of money on reconstructing the barracks when the hangars at the aerodrome itself are decaying to such an extent that they are in danger of collapsing.  If the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister for Defence, would visit the aerodrome they could actually tear lumps from the iron doors of the hangars.  Portions of the building are rotting and falling to pieces.  It reminds me of the poem written by Dean Swift when he saw the magazine in the Phoenix Park.  If the situation at Baldonnel is allowed to develop on present lines by the Board of Works and the Ministry of Defence I think that we could safely parody Swift's couplet and say of it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Behold a proof of Irish fun,</P>
    <P>'Tis Irish wit I guess;</P>
    <P>When the aerodrome is dead and gone</P>
    <P>We build an officers' mess.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions a large sum was put down for the reconditioning of the hangars in Baldonnel but it disappeared in subsequent years from the Estimate.  With regard to the Phoenix Park, last year and the year before I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to do something in the way of providing proper accommodation for boys playing football on the fifteen acres.  There is no telephone or lavatory accommodation there.  A telephone in that part of the park would be very advisable, especially in view of next year's celebrations.  The cost would be comparatively small.  I am not sure whether it should be borne by the Board of Works or the Post Office.  The telephone is badly needed, because frequently accidents occur there and people have to go a considerable distance before they can get an ambulance for an injured player.</P>
    <P>I notice that in another sub-head a sum of over £10,000 is provided for the upkeep of British aerodromes and military buildings in this country.  It is now a considerable number of years since the British left, and I think it is about time that some decision was taken as to what is to be done with these buildings.  A charge of £10,000 is rather unnecessary.  Of course, certain rents are being paid for land attached to these buildings, but they hardly amount to that figure.  The matter has been dragging on for years, and it is a charge on the State which might very well cease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is about to take steps to drain the Blackwater, which, with the Boyne, is one of the main rivers of Co. Meath.  I do not remember seeing it in a worse condition that it is at present.  I am sure that he has had notification about it from the county council.  In its present state it is doing a considerable amount of damage and is doing much to nullify the effects of arterial drainage. It seems a strange system under which the main rivers are left undrained <Col N="1201" /> while the small rivers are drained.  That may be one of the reasons why I have so many complaints from people who are supposed to have benefited by arterial drainage. I have received very sound complaints from farmers, who state that instead of getting any benefit their land is completely flooded.  If that is so, I do not see how the Board of Works can continue to assess them.  The matter should be examined.  From one district for a couple of years I have had complaints that the lands of some of the farmers have been flooded out altogether.  I have not actually seen them, but I have reasonable ground for knowing that that statement is correct.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would get his engineers to examine the district, and if these lands are being flooded the farmers should not be asked to pay.  I will give the Parliamentary Secretary the names of these districts afterwards. It was rather demoralising to have such complaints made, especially when the cost of schemes is so high.  I wrote on two or three occasions to the Board and was told in reply that the scheme was assessed and there was no way out of it.  Engineers, however, like other people, can make mistakes.  It would not, in my opinion, cost much to repair the damage caused by the overflowing of the Blackwater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what progress has been made in regard to the National Monuments Act, which was passed two or three years ago, and inform us whether he has scheduled under that Act any monuments which were not scheduled before.  Personally I cannot see that any progress has been made. The few places which I visited displayed dilapidated signboards with the inscription&mdash;almost impossible to read: &ldquo;Board of Works.  Trespassers keep away.&rdquo;  That state of affairs should not be allowed to continue, particularly as we went to the expense and trouble of passing a Bill to protect such places.  It does not look as if steps are being taken to protect them. I notice in the Estimate that provision is made for a salary of £100 for an inspector under that Act.  I wonder if <Col N="1202" /> his whole time is being given to that duty or whether he is only a part-time official.  Certainly the amount struck me as not being sufficient for a whole-time inspector.  I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would answer my queries, especially in regard to the Blackwater.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Board of Works on the great success of the drainage scheme which they carried out in my district near Buttevant, where formerly hundreds of acres were flooded every year.  Nothing grew but rushes, and at the end of May you could see nothing there but water and water-hens.  When they tried to bring the hay in in September they would often find water half-way up the haycocks. Now, however, there are up to 1,000 acres there of the most fertile land in Co. Cork.  The great success of the Awbeg drainage scheme has been commented on by several Deputies. If every other scheme in Ireland proves as successful as the Awbeg scheme the Board of Works should go on with the work.  In my district a lot of property is managed by the Board of Works, who do everything to meet the wishes of the people, and houses under their control have been let to people after proper representation had been made to the Board.  I have nothing but praise for this Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The small provision made in the Estimates for the provision of lights and beacons in harbours has induced my return to a subject which I discussed here on former occasions. On change of Government, the buoys in Castletownbere Harbour were removed, and repeated attempts have failed to induce the Board of Works to make any provision for harbour lights there.  Representations have been made so often that there appears to be very little use in continuing them, but as this is the only opportunity we have of reviewing the work of the Department responsible in this case, it is perhaps as well to bring the matter to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary again.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have an inquiry <Col N="1203" /> made into the matter and to satisfy himself as to the facts of the matter. He will find that the fishermen there are plying their calling at the present time under very great difficulties and that the position which obtains there at the moment, if not remedied, will ultimately result in loss of property certainly, perhaps loss of life.  The expense will be very small and there does not seem to be any reason whatever why the work should not be undertaken.</P>
      <P>In connection with smaller works in connection with the west Cork coast line, I understand that the Board of Works have performed their part of the work satisfactorily and that the delay is due to the fact that the local authorities have not dealt with the matter as expeditiously as they might have done.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary twelve months ago for information in regard to another matter, namely, in connection with the ruined military barracks in Bandon. The decision as to what would be done with the building was held up pending some negotiations which were taking place between the Department of Public Works and the people interested in the erection of a central co-operative creamery.  A site for the creamery has since been selected elsewhere, and the building is still there.  I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that a demand reached him from the townspeople for the purchase of the building with a view to erecting a people's hall on the site.  I do not know whether any decision has been come to, but it seems rather hard to understand the great delay in dealing with the matter.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, or if he is unable to do so when replying, as soon as possible afterwards, to give us some information to indicate what the policy of the Department is in connection with that particular building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that provision has been made for the erection of a military barracks at Ballydehob, and I suggest that the work should be expedited as much as possible.  I would like also to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether his Department does in fact insist upon a fair wages clause <Col N="1204" /> being embodied in contracts entered into by the Department of Public Works.  I brought to the notice of his Department lately a very bad case where the fair wages clause had been entirely ignored.  I pointed out the facts of the case where a contract had been entered into for the erection of a public building, and where the contractor, in complete disregard of the fair wages clause, tendered a wage of 24/- a week to labourers employed on the work.  The provision in the clause would go to show that the Office of Public Works desired that a contractor for work of that kind would pay as good a wage as a good employer in the locality.  The local rate of wages in this case would be something like 35/- or 36/-.  I am anxious to know whether this clause is usually insisted on, or whether it is merely inserted in the contract as a matter of form.  This is clearly a very bad case, and a case in which one must assume that if reasonable provision for a fair wage were insisted upon when the contract was made, the contractor would have regard to that.  The effect of it would be, if this were allowed to continue, that the wages which ought to go in payment of labour on the work would revert to the contractor in addition to whatever profit he might reasonably be expected to get in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I regret that no more ample provision than is indicated in the Estimates is made for minor works.  One coming from a coast-line constituency can see the necessity for a number of works altogether in excess of that which the sum in this Estimate would provide for.  I would like to see that item dealt with in the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, and also if he would give us some indication as to what he intends to do with the small sum provided.  I would also like some explanation as to why a much larger sum is not forthcoming for work of that kind.  I would direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the other matters I have referred to, with particular reference to the item of the fair wages clause, and also to the complaint that the discretion to which the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1205" /> referred in regard to contracts is not exercised.  Complaints have been made to me that in some cases very unsatisfactory contractors have been accepted for certain work, people who insist on paying very small wages and who would not in the ordinary way, on works of much lesser importance, be regarded as competent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather agree with what Deputy Esmonde stated in regard to the division of the new building which it is proposed to erect.  It is absolutely right that the Opposition should have their proper rooms in every way and have what they require. It is also, as he says, quite right that the members of the Government Party should have rooms too.  As Deputy Esmonde remarked, there is no privacy here for seeing people or for writing letters.  You have invariably a large number of people about you.  I think that the interests of the Government Party should be considered in that matter.  There is also another matter which should be considered.  At present we have not very many lady members of the Dáil, but there are some lady members of the Seanad and there is really no provision made for their comfort in any way.  I think, as in other assemblies of which ladies are members, there should be reading rooms for them with all necessary accessories.  Now that the voting power of the women of the Free State is very considerable, I think that in time to come there will be many more lady members on every side of the House, and I think their interests and comfort should be considered.  Nobody will deny that at present that is not the case.  I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Barrow works are a success, and that the good effect of the drainage so far is being felt, because that is a thing that is long overdue.  It will always stand to the credit of the Government that they tackled a matter which British Government after British Government tried to remedy and failed. I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if it is proposed to do a large amount of the work <Col N="1206" /> this year, and if in consequence a larger number of people will be employed, and if he could state the approximate time that it is expected to complete the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): Under the Parliamentary Secretary's administration there are certain matters in connection with the Shannon development scheme that I would like to refer to. There were lock-keepers employed who came under the control of the Board of Works, and therefore under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary. When the Shannon development was initiated several of these people were thrown out of employment.  The compensation given them was very small. In fact it is miserable in some cases. There are two cases that I wish to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and of the House, and they are, perhaps, as penurious as it will be possible to find under the administration of any department.  One is that of a lock-keeper named Magee. He was in the employment of the Board of Works for 27 years as a lock-keeper, his wages being £1 10s. 6d. a week.  In addition to being in the employment of the Board for that period as a lock-keeper he was, for five years, on the inspector's boat for navigation purposes.  In calculating his allowance these five years were not taken into consideration at all, and the total amount that was given to him was £28 per year.  He had to leave his house, which was worth 7/- a week to him.  It contained three bedrooms, a parlour and kitchen.  He had a free garden and 2½ acres of land, which were rented at 30/- a year.  That man is being deprived of everything, perquisites and all, and all that he receives now is £28 a year.  Anyone who examines this case will, I think, agree that, at his age, £28 a year will not enable him to keep his family properly.  He is certainly not able to go to work.  He cannot find work in the district that will suit him.  At his age he is not able to take on new employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another case which is probably worse than the one I have mentioned.  It is that of a man named Crowe.  He was for 11 years in the employment of the Board of Works as <Col N="1207" /> a lock-keeper.  He succeeded his father, who was for over 40 years so engaged, and also his grandfather, who held the same employment.  His wages were £1 10s. 6d. a week.  He had a free house valued at 10/- a week. He rented 26 acres 3 roods and 37 perches of land, the annual rent being £4 10s.  It will be agreed, I think, that these were very important emoluments and added materially to his wages.  He was obliged to sacrifice all that.  As far as he is concerned, everything went.  His house is now under water.  All that he receives now is £13 a year.  Representations have been made to the Parliamentary Secretary with a view to having the sums awarded in these cases commuted to a lump sum, so that the men concerned would have some chance of starting some kind of a business to enable them to earn a livelihood.  So far nothing has been done.  As a matter of fact, the Department of Finance has turned down the matter entirely.  It is important to note that although the houses of these two men were totally destroyed, in the case of other lock-keepers who were given compensation they were left their houses.  Not alone were these two men given meagre compensation, but their houses were destroyed. They were told to go and find a house.  They are expected to live on a miserable pittance of £13 a year in one case and £28 in the other.</P>
    <P>These are cases which the Parliamentary Secretary should surely take into consideration.  I think he ought to take steps to see whether the Minister for Finance would, on reconsideration, agree to commute the amounts granted in both cases and give lump sums, so that these people would have a chance of setting up in business, and thereby be enabled to keep their families.  It is interesting to note that while these men are unemployed and are suffering great hardship strangers are brought into the district to do the work that they could do.  Strangers have been brought in from other counties, counties close by and counties far distant. I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> I was glad that Deputy Esmonde raised the question of coast erosion. This is a matter of very grave importance to us in Clare.  Locally we are certainly not in a position to deal with it.  It is wiping away one of the best seaside resorts that we have in the county.  It is time that this question was dealt with in a national fashion, time that we knew what this Commission is doing, whether they have held any sittings or paid visits to seaside places in the county, and whether their engineers have made an examination to see if these places can be saved.  I never heard, for instance, that the Commission visited Lahinch, where the-sea is biting in at a great rate annually, and threatening to wipe out that pretty health-giving resort.</P>
    <P>Regarding drainage schemes, there are several of them that I think the Parliamentary Secretary should take steps to expedite.  I cannot join in the eulogistic terms that Deputy Daly employed when speaking on this. Neither can I say that the Board is not doing a good deal of work in this matter of drainage.  The Board is doing a great deal of valuable work in that connection, but I think they might take steps to expedite work on a number of schemes that have been under consideration for a long period.  Some years ago the Board carried through a number of large schemes, schemes involving large areas, and in connection with these much valuable work was done.  I do not, however, know what is the position in regard to maintenance on them.  Unless something is done to keep those schemes in proper repair, then all the work and expense incurred in carrying them through some years ago will be lost.  Breaches will be made in them here and there, thereby enabling recurrent floods to tear away whole banks and do damage that will cost a lot of money to repair.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Esmonde might have developed the matter of an improvement in the front of the House and in the lawn Might I make a suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary that from an æsthetic point of view, it might be just as well if he paid some attention to what Deputy Esmonde did say, and that if he did nothing else he <Col N="1209" /> might get the Department of Finance to smelt down the object referred to, thereby giving the good lady an opportunity of being of some service to this country which she so consistently despised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in the Estimate that the amount provided for repairs and maintenance of the Phoenix Park has decreased from £19,410 in 1930-31 to £1,990 for the current year.  I must say that the Park is kept in excellent condition.  It is a credit to the Board of Works and to the workmen employed there.  Some of the footpaths, however, are in a very bad state&mdash;some of those in the main, and most frequented, parts of the Park, particularly from the North Circular Road Gate to the Depôt.  They are so worn down and full of holes that no one can use them.  The result is that all pedestrian traffic is diverted to the main road.  On account of the footpaths being in such a condition, people who witness the heavy traffic there is in the Park, fear that some day a serious accident will occur.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I wish to refer to.  Some of the trees along the main road are very old and seem to be in danger of falling.  I am sure I have only to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter, so that he will take steps to see that these old trees are removed.  The wood in them would not be much use, I think, except for firewood.  It could be distributed amongst the poor through the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and it would do something to relieve their condition during the winter when fuel is so scarce and dear.  The condition of the Park, as a whole, is excellent.  The People's Gardens are really a credit to any city in the world.  They are a marvellous breathing space and playground for the children of the city.  I feel sure I have only to mention the matters I have touched on to the Parliamentary Secretary, and that he will do his best to have them rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The first is that some years ago the Post Office authorities <Col N="1210" /> acquired some premises in Cork for the purpose of Post Office work.  There is a re-vote mentioned in the present Estimate and a number of people in Cork are inquiring when this work will be begun.  We do not know what the difficulty is.  There may be some question of title, but, at last, there appears to be an amount of doubt as to the causes which have held up this building or buildings.  A number of persons in the building industry in the city are at the moment unemployed, and it would be a commendable thing if the Parliamentary Secretary were to expedite this work.  We know that the present Post Office in Cork is rather congested from time to time, and we know that there is necessity there for increased facilities and that further space is required.  I take it that the Post Office authorities would not have acquired these buildings otherwise, and hence I ask that the work should be expedited as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to refer which might be considered a purely domestic matter.  It concerns the engineering staff who are responsible for the heating of these premises and the adjoining premises. As far as I understand the matter, these men appear to be official and yet unofficial.  They are not directly employed under the Department but by some contractor, and these men have no recognition from the State in any way.  It seems a rather peculiar state of affairs that you have a building such as the one in which we are housed, and the adjoining building, which are the property of the State, and yet the men working in them are not in the State service.  They are engaged in the heating of these premises and they undertake very strenuous work in the way of firing, looking after the boiler, and work of that character, which every Deputy will admit is hard and arduous work. Even if they got recognition to the extent even of a fortnight's holidays my complaint would not be so great.  They work from year's end to year's end without any holiday whatever.  That is a state of affairs that should be immediately remedied.  It is no credit <Col N="1211" /> to this State that persons engaged on what is after all State service by virtue of their employment, should not have the amenities enjoyed by all other servants of the State.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to call attention is that of the derelict coast guard stations in the country. As the Committee is aware, they have been dismantled.  Others are in a very bad state of repair, and probably a very large number of them are untenanted. While we have demand in the country for housing I do not see why some of these structures should not be made into dwelling houses. With very little expenditure many of them could be put into a habitable condition. Some of them could be let as boarding houses at the seaside.  It would be a useful expenditure on the part of the State to recondition some of these houses and let them at rents that would recoup the State for any expenditure involved in their repair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe referred to some of the amenities which are not enjoyed by the Deputies in this House.  He has spoken of the want of proper accommodation for the lady members of the House, and also for Committees appointed for various purposes. We are extremely limited so far as these amenities are concerned.</P>
    <P>We of the Labour Party do not complain, but a very short time ago we were evicted out of our own Committee room to make way for the President. We consented to that with a good grace, although we might have claimed to have what is termed squatters' rights, and could have made a good stand, and could probably have resisted a long siege before being dispossessed.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see whether we should not be able to enjoy the ordinary amenities to be obtained in the ordinary club, and to which we are justly entitled.  The fact that the Committee room which we have is not large enough at times to accommodate the members of our own Party when having meetings with other bodies who have interests possibly in common with us, should be remedied by <Col N="1212" /> the Department of Public Works.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to supply the information I have asked for on these subjects this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Public Works Department have, I think, a very long and honourable record in many monuments throughout the country which it has put up and in the substantial work that it has done.  In looking over the Estimates for the coming year I do not think that, perhaps, the most pressing things have been put in the forefront.  The Deputy who has just sat down referred to the shortcomings of this House, and a large sum of money is proposed to be expended on what are called certain improvements.  I am not sure that a case can be made for that in normal circumstances. I think from the debates which we have listened to during the last number of Parliamentary sittings one would not gather that the country had so much superfluous money to spend on this House.  I think we are not badly housed at all if we look at the number of rooms in this building and the number of members in the House.  Surely with some little adjustment we would not be too badly off at all.</P>
      <P>The group to which I belong is lent a room during the time when the Dáil is sitting.  We make no complaint.  We had not a room to ourselves.  I cannot believe there is any great hardship suffered by Deputies in the House, especially when you look round and witness the celerity with which Deputies disappear out of the House at times. There must be some congenial place in the House where people find rest and refreshment and comfort.  I do not think the spending of this sum of money on this House is one of the most pressing needs of the day.  I think there are other things more pressing in the country, and that this matter could stand over for the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a word or two in commendation of this Department.  I have visited several places and they <Col N="1213" /> are certainly doing useful drainage work, and going ahead with a fair amount of speed.  Still, I think there are several schemes which could be undertaken.  One in particular was a very burning question, especially during the last couple of elections.  It will remain there until there is a prospect of another election.  I refer to a scheme which affects Monaghan particularly, and also Cavan.  That is the Dromore drainage scheme.  I do not like to mention the need for this drainage scheme.  Several inspections have been made and a great amount of money has been spent.  Inspections do not remedy things.  I have been over the area, and it is a disgrace to think that we have a Drainage Act that we are not putting into force there.  The rainfall has not been heavy lately, but for miles the land is covered with water.  That is not the worst.  The farmers are crying out that they cannot put their cattle on meadows for which they are paying annuities and rates. The water is being banked up owing to the floods, and in Ballybay the river washes the sewage back into the town.  It is a menace to the health of the people, and I do not think you will find the like of it throughout the Free State.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up the work in that area.  There may be a small scheme which would relieve that nuisance I speak of.  There is another aspect; throughout the county and the neighbouring counties there are men in receipt of unemployment benefit because there is no work for them. Here is a useful means of employment. In the good weather there is no reason why there should not be a great amount of work done on this river.  It could be done economically.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other things, but they have been mentioned by other Deputies.  Perhaps in speaking about the rooms of the House I should have qualified my statement.  If it is a fact that the lady members of this House, and of the other House, have no room, somebody should be moved so that they might have a room right away. In a building of this sort we should be able to find accommodation for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the objections <Col N="1214" /> I have to this Department is that its ideas are far beyond the opportunities of the people.  In some of the counties in which I have an interest I have found that the estimates for drainage schemes are entirely out of reach of those responsible.  From the ordinary view-point it might appear to be a matter of circumstances.  Certain operations would be so expensive that they would be uneconomic.  On examining the proposition further, I am forced to the conclusion that the Department might, with very great advantage, adapt itself to the conditions of the areas concerned.  In County Leitrim recently we considered whether the County would come under the Drainage Act passed in this House. Of twenty schemes, approximately, which we examined in the county, four were actually recommended by the Department as practicable.  That meant that a very large part of the county was denied the possibility of having any drainage schemes carried through, because, in the opinion of the Department's engineers, the work would cost so much as to render the scheme impracticable for the county. If I had not got the experience of a drainage operation in the county, I might be inclined to think the Department was right, but in one of the areas which the Department had inspected, Rinn and the Black River, they estimated £16,000.  The engineers of the Department recommend that the work should not be carried out, as it would not be economic.  In that area there is a Drainage Board existing by statute, which is bound to carry out certain drainage operations. Their operations are naturally limited, but since the report of the Board of Works engineers was made they had, of necessity, to carry out a minor drainage work.  It consisted of one and a half miles of river which, according to the Board of Works engineer, would cost £170.  The actual cost to the local authority was £37.  The work was satisfactory to all concerned, and it was all that could be desired by the local people whose lands were affected.  In view of that I am forced to the conclusion that the Department are operating on too large a scale, <Col N="1215" /> and that their ideas are out of keeping with the requirements of the poorer counties.  I feel that the Department would do well to arrange its entire system and to adopt methods more in keeping with local requirements.</P>
      <P>For a number of years representations have been made regarding an improvement in the Shannon navigation north of Athlone.  I put a question to the Minister to-day asking if it was proposed to do anything, but the reply gave no indication of any sincerity on the part of the Department to undertake an investigation of the position. The amount of goods carried north of Athlone is shown by the tolls collected for the year 1929, amounting to £203 14s. 8d., while the expense of maintaining the system for navigation purposes amounted to £904 12s. 11d. As a business transaction, surely that would be considered a bad one.  I do not suppose any business institution would stand for its maintenance for any length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were the only objection perhaps some argument might be used in favour of its retention, but when we take into consideration that in County Leitrim the retention of the navigation represents the flooding of over 4,000 acres, according to the engineer to the board of health, and that the estimated loss amounts to £13,450 yearly, then one has some difficulty in understanding the mentality of the Department that continues the operation of the system.  It shows a lack of business consideration apart from the losses inflicted by this flooding.  These figures do not include other counties affected, like Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon and parts of Sligo.  In view of these circumstances I think I am quite justified in saying that whatever useful work the Board of Works may be doing in other ways I am not in a position to say anything kindly or good of it in this respect.  It would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider that the people affected in these areas have a right to some consideration beyond the stereotyped reply that a Deputy gets when he puts down a question regarding this Department. <Col N="1216" /> The officials in the Department may be very kindly disposed and very good, but they are bound by an amount of red tape in the form of statutes dating back hundreds of years.  Another aspect of the case is that farmers find themselves compelled to pay drainage rate as a result of which they suffer from increased flooding.</P>
    <P>As long as the Shannon is maintained at its present level no expenditure in the way of drainage can have an effect other than to increase the flooding on a section of the people living close to the river.  That section has a right to consideration in a practical form, and they insist on some relief being given to them.  If the Parliamentary Secretary by some means could destroy all the parchments that tie his hands and that regulate these matters he would really be conferring a service on the community. A navigation system that dates back for centuries may be of historical value, but for practical purposes its retention should not be tolerated by a modern department. After the remarks that were made by a Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches dealing with the improvement of Leinster Lawn, and spending money there, I hold that a far more useful purpose could be served by the Department bringing itself up to date and dealing with problems of drainage, as they affect the bread and butter of the people down the country.  It may be a very good thing to suggest expenditure on Committee rooms for the Opposition &mdash;and I presume the Parliamentary Secretary was thinking of their value as a result of the coming General Election&mdash;but I suggest to the Department that the money is required for other purposes, and that this Department should make itself a useful asset to the State.  This Department insist on retaining a service in the form of navigation that is being run at an annual loss of practically £700, and at the same time results in the flooding of 4,000 acres.  That is a proposal that does not appeal to me for a vote of confidence.  I feel that I am justified in taking the stand I am taking until this Department <Col N="1217" /> loosens itself from the ties and from statutes that have influenced it since the time of Queen Elizabeth.  Until it does so, it will be my duty to vote against this expenditure.  As far as I know it is not a useful Department. I take this opportunity of making this protest, and I will vote against any money being spent on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that £100,000 is being voted for building and enlarging national schools.  That is a very substantial sum.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain, if he can, why there is such great delay in making grants to responsible persons for the building of schools.  Complaints are very general from managers that although they have complied with all the necessary requirements, they cannot get the money released to go on with the work.  While I feel that this matter would be, perhaps, more properly raised on the Vote for the Minister for Education.  I think it right to mention it now.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, when the Ministry of Education are asked what is the cause of the delay they are not beyond saying that the delay rests with the Board of Works.  I am, therefore, giving the Minister an opportunity of saying what exactly is the position with regard to the grants and what is the cause of the delay.  We have been told quite recently, in fact, since the 1st April, that there was no money available at the moment.  I do not know whether it is that they were waiting for this Vote to be passed.  I do not think that is the reason because some money was voted on account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is a type of case where more than the ordinary two-thirds grant is being given.  It appears that there is some special sum named beyond which grants will not be given. When that sum is exceeded no grants will be given.  That is a mystery to most people.  Nobody knows anything about it until the particular case crops up and then the applicant is told that the amount of money available for these special cases has been exceeded. Nobody knows how the amount of money is arrived at.  I would like to <Col N="1218" /> point out to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister, the necessity for revising these regulations for the giving of grants for school buildings. There are no statutory regulations tying the hands of the Minister in this matter.  While it might have been right and proper at some period that the locality would be expected to find one-third of the amount necessary to build a school, it does not at all hold that it is equally right and proper now.  In fact, it is the general opinion of those who are responsible for building schools that in the vast majority of cases the two-thirds grant from the Department is not sufficient in present circumstances and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to raise the balance of one-third to put up a new school building. There are very strong arguments in favour of granting the whole or a very much greater proportion of the amount necessary to build a school.  I do hope that the Minister will tell us what exactly is the reason for the delay in a great many cases in regard to school buildings.</P>
    <P>I see on page 53, where grants are made for arterial drainage that while there are several districts mentioned in the Estimates there is no mention whatsoever of the Robe drainage. That omission leads me to believe that there is no money to be expended on the Robe drainage this year.  I have asked questions and other Mayo Deputies have asked questions from time to time, with regard to the position of this drainage scheme that has been talked about as long as I can remember. Is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to say how the matter stands now or what progress, if any, has been made?  Can he say how soon the work on this scheme can be commenced? I think we had promises from time to time, not entirely official promises, that the work would be commenced inside three months.  These three months have long passed.</P>
    <P>There was, at least, I think, a hint in some of the Minister's most recent answers in this matter that the delay lay with the county council. The Government have removed that obstacle, so they cannot any longer say that the blame rests with the <Col N="1219" /> Mayo County Council.  I would like to know what has been done and when the work is to be commenced. Quite a number of young labouring men go from that district to England and Scotland at this time of the year&mdash;from now on until June.  These men are anxious to know if work on the Robe drainage is to be commenced this season.  That knowledge would help them to decide whether they are to go to seek work in England and Scotland or to wait for the work at home.  I need not urge, I am sure, the necessity for getting on with this work.  The importance of the work is accepted by everybody.  What I want to know is what is the position, and whether it is likely that the work will be commenced this season. If the Minister makes a statement it will help a great many of these men to decide whether it would be possible for them to get work on the Robe drainage or seek work in England or Scotland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a question in connection with the building of a school in Rosslare in my constituency.  I was surprised to hear that the Board of Works recommended to the manager of the school that the second lowest tender for the building of that school should be accepted.  I think the House will agree with me that that is a system over which no self-respecting Department would stand.  I could understand that attitude being taken if the firm which had the lowest tender on this occasion were a firm of mushroom growth.  But the firm that sent in the lowest tender in this instance had been established in the town of Wexford for fifty years.  I refer to the firm of O'Connor and Company. They have built up a large business in Wexford and amongst the contracts taken by them was that for the building of the Convent of Perpetual Adoration, Loretto College and Saint John of God's Convent.  They have also built additions to the two principal churches in Wexford.  If they were good enough for that I cannot understand why the Board of Works <Col N="1220" /> did not think them sufficiently well qualified to build a small national school in Rosslare.  The action of the Board of Works on the present occasion is a thing that the Ministry could not reasonably stand over.  I do not think it is fair to the contractor or fair to the school manager or fair to the tax-paying community.  When a firm of reputation, such as the one about which I have told the House, gives a lower tender than another I believe that tender should be accepted. Doing anything else than that is a form of patronage which I cannot understand, and I would like to hear a more lucid explanation than the Parliamentary Secretary gave at question time.</P>
      <P>The question of coast erosion has been raised by other Deputies.  We have had a Commission sitting on this question for two or three years, and the country would be now entitled to know what is the policy of the Government so far as coast erosion is concerned. So far as one can see it is merely a question of Nero fiddling while Rome burns.  For the last two or three winters, from Waterford along the eastern coast right up to Greystones, there has been grave coast erosion.  In my constituency, in Rosslare, a great deal of damage has been done.  Part of the public roadway has been taken away within the last winter. Surely we are entitled to expect now some result from the deliberations of that Commission.  That ought to be made known to the Dáil and to the public generally.  The people are beginning to think, and I fear with some degree of accuracy, that when a Government wants to shelve a question the method is to appoint a Commission. That has certainly been proved true in the case of two or three matters in this country recently.  I think the people are entitled to know what is the policy of the Government on this question of coast erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the money contained in this Vote is for dredging.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he thinks, in view of the demand made upon the Board of Works by different harbour boards in the State, that he has sufficient plant at his disposal.  Has <Col N="1221" /> he made any representation to the Minister for Finance with a view to getting more plant?  I know that in two or three cases where applications have been made to the Board of Works by harbour boards in the Free State for the use of a dredger on hire, the Board of Works were not in a position to grant the facilities asked for within a certain period, with the result that the harbours in question have been allowed to shoal up.  In the case of a tidal harbour, such as Wexford, there are only certain months of the year in which dredging can be done, and invariably it happens that the dredger is available for Wexford two or three months after it has been asked for, with the result that the work cannot be done in the time at their disposal. I do believe, even though a great many of the harbours in this country are not directly under State control, that a greater effort should be made by the Board of Works to provide facilities for these harbours, especially tidal harbours.  Some of the seaport towns in this country are making earnest efforts at the moment to develop their trade, and I must say that there has been very little help from Government Departments.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he considers the facilities at his disposal for meeting the requests of the various harbour boards are sufficient. I submit that it is his duty if he finds they are not sufficient to make representations to the Minister for Finance with a view to providing greater facilities.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I put down a question as to the advisability of providing Castlebridge, Co. Wexford, with a new Gárda barracks.  The position there is undoubtedly very bad.  The barrack has been condemned quite a long time by the sanitary officer, who has stated that it is a menace to the public health.  I was told on that occasion that it was proposed to build a new barracks.  I notice on the Estimate that while it is suggested that the cost would be £1,500 there is only included in this Vote a sum of £200 as a token provision.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that a <Col N="1222" /> token provision of that kind will be a long time making a Civic Guard barracks sanitary.  I do believe that matters of this kind should not be shelved as they have been done by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department. This place is a standing disgrace in the particular locality in which it is, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make an honest endeavour to have that particular job proceeded with this year.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I want to refer to; the ground has been covered pretty well, but I certainly would insist on an answer so far as the giving of the contract for the Rosslare National School is concerned as to why a tender other than the lowest tender was accepted.  I certainly think we should get a more satisfactory answer on that point.</P>

      <P>My experience of the Board of Works in respect of arterial drainage has not been very pleasant. Inspectors and engineers went to a good deal of trouble in our county some years ago, and they submitted proposals to the county council.  The proposed contribution of the Board of Works was considered generous at the time but the proposed work was turned down by the county council, with the result that the people affected suffered considerably through the flooding of their land and through the loss of the money they were getting in the shape of a free grant, which would have been spent to their benefit and the benefit of the workmen in the district. Having regard to what occurred on that occasion, I think it is useless for the Board of Works to proceed to deal with arterial drainage under the present system.  I think that they ought to take the initiative, and when they find that work is necessary do it and allocate the sum that the people benefited would have to pay.  I do not see any other way of dealing with it, because in the county council you have representatives of north, south, east and west, and a scheme that will only benefit one part of the county will not be supported by representatives from the rest of the county.  Under such circumstances I think the Board of Works <Col N="1223" /> should carry out such works in the interests of the people affected and for the national benefit.</P>
      <P>
        <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair</i>].</P>
      <P>There is another matter of very great importance that I wish to refer to.  It has to do with the Shannon in North Longford, portion of Roscommon and South Leitrim.  Unfortunately, this Vote has come more or less like the car before the horse.  For a considerable number of years much attention has not been paid to the Shannon.  Silt has collected before a number of arches to such an extent as to form islands, and the passage of the water is retarded.  I certainly think the Board of Works should pay attention to that matter.  Attention should also be paid to the locks and canals generally.  The lock gates are of a rigid type.  They are there for the purpose of holding water for the service of boats.  I think these gates should be removed entirely and a gate installed that could be manipulated with ease.  If the water rises to any considerable extent before those gates, they cannot be opened at all.  In such a case as that, when you have flooding in an area, the gates must remain so closed until the water subsides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to send some engineers down in order to consult with the people who are complaining about the flooding of their lands.  The old method of dealing with floods should not be allowed to continue.  At the present time the lands there are flooded to such an extent as to leave them of little or no value to the community.  It is an important thing that engineers from the Department should inspect those places.  They would be able to form a definite opinion as to the cause of flooding, and they could consult with the people.  In this manner a scheme might be arranged which would dispose of the existing menace.  The people should not be allowed to suffer such losses year after year.  For the last 30 years the people have been suffering, and the flooding, I may say, is getting worse every year.  The trouble is <Col N="1224" /> primarily due to neglect&mdash;want of regular attention to the Shannon in general.  I trust that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will look at this matter from the point of view of the people who are, at the moment, suffering very severely.  To remedy the condition of things down there may involve a good deal of expense, but the people, who live mainly by farming, cannot be expected to continue to suffer heavy losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that no provision has been made in the Estimates to deal with coast erosion.  There is no constituency in the Twenty-six Counties that has suffered more damage through coast erosion than Wicklow.  I recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works engineers have given us every sympathy, and they have assisted us financially by way of a small grant for relief work.  I certainly admit that very good work has been accomplished under that small grant.  However, if the local bodies do not receive a further substantial grant, it will be difficult to prevent additional damage being done during the coming winter. I will make a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, now that his engineers are there, and now that men are actually engaged on constructing protection works with the object of preventing further damage, to request the Executive Council to give us a further grant.  The local bodies have spent some thousands of pounds, and they are unable to give anything further by reason of existing depression, unemployment and high rates.  We believe it is the duty of the State to prevent serious damage being done. Such damage is bound to have an effect on the towns and on the business people and others.  If adequate protection is not afforded, it will mean a loss to the harbour, and that will reflect on trade and there will be further unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the dredger, there are complaints from some of the harbour boards in my constituency.  Their finances are limited, and while they appreciate the privilege of having the dredger, they are forced to pay for the <Col N="1225" /> use of the dredger from the date it leaves the port in Dublin until it returns.  They have to pay actually for the day when the dredger is anchored, but not working, in the harbour.  I think that the harbour board should be asked to pay only for the actual working days in each area.  The harbour boards should have some control over the dredger as to the particular place where it should work, and the amount of work that should be done in each area.  It is a great hardship on harbour boards with limited finances to have to pay for the use of the dredger over a period of a week when really only one day's work would be done.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will make some effort to relieve the harbour boards of liability in these circumstances.  The boards are quite willing to pay for the dredger on the days on which it is actually working in their areas.  It is possible that this matter has not been drawn to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary before.  Now that work is proceeding in Wicklow in connection with coast erosion, I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will endeavour to give a further grant so that additional good work may be done in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to one river in Roscommon, the Hind. The drainage of the Hind was carried out about four or five years ago at a time when an election was on.  If the work had been as satisfactory as the people expected, they would not raise any objection to paying for it, but most of the people living in the Hind river drainage area complain that instead of there being an improvement, the land is flooded worse than ever.  Undoubtedly near the town of Roscommon the land has been drained all right, but the people near the Shannon end have suffered very much.  It is a scandalous thing to ask them to pay for an alleged improvement.  The fact of the matter is that there was no improvement at all made on their lands by the drainage work that was carried out.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to have the place inspected again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, the procedure of the Department of Public Works is <Col N="1226" /> that they estimate what the improvement is likely to be and they ask the farmers to pay on that estimate.  If, instead of an improvement being effected, there is more flooding, then it is very hard to ask people to pay. I was in this particular district last Sunday and I met a lot of people who live along the drainage area.  They complained to me that since the work was carried out the flooding has been much worse.  I do not know whether they are correct in saying that the work was started at the wrong end and was not completed towards the Shannon end; they told me the work was carried out more at the source of the river and it was not finished towards the Shannon side.  That may be the case.  In all these cases I suggest there should be an examination to ascertain whether the estimated improvement has taken place before the people are asked to pay for the work done.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Connolly helping us out in regard to the Shannon question.  I know the position in North Roscommon and in Longford and Leitrim.  After the Deputy's speech I need say nothing more on the Shannon question.  I think we may expect good results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate whether the Department of Public Works intends to carry out the promise given to me some time ago regarding the drainage of the River Robe.  This matter goes back, probably, for over one hundred years.  Some time ago I was shown a cutting of a newspaper containing a speech made by the late George Henry Moore in 1864 in which he referred to the drainage of the Robe.  The Parliamentary Secretary made many statements in the House regarding the drainage of the Robe and some of the Cumann na nGaedheal representatives from Mayo have gone to South Mayo and made definite statements that the work was going to be carried out.  I presume they made those statements because they had guarantees from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy O'Connell's remarks about the county council, I can assure him&mdash;and he must be already <Col N="1227" /> aware of it&mdash;that the guarantee from the Mayo County Council, in respect of the carrying out of that work, was given eighteen months ago.  The county council were asked to guarantee a sum of £6,000.  They gave that guarantee, regardless of party.  It was given under the impression that the work would be carried out immediately. I understand the survey of the drainage area was undertaken but we have heard nothing about it since and no drainage work has been carried out in the area.  Undoubtedly this is a big grievance in Co. Mayo and the overflowing of the Robe results in damage to the extent of thousands of pounds every year.</P>
    <P>That is quite well known to everybody. It is well known to the Department of Public Works.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, to state definitely whether they have completely abandoned this scheme or whether they intend to make a start in the immediate future.  I would also ask him whether his Department has considered and finally given their decision regarding the making of an additional grant towards a drainage scheme carried out in what was known as the Sauleen drainage area in the Castlebar district. I have spoken to the Parliamentary Secretary regarding this matter.  He is aware that the cost of this scheme presses heavily on a lot of small land holders, many of whose valuations do not exceed £3.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say whether anything could be done towards their relief by the making of a further grant in aid of this scheme.  I should also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why it has been considered necessary to build a new Civic Guard barracks in Ballyglass area, and if it is the intention to establish an additional Civic Guard station there, seeing that already the Civic Guards are living only about one and a quarter miles from the barracks now being built.  Is it the intention that the Guards who are at present stationed about one and a quarter miles from there are to be removed to the new barracks, or are these additional barracks? <Col N="1228" /> If so, what is the necessity for this additional expense?  I would again impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the urgency of the necessity for draining the Robe.  I would like if he would state whether his Department have any sincere intention of carrying out the work, or whether it is to be treated as it was in the past.  When I went to the offices of the Department to inquire about it it appeared to me to be treated as a standing joke.  I should like to know whether the matter is to be attended to seriously in the future.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate an item for the care and upkeep of war graves.  I have no objection to spending money on the upkeep of war graves.  There is an old saying that nobody should speak ill of the dead, no matter who they are. That is a good saying.  I am not objecting to the care of the graves as such, but I do consider it rather contradictory that, in a country like this, it should be left to a few private individuals in this city, for instance, to form what is called a National Graves Association, and that they should have to go round begging and sending out circulars to raise the necessary funds for the care of what we consider the national graves of this country.  I consider it rather contradictory that a sum like this should be provided in our Estimates year after year when no sum is provided for the care of graves that can really be considered national, not only in Glasnevin Cemetery but in cemeteries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely a graveyard in the country where you will not find the grave of some veteran who took part, perhaps, in the land agitation or the Fenian movement or some of the older movements, or in which you will not find the grave of a man who took part in the struggles of our own time.  Recently, a friend from a foreign country asked me to bring him to St. Michan's churchyard in this city.  I saw there where the bodies of the brothers Sheares are lying.  Certainly the condition of affairs there is not one that any Irishman can be proud of.  I am given to understand that since the great Dr. Madden, the historian of '98, thought it worth his <Col N="1229" /> while to euclose the remains of the brothers in a coffin, nothing has been done.  I had also a few years ago occasion to visit the grave of a man from my own place who was imprisoned in Mountjoy, where he was serving a ten years' sentence for assisting the cause of his country.  Within a fortnight of his release he died, because of the prolonged imprisonment.  I paid several visits to Glasnevin before I could find his grave.  It is only since the founding of the National Graves' Association that any man working in the cemetery can point out the grave of that man. That is the objection I have to this sum.  While such a state of things exists regarding the national graves of this nation, I do not see why we should be asked to provide an annual sum for the upkeep of graves that are certainly not national.  I, for one, enter my protest against any such practice in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. M. Hennessy Mr. M. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to get some information from the Parliamentary Secretary on some of the sub-heads in this Vote.  I notice that under sub-heads C and D the Department of Public Works purchase a considerable amount of supplies&mdash;to the extent of about £220,000.  I desire to know whether these purchases are made, in the first place, by means of tenders open to the public.  If so, are these tenders dealt with by a committee of the Department or by a public committee similar to that which deals with tenders, say, in the trade department of the Local Government Department? A considerable sum is being voted for works of various kinds.  I would like that the Dáil should have more time to deal with the large number of sub-heads than it has.  As regards dredging, to which other Deputies have alluded, I think that dredging is a very extravagant item and, if I may say so, uneconomic.  I think that some of our port authorities in the Saorstát are coming to the conclusion that dredging is uneconomic.  I was wondering whether the Department had considered the giving of this dredging to some contractor, whether within the country or without.  A contractor would, I think, do the work at a considerably <Col N="1230" /> lower price than is set forth in this Vote.</P>
      <P>A previous Deputy referred to this Vote of £25,000 for British military graves.  I am glad he did.  This matter has been getting so much political advertisement recently that I would like that the Parliamentary Secretary should give the Dáil a very lucid statement on the whole question and set our minds at case.</P>
      <P>There is an item in the Vote referring to Dun Laoghaire harbour.  An annual sum of £20,000 is voted for the upkeep and maintenance of Dun Laoghaire harbour.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if that Vote is to continue interminably?</P>
      <P>£20,000 seems to be a very big sum for the taxpayers to devote to that particular harbour.  I think that it is 120 years since that Act was passed. I understand that a considerable amount of business is being done by vessels using that harbour.  Surely they pay harbour dues, berthage dues, or some other form of dues when using the harbour that would reduce the amount of this Vote.  In all the ports with which I am acquainted there are such dues as tonnage dues, berthage dues, and so forth, in order to relieve the port authorities and give them some revenue to maintain the port. Am I to understand that the vessels using Dun Laoghaire harbour do not contribute anything to the maintenance of that port and that the taxpayer has to provide annually a sum of £20,000 for its upkeep?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this rather extraordinary Estimate I hope before the Parliamentary Secretary replies that we will hear something from Deputy Heffernan, Chairman of the Economy Committee.  The total amount of this Vote is £678,000, and of that I find that £356,000 is being spent in Dublin and the balance, £322,000, throughout the rest of the country.  It is difficult on coming to Dublin and seeing the fine buildings which it contains to ascertain where room will be found for more of them in order that £356,000 may be spent in that direction. Compare that sum with the £51,000 voted for drainage purposes. <Col N="1231" /> £356,000 for building places in Dublin and £51,000 for the farming community throughout the country.  The more we consider the Estimate the more faults we have to find with it.</P>
      <P>In connection with the various housing schemes and housing grants we frequently hear comments here about the scarcity of money, yet we have a sum of £29,200 provided for supplying easy couches for sleepy Deputies.  I am well aware that when Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies are not allowed to speak here they must have somewhere to slumber out their leisure hours until the division bell calls them.  That sum would be better spent in providing accommodation for some of the families who live in one-roomed tenements in Dublin and other places in the country than in spending it on supplying better accommodation for tongue-tied Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that we intend spending £10,000 in the restoration of Civic Guard barracks in Cork city.  I think that the Guards there have more accommodation than they need.  I know some stations there where there are fifteen or sixteen rooms for thirteen men.  That ought to be sufficient without building a new mansion costing £10,000 this year, and an additional £6,000 next year, or some future year. That money is more badly needed by the unfortunate workmen of Cork for new houses, and if it were spent in that way it would give far more satisfaction. In my constituency, a sum of £1,500 is provided for the building of a new barrack in Whitegate.  I think that Deputy Hennessy hit the nail on the head when he asked how tenders for these barracks were received.  I know that within the last twelve months we required a doctor's residence at Whitegate, and we secured a beautiful house standing in its own grounds, with five acres of freehold, for £700, within a quarter of a mile of Whitegate.  If the South Cork Board of Assistance could purchase a residence of that kind for a doctor, with room for a dispensary attached, for £700, surely a barrack to house four or five Civic Guards could be secured from any of the seven residences which <Col N="1232" /> we were offered there without spending £1,500 on building barracks or rather on buckshee for the contractors, because that, I think, is what it means.</P>
    <P>For the Governor-General's establishment we have £7,000 provided for maintenance and supplies.  Does all that go in food for the Governor-General or is some of it going in extra buildings to house an increasing family or anything like that?  We are paying £4,150 for fuel, light, cleaning and water.  I think that a gentleman with a salary of £10,000 a year could surely afford to pay someone to clean his house without having to provide in this Estimate a sum of £4,150 for that purpose. I think that is absurd for a country like this.  Then we have a sum of £1,000 for new furniture.  I wonder is the grand piano included in that. The more we look into this Estimate the more extraordinary it seems.  There should be no occasion to spend £9,450 on providing fuel, light, furniture, maintenance and supplies for a gentleman with a salary of £10,000 a year. Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that we have turned yet another corner?  I consider that this Estimate is nothing more or less than a scandal. I do not wish to allude to it, as Deputy Walsh has already mentioned the matter, but in regard to this sum of £25,000 for the erection of headstones for the British military, I would like to know where these stones are being purchased.  On Monday last at a meeting of the Cork County Board of Health we had an application from this Department for permission to erect these headstones over different graves. Permission was granted on condition that the headstones were purchased in Cork.</P>

      <P>Considering that the money has been passed by the Dáil, a sum of £25,000 for headstones for British military out of the taxpayers pockets, I thought that certainly they should get permission to erect them on condition that they were purchased in Cork.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply as to where these headstones are being bought.  Is it a fact that the headstones are being purchased outside the country, and that we are actually paying the British for headstones to put over their own men?  I would like to hear that explained by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have looked carefully through the Estimates and I have found no sum to provide for the care and maintenance of the graves of Irishmen who were executed by those British military and whose bodies still lie in Cork jail.  I have seen no provision made in the Estimate for the care and maintenance of those graves.  I would like some statement from the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply on that matter. If we are so generous that we can afford to give £25,000 for headstones for those who shot them, surely we can afford something for headstones or for the care and maintenance of those graves.  I consider that this whole Estimate expresses the minds of those who unfortunately rule the Twenty-Six Counties at present.  We see that that mind is centred here in Dublin City and cannot by any possible means be got into the country, the mind of those who spend £356,000 in Dublin City out of an Estimate of £678,000.  I think that speaks for itself, for the mind of those people who spend this £356,000 on buildings and all the rest of it here, and who spend only £51,000 for drainage for farmers in the whole Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated at the commencement, before the Parliamentary Secretary replies, I would like to hear some statement from Deputy Heffernan and his Economy Committee.  He is Chairman of the Economy Committee.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig criticised the high expenditure of the Department, and asked why a reduction is not made in salaries, etc., and in the cost of the staff.  As the Deputy will see by the programme of works which we have in hand, there has been little or no decrease in the amount of work which we are doing at the present time, and accordingly we are not able to reduce the Estimate.  We expect later on, perhaps next year or the year afterwards, if no new works are undertaken, to be able to reduce the staff accordingly. At the present time we have many new works, Gárda Síochána barracks, new schools, etc., in hand; and there is no justification for any reduction in the staff or the expenditure thereon.  The Deputy dealt in particular with the Land Loans section, and he asked why, now that the Agricultural Credit Corporation had taken over most of our duties, we are incurring any expenditure under this head.  At the present time we are dealing with all cases under £20 valuation. Accordingly, while our expenditure has been considerably decreased we have still to keep up a considerable staff for dealing with land loan work under this section.  The Deputy also referred to the work on Gárda Síochána barracks, and thought that our expenditure in this connection was unnecessary.  I consider that this is one of the most necessary things with which we have to deal in the country at present, and one that has to be dealt with very expeditiously.  The Deputy also referred to the decrease in the amount for drainage maintenance. That £1,000 is not much more than a token Vote.  We do not expect to do anything under the Drainage Maintenance Act.  We have practically completed all the work which it is possible to do under that Act.  We had intended to do some work on the Corrib, and we were making available a grant of £10,000 for that purpose, but the Galway County Council refused to <Col N="1235" /> go ahead with the scheme, and there the matter drops.  As far as we were concerned, we were quite willing to go ahead.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cassidy dealt with the works in Buncrana, and he said that there was some objection taken locally to the fact that we started without any plans. The scheme in Buncrana was a bit rushed in the beginning in order to give employment.  On the representations of Deputy Cassidy and other Deputies, we decided to proceed with certain works that we knew would be required before the plans were completed. The plans are completed now, and the Engineer has satisfied the local council on all questions raised.  The Deputy also raised a point about grants for certain harbours.  We only give grants for harbours which are vested in the Office of Public Works. It would be much too big an undertaking to take charge of all the harbours in the country.  Some Deputy made a remark about the statues on the Custom House.  The Custom House is one of the great ornaments of the city.  It is an architectural masterpiece of its kind.  It is famous all over the world, and, I think, for the sake of the expenditure of a couple of thousand pounds, it would be a pity not to restore it to its original condition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde expressed the view that it was the duty of the Board of Works to provide extra space in the Dáil for Government Deputies.  That is a matter for the Deputies themselves. The function of the Board of Works is to carry out the instructions given to it.  If Deputies feel that there is any lack of accommodation, then it is their duty to make representations, and if instructions are conveyed to the Board of Works we will be only too willing to carry them out.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Deputy requires a room for himself.  Deputy Murphy raised a point about the fair wages clause.  We insist on that in all our contracts.  In several cases where it was not observed we dealt with the contractors <Col N="1236" /> and insisted on their carrying out the undertaking with reference to it.  Deputy Maguire seems to think that in the carrying out of our drainage policy we are inclined to proceed on too grandiose a line.  As I mentioned before, if the local people were satisfied to carry out these drainage schemes the work could be done much cheaper. Anything we do in that line has to approach very near perfection.  When our work is executed it is examined with a microscope by the local people charged with the benefits accruing to their lands, and if any individual thinks his land is not benefited to the extent that he has been assessed we hear all about it.  Deputy Boland gave us the opposite side of the case.  He complained that people in his area have objected to what they are being charged for the carrying out of these schemes.  I may say that has been our experience all over the country.</P>
      <P>People clamour for drainage schemes to be carried out.  While the work is in course of execution they are in ecstasies as to how it is being done, but when completed and the charge goes on them then we hear from them that their land has not benefited at all, and in some cases they complain that it has actually suffered as a result of the operations we have carried out.  The Deputy also referred to the question of navigation on the Shannon.  He seemed to consider that in our attempts to maintain the navigation we were keeping the country in that particular area flooded.  He referred to the old Tarmonbarry problem.  As I mentioned before, the lowering of the weir there would not really benefit the district. The difficulty there is the lack of cut, which is hewn from solid rock.  The cut is too narrow, and would not take away the water no matter how much the weir was lowered.  The cost of cutting through the rock would be so heavy as to make the undertaking hopelessly uneconomic for the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is dealing with the lack of cut south of Tarmonbarry weir, but the flooding that I refer to is north of Tarmonbarry weir.  There is an obstruction of eight feet, and it is that <Col N="1237" /> that is responsible for the flooding in the area that I have been speaking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Our engineers have reported that without doing something to deal with the lack of cut no benefit would result from any lowering of the weir.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Connell, I am not aware of any undue delay in the building of national schools.  We pay out the grant according as the work is done. No case has been brought to my notice at any time of undue delay in this matter.  If there is any delay it may be that the Department of Education, for other reasons, are holding up these schemes.  With regard to the River Robe, Deputy Walsh told us that the drainage of this river has been on the tapis for over a hundred years.  That being so, I do not see why Deputies should be anxious that it should be rushed in a few months.  The original delay in that case arose from the fact that it was not possible to get Galway and Mayo County Councils to submit proposals to us.  In order to carry out a complete scheme on the Robe it is necessary that Galway should petition as well as Mayo.  Galway has refused to petition.  The position there is that we cannot go ahead with a complete scheme because Galway has refused to co-operate.  We have made a thorough investigation of the area.  At present, we are held up owing to a legal difficulty as to whether or not we have the right to lower the level of the waters in Lough Mask.  There are various other matters too that have to be dealt with in detail before the scheme can go through.  Personally, I do not think we will be able to put the scheme in operation this year.  I will be very much surprised, however, if we cannot make a start next spring or next summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised a question with regard to a tender for the building of a national school in the County Wexford.  As I have said we did not accept the lowest tender.  We accepted the second lowest tender.  The difference between the two was only £2.  As I explained we are not in the position of deciding whether a tender will be accepted or not.  We are in the position <Col N="1238" /> that we merely give advice to the local manager.  We advised him that, in our opinion, the second offer was the better one.  We have had experience of the work carried out by this man.  He has always given satisfaction. From our knowledge, we did not consider the other man fit for doing work of this nature.  If the local manager wishes to disregard the advice we have given to him he can do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of coast erosion was also raised.  I believe that the Commission considering that question have reported to the Minister for Local Government.  It is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and not for my Department.  Our concern will be to carry out any recommendations that may be decided on, but we have no other functions in the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the lock-keepers on the Shannon.  Those lock-keepers have been pensioned on the same basis as the others, but they have of course received different annuities.  James Good has £21, John Magee £28, Simon McEvoy £33, John Crowe £13, David Madden £33, Michael Hackett £33, Patrick Gully £30.  In the case of John Ryan, who had less than six years service, a gratuity of £33 was awarded him.  The pensions were calculated as follows:&mdash; Wages, 13s. per week; value of house and lands, 4s. 3d. per week; bonus on above, 13s. 1d. per week; total, 34s. 4d., multiplied by years of service. That is the basis on which they were pensioned; it is the usual basis, and we could make no distinction between them.  There are, I realise, in these certain cases of hardship, but it is an old principle that hard cases make bad laws, and we cannot legislate for every individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I might point out that even on the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures it would seem that in the actual calculation there is some kind of discrimination, because some of these people got £30, while retaining their houses, which is certainly a very great thing for an ex-lock <Col N="1239" /> keeper.  In the case of Magee and Crowe, all their perquisites and wages have gone, and in the matter of Crowe he, after a number of years and following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, only got £13 to live upon in Killaloe; that is certainly something blue to look forward to.  In the other case the man got only £28. It certainly, at first glance, seems as if there was discrimination in connection with these men; whether that is so or not, I cannot say.  I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">

      <P>The Ancient Monuments Body has only very lately been brought together.  The first meeting of the Council was called by the Commissioners for the 10th September, 1930, and was duly held, the members being received and welcomed by the Commissioners.  Professor Macalister was unanimously elected as chairman, but I think the Deputy knows all that. Consideration has been given to the preparation of a list of monuments of interest and importance which, in the Council's opinion, are worthy of preservation, and some progress has been made with it.  The Council has put forward the considered opinion that a monumental survey of the whole country is a work of great importance and necessity, and has submitted a draft scheme supported by recommendations and a report upon what is being done in other countries in this way for the Minister's consideration. There are proposals for the encouragement of the public interest in ancient monuments and their protection and preservation.  This body has only been called into being for a very short time, and we cannot expect much results for some time to come.  They are preparing the ground for work later on.</P>
