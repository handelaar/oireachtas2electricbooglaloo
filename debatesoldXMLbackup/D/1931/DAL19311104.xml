      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if Post Office workers in the Dublin District, now dismissed, suffered any loss, and, if any, to what extent, by being graded according to service regulations, and, further, if the services of such workers were not of a continuous nature, what were the reasons for grading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan) Michael Richard Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Five of the temporary engineering workmen recently discharged in the Dublin area suffered reductions varying from 11d. to 2s. 9d. a week on being graded for skilled work.  This disparity was increased to 2s. 4d. and 4s. 2d. a week respectively as at the date of the termination of their employment.  Six other men received equivalent or slightly enhanced wages on re-grading, but at date of discharge they were in receipt of wages varying from 1s. 2d. to 4s. 2d. a week lower than their former rate as labourers.</P>
      <P>The reduction subsequent to re-grading in both cases was due to the fall in the cost-of-living bonus in the interval.  As labourers these men's wages were based on outside labour rates and were immune from fluctuations in the cost-of-living figure.  On transfer to the skilled scale they were given the highest starting pay permissible on that scale under Departmental regulations and any loss sustained by them subsequently was common to all Post Office classes paid on a basic plus bonus basis.</P>
      <P>The temporary grading of labourers as acting unestablished skilled workmen was necessitated by the work to be done under the Telephone development scheme.  Employment on skilled duties was sought after as the work was more congenial than that performed by labourers and furthermore increments on the skilled scale would ultimately have given a higher rate of remuneration than that paid to labourers.  No promise of permanency or continued employment was, however, held out to the men concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question does not state whether the Deputy refers to dictation in Irish or in English, or in both languages.  An element of competition enters into practically all the examinations conducted by the Secondary branch of the Department, and in such examinations it is essential that the conditions under which candidates are tested should be as uniform as possible. The conducting of dictation tests on uniform conditions at a large number of centres throughout the country would present difficulties which would more than counterbalance the value of such tests, and I am not prepared, therefore, to adopt the suggestion.</P>
      <P>So far as the Primary branch is concerned, the question as to the desirability of including dictation in the Primary School Certificate Examination will be submitted for discussion to the Primary School Certificate Committee, but it is not proposed to include dictation in examinations for scholarships, etc., conducted by the Primary branch.</P>

      <P>The claim for compensation in respect of 1930, by the occupiers of the Pollagh meadows covered practically the whole of the meadow lands in this area and, having regard to the abnormal rainfall in 1930, the engineers had to survey the area and determine how much was affected by the Shannon scheme, and how much through excessive rainfall. The staff had to postpone the completion of this task in order to prepare plans for the protection works decided on some time after the Deputy's question of 4th December, 1930.  In the meantime a claim for losses in 1931 has been received and is under investigation. It is intended to deal with the 1930 and 1931 claims together in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe (for the Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.  Close attention has been given to the condition and prospects of this season's potato crop since the beginning of June, when blight made its appearance and spread rapidly throughout <Col N="795" /> the country and when the weather conditions generally seemed to threaten the crop.  Warnings were conveyed to the farmers through every available channel that the crop was liable to fail unless early and thorough spraying was carried out.  This propaganda was successful inasmuch as spraying was done more thoroughly than ever before, but unfortunately a certain number of growers took no notice of the Department's warnings, with the result that their crops were partially destroyed by blight.  Except on very wet land wherever growers paid heed to the Department's warnings, crops have turned out better than was expected.  As the crop is only now being raised, it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the total yield.  It is, however, known that yields are very variable.  Reports indicate that many growers have average crops, while others, mostly small growers on wet land, have a serious shortage.  In the areas in which potatoes are grown mainly for sale, it is anticipated that the crop will be fully 75 per cent. of the average.  On the whole, while there may be local shortages, there seems from the information at present at the Department's disposal no reason to fear that the produce of the potato crop will be insufficient to meet requirements for household consumption and seed purposes, especially as, owing to the high prices prevailing, much greater care is likely to be taken of the crop and less of the produce fed to live stock.  In districts where there is a shortage of potatoes, pig and poultry-keepers are likely to utilise other feeding stuffs in substitution for potatoes.  For this purpose wheat offals and the principal cereals available are quite suitable.  These foodstuffs are procurable this season at relatively low prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is introduced because it is feared that actual or expected changes in tariff policy in Great Britain might lead to the sudden diversion to this country of large quantities of goods or the removing out of bond in Great Britain of large quantities of goods, and of their being dumped here in such a way as, perhaps, for months ahead, to deprive certain industries of their market. Under this Bill it is proposed to ask for power so that the Executive Council may by order in such cases impose customs duty.  That duty would have to be confirmed by the Dáil within ten sitting days after its imposition or it would lapse.  It is proposed to substitute in this case for a resolution of the Dáil in Committee on Finance an order of the Executive Council.  The Bill would have to be confirmed by legislation in the same <Col N="805" /> way as ordinary customs duties or it would lapse.  If the First Reading is agreed to I propose to circulate the Bill immediately and to take the Second Reading at 7 o'clock, when Deputies will have an opportunity of reading the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> As I have already stated, the Bill arises out of the change in the tariff policy, which seems almost certain to occur in Great Britain.  We know, particularly in certain classes of goods, that there were labels or other notices in English on them.  Perhaps I had better not mention any particular class, but there are goods prepared for sale in markets where English is spoken, and the labels and other notices attached to these goods are in English.  If they are suddenly shut out of Great Britain the tendency of those who manufacture them for export to Great Britain would be to send them here as far as the market here could absorb them in any reasonable period.  In many other countries there is power in existence for the Executive to impose a customs duty in order to prevent dumping, without going through the ordinary legislative procedure. As a rule, in all cases some investigation by a committee precedes the imposition by the Executive of a duty, but in the peculiar circumstances which we are faced with, it would not be possible to have that investigation in advance.  We might get word that steps had been taken to impose a duty in Great Britain, or even that manufacturers who export goods to Great Britain feared there was going to be a tariff imposed there immediately, and that they were diverting their goods here.  If we were to delay there might be a case even within two or three days where very large consignments of goods might be landed here, to be sold at very reduced prices, and in such a way as to prevent manufacturers here having the normal market they would have.  We came to the conclusion that there was no way to face this difficulty except by the Executive taking power to take the initial step of putting on a duty.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that within ten sitting days after the imposition of the duty by Order the Resolution must be approved by the Dáil; otherwise it lapses.  Then a Bill ratifying the taxation must be introduced within the next twenty sitting days of the Dáil and the legislation confirming it must be passed by Dáil Eireann within four months of the making of <Col N="807" /> the Order; otherwise it lapses and any duties collected under it must be repaid. As I said, elsewhere the usual procedure is to have an investigation by some sort of Board or Committee before the duty is imposed.  The close proximity of this country to England, and the fact that labels or wrappers on these goods are printed in English, makes this the natural place, when goods are refused admission to England, to dump such goods.  Because of these circumstances it is necessary to be able to act here more rapidly. We believe there are many cases where there might be a measure of doubt as to whether the duty should be continued at a particular rate or whether it should be continued at all for any length of time.  At any rate we propose to enable the Executive Council to submit to the Tariff Commission immediately after a tariff has been imposed the question of its continuation, variation or termination, to get the Tariff Commission to hear the evidence that is available, and to present a report at the earliest possible moment, because the object of the Bill is not to prevent the importation of cheap goods, provided it is a legitimate importation and provided the goods are not being positively sold here below the cost of production and in such a way as to make it impossible for the Irish manufacturers to compete. So that where there is any doubt about the absolute need for the tariff the intention would be to refer it immediately to the Tariff Commission for investigation.  Meantime, whenever necessary, steps will have been taken and such a duty will be imposed as to make it impossible for this market to be flooded with such goods.</P>
    <P>I do not care to mention any particular class of goods though I think there is one that I might mention because I had occasion to refer to them once before with regard to this particular point.  I remember the British Parliament some years ago changed the incidence of the customs duty on matches.  It had been imposed on one basis and it was altered to another basis.  The effect of that would have been that if we had not <Col N="808" /> changed our duty, foreign matches which had been intended for the English markets and which could no longer have got in at minimum rates or at favourable rates, would have been dumped here in such quantities as would have put the factory which operates here out of commission or out of work for a period.  We felt obliged on that occasion to adjust our tax so that the basis of admission here would be the same as in England.  One of the reasons why those matches which could not have got in at favourable rates to England would have been sent here was simply that the notices on the boxes were in English and the matches were intended for a market where English was spoken.  That would apply to other classes of goods. It is absolutely certain that if there were sudden tariff changes in England on any very large scale quantities of many classes of goods which would not ordinarily have reached this market, would be diverted here to the disturbance of trade and the injury of our manufactures.  It is a very good thing to get goods cheap, but it is a bad thing to get dumped goods, which, while they might benefit consumers for a while, would permanently destroy a source of wealth in some manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>1.&mdash;(1) That a customs duty at the rate of two shillings and sixpence the hundredweight shall be charged, levied and paid on all oats imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 24th day of October, 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though oats were included in the Second <Col N="809" /> Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>2&mdash;(1)  That in lieu of the duty of Customs chargeable under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926), there shall be charged, levied and paid on all oatmeal imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 24th day of October, 1931, a Customs duty at the rate of six shillings the hundredweight.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though oatmeal were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  That in lieu of the drawback payable under Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1927 (No. 18 of 1927), there shall be allowed as from the 24th day of October, 1931, on the due exportation or the due shipment of stores for use as stores of any goods in the manufacture or preparation of which in Saorstát Eireann any imported oatmeal chargeable with duty under this Resolution has been used a drawback equal to the duty paid under this Resolution in respect of the quantity of such oatmeal which appears to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been used in the manufacture or preparation of the goods.</P>
    <P>(4)  That in allowing the drawback under this Resolution the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may, in order to facilitate trade, modify or dispense with all or any of the requirements of Sections 104 and 106 <Col N="810" /> of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, as to the giving of security and the examination of the goods.</P>

      <P>We are glad to see that this tax on oats has been introduced even at this late moment.  Deputies will remember that on 20th November, 1930, there was a motion introduced here by the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties.  The motion was defeated by the Cumann na nGaedheal and Farmers' Parties combined and the Independent members.  There were other matters mentioned in the motion besides oats&mdash;bacon, butter and barley &mdash;and it was pointed out at the time that the area under oats in the Free State had been declining, and that it was thought by those who introduced the motion that unless something was done to protect the home market for oats the area would decline even further and that as a consequence tillage in general would decrease.  It was the 1930 crop which we were dealing with at that time.  When the motion was introduced last November there were 643,000 acres under oats. We are now informed by the report that has just been issued that for the year 1930-31 there was an excess of imports of oats over exports to the extent of 496,000 cwts.  The report goes on to inform us that it is estimated that this year there will be something like 617,000 acres under oats so that there was a very big reduction of the area under oats this year as compared with last year.  We are informed further by the Tariff Commission that at least the tariff will have the effect of supplying our own needs in oats, that it may not have the effect of increasing production beyond that point, but at least it will have the effect of our growing sufficient oats for our own requirements.  If the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the members of the Farmers' Party and the Independents had as much sense last November as they <Col N="811" /> appear to have this November we could have something like 52,000 acres more under oats than we actually have.  That is rather a big thing.  As a matter of fact the Tariff Commission go on to calculate the amount of labour that is involved in growing oats, and according to their estimation the number of hours of manual labour given for the growing of oats would be equivalent to the labour of 20,000 men.  Take the 52,000 acres I spoke of that we would have grown in this country.  If the Cumann na nGaedheal members and the Farmer members had as much sense last November as they have now it would mean the full time employment of 1,625 men.  Can this country afford to allow their T.D.s, whether they are Cumann na nGaedheal, Farmers' Union or Independent to follow the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture into the division lobby and for a political motive deprive the agricultural population of such an advantage as it would have if it had another 52,000 acres of oats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind some of the members of the opinions given at that time by some of the Deputies and the Ministers here on the growing of oats. The Minister for Agriculture said that his attitude was that this tariff did not matter twopence.  He was referring to the tariff on oats, barley and eggs. Having given that lead, he was followed in the same opinion by Deputy Bennett, the Minister for Justice and Deputy Gorey.  They all said this tariff did not matter twopence.  The Minister for Agriculture went further and said &ldquo;the only effect of placing a tariff on feeding barley or oats so far as I am concerned is to still deceive the farmer and induce him to go on with an economy that is completely unsound.&rdquo; I presume that members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party here and the members of the Farmers' Party who are left are going to go into the Division Lobby and vote for a tariff on oats.  They are going to deceive the farmer by putting a tariff on oats&mdash; those members who were not going to deceive them last year.  They had the greatest concern for the ethics and the morality of the question last year, but <Col N="812" /> now they are going to deceive the farmer and induce him to go on with an economy which is completely unsound. Surely the economy in this country has not changed, and surely if there was deception last year there is deception this year.  What has changed?  Is it that the members of the Farmers' Party are now prepared to deceive the farmer and to induce him to enter on an economy which is altogether unsound? The leader of the Farmers' Party, Deputy Heffernan, must take a national view on this question because Deputy Heffernan is leader for the whole country.  He does not represent a constituency like the ordinary farmer. He represents the whole country, and must take a broad view.  He says &ldquo;so far as this tariff is concerned it is simply an appeal to the prejudices of the farmer.&rdquo;  Deputy Heffernan, I presume is going to appeal to the prejudices of the farmers this year. The motion was rejected on 30th November, and there was nothing more heard about it until we had an election in Kildare, and it was reported that as a result of certain representations and threats made by a group of farmers in South Kildare a tariff was promised on oats.  Some of us do not believe those stories always. We are told that the Minister for Agriculture promised the farmers of South Kildare a tariff on oats if they would vote for his candidate.  The election was on 29th June, and, strange to say, there was a notice in the paper on 9th July to the effect that there was an application for a tariff on oats put in by the Executive Council and, we presume, on the advice of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>We find amongst those who are in favour of the imposition of a tariff &ldquo;a group of tillage farmers in the southern area in Kildare,&rdquo; a most extraordinary thing to put down in these Tariff Commission reports.  As a rule you get such people as a County Committee of Agriculture or perhaps a group signing themselves the Farmers' Union of a certain county or perhaps a committee of merchants who might be involved, but no description could be given to these except a group of tillage farmers in the southern area in <Col N="813" /> County Kildare that were in favour of the tariff.  They got it.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister for Agriculture in speaking here on 20th November last said that the effect of the placing of a tariff on oats would be still to deceive the farmer and to induce him to go on with an economy which is completely unsound.  I am inclined to believe that the Minister was quite sincere in what he said because nothing could be better proof of that than the fact that when the County Kildare election was on this group of tillage farmers in the southern area of Kildare were told that if they voted right there would be an application for a tariff on oats.  It was still to deceive the farmer and to induce him to enter on an economy which was unsound. Also in favour of the imposition of a tariff was another group, the Irish Beet Growers' Association.  A couple of years ago I remember when there was a controversy amongst people growing oats and grain in this country, the Minister for Agriculture said that it was an unsound policy to advise people to grow oats and barley for cash.  He said the Government had tried to meet that situation by giving them beet.  When they could not help those men who were growing oats and barley to grow the cash crop, he gave them beet. Now when they fail in beet he gives them oats.</P>
    <P>Last year the tariff was of no importance. That is what was said by people on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches.  The Minister said: &ldquo;My attitude to these tariffs is that they do not matter twopence,&rdquo; and the Minister for Justice, who came on afterwards, speaking on this question of a tariff on oats, said that a tariff on oats could not possibly raise the price. Deputy Gorey said that a tariff on oats is of such little importance that it is not worth talking about.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, against those opinions, which were very forcibly expressed here on the 20th November last, we have the Tariff Commission Report which goes to show that the effect of a tariff would be to put at least another 52,000 acres into <Col N="814" /> oats.  That is something worth talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Other difficulties were raised on the 20th November.  Deputy Heffernan said that even if you did place a tariff on oats, three classes of oats would have to be allowed in free of duty&mdash;imported seed, dry oats for racehorses and Canadian screenings. The Tariff Commission have examined each one of these items.  It is shown that there is no necessity whatever for allowing seed oats into this country. They have shown that we are capable of producing very good seed oats here, that we are capable of producing purer varieties of seed oats than the imported varieties, that the imported seed is not a pure line at all, but, as they describe it, a good commercial sample.  As the Commission point out, after five or ten years we would have much better seed oats as a result of the tariff, because it would induce certain farmers to grow good seed oats which they would expect to get a good profit upon.  In support of that, the Commission cite the cases of barley and potatoes.  There, an attempt was made to grow our own seed, and, as a result of that attempt, the seed produced now in the case of barley and potatoes is of a better variety than the seed which had been imported previously.  We have been asking for protection for oats as well as other things for a long time and we have no doubt whatever that this tariff will have good effects. The Tariff Commission say that it will have a good effect even up to a certain limit, if we do not want to go any further.  But there are certain interests against this tariff as they are against every other tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, a group of farmers in the southern part of Kildare and the Beet Growers' Association were in favour of it, but we have the Farmers' Union of County Meath in favour of the tariff and the Farmers' Union of Cork against it.  There is where Deputy Heffernan will be in a <Col N="815" /> quandary.  Deputy Heffernan has to try to please the Farmers Unions all over the country.  I do not know which side he is going to please on this occasion. The Farmers' Union representative for Cork will, of course, be with the Farmers' Union there, and the prospective Farmers' Union candidate for Meath will, of course, take the view of the local Farmers' Union.  But I do not know what Deputy Heffernan is going to do to keep all the Farmers' Unions on his side.  The Farmers' Union of County Cork may, of course, change its mind as it did in the case of the bacon tariff.  Having opposed that tariff in the beginning, they veered round in favour of it, and they may likewise favour the tariff on oats later.</P>
    <P>As in the case of butter and other tariffs, this tariff was introduced too late.  A number of farmers had sold their oats before this tariff was imposed.  We take it for granted that the intention of the Government, when applying for this tariff, was to give the benefit to the farmer and not to the merchant or corn buyer.  But, when the tariff was imposed, a number of farmers had already sold their oats at a very low price.  Since then the price has gone up 4/- per barrel, so that the merchants and corn buyers will reap the benefit of the tariff. Probably the majority of farmers have their oats still, but some of them are not going to get the benefit of this tariff.</P>
    <P>Last year, when discussing this question, we were told by Deputy Bennett that a tariff on oats would not be popular with the farmers.  Deputy Bennett challenged Deputy Davin to go down the country and preach a tariff on oats to the farmers.  We are all going to be in the same boat now. Deputy Bennett, Deputy Heffernan, and the rest of us will have to go down the country and recommend a tariff on oats to the farmers.  If we are to judge from the trend of legislation in this House, we may even go further. We are getting a tariff in favour of oats now.  There is going to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is going to be provision <Col N="816" /> made whereby the Executive Council can impose a tariff any minute they wish without consulting the Dáil or anybody else.  That will be a great convenience to the Government. It will not be necessary for the Minister for Agriculture to promise the farmers of Kildare that he will put on a tariff.  He can come back to the Executive Council and actually impose the tariff next day to show that he is in earnest.  The tariff that suits each constituency can be put on when a bye-election occurs. An anti-dumping law was referred to by some people to-day.  Before we got the Bill, I was told outside that it was an attempt to stop the dumping of Soviet goods here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were accused here, when talking about a tariff on oats, in November, of having a prejudice against the Soviet.  The Minister for Agriculture said that it was to Russia and not to the oats that we objected. Now the Government has come round to our side again.  I admit that our motion dealt with more than oats. The point may be made from the other side that we covered butter, bacon, barley and eggs, in addition to oats, in our motion.  Since then, butter and oats have been tariffed and there is an application for a tariff on bacon, which I hope will go through.  The only thing left is barley and all we asked in respect of barley was that it should be only admitted under licence. They were 100 per cent. against us last year.  Now they are 80 per cent. with us.  They are coming round to our view and with a general election coming we may have them 100 per cent. with us within the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be certain benefits under this tariff.  The Tariff Commission gave fairly definite proof that we will be in a position, at least, to produce the amount of oats that we require at home.  That according, to their figures, would mean about 52,000 acres additional to the amount sown during the present year.  That is a definite advance.  Apart from that, according <Col N="817" /> to their figures, the amount of employment given on an acre of oats&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>On an acre of oats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They give the number of hours&mdash;82.  This will mean the equivalent of full-time employment for 1,625 men.  That is a large number of men.</P>
      <P>There would be as the Tariff Commission points out a good market for seed oats.  Men would be inclined to get some pure line seed from the Agricultural College, Glasnevin, or from somewhere else, and grow it carefully, harvest it carefully, and thresh it carefully, and be able to sell that seed at a good price.  It would certainly be a distinct advantage to a number of farmers to get the price that people in Scotland, or England, or elsewhere, were getting for what was called imported seed in this country up to this.  That was for purely commercial oats, and not for pure seed oats which we hope to produce here at home. That imported oats came usually to about 30s. a barrel.  In some of the returns given here the farmers put down the cost of their seed at 30s. per barrel.</P>
      <P>We are also told in this Report that the objections raised do not amount to anything.  We are told that those responsible for the Report do not believe that racehorses would be anything the worse for consuming all Irish oats.  Deputy Heffernan may not agree with that; at any rate he did not agree last year.  Horse trainers, horse breeders, and racehorse owners came up here and gave evidence and they admitted that they could run their horses all right on Irish oats; and if, in a very wet season, as the Report says, they are able to import, say twenty-five per cent. of the quantity of oats used, it will not amount to a very big burden on the owners of racehorses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big objection that was made to the tariff was that there were certain people who keep cattle, calves, pigs and poultry, who had to buy from their neighbours a certain amount of oats for their needs.  Now it will be quite possible for those people to grow the <Col N="818" /> oats they require themselves, or if they are prepared to pay the price that oats will go to they can buy it for themselves.  Another class of people who are users of oats in this country are the owners of traffic horses.  They raised no objection to the tariff.  They did not appear before the Tariff Commission. And as the Report states it will be possible for them also, if they find the oats to be getting too dear, to replace it by other feeding stuffs. Really there is no big objection placed against this tariff on oats whatever so far as the Tariff Commission is concerned. I am very glad that this tariff has been introduced, although I do say that it was a little bit late. It was certainly three or four weeks late, and because of its being three or four weeks late, the advantage to a certain extent at any rate&mdash;I do not know to what extent&mdash;is going to the merchants who purchase oats rather than to the farmers who grow it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has gone to great pains rather to make fun of those who voted last year against the tariff and to take it for granted that they were of the same opinion still. Deputy Ryan asked a number of questions. He asked what is the reason for this tariff.  I take it that one of the reasons why this tariff might be argued for would be in anticipation of what the Executive Council are asking powers for because of happenings in another country.  The whole answer to the tariff question, as some of us tried to point out the last time is this: that if we consider for ourselves its operation in this country alone, there can be no argument for it.  As far as one can see the exports from this country will be the finished farm products, live stock and live stock products; and if we raise the price of oats to the person who is feeding beef, etc., and producing poultry without that person getting any compensation in the way of a better price for his exports, then he is carrying a loss, and is not getting any benefit from the tariff.  If we were to judge this as far as operations in this country are concerned, I think the tariff will fail.  Deputy Ryan argued that oatmeal has gone up to the amount of the tariff; so has oats gone <Col N="819" /> up by the amount of the tariff; and we must anticipate that the price of oats will be put to the extent of the tariff.</P>
      <P>The other question which he asks is in regard to butter.  Wherein has the tariff benefited the butter industry?  I work a farm on which we raise milk and we have got no benefit whatever this season from the tariff on butter. And except we get a better price for the butter we are exporting, and for our oats, then the tariff on oats will be just the same as the tariff on butter &mdash;it will not yield anything to the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can quite agree with Deputy Haslett's method of argument because I think that what we are faced with in this country is just what England was faced with&mdash;a huge deficit balance. That is the real issue that we shall have to deal with.  What England has been doing and what we have been doing all along is that we have been buying a great deal more than we could pay for.  I think that this tariff is a step in the right direction, and of course, it will be followed by a great many more steps in this direction, and I hope we will continue on this line until we make a definite effort to reduce the trade deficit balance.  I expect that it will be very heavy during this coming year and will be more than the people will be prepared to meet.</P>
      <P>If this process is to continue and the Minister for Finance intends to continue it and adopt a rather more rapid method than we have adopted so far, it is proof that we have been wrong here in the last nine or ten years.  With regard to the anticipation of what is to happen in other countries all I have to say is that we should have anticipated that long ago.  So far as butter and livestock and all farm produce is concerned I believe that in the end 75 per cent. of this debit balance has to be made up by the farmers.  It has to be made up by them out of their savings, and these savings will by the end of December next have completely vanished.  Then they will not be able to sell any more of their assets or their savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I think that this should have been considered long ago by the Minister for Agriculture.  Meath is one of the counties one would expect would be most against tariffs.  But the farmers of Meath are in support of this tariff on oats.  There were only one or two Meath farmers who breed horses who are opposed to it.  I admit that we had very bad weather in the last couple of seasons and the crop had not been properly saved.  In such a year the oats grown here is perhaps not ideal for horses.  Canadian and Chilean oats are not used by pretty expert racehorse trainers in other countries. I know that fifteen or twenty years ago in this country there was no such thing as Canadian or Chilean oats used.  Irish oats are appreciated in other countries.  We had expert trainers of horses in this country fifteen or twenty years ago, and it was rather strange that they did not use Chilean oats.  They used Irish oats.</P>
    <P>I do know something about hunters and racehorses, though I seldom go to a race meeting of late; but it surprised me when I went to a race meeting some time ago to find how imperfectly trained and turned out most of the horses were.  With one or two exceptions I found that out of nine or ten horses there was nothing approaching what the racehorses of fifteen or twenty years ago were.  I would say that certainly this is owing to the method of feeding and to the food the horses got.  Some of the horses looked quite slobby.  If we succeed in ousting foreign oats we will find that our horses in Ireland will take the place they used to take years ago.  So far as the growing of oats in this country is concerned I am quite satisfied that we can grow as good oats as can be grown in any country in the world. The oats grown here is the oats that should be fed to animals in this country because it is the most suitable, taking into consideration climatic and other conditions.</P>
    <P>I am glad that people have to a large extent to admit the necessity for this tariff.  It is hard for people to apologise; I am not going to emphasise that point, but later on we will have other points.  I think that from the point of view of the lowering of the adverse <Col N="821" /> trade balance this tariff is a good sound step.  I am sure other steps will be taken later on in the same direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House at any great length.  I notice there has been a great deal of glorification about this tariff on oats.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party, led by Deputies Aiken and Ryan, are quite confident that the tariff is going to be the salvation of the farmers of this country.  The Fianna Fáil policy is a policy of wholesale tariffs on agricultural products and wholesale tariffs on industrial products, and they tell us that that policy is going to save the farmers and to save the country as well.  I am not going to apologise, nor am I going to give any explanation as to why I said in the past that a tariff on oats can, in my opinion, have ultimately very little effect on the farming industry.  But I am glad for two reasons that this tariff has been imposed because in the first place it is going to be of some little advantage to the farmers even though that advantage is going to be shortlived. In the second place, and this is the most important reason to my mind, it is going to prove an education to the farmers of the country just as the tariff on butter has been an education to the farmers of the country.  It is quite clear that the advantage which will accrue from this tariff is going to be a slight one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We happened during the past couple of years to have an increase in the imports of oats.  That is due probably, at least possibly, to the climatic conditions of the past two summers which have been very unfavourable to the growth of oats.  The weather has been very wet and the oats did not fill out very well.  The result is that there has been a definite shortage in the homegrown oats and ordinary commercial oats has had to be imported.  The effect of that has been that the price of oats in this country has been fixed by the price of imported oats.  Now the recommendations of the Tariff Commission in this matter of oats will, in my opinion, keep out to a very large extent this importation of <Col N="822" /> oats with the consequent effect that the requirements of this country being greater than the actual amount of oats in the country, the price of oats will go up to an extent.  It will to that extent help the farmers who grow oats for sale in depressed times.  I am very glad of that.  In so far, however, as regarding this as a permanent advantage to the farmer I have very little hopes that it will be so. Deputy Ryan and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies who are glorifying this tariff on oats to such an extent as to suggest that it is going to be the salvation of the farmer, will find after this tariff has been tried out that that cannot possibly be the case.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 42 of the Report of the Tariff Commission on this matter clearly explains the effect of this tariff on the price of oats in this respect. The paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>If production and the proportion thereof retained for use on farms were such that there would be an insufficient home supply to meet non-agricultural needs the price of oats on the home market would, <i>prima facie</i>, advance in the event of a tariff being imposed.  Then if the higher price obtainable proved attractive to growers, a larger acreage would undoubtedly be placed under oats, and production would once more be increased to the point where a surplus would be available for export.  This process would gradually equate the home price to the world price, and a grower, producing oats with a view to sale as a cash crop, would in the long run find himself no better off than he was before the tariff was imposed, and would not, therefore, be inclined to increase permanently the area under oats.</P>
    <P>That paragraph makes my point perfectly clear.  As soon as the amount of oats produced in this country by the farmers exceeds the home requirements of the country we will immediately have an exportable surplus, and it is an axiom of political economy that the moment you have an exportable surplus the price received for the article sold in the country must equate with the price got for <Col N="823" /> that part of the product which is sent out of the country.  A gap has to be filled before we have an exportable surplus, and that gap is a comparatively small one.  In 1930-31 we had an excess of imports over exports of 495,875 cwts.  That is the biggest gap we had.  But that was a gap in a very bad season.  There will be a gap again this year.</P>
    <P>Probably the effect of this tariff will be to stimulate the farmers to grow more oats next year.  As soon as the farmers grow sufficient oats to fill up that gap there will again be an exportable surplus.  I see no reason to think that the farmers will not in the coming season under the stimulus of an increased price which has been brought about by the imposition of this tariff, grow sufficient oats to fill up the gap.  Then we will have an exportable surplus.  As soon as we begin to export our home price is regulated by the external price.  The result will be that we will then be in the same position as we were before the tariff was imposed.  I am not objecting at all to this tariff on oats. If I have been wrong in my forecast as to the result of this tariff on oats I will be glad to be found wrong.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to see a tariff imposed on any agricultural product on which a tariff could effectively be imposed and the effect of which would be to increase the price that the producer will get for his article no matter how small that increase may be.  I say in regard to this as in regard to any other article of agricultural production that the possibility of the imposition of tariffs being a benefit is very slight indeed.  It is doubtful now whether the tariff on butter has had any definite permanent effect whatever in increasing the price the farmer gets for his butter.  There was some advantage the first year.  Similarly the tariff on oats clearly has increased the price this season; the price this season will be definitely higher than if a tariff had not been imposed.  The effect is temporary.  As soon as our production of oats exceeds the requirements of the country and as soon as we begin to send oats abroad, it is no longer any advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> I do not maintain that the advocates of a tariff on oats or butter or bacon, or any other article of agricultural production, are consciously dishonest in their demands for a tariff on these products. I will accept it that they are honest, that they believe that, at least to some extent, it would benefit the producers.  But they are dishonest from this other point of view.  They are dishonest in that they are endeavouring to cover up their whole policy of wholesale tariffs by pretending that the salvation of the farmers lies almost exclusively in tariffs on agricultural products, and that equal advantages will accrue to the farmers' industry as will accrue to the owners of industrial concerns by the imposition of tariffs on industrial products.</P>
    <P>With the possible exception of the demand for a tariff on bacon, behind which there are some real farmers, in so far as there has been a demand for tariffs on agricultural products, to my own knowledge spread over a period of many years, that demand has been helped on by, financed, and the propaganda has come to a very large extent from, those who are interested not in the agricultural industry, not in increasing the prices of agricultural products, but in getting tariffs for industrial products. That is the danger in a demand of this kind; that is the danger of a policy such as is advocated by Fianna Fáil when they state that this is going to be of immense benefit to farmers. Doubtless if we had a general election within the next two months the farmers could be told, and some of them might be foolish enough to believe, that a definite material permanent benefit would accrue from this tariff, but by this time twelve months their eyes will be opened and they will realise that the tariff was to a large extent a passing advantage and that the advantage will almost have passed away.</P>
    <P>My attitude with regard to tariffs on agricultural products, taking this particular tariff as an illustration of the general policy of tariffs on agricultural products, is that if on examination by the Tariff Commission&mdash;and I believe that applications for all tariffs should be examined by the Tariff Commission <Col N="825" />&mdash;it can be shown that a tariff will at least do no harm to the community, it ought to be imposed.  It can be stated definitely that this tariff cannot do any harm to the agricultural community.  It will temporarily stimulate production and to that extent it is an advantage.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Ryan and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, who say that they stand for agriculture, I am not infallible. I have learned certain things from the Tariff Commission.  I have learned that certain things were not quite as I thought they were.  That in itself is an advantage.  I have learned, for instance, that there is no great opposition from racehorse owners and trainers to the imposition of a tariff; that in an ordinary dry year Irish oats is as good as imported oats for racehorses.  I am glad to learn that, and to have the point cleared up.  In expressing an opinion on these things I was expressing the opinion conveyed to me by people who should be in a position to know. Apparently they were wrong.  Apparently they were not prepared to carry that opinion before the Tariff Commission. In so far as the point is cleared up it is an advantage to know that there is no particular reason why foreign oats should come in to feed Irish racehorses.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to find that it is not necessary to import foreign oats for seed purposes.  A great many practical farmers were uneducated and uninformed on that point.  I was uninformed.  I thought it was necessary to introduce foreign seed oats, that there was a tendency for oats grown over and over again in this country to get run down and unsuitable, and that we had to refresh our stock occasionally by the importation of foreign oats.  That is an opinion commonly held and expressed by practical farmers.  We now find it is not necessary, that we have pure lines of seed which can effectively meet our demands.  In so far as that may help to create a new branch of the farming industry, it may be helpful.</P>
    <P>There are certain disadvantages attaching to this, but I think they are <Col N="826" /> of a temporary nature and that the people who are suffering from these disadvantages will be prepared to put them against the general benefit. There is the disadvantage that in certain parts of the country farmers do not grow sufficient oats to meet their feeding requirements.  I think that a little education will be helpful to those farmers in that respect.  They will find that they can fully substitute maize on a cheaper basis as a feeding stuff for oats, and that oats will meet their requirements.  Again I say that I am glad that this tariff has been found to be of some use.  It is undoubtedly going to be of a temporary advantage to the farmers, and I welcome it to that extent.  The idea, however, that it is going to be of permanent advantage is unsound and based on unsound reasons.  I would suggest to farmers that they should accept this for what it is worth, but I do not think there is anything, beyond an advantage of one or two years until we produce all the oats we require in this country, that will accrue to the farmers.</P>

      <P>It is evident that Deputy Heffernan was labouring under terrible difficulties in trying to speak for and against the tariff.  As far as he has gone he has stated that tariffs should be supported because they do no harm.  That is going a very short way in favour of this tariff.  My view in this matter is that the tariff on oats must be taken entirely from the farmers' point of view.  There are two classes of farmers in the country: the man who grows oats and feeds all the oats he grows and the man who does not grow oats and who buys oats for feeding purposes.  To the man who grows oats and feeds all the oats he grows it does not matter a row of pins whether there is a tariff imposed or not.  To the man who has to buy oats for feeding purposes the question of a tariff is one of rather serious importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no benefit going to accrue to the farming community or agriculture generally from a tariff on oats.  But there is a class of man who sells oats to the farmers who do not grow oats.  Somebody called him a <Col N="827" /> merchant, but in most cases he might nearly be called a gombeen man, and it is this man who is going to get the benefit out of the tariff on oats this year and next year.  Deputy Heffernan says that this year there will be an immediate advantage to the farmers. I question that very much.  I know cases where farmers have already sold oats at 8s. per barrel, and the men to whom they sold the oats are now going to get 14s. or 16s. a barrel in consequence of this tariff. Not a penny of that will go back into the land.</P>

On the whole I agree with Deputy Haslett that the condition of affairs has not changed in the slightest, and that <Col N="828" /> there is going to be no advantage from this tariff no more than there was from the butter tariff.

Deputy O'Hanlon did not say whether he was going to vote for the tariff or not.  Deputy Haslett tried to make a little bit of excuse for the Government changing its mind.  He tried to fool the House into believing that the reason the Government brought in the tariff was because England went off the gold standard.

      <P>There is nothing about that in the Tariff Commission's report. There was no anticipation of the National Government in England or of the present conditions in England when the Government referred the application for a tariff on oats to the Tariff Commission on the 3rd June last.  The reason the Government referred the matter to the Tariff Commission as to whether there should be a tariff on oats is that the people were waking up to the fact that the country have to organise in order to force the Government to do something. The tillage farmers in the town of Kildare at the last by-election showed the Government what they thought of them.  I had the pleasure of speaking to some of them during the by-election <Col N="829" /> and I told them that if they got together now there was an opportunity of forcing something out of the Government, and that if they wanted to insure protection for agricultural products the surest way to secure it was to turn down the Government candidate. If they were wise enough to do that, and if the farmers of the country would only follow their example in the next election they will see that something will be done for them all. Before the Kildare by-election the Minister for Agriculture was pro-Russian oats.</P>

      <P>The fundamental aspect of the whole situation has been neglected by the people who used to be opposed to a tariff on oats and who now accept the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to it, and that is the big advantage that is going to come out of this tariff, that the farmers are going to have a better chance of remaining in the production of 650,000 acres of oats.  Deputy Heffernan cannot see any advantage. He can only see that we can produce another 50,000 acres on last year's standard, but the fact of the matter is if nothing had been done to protect the farmers against the dumping of foreign oats the acreage under oats would have shrunk still until we would have gone out of the whole 650,000 acres, just in the same way as we went out of the 800,000 acres of wheat formerly produced in this country. Everyone knows perfectly well that the present system of tariffs on oats is not going to help us to export oats. The tariff on oats if high enough will safeguard the home market for the 650,000 acres of oats produced last year.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out the Tariff Commission calculated that that will mean an equivalent of full time employment for 12,000 or 13,000 men.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey admitted that he had not read the Tariff Commission's Report.  I advise him to read it and if he does he will there see that the farmers are going out of production of oats owing to falling prices, and if these prices continue to fall they would go out until nobody was left in the production of oats just as there is hardly any one left in the production of wheat for the same reason.  If we do not take steps to safeguard other agricultural products they will go out of production as the country went out of the production of wheat and as it was going out of the production of oats until something like this was imposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan is learning a little. He was glad enough to find that Irish oats was good enough for Irish racehorses and was good enough for seed for Irish soil.  Hitherto the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Heffernan always took up the attitude of sneering at Irish cereals, but if the farmers of the country get another opportunity of telling the Minister and Deputy Heffernan what they think of them, they will find their education advanced a little further and they will be glad to find in a couple of years after the Fianna Fáil Government has come in that Irish wheat is good enough for Irish people and that Irish soil is good enough to grow wheat for the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> The Tariff Commission having been touring did what the Minister for Agriculture wanted them to do:</P>
    <P>The observations which we have made and the evidence presented to us by farmers and agricultural experts show that the preparation and manuring of the land as well as the seeding and harvesting operations, are, in general, carried out in an efficient manner; and furthermore good yields are obtained over a wide range of soils and under varying climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>The farmers can only have an opportunity of getting a whack at the Government at a by-election.  The Government may tell the Tariff Commission to find that the climatic conditions are good enough for wheat and good enough for barley and that the farmers will be as efficient in the growing of these cereals as in the growing of oats.  It is a positive disgrace that this tariff was delayed until the middle of October.  It is a downright disgrace.  The people who did not get the tip that the Government were going to put a tariff on oats have suffered badly.  Of course the men who got the tip to buy cheap oats knowing that the Government were going to put on a tariff have profited.</P>
    <P>The Government referred the application to the Tariff Commission on the 3rd June, and it was known by people inside that they had determined to put a tariff on oats.  The Minister for Agriculture promised a tariff on oats two days before the Kildare by-election. The Government had made up their minds then, and the announcement that a tariff was going to be put on should have been made before small farmers in bad circumstances were forced to sell their oats.  It is a downright disgrace that that was not done, as the worst off farmers have been the worst hit over the delay.  I do not know whether we will have an opportunity on the Dumping Bill of discussing the question of protecting other agricultural products in the coming year.  A large number of visitors are expected, and they will eat a large amount of Irish produce.  If some <Col N="832" /> effort is not made to protect Irish produce these foreign visitors will be fed on foreign products.  Perhaps we are a couple of weeks later than the south of England and the Channel Islands in the production of certain things, but vegetables and farm produce that are in season are good enough for any foreign visitors that come to this country.  I hope the Government will make sure that our farmers will not be left with a surplus of vegetables and potatoes about the time that the Eucharistic Congress is held.  There is no reason why foreign vegetables should be let in during that week as we can produce all that are required.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to sympathise with those alleged members <Col N="833" /> of the farmers' party, and with some of the alleged Independent members in this House who opposed our motion for a tariff last November, were it not for the fact that now, twelve months afterwards, they get up here to try to justify their actions, and the actions of the Government, in accepting this same tariff.  It reminds me of the man who was playing pitch and toss, and who had two two-headed pennies, so that no matter what way they came down he won. Deputy Heffernan seems to have learned a lot since this time twelve months.  I can assure Deputy Heffernan that the farmers will teach him a few further lessons, and one is that no land in this country is too good to be sub-divided, just as they taught the Government that we should have a tariff on oats.  Deputy Haslett asked what benefit had the farmers derived on the tariff on butter.  The Deputy said that although he produced some butter he did not see any benefit from the tariff.  I am sure that Deputy Haslett knows the frame of mind of farmers who ask: what benefit are we deriving from the Dairy Produce Act?  what benefit are we deriving from the Eggs Act?  what benefit are we deriving from all the other Acts that were passed to improve our conditions? The Deputy used an argument in this case that he has contradicted in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon says there are two types of farmers, one who grows oats as a cash crop, and the other who grows oats for feeding purposes.  He says that a tariff is of no benefit to the latter class.  Deputy O'Hanlon must remember that if the farmer who grows oats for feeding purposes can buy imported oats cheaper than he could produce them, then he is going to cease producing oats.  That is one of the weakest arguments that could be advanced.  I know something about farming, and I know no farmer who is going to be so foolish as to continue to grow oats when he finds that he can buy foreign oats cheaper.  That is only common sense, and we are often told by those on the opposite Benches that farmers are common sense people. It seems to me that they have much <Col N="834" /> more common sense than Deputies on the opposite Benches.  Deputy O'Hanlon says that the tariff is ill-timed. When we introduced a motion last year it was also ill-timed, and the Deputy voted against it.  Last week Deputy O'Hanlon talked about Asiatic rats and about Communism.  He said that as a Catholic he was going to wipe out all trace of the Asiatic rat, yet the corn and the wheat that is produced by the Asiatic rat is good enough for Deputy O'Hanlon and for the people of this country, if we are to follow his line of argument.</P>
    <P>He was going to wipe out all trace of the Asiatic rat, and yet the corn and the wheat that is produced by the Asiatic rats is good enough for Deputy O'Hanlon and the people of this country. If you follow his line of argument he is going to take from the Asiatic rats, to whom he referred last week, all the corn and the wheat which they produce and leave our own people walking about with their hands in their pockets looking for Home Help. That is the sort of reasoning and argument that we get from people who talk and prate about the farmers.  Honest to God, they would give you a pain in your heart.  I have been here for the last four years and I wish the people in this House would go before the farmers and tell them what they stand for.  They criticise us because we do not appreciate the position, because we, who are farmers, who were bred, born and reared on farms and who know what the farmers' position is, do not appreciate the position.  They tell us from the Chair of the Manager or the Editor, what the farmers' position is and what it should be.  We will get rid of that soon I hope.  The farmers of my county grow oats and they feed it.  I would not say but that they buy some, but even if they do, anyone who goes through the county which I represent and sees farmer after farmer being driven out leaving a farm derelict, must agree that there is something wrong.  You can take several districts in any county and you will find the farmers as a result of the prevailing conditions and as a result of the policy that has been adopted by this Government leaving their farms derelict. You find the homes and the <Col N="835" /> houses in which families were reared lying derelict with the roofs falling in. If that sort of thing is going to continue, if the people are going to be driven off the land, then what we have understood as good national policy, as long as I can remember it, means nothing.  We want to get the people on the land, but as a first step we must ensure that those now on the land remain there.  That is why we are in favour of a tariff policy.  We have a much greater appreciation of the farmers' position than the alleged Leader of the Farmers' Party who talks about land in Tipperary and tells us that it is too good for sub-division.</P>

      <P>I regret that this tariff has been introduced so late in the day. Of course the Minister for Agriculture was so busy with his harvest, as was stated in the Press, that he had not time to think where the other farmers of the country were going to sell their harvest.  Of course the other Ministers were too busy in other countries fixing up the fight between the Chinese and Japanese to think of anything at all in this country.  The delay in the introduction of this tariff has cost the farmers in my county something like £37,000.  In September the farmers in my county threshed and had to sell their oats.  They grew 103,000 acres of oats last year.  In September the price for white oats for feeding was £5 and for the merchants £4 10s. per ton.  It is now £6 10s. per ton.  We can take it that at least one-fourth of their produce was immediately to pay the tribute to John Bull. You can take it that 25,000 tons of oats were sold at a loss of 30s. per ton to the farmers.  That would amount to just about the same sum as the votes of the six members of the Farmers' Party cost the farmers of the country this year in regard to the relief of rates.  They cost practically the same amount as the £37,000 that was lost to the farmers because the Ministers would not come back from their holidays for one day to bring in this tariff on oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan told us of his attitude in regard to this tariff and that tariff.  The farmers of the country have very little thought of what Deputy Heffernan's opinion or attitude on anything at present is, and I can promise him that when the next election comes along the indication of appreciation we have here will be missing.  The farmers of County Tipperary do not stand for the 400-acre farm that will not be sub-divided. Deputy Heffernan stated to-day that he was very doubtful whether this tariff would be of any use next year, and that the farmers will go back again to the old method and will not grow any more oats.  Deputy Heffernan loses sight of the fact that if we only increase the production of oats to meet the amount imported last year we will give employment to 1,625 men.  He ignored the fact that 1,625 men have to be kept on Home Assistance, which comes out of the farmer's pocket. That does not matter, of course, to the man who talks about 400-acre farms&mdash; the man who solemnly told us a few moments ago that if racehorse owners were against the tariff he would oppose it.  He does not represent the farmer; he represents the racehorse owner.  I hope they will give him a good horse to take him away quickly after the elections.</P>
      <P>Speaking for a county which produces one-sixth of the total amount of oats grown in the Free State, I welcome this tariff, late as it is. It will undoubtedly be of benefit. Deputy Heffernan, who comes from Co. Tipperary, doubts whether we can grow proper seed and states that we would want fuller education in that respect. I bought seed in his county three years ago, from his colleague Deputy Hassett and it was the best seed I ever got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He told them to buy maize.  That is the teaching we get from the Leader of the Farmers' Party.  Some capital was made here out of the fact that the Farmers' Union in County Cork opposed the tariff on oats.  A paid official of the County Cork Farmers' Union came to Dublin and made a speech against the tariff on oats in alliance with the grain merchants of Cork.  Immediately he returned he was attacked by his Farmers' Union Executive, of which Deputy Donovan is chairman, for daring to misrepresent the farmers of Cork County in Dublin.  The following week at a meeting of the Cork County Agricultural Committee a resolution was also passed in favour of the tariff on oats.  This famous gentleman's proposal was turned down.  So much for the power of the Farmers' Union in Cork.  It is about time&mdash;and I am glad even on the eve of the General Election&mdash;that this proposal was brought in and if the closeness of the General Election has no other good effect than to bring in this tariff and the tariff that Deputy Gorey is looking for,&mdash;he voted against it last year&mdash;the tariff on bacon&mdash;we will all be grateful also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the nearness to the General Election will also bring in a tariff on foreign barley we will be also pleased, but it is extraordinary to see the conversion that occurred here since the 20th November, when we had solemn statements made here by the gentlemen who will vote now in favour of it.  I am glad to see that we are such good missionaries and that we have power of conversion and that the leader of the Farmers' Party, who voted against a tariff on oats last year, is going to vote in favour of it this year.  He stated last year that he was opposed to a tariff on oats.  He talked about the extra cost.  He voted for a tariff on rosary beads, the only tariff he ever voted for.  I must congratulate the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party on the new converts we have got <Col N="838" /> lately.  It is said that there is more joy for one converted sinner, but I do not know.  There is always a very grave doubt with regard to sinners, and I am afraid when people catch a hold of sinners of this description that they will put them in limbo for a while.  I am sure when the farmers catch Deputy Heffernan in the country that they will remember not the deathbed repentance but the actions here during the last eight years and what those have cost the farmer.  It has cost the farmers of Cork County £45,000 in relief of rates.  Owing to the extended holidays of the Minister they were not able to bring in this proposal until the 4th November and that cost the like £37,000 this year.  They have suffered that through the absolute neglect of the gentlemen who are too well paid and cannot do the business they are paid for.</P>

      <P>It is customary to make allowance for party political speeches. The object of that class of speech is to distort and to make the situation as unreal as possible.  It is said by some Deputies of responsibility&mdash;Deputy Ryan &mdash; I do not mean some of the other Deputies&mdash;that people on these benches have been converted.  There is no conversion or no change of attitude.  The attitude last November, the November before and the November before that, and as long as this Dail has been in existence, has been that tariffs should be decided upon.  The motion was that they should be decided upon without any examination.  We voted against that motion and supported the principle that tariffs must be examined before they are decided upon.  Play has been made of the loss the farmers this year have suffered because the tariff was not imposed earlier.  It was not because of any delay in the tariff.  It was because of the climatic conditions in June and because the oat crop was 40 per cent. below the average.  A bag of oats, instead of weighing from 17 to 20 stone, will not weigh this year any more than from 13 to 15 stone.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did and 21 and 22 <Col N="839" /> stone.  A sack of oats may weigh 22 stone.  It is decent oats certainly.  It is not because of the shortage in acreage, but because of the shortage in barrellage and production.  Last year the same difficulties prevailed.  The oats were flattened out and had to be cut by a reaping machine and only two-thirds were available.  That was the reason for our discrepancy.  One of the real reasons of this is to keep out communist oats and anything that will keep out communists and communism will have our support any year.  I never heard a funnier argument than that 1,625 people are going to be employed.  I make the statement no matter what is in the Tariff Commission Report, that the addition of this 52,000 to our 600,000 acres will not mean the increase of five people in employment.  We are not going to take up a ranch and grow thousands of acres of oats.  It is going to be grown all over the country.  Where there are five acres this year there may be five and a half next year or six at a maximum. A pair of horses and a plough will sow these and it will not mean an increase of one man in the country.</P>

The acreage too has been referred to. Previous to last year we had bad oats in this country and had an unusual influx of foreign oats.  The average imports for five or six years would amount to about 200 cwts. or a little over.  That would mean very little in acreage.  I would like to know what 200 cwts. would mean in acreage.  In a normal year it would mean very little and it not worth talking about.  I said that 12 months ago.  That is my opinion now and the farmer in two <Col N="840" /> years' time will know from experience that he will not derive five shillings advantage from this tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my county is concerned and so far as the working farmers there are concerned, this is a case of locking the door when the horse is gone.  In the case of a great number of the working farmers of Kildare, their oats are sold at 9/- or 10/- a barrel.  That was a big loss to them. The benefit of the tariff will go to the merchants and dealers who have bought these oats.  Whether they knew a tariff was coming on or not, I do not know.  The people entitled to the benefit of the tariff will be deprived of it.  Next year, according to Deputy Heffernan, the big increase in the acreage of oats, which he anticipates, will reduce the price.  He anticipates that there will be an exportable surplus which will bring the price down.  I suggest that the best protection against that would be to improve the price of barley by prohibiting the importation of a lot of the barley that finds its way in here.  In that way, much of the land which might be devoted to oats would be devoted to barley.  If the Fianna Fáil wheat policy was adopted, it might have the same effect.  I do not think it is too late yet.  The tariff on oats would be more effective and more beneficial if it were combined with prohibition of foreign barley and encouragement of wheat growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad that the Minister for Agriculture has changed his attitude so far as the importation of oats is concerned.  It is not so long since he expressed the view that the more foreign oats and the cheaper it came in the better for the farmers. This tariff indicates a change of attitude so far as the Minister is concerned. As late as last Friday week, he said that the tariff was going to be no good.  Although he introduced it, he believed that it would be no good. Immediately it went on, the price of oats went up 4/- or 5/- a barrel.  It will take more than the Minister's power of persuasion to convince the farmer who has since then sold corn that the tariff is of no use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question <Col N="841" /> of imperial preference.  I understand that imperial preference amounts to one-third the amount of the tariff.  That will mean that German and Russian oats need only be brought across the Northern Border in order to obtain the same preference as English or Canadian oats.  The Minister has no way of proving that the oats imported are Russian or German oats.  All countries will get the benefit of imperial preference so far as oats are concerned.  The tariff means that there will be no direct shipments of oats from Germany or other countries but that they will be landed at, say, Liverpool, and tran-shipped here.  They can then get the benefit of imperial preference without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>We hope the Minister will continue doing his good work so far as tariffs are concerned and that before long we will have a tariff on bacon, which the farmers all over the country are seeking. It is to be hoped that the Minister will introduce that tariff and that he will not condemn the farmers any longer to sell their pigs at 25 per cent. under the cost of production.  This tariff was too long delayed.  In Wexford one-third of the oats was sold at from 6s. 6d. to 8s. per barrel.  I hope that when the Government make up their mind to put a tariff on bacon they will put it on immediately.  During the bye-election in Kildare the Minister, as Deputy Aiken mentioned, said that he would give the farmers a tariff on oats if they would vote for the Government candidate.</P>

      <P>In this House, the mere contemplation of any tariff seems to generate in certain deputies a condition of intellectual vertigo.  Deputy O'Hanlon seems to be one of these. Deputy O'Hanlon gave us a remarkable example of arithmetic.  He said that oats were sold by a certain farmer at 8s. a barrel and that in consequence of the imposition of a tariff of 3s. a barrel these oats were going to be sold <Col N="842" /> at 16s. a barrel.  He argued from this &mdash;and if his premises are correct I agree with him&mdash;that the person who is going to reap the benefit of the tariff in this instance is the merchant who will sell the oats.  I did not quite appreciate what Deputy O'Hanlon's attitude was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave the Centre Party out of the question.  But the Deputy's attitude, as I said, to the tariff seemed to be based upon the fact that so far as this year was concerned it was not going to benefit the tillage farmer; it was not going to benefit the farmer generally.  It was only going to benefit the corn merchant. If that is the case who is to blame for that?  As has been already pointed out when we this time twelve months introduced a motion in this House calling for the imposition of a tariff upon oats that tariff was opposed by the three blind mice of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and Deputy Gorey.  The three blind mice are now running after the farmer and the farmer's wife, and they are going to go into the division lobby against Deputy O'Hanlon and vote for a tariff on oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three blind mice are now coming around to the Fianna Fáil policy, but they are not coming around quickly enough to save their tails, because the farmers and the farmers' wives in every constituency in the Twenty-six Counties at the coming General Election are going to serve the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Gorey in exactly the same way as they served the Cumann na nGaedheal candidates in Longford-Westmeath and Kildare.  Deputy Heffernan speaks in this House, in a chastened mood.  He is not infallible, he says.  He quite admits that he was misinformed when he opposed this tariff on the grounds that it was going to be detrimental not to the interests of the farmers but detrimental to the interests of the racehorse owners.  He admits that he was incorrect when he opposed this tariff on the ground that it was necessary to import seed oats in this country.  And having admitted that every single ground upon which <Col N="844" /> he opposed this tariff is, in the judgment of the Tariff Commission, an erroneous and misleading ground, he now comes along and says that notwithstanding the fact that he is not infallible and that he has been proven to be fallible, he still holds to the contention that this tariff will not be of permanent benefit to the farmer. And he bases his opinion I think on paragraph 42 of the Tariff Commission Report and upon this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If production and the proportion thereof retained for use on farms were such that there would be an insufficient home supply to meet non-agricultural needs the price of oats on the home market would, prima facie, advance in the event of a tariff being imposed.  Then, if the higher price obtainable proved attractive to growers, a large acreage would undoubtedly be placed under oats, and production would once more be increased to the point where a surplus would be available for export.  This process would gradually equate the home price to the world price, and a grower, producing oats with a view to sale as a cash crop, would, in the long run, find himself no better off than he was before the tariff was imposed.</P>
    <P>Agreed.  If the tariff is going to be effective at all, if it is going to enable the grower to meet all the requirements of the home markets and to have an exportable surplus, the tendency will be to equate the home price to the world price.  And what is the conclusion to be drawn from that? First of all that if this tariff is effective, in the long run it will not act in any way detrimentally to the farmer with whom Deputy O'Hanlon professes to be primarily concerned&mdash;the farmer who has to buy oats for feeding purposes. Because in the long run the price of the home-grown oats, having been equated to the world price of oats, that farmer even under a tariff will be able to buy oats in the Irish market at the same price as he would be able to buy it if the tariff were not there.</P>
    <P>The point that I suggest is of first importance is: At what point will the <Col N="845" /> home price be equated to the world price?  Will it be under present conditions when we have only 650,000 acres under oats and giving employment approximately to 20,000 people, or will it be when our production has increased to something over 1,000,000 acres, as in 1919-1920, and giving employment to 30,000 people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why say 1,000,000 acres?  In 1925 there were 666,000 acres under oats and according to the Tariff Commission there was an export surplus in that year.  Why does the Deputy propose to grow a million acres?  Will he explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to explain it.  We know that there were a million acres under tillage in 1919-1920 and a million acres can be grown again, and when we get to that point when we shall be able to influence the world market and when the home price will be equated to the world price and when our exportable surplus becomes great then we shall have not 20,000 people growing oats but at least 30,000 people; and in the meantime we shall have those two advantages, first of having 10,000 people additional in employment and secondly that the price of oats in the Irish market will not be above the world price and that no section of the Irish farmers will suffer in consequence of the tariff.  And even if one section of the farmers were to suffer, surely it is the duty of the Government to see that every section of the farmers is benefited and not one class only, notwithstanding anything which Deputy Heffernan has said and notwithstanding any of the specious arguments which may be advanced at present against a tariff.</P>
      <P>We have benefited one class of the farmers by the imposition of a tariff upon butter.  Deputy Gorey wants us to benefit another class of farmer who is interested in the bacon factories by imposing a tariff upon bacon.  If the dairy farmers of Limerick and the Waterford farmers and the Kilkenny farmers who are sending pigs to the bacon factories want protection so also do the tillage farmers of Leix-Offaly, Westmeath and Kildare require protection.</P>

      <P>Well the tillage farmers of Longford and Kildare and other counties that are in exactly the same way.  We cannot in a matter like this, if we are going to put certain sections and classes of the community under apparent disability by imposing tariffs, refuse to give fair play to other sections of the community.  If we put a tariff on one class of commodity we have got to equalise that so as to give fair play to the other classes of the community by imposing tariffs for their benefit as well.  In that way we will counterbalance any detrimental effect of the tariff on butter or of the tariff on bacon or the tariff on oats. In that way every section of the community will be benefited.  I am glad to say that already we have brought the Cumann na nGaedheal to two-fifths of the Fianna Fáil way and we are now going to get a tariff upon bacon.</P>

      <P>After the examination which we have made before we introduced our Motion.  We had examined the question of oats and we had satisfied ourselves that it was practicable to impose a tariff upon it. We satisfied ourselves it would be beneficial to the farmers to impose a tariff upon butter so as to protect the dairying industry.  We also satisfied ourselves that it would benefit the farmers to impose a tariff on barley and wheat and other things.  We introduced a motion in connection with wheat.  The Tariff Commission has said that in two cases the Fianna Fáil policy was right and that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Heffernan were wrong.  Later on when the bacon tariff will be imposed we will also be found to be right.  When these parties go to the country and when both policies are put before the people of this country and not before the Tariff Commission, I am sure that the people of the country will find that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is right and that the Cumann na nGaédheal Party <Col N="847" /> and Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Gorey and the rest of them will be thrown into exterior darkness.</P>

      <P>I have listened for the last couple of hours to the speeches of the Deputies on the Opposition side.  I do not think I ever before heard so much piffle in the course of two hours. I do not mind Deputies like Deputy MacEntee and people like him, who do not know the first thing about farming, talking nonsense about it, but when Deputies like Deputy Ryan, Deputy Allen and Deputy Corry, who is a farmer, talk about one-third of the oats being sold in November, and when they talk about first-class oats being sold at 6/- to 8/- a barrel, what am I to think?  These Deputies know that that is all nonsense and so much silly propaganda. Now what are the facts?  Not five per cent. of the oats is sold on the 1st November.  Not even three per cent. of the saleable oats is sold by the 1st November.  Not one barrel of oats was sold for 6/- or 8/-, and every Deputy on those benches opposite who happens to own a bit of land knows that all that sort of thing is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to get back to anything like reality when people get up and make silly political speeches and talk drivel for two or three hours. One wonders whether it is worth while at all to get back to the realities of the situation because one feels that he is speaking to people who though their knowledge is very limited still they are people who are bound to know something about these matters. Labouring these points is not a pleasant occupation for anybody.  Now to get back to the question of oats. Here are a few figures I want the House to remember.  We produce 13,000,000 cwts. of oats yearly.  I do not like to give the House statistics because as I have already said statistics have done more harm to the Party opposite than even seditious literature. But let me give a few modest figures. We produce 13,000,000 cwts. of oats in the Saorstát.  We require for seed cats 1,300,000 cwts.  We import seed to the amount of 120,000 cwts. to 150,000. <Col N="848" /> I wish Deputies would get these figures into their heads.</P>

      <P>That is the trouble. Would the Deputy try and understand them and try and put them into their proper perspective?  I want to give the House the imports figures and exports figures for the last five years, beginning with 1926-'27 and down to 1930-'31.  In 1926-'27 we exported 887,000 cwts; in 1927-'28 the exports were 1,400,000 cwts; in 1928-'29, 700,000 cwts; in 1929-'30 500,000 cwts; and 1930-'31 200,000 cwts.  These were our exports of oats for these years.  I have given the matter in round figures of so many hundred thousand.  Now in 1926-'27 we imported 260,000 cwts; in 1927-'28 150,000 cwts; in 1928-'29 241,000 cwts; in 1929-'30 286,000 cwts and in 1930-'31 695,000 cwts.  What is the moral of that story?  All this took place before this tariff was imposed. Taking one year with another the exports are twice as great as the imports.  There is only one year in which the total of the imports was greater than the exports and that was last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

      <P>A bad year and Russian oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Russian oats had anything to do with it. Russian oats does not count.  What counts is the cheap Argentine meal, as Deputies Allen and Ryan know.  Last year you had a particularly bad year for grain, and this year you had another bad year.  These years were worse than for a long time previously. This year was better than we expected it to be, but still it was a bad year.  In addition to the bad year last year, what had you?  You had Indian meal coming in last year at a wholesale price of £4 a ton.  You had wheat at 16s. a barrel.  You had imports of grain coming in cheaply. What is the result?  There is bound <Col N="849" /> to be a fall in the acreage under oats. Any farmer who would increase his acreage under oats this year, if he expected that cheap imports would continue, would be a fool.  Of course I will hear some Deputy saying, &ldquo;What are you going to do about it? What about unemployment?&rdquo;  Is not the moral of that story that the cheaper our imports are the better? The cheaper the grain and feeding stuffs come into this country the better.  Would we have a pig in the country at 38s. per cwt. unless we were able to get Indian meal at the cheap price we had been getting it? Does not every intelligent farmer know that it is only the cheap feeding stuffs with the price of butter, and other farm produce as it is, that saved the farmer from bankruptcy?  Every Deputy who knows anything at all about farming knows that.  The price of oats was cheap last year.  The imports of feeding stuffs were big. The acreage under oats this year is low.  Why is it low this year?  Because the people realise that they can get cheaper grain, and if we are not to have cheaper oats we are to have cheaper Indian meal, cotton cake, wheat, and other grains.  There is only one way to get permanently high prices for oats, and that is to impose a tariff on Indian meal.  The Deputies opposite know that.  Do they stand for that?</P>

If we are to impose tariffs on imported feeding stuffs in order to put up the price of oats, if we are to put up the price of feeding stuffs in order to put up the price of oats, what is going to <Col N="850" /> happen to our export trade and our export surplus?  It does not matter what is my view on tariffs or what your views on tariffs are, except that it is a little painful, having come to a mature age, to have to listen to a debate on tariffs here which I could hear in a debating society in University College, Dublin, when I was an undergraduate. You would expect a little more from people who have passed the age of from eighteen to twenty years, and who are in business themselves.  The sort of debate I have listened to here on tariffs I heard twenty-five years ago in University College, Dublin, when I was young.</P>

      <P>I said exactly last November what I say now.  I say now that apart from politics every Deputy on the opposite Benches knows that this tariff on oats is quite futile from the point of view of increasing the price of oats unless you accompany it with a tariff on wheat, as Deputy Haslett stated, and a tariff above all things on Indian meal.  Deputy Ryan almost came over to my point of view to-day.  So far from my being converted the conversion has taken place on the Benches opposite.  Deputy Ryan said that it would make no difference except that it would bring about 40,000 or 50,000 more acres of oats.  It would make no real difference in price in the long run, he admitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I knew that before.  Deputy Ryan read paragraph 42, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If production and the proportion thereof retained for use on farms were such that there would be an insufficient home supply to meet nonagricultural needs, the price of oats on the home market would, prima facie, advance in the event of a tariff being imposed.</P>
      <P>That is, of course, the temporary effect.  I am talking of the permanent effect.  I shall come to that later and spend some time on it.  The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Then if the higher price obtainable proves attractive to growers, a larger acreage would undoubtedly be placed under oats, and production would once more be increased to the point where a surplus would be available for export.  This process would gradually equate the home price to the world price, and a grower, producing oats with a view to sale as a cash crop, would, in the long run, find himself no better off than he was before the tariff was imposed, and would not, therefore, be inclined to increase permanently the area under oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what you said.  However, let me clear it up. Let me put the position.  I am dealing now not with the temporary increase in the price of oats, but with the permanent increase in the price of oats. I can afterwards deal with the temporary increase in the same way as we had a temporary increase in the price of butter.  I am dealing now with the permanent increase.  I understood Deputy Ryan to admit that whatever the reasons might be there would be no permanent increase.  He says he admitted no such thing, and I accept that.  All I am concerned to point out is that that was the case that the Tariff Commission made&mdash;that there would be no permanent increase in the price of oats.  That is their case.  That is obvious to everybody who knows anything about the subject.  It is obvious to everybody that there can be no permanent increase in the price of oats by a mere tariff on oats, and that <Col N="854" /> the only way to bring about a permanent increase in the price of oats is by a tariff on Indian meal, cotton cake, wheat, and all other cereals coming into the country.</P>
      <P>Let us come now to this question of the increase of acreage.  There is no doubt that our crop of oats is short this year.  Why is it short?  As I pointed out before, it is short because cheap cereals came into the country. What are the cheap cereals?  Indian meal, largely.  When will an increase in acreage come about?  An increase in acreage will come about again when the cheap cereals are no longer available. A tariff on oats will not have the smallest bit to do with it.  There is a fall in acreage this year because this year follows last year when cereals were extremely cheap.  If the cereals remain cheap, next year there will be no increase in the acreage under oats, and there will be a slight rise, as a result, in the price of oats.  If, on the other hand, cereals go up, there will be an increase in a year or two in the acreage of oats, and you will have the price of oats here equating to the world price.  This tariff will make no difference&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent&mdash; to the price of oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. I said last November that this tariff would not make twopence difference to the farmers and they realise that already and they know that way it will make no difference.  The position about this tariff is exactly the same as regards the tariff on butter.  I would not waste time debating whether we put on the tariff at the right time or not.  I know that we put on the tariff on butter exactly at the right time, at the beginning of the winter, which was the only time at which it would increase the price.  Deputies opposite who say to the contrary know that they are talking nonsense.  We put on the tariff on oats in the month of November, not only before any quantity was sold, but exactly the right time again.</P>

      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I do not mind the Deputy.  What happened in regard to <Col N="855" /> butter?  Here I am talking with some knowledge of the subject.  I control four or five creameries, the largest creameries in Ireland, and the Department of Agriculture has been selling butter all the year.  What was the immediate effect of the tariff on butter?  The immediate effect was that it put up the price of butter to the full figure of 4d. imposed by the tariff.  What will be the immediate effect of the tariff on oats put on in a period of shortage?  It will put up the price to the full amount just as was the effect of the tariff on butter. What was the effect of the tariff on the price of butter in May, June, July, August, September and October, up to the present day?  It did not fetch one penny more than in England &mdash;no not even one halfpenny.  I did not wait nearly for a year to find out that and point it out to the Irish farmer.  For four years I have been pointing out to them that taking the long view and considering their production as a whole tariffs could be of no use to them; that taking their production of livestock and livestock products, of which they have a surplus on every item, while there may be temporary rises due to dislocation immediately after the tariff was put on, tariffs can be of no use to them because they would not put up prices and will not increase production. The butter tariff proved that up to the hilt and it is Deputies sitting on these benches who can come in and say &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened?  Is there any Deputy sitting on the benches opposite who will deny that the price of butter this year has been the same as the price of butter in England, notwithstanding the tariff here and notwithstanding that it was a prohibitive tariff?  Does anybody deny that?  We had a lot of nonsense before the event, but we put the duty on and it amounts almost to prohibition.  What has been the result?  Not one single penny more on the price of butter.  The price of butter is 15/- per cwt. this year less than it was before the tariff was put on at all.  What good was the tariff then? It is quite true that the farmers got <Col N="856" /> something out of it immediately after the tariff was put on, but remember they lost something as well.  I am not now talking politics and I want to warn the farmers what they have to be on their guard against.  Our exports of butter amounted to about £3,000,000 per annum&mdash;it is a little over £3,000,000, the balance between three and a half million pounds and five million pounds is made up of cream, condensed milk, and milk products of other kinds.  Now the export of butter from Denmark to the British market amounts to something like £20,000,000&mdash;I forget the exact figure.  By exporting £20,000,000 worth of butter of a uniform character from Denmark to England the Danes have got a good-will in the English market which we can never get with our small export.  We could get a better price if our exports amounted to £15,000,000 and if our exports were continuous for the whole year round.</P>
    <P>There is no big grocer in England who is friendly to this country who has not put that point of view.  Remember the home market is no good to us.  I am talking now when all our imports have been stopped and when we have this export surplus.  Remember too that every friendly agency who handles our butter has put up that it is first-class.  Someone has asked what the Dairy Produce Act did for our butter trade.  It saved the butter situation.  We are closer to the Danish than ever we were.  Our butter is now admitted to be first-class. But we can never reach the Danish figure until we export bigger quantities and quantities sufficient to supply the needs of the big merchants who are catering for the big centres of population.  Remember when thinking of this butter situation and when you say that it does not do us any good, ask yourselves this question: Did the situation created by the tariff do us any harm?  Our supplies are £500,000 smaller now by reason of the fact that certain exports have been kept at home to supply a market that was formerly supplied by £500,000 worth of cheap imports.</P>
    <P>Take the case of bacon.  I do not want to say very much about that <Col N="857" /> because it is before the Tariff Commission at the present moment, but remember the question is becoming very acute.  There will be a question of that, and I have no doubt the Tariff Commission will avert to it.  What is going to happen your good-will in the British market which is essential to you, because if you stop imports you will have a huge surplus.</P>

I am not giving the answer.  We have to consider this further that bacon is in a slightly different position, and that if we prohibit the import of bacon we are prohibiting almost one and three-quarter million pounds of bacon which will have to be supplied by Irish production which in turn will have to be withdrawn from the British market.  That is one consideration which, of course, even though I never saw it, is quite present to the minds of the Tariff Commission and will get the fullest consideration.</P>

    <P>What Deputy Ryan said about oats, that this tariff will increase production, was also said about butter. Has it increased production?  The production of butter has fallen in this <Col N="858" /> country, but not because of the tariff. The only point I am making is that in spite of the tariff the production of butter has fallen.  But I want to go on and say that the production of butter does not depend at all on the tariff. The tariff has nothing to do with it; it will not be affected by a tariff. Whether there is an increase or a decrease in the production of butter will depend on factors entirely outside a tariff, and whether there is a decrease or an increase in the production of oats will depend on factors entirely outside this tariff.  The production of oats and the price here will depend absolutely and always on the price of Indian meal and maize, and as far as this tariff is concerned it will make no difference whatsoever in production or price, though I expect that there will be an increase in the price this year, due to the shortage, and to the imposition of a tariff, in the same way as there was an increase in the price of butter.  I expect there may be an increase in acreage next year.  Why then impose this tariff?  I stated last year that a tariff on oats did not matter twopence. Deputies seem to think it does.  Some of us are paid as Ministers and some as Deputies, and we are wasting three hours talking about this tariff when we might be doing something else.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who spoke, not only Deputy Aiken and Deputy MacEntee, who know nothing about it, but Deputy Allen and Deputy Corry&mdash;who tells us that he is a farmer and a good one&mdash;say that it is important. Remember that there are a lot of people in the country persuaded by political propaganda that it is important just as they were persuaded that the butter tariff was important. They were persuaded that a tariff on butter, on oats and other things was very important, and that it was going to make easy money.  A tremendous amount of the mental energy of farmers that might have gone to creative work is being deflected to political expedients and to political panaceas which amount to nothing.  I am in favour of this tariff in much the same way as I am in favour of the republic.  If we had tariffs and a <Col N="859" /> republic we would have no excuse but to settle down to work.  The republic is being used in this country as an excuse for not working, and so is a tariff on butter and a tariff on bacon. My point of view upon tariffs on bacon or butter is that they make no difference, none whatever, and that a tariff on butter or oats makes no difference; that anything which will deflect farmers' attention from a perfectly futile issue of that sort and get them back to real business is a good thing.  I think, with Deputy Heffernan, that the effects of these tariffs in the long run will be extremely educational.  The country will begin to realise that after all these tariffs are not going to have the advantages which professional politicians say they are going to have.  I think people will begin to wake up as a result of the tariffs on butter and oats to the real danger.</P>
    <P>What is the real danger?  The real danger of the position is that there are a very large number of people who want industrial tariffs.  They are very well organised.  Being organised, and having funds at their disposal, they are able to get at politicians and political parties by efficient propaganda. We are extremely good at propaganda, much better at propaganda than at work.  My point of view on industrial tariffs is that the people that are behind the propaganda realised long ago that there is one step in their way. They realise that they cannot get away with the propaganda, and cannot get away with industrial tariffs, with a constant increase in the cost of living to the consumer, who, to a great extent, is the farmer in this country, unless they can promise the farmer a quid pro quo.  Deputies on the opposite benches know that perfectly well.  They are in the same position as the industrialists.  They are not very much concerned at all with the farmer. Their main interest in the farmer is to trick him, to fool him.</P>

      <P>Their main interest in <Col N="860" /> the farmer is to try to persuade him that if he agrees to industrial tariffs they can give him a quid pro quo in agricultural tariffs.  I flatter myself that the tariff on butter has definitely killed that.  There was a real danger three or four years ago that farmers would be tricked into the point of view that they could afford to agree to all sorts of indiscriminate and extravagant industrial tariffs, that were certain to increase their cost of living, on the promise that they would get instead agricultural tariffs.  I believe that, to a great extent, that danger has passed. I believe that the tariff on butter has definitely shown the farmer that there is a very big difference between putting a tariff on products of which there is a shortage in home production, such as industrial products, and putting a tariff on a product of which there is a big export surplus.  I believe that the tariff on butter has done more than anything that I or anyone could do to show the farmer that there is that distinction. I believe that this tariff, if it has no other advantage, will tend further to press home that lesson, and I am personally in favour of this tariff for that reason, and for no other.</P>

The Corporation of Dublin has made certain recommendations to the Department, but the most useful contribution that could be made here would be to discuss all the different points on the appropriate sections that have been raised by the Corporation, because I think Deputies will find that many of them are matters that require discussion here in Committee as distinct from any consideration that the Committee set up by the Corporation could have given to them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to explain before the section passes why he has given the Commissioner of the Gárda the status of a Minister.  We have always understood that the Commissioner of the Gárda was a subordinate officer, like any other civil servant.  In this Bill he is being made an independent authority.  He is to deal directly with the Minister for Local Government. He is mentioned in the Bill and there is no reference in regard to any of his duties that he is to have the concurrence of the Minister to whom he is <Col N="864" /> responsible.  If Deputies will refer to Section 8 they will find there is material there for conflict between the Commissioner and his superior officer, the Minister.  The section states:</P>
      <P>Every bye-law made by the Commissioner under this Act which is required by this Act to be made with the consent of the Minister shall be submitted in the prescribed manner to the Minister for his approval and, if and when approved of by the Minister, shall be published in the prescribed manner, and no such bye-law shall be of any force or effect until it has been so submitted, approved of and published.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has to deal directly with the Minister for Local Government and if the Minister for Local Government does not approve of the bye-laws which the Commissioner makes, apparently the Commissioner has got to remake his bye-laws.  Suppose the Minister does approve of the bye-laws and that the Commissioner's superior officer, the Minister for Justice, if he has any authority in the matter, vetoe them, what is to happen? I think the Minister should explain if the Minister for Justice has any function in the matter, and if the functions which should ordinarily belong to the Minister for Justice are being taken out of his hands and given to the Commissioner, and why that is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no function which the Minister for Justice has had being taken out of his hands under this Bill.  If the Deputy considers that the Commissioner ought not to have power in respect of traffic that is mentioned here and that the Minister for Local Government should not be the person to supervise in his particular way the traffic regulations and by-laws, I would like to hear what his suggestion in the matter is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my point.  I asked is the Commissioner to be responsible to his superior officer, the Minister for Justice, under this Bill, or are the functions of the Minister for Justice in this matter being given to the Commissioner, <Col N="865" /> where he is mentioned?  Is he to act independently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner is being given power here to frame certain regulations dealing with particular matters.  Perhaps the Deputy could mention any one of these particular matters in connection with which he thinks the Minister for Justice should have some function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that where the Commissioner is mentioned the Minister for Justice should be substituted. I would say that the Commissioner is a subordinate of the Minister for Justice, and that he should not be given the authority of a Minister.  Is it not a fact that in any other Bill it is the Department that is referred to as the authority?  In this case authority is being taken out of the hands of the Minister for Justice and is being put into the hands of the Commissioner. By implication, he is to be independent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot mention a single function for which the Minister for Justice might be responsible and in respect of which the Commissioner is asked to deal with the Minister for Local Government.  The Deputy cannot mention a single function in connection with which the Ministry here is asked to operate which is a function of the Minister for Justice, work with which the Minister for Justice, because of his functions, is competent to deal.  The Minister for Local Government, on the other hand, has functions in connection with the regulation and control of traffic, and it is because of that that the Commissioner, who has definite responsibilities for the control of traffic, has to get the approval of the Minister for Local Government for his by-laws and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big admission. It means that the Commissioner of the Gárda, who has, I think, always been regarded as responsible to the Minister for Justice, is no longer to be in that position, that he is to get the status of a Minister.</P>

I think the Minister should give an assurance that if drivers of steam-rollers are asked to take out a licence that the local authority should pay for the licence.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I may state that during the short time at my disposal on the Second Reading Stage of this measure I endeavoured to ascertain from the Minister the reasons why Section 5 provides that exemption should be made in the case of public servants or public vehicles under the conditions laid down in Section 50.  I realise that the Minister had not sufficient time at his disposal in order to make his position in regard to this matter quite clear.  As a matter of fact, I did not refer to it at all.  However, Section 50, in my opinion, lays down very necessary conditions in order to enable a person to secure a licence regarding third-party insurance and other matters mentioned in Section 50.  I have personal knowledge of at least one case where a military driver during the civil war period of 1923-24 killed one of my constituents, and it was only after a long correspondence with the Department and subsequently raising the question in this House that relatives of the person who was killed received an ex gratia grant of £50.  I think it very desirable in a Bill of this kind that the same conditions should apply to the owner and the driver as apply to the ordinary member of the public who received a licence to drive, and that the person who meets with the accident or the representatives of a person who is killed should receive proper compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister <Col N="868" /> why it is proposed to exempt the drivers of State vehicles from the conditions laid down in Part V, Section 10, of this particular Bill. Unless very definite assurances are given that the owner, namely the State in this case and the person employed by the State, should be held answerable in the same way as ordinary citizens I am certainly going to oppose the exemption provided for under Section 5 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two things will happen if we apply insurance principles of this kind to servants of the State.  In the first place the State will be under the necessity to insure. That is not the point.  The point is, that the Deputy wants to see the State put, in the eyes of the law, in the same position as an ordinary owner with regard to compensation.  The purpose of this Bill is not to change the law with regard to the liability of a person negligently driving a car, injuring a person with regard to his liability for compensation.  It is to put the person liable under the law normally into the position that if he does injure a person he will be a good mark for the compensation that is normally due to the injured party.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the State in cases of tort is that it is not liable to be sued.  That is fundamental in the law generally and if it is to be challenged at all it is to be challenged in an objective and definite way and by statute.  The position with regard to the State and its servants is that those persons who are injured as a result of the negligence of State servants are not deprived of compensation.  Whenever a person is injured in an accident by a servant of the State the case is reviewed by the Attorney-General as to the facts of negligence in the case and if negligence is established in his eyes then the State does pay a suitable ex gratia compensation grant, so that the State is in fact not in a different position from any other person.  It is not done by an assessment of the Court but by an assessment of the Attorney-General as an ex gratia matter.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any reason as to why it should not be made liable in respect to road accidents?  Quite a number of people have been killed in accidents arising out of the negligent driving of cars. Is there any reason why the relatives of persons so killed should not have a positive claim against the State for compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I do not know whether there is any use in discussing individual cases, but in general it cannot be alleged that persons injured by the negligent driving of State servants have not been compensated.  In the second place, there is a fundamental position that the State is not liable to be sued in respect to cases of tort, and we are not prepared to open that case for discussion except by a general facing of that whole position.  No one is being put in a prejudicial position as against where they stood in the past by this legislation; and we claim that no one can claim that, being entitled to compensation in the past owing to negligence on the part of State drivers, they were not paid.</P>

      <P>As far as I can ascertain, there are thousands of servants in the State employed through the Post Office, through the police force and the Army departments in charge of cars, and according to what I now hear from the Minister these people, if and when charged, will be tried by themselves, in effect.  The case which I have in mind, and under which I have a very clear recollection, is a case where a military driver at a particular period knocked down and killed an old woman.  After exhaustive inquiries, lengthy correspondence, and after raising the question in the House and after careful consideration by the Department and the Minister, her husband was given £50.  I did not, and do not at present, regard that as what the Minister calls a suitable ex gratia grant in the circumstances.  An inquiry <Col N="870" /> was held in that particular case by the officer who was in charge of the particular individual in the area where the accident occurred.  I am not prepared to have cases like that continued under legislation of this kind.  I do not see why we should pass legislation putting a certain obligation on the ordinary citizen and saying that the State and the State employee would be relieved of the same obligation and responsibility.  I don't think that is fair.  No matter what the Minister may say, there is something wrong with a Bill that allows that to be continued.  The Minister says that this is a question of having to change the law.  The whole law with regard to traffic regulations is out of date.  It is being brought up to date in this Bill.  The State, in this age of modern transport, has a large number of vehicles under its control.  It must have a very high percentage of the number of registered vehicles in the State, and there is no reason why it should be relieved of this obligation. I ask the Minister to reconsider seriously the whole matter of relieving employees of the State of obligations which he is endeavouring to impose, through the means of the Oireachtas, upon the ordinary citizen.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter before the next stage of the Bill is reached.  Otherwise, I shall challenge the section giving this privilege to the State.</P>

      <P>The Minister may attempt to stand on the principle that the State cannot be sued, but he must realise that the increasing number of mechanically-propelled vehicles in use by Government Departments must, of necessity, bring about a change in the obligations imposed by law.  Deputy Davin has spoken about motor cars in use by the State.  In the City of Dublin there are a tremendous number of motor cycles ridden by the messenger boys in the Post Office.  The Minister wants to put the citizen in the position that, so far as State-owned vehicles are concerned, he is not to have the same redress that he has against his fellow-citizens in cases of negligence.  The Minister says that the Attorney-General will consider the claims put <Col N="871" /> before him and that they will be dealt with on an ex gratia basis.  That is not the way a citizen expects to be treated in a matter of this kind.  In the ordinary course, the citizen goes to court and a judge and jury measure the damages which are due to him, having regard to all the aspects of the case. I think the Minister knows that he cannot absolve the State of this liability on the mere statement that the State cannot be sued.  We know that the State is not going to insure in the ordinary way.  It will bear its own insurance, but the citizen who is injured by a Post Office van or bicycle or by an Army lorry should receive the same treatment as if he were injured by a vehicle driven by an ordinary citizen. You cannot legislate in one way for the State and in another for the citizens. I think the Minister will have to reconsider his decision and bring this matter more in line with common sense and fair treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Davin and Deputy Briscoe have said.  The State, for reasons which are thought good by some people and not so good by others, is becoming more and more a commercial concern.  In the City of Dublin and in other parts of the Free State, there are vehicles used for what may be called commercial purposes by the State, without talking of the Army or Post Office vehicles.  When I was coming in here, I noticed a van belonging to what was formerly known as the Stationery Office; I do not know by what name it is known now.  The position, however, is, as defined by the Minister, that if a citizen be knocked down and injured by a commercial vehicle of that sort under the control of the State, he is not entitled in law to any compensation.  The person injured, or the relatives of a person killed, may obtain an ex gratia grant from the Government through the medium of the Attorney-General.  A person who is thus killed has only the honour of being killed by a State-owned vehicle, whereas the relatives of a person who has not that honour can have compensation assessed by a judge and jury.  I do not think it is fair to <Col N="872" /> leave the citizen who is injured by a Government-owned vehicle at the mercy of the Attorney-General.  If the Attorney-General assesses the damages in respect of a person killed at £50, as mentioned by Deputy Davin, the relatives of that person have no redress. If they demur as regards the amount, the Attorney-General can tell them to take it or they will get nothing.  There is no court to which they can appeal.  I think that that is an unfair position to leave the citizen in.  The number of vehicles owned by a Government Department is growing and will continue to grow.  The risk will be greater, therefore, for ordinary citizens in all parts of the country.  There ought to be the same law for State servants as there is for other citizens.  If they are guilty of negligence and cause injury to citizens, they should stand their trial before the court and have damages assessed in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I think there is a good deal in what Deputy Davin and Deputy O'Kelly have said.  Some of these mechanically propelled vehicles, such as motor vans carrying mails, and bicycles, are very recklessly driven.  It is somewhat hard that a person who is maimed or injured, or the relatives of a person who is killed by one of these vehicles, should have no redress beyond the acceptance of an ex gratia allowance.  I think the Minister might consider the inclusion in the Bill of a clause providing for arbitration.  I suppose the State cannot be sued, but there should be some way of providing for arbitration at which the person injured or the relatives of the person killed could be represented by counsel. Some of these vehicles are driven most recklessly.</P>

      <P>I have tried to appreciate the point of view of the Minister, but the arguments of Deputies Davin and O'Kelly have convinced me to the contrary.  I cannot see why the State should not be responsible in cases of this sort.  It does seem inequitable that where one citizen is injured by a motor vehicle belonging to another citizen, he has an opportunity of going to the courts and securing redress, whereas where the <Col N="873" /> State is the aggressor he has only the possibility of obtaining charity, because an ex gratia grant really means charity.  I think that is wrong.</P>

      <P>I think it is up to the Minister, if he does not wish to destroy the prestige of the State by making it amenable to the law, to find some other means.  There is hardly a Deputy in this House who, at some time or another, has not been obliged to put up a claim for his constituents for damage done by the servants of the State.  We all know that it is not a very satisfactory method of dealing with the matter.  But in the case of an ordinary citizen against another citizen, even if the judge and jury turn down his claim, he has had the satisfaction of having had a fair trial. I do not agree that it is a satisfactory method that an aggrieved person should have his compensation assessed under circumstances that have been described by Deputy Alton as charity.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably would.  It will have to be amended. A civil servant driving his own car is in a different position from a civil servant driving for the State.  There is no want of appreciation on our part of the case that is put up that a person injured by an officer of the State as a result of negligence, is entitled to be compensated equally with a person who is injured in any other way.  But Deputy Davin has had to go back eight years to a particular case in which we had no evidence at all that negligence was absolutely proved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy goes back eight years to find a case to show <Col N="874" /> that persons injured in this particular way might not be suitably compensated by the State.  There is also the fact that a person who is a servant of the State is liable to be proceeded against as the person causing the injury, so that if a yard-stick is wanted by anybody injured in connection with a case like this to have the damage suffered by him measured, if he is able to prove negligence there is nothing to prevent him proceeding against the individual directly responsible for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in his argument now that a yardstick to define the amount might be got by suing the individual driving the car or vehicle.  Now, supposing the Minister eliminates the idea of damage to the person or, say, the killing of a person, and he comes to the case of damage to property, is he going to ask the individual who has been injured to risk suing the person driving the car, who might be a person with a very small wage, in order to establish his right of proving that he has suffered, say, £15 or £20 damages, and that after doing that he is to go on and find out whether the Attorney-General will consider whether he has made good his claim or whether he is entitled to compensation? Now Section 50 (4) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person charged with an offence under this section was, on the occasion on which such offence is alleged to have been committed... it shall be a good defence to such charge for such person to prove that he was using or driving such vehicle on such occassion in obedience to the express orders of such owner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the servant of the State is driving a Post Office car, and he is travelling speedily to catch a train, that is a good defence for him, and the citizens under the Bill cannot sue him.  Yet the Minister calmly says that he knows that it is in the Bill.  The citizen is debarred not only from suing the State, but from suing the driver.</P>

      <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks states that he does not want to put the State into such an embarrassing position that if any of its drivers knocked down and injured a person, it will be sued.  He suggests an alternative way of going about it by suing the driver.  What would be the good of any person injured by a State motor car or cyclist suing a telegraph messenger or Post <Col N="876" /> Office driver earning 42/- a week?  I quite realise the difficulty the Minister is in.  The suggestion I would put up is that instead of the victim or the victim's relatives suing the State, the State should take out premiums which would cover every driver.  That would get over the difficulty, and a section could be inserted in the Bill to that effect.</P>

      <P>But the exception which is provided for in Section V of this Bill certainly does not make me feel that the State will be as good a mark for liabilities as the ordinary citizen if even the servant of the State is guilty under Section 50 in Part V of the Bill.  I am prepared to accept any way out of this difficulty other than the continuance of the conditions which have hitherto operated, namely that an inquiry into the accident might be held by the Department responsible for the accident, or somebody immediately connected with them; that the case should be reviewed by the Attorney-General and that a suitable ex-gratia grant should be paid to the people concerned.

      <P>If there is a clash between the Commissioner and the Minister, the Minister's view will prevail, because if bye-laws are made by the Commissioner the interests of the local authorities are likely to be involved and that will have to be taken into consideration in connection with this matter.  Under the Bill the Commissioner is made responsible for bye-laws for the whole country.  At present, he is responsible for making bye-laws for the City of Dublin subject to the approval of the Dublin Corporation. He may under the Bill make bye-laws for particular areas or for the country as a whole and the interest of the local authorities will have to be taken into consideration.  Just as the Corporation of Dublin can overrule the Commissioner in the making of his bye-laws at present, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will under this Bill be able to overrule the Commissioner in the making of the bye-laws.</P>

We were not able in the drafting to apply directly these clauses of the Public Health Act with regard to these inquiries to the procedure, but it is proposed that in the regulations which the Minister has power to make, the bye-laws framed by the Commissioner will have to go through a routine such as is gone through when bye-laws are made under the Public Health Act, 1878; that there will be if necessary an inquiry, that there will be publication and a deposit of the bye-laws in a particularly advertised place for examination before the bye-laws are actually sanctioned.</P>

      <P>You are taking away from local authorities the power which they have, and giving nothing in exchange except what the Minister may choose to do from time to time. If there were embodied in the Bill some phraseology which would protect local authorities by stating that these things will happen which the Minister has enumerated, that would meet to a certain extent the case which Deputy Good has in mind and that we have in <Col N="881" /> mind.  But the Minister is taking away all the rights and powers the local authorities have under the old Act in exchange for which a section is put in which says that the Minister may from time to time prescribe certain regulations in any form he likes. There is nothing in the Bill to make it obligatory.</P>

      <P>It is our intention to support the passage of the Bill.  It is in fact in accord with the policy of this Party, and whether introduced to deal with the special set of circumstances now existing or introduced for the purpose of giving the Government this power under any circumstances, would meet with our approval.  Its introduction is in fact a further indication of the conversion of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to the policy of Fianna Fáil, which has been going on for some time past, and needless to remark we are glad of that conversion, inasmuch as it is taking place so rapidly as to be rather embarrassing. The Dáil discussed to-day the origins of the tariff on oats.  It was pointed out that during the course of a recent bye-election the Minister for Agriculture found himself in the position that certain farmers refused to support his Party's candidate unless a tariff on oats was promised.  The Minister was only in a position to promise a tariff.  The farmers in question, not placing much reliance on promises, voted against his candidate. As we are now approaching the possibility of a general election and certainly of bye-elections, apparently the Government are determined not to be handicapped in that manner again. If they should find it necessary to secure votes by imposing tariffs, they are taking, under this Bill, power to <Col N="882" /> do it immediately, whether the Dáil is sitting or not.  Apart from that, however, there is good reason that in the special circumstances of this country, and particularly circumstances likely to prevail in the near future, the Executive Council should have power in the matter of affording protection to our industries against unfair external competition, to act first and seek approval afterwards.  We think that the introduction of this Bill is a very wise step, and one which will probably be justified before long.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance gave to-day a very lucid account of the danger that might arise in the event of a protectionist policy being adopted in Great Britain.  I do not think he exaggerated these dangers.  In fact there is some reason to believe that the situation which he visualises is already beginning to develop.  Perhaps the only clause in the Bill to which we might take exception is the one which prescribes that it shall continue in force only for a period of nine months. We think it is possible to make a case for keeping upon the Statute Book some Act such as is now suggested which would give to the Executive Council the power to act rapidly in matters of this kind without finding it necessary to convene a special meeting of the Dáil.  We hold that in the past certain tariffs were probably held up because the Dáil was not in Session and the motion imposing a tariff could not be introduced until the Dáil reassembled. While this Bill is in operation that will not be necessary and it should not in our opinion be necessary at any time, at any rate until the economic position of the country has changed very much from what it is at present.  There are one or two points in connection with the drafting which I would like to refer to, but perhaps it would be better to bring them up on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that we welcome this Bill.  In my opinion a Bill of this kind is long overdue. I consider that any Executive should have the power which is conferred under this Bill.  A great amount of time has been lost in the past in so far <Col N="883" /> as the application of tariffs is concerned and when the Tariff Commission was considering whether a certain tariff should or should not be placed on certain articles a great deal of dumping took place.  The Executive Council under this Bill will have power to deal with a situation of that kind.  I hope they will examine the whole situation as far as tariffs are concerned.  I take it the reason for bringing in the Bill is to enable them to deal with something that is going to happen in consequence of the economic situation on the other side of the channel.  I believe the Executive Council should go further and do something under the powers to be conferred on them under this Bill to endeavour to build up the industries of this country.  As I say, it is certainly a very good thing for the Executive to have these powers.  We welcome the Bill and will support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill; it is better late than never.  I feel the Ministry, in introducing this Bill, may have in mind recent occurrences across the Channel and therefore must have had in mind the very grave menace to industry in this country as a result of recent happenings in other parts of Europe as well.  While this Bill professes to do certain things and to take certain precautions against dumping, I would like to know if these precautions mean that the Ministry will go so far as to actually prohibit certain imports into this country.  I have in mind and I feel also the Minister must have in mind that quite recently we have had dumped into this country a good deal of ready-made clothing from Poland.  I do not know any tariff that we might raise against that particular kind of dumping that would meet the case at all.  We must have regard for the fact that our people have a higher standard of living than the Poles or the Russians.  We have no forced labour and we have no slave labour, and it would be almost impossible for our people, even with a tariff of 100 per cent., to turn out as a result, this ready-made clothing at a price to compete with that at which it is <Col N="884" /> dumped here.  I hope the Minister will tighten up legislation of this character and see to it that within the scope of this Bill we will be able to put up a prohibition order against dumping of the character to which I refer.  I do feel at the same time there has been a good deal of dumping of foreign flour for a considerable period. How far dumping in that direction is continued I do not know at the moment.  It would be easy to get the figure.</P>
      <P>I agree it is difficult to provide against dumping at times, though it would not completely upset the economic fabric to have a certain amount of dumping.  That is commonly accepted by economists who know their job, but we are in a rather peculiar position in this country.  We cannot afford to stand by while the over-production of mills in other countries is being dumped in here.  When I say dumping I mean every import into this country under the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this measure, because I feel the Minister has responded in some way, at least, in this matter, but not, of course, to the whole-hog tariff people.  Personally I am not a whole-hog tariff reformer.  I believe we must continue by way of selective tariffs.  Good and valid reasons must be shown for these tariffs.  But I suggest the Minister might consider another aspect of this question, and that is that the onus should not be thrown entirely upon the producers of a certain commodity to look for the need for a tariff.  It should be up to the State to intervene and help the operatives engaged in a particular industry to see that it is protected.  We know there might very easily be a number of inefficient manufacturers.  They might have very highly efficient operatives, but because of the inefficiency of the manufacturer or proprietor a certain industry might be allowed to become inefficient and find itself not able to hold its own in competitive markets. I feel the Minister should make provision for such a case in this measure. As he has taken such a bold step, I sincerely congratulate him, though I think he might also make provision in <Col N="885" /> this Bill for the case that I have put forward: that operatives in any industry where it is found that the workmen are efficient, but that owing to an amount of bad trade organisation or bad distribution, for which the operatives are not responsible, the business is not a success, then the State should be able to step in and say we want to protect this or that particular industry.  I would have regard to key industries.  I felt at the time of the debate on flour that we were losing a key industry by allowing it to pass into other hands.  I hope the Minister will take every measure to secure that this country is not going to be made a dumping ground for slave labour, or Polish or Russian labour, or the sweated labour of any other country, and on that understanding I heartily welcome this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an extraordinary commentary upon the policy of the Executive Council, as this House has heard it outlined in the past, when they were, I might say, propagandists for the theory that the economic welfare of the Free State is in some way indissolubly bound up with the fortunes of our neighbours across the sea, that they should be compelled, by virtue of the crisis that has befallen our neighbour, to take steps to protect the welfare of our country and the productive powers of the community.  In the crisis that has occurred in England, out of which capital is sought to be made in this country at present, that now perhaps more than ever are our fortunes linked with our neighbours, it is an extraordinary thing that that policy should be preached.  Because one would imagine that anyone who seriously studied the trend of events across the water in the past few years, and saw the steady growth of unemployment, the steady decline of foreign trade, the steady decline of British financial prestige, and the cataclysm, the worst features of which probably have not yet perhaps made themselves felt, and who seriously looked into these matters, could argue that there is any future for this Free State, or any hope for an economic policy which is fundamentally based upon the conception that we are <Col N="886" /> linked up, and that our future is in some way indissolubly bound up with that of the British Empire and the neighbouring island in particular.  In my view the moral of the whole crisis in Great Britain for our people here is: we ought to look to our own affairs. We know those nations on the Continent of Europe that steadfastly pursued a policy of increasing their own productive powers, and husbanding their resources, and by every means in their power, by anti-dumping, by subsidies, by bounties, by protection, by special grants for technical research and every possible weapon which lies in the hands of modern government for building up their country economically, and the more we look into all these questions the more we see that these Governments are right, and that the countries which have such Governments are countries that are to-day progressing, while other countries that allow things to drift and lapse find themselves in a position where the wit of man cannot see where the solution will lie.</P>
      <P>Whether the Executive Council had a certain policy or not in the past, and whether they are departing from that policy or not, is a matter of opinion, but in the future, at any rate, no matter on what side of the House we may sit, we should endeavour to do the very utmost that within us lies to build up the potentialities of our own country. This crisis, whatever its repercussions and reactions may be upon our own people, has at least driven us inward upon ourselves and made us realise our own position.  I hope one of the effects will be not alone to force whatever Government is sitting in this House to face up to the question, but to have a strong and bold policy in this matter and also in financial matters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and other Ministers have stated over and over again in this House that the question of the cost of living and of imposing large burdens on the poor, who are already suffering greatly from the economic troubles, is the paramount consideration in the application of a tariff.  The Ministry now realise that the cost of living or any other question <Col N="887" /> must be set aside in a crisis such as we have at present, or in an emergency when the whole productive power of the country may be shattered overnight by some policy originated in the Argentine, in the United States of America, Germany, Poland or somewhere else.  It simply proves over and over again that the Sinn Fein policy was the right policy, the policy of self-reliance, of building up our own industries and our own productive power.  It is also the policy of trying to keep our money at home and no longer allowing it to be said that Irishmen have no industries in which they could invest their money.  There is, and there ought to be, that security that the Government can give.  If the Government would only come forward now and say that they were going to take very definite steps under this Bill, there is, in my opinion, an excellent opportunity to bring home capital that was invested abroad, a great deal of which has been lost recently.  No matter how poor an opinion we may have of our business methods and of our enterprises, we must, at least, agree that capital could not have suffered any worse in Ireland, from whatever lack of management and technical methods there is, than it suffered in the hurricane of the last one or two years.</P>
    <P>I think the introduction of this Bill is a tribute to the policy that Fianna Fáil has preached, in season and out of season, for years, that no matter what happens in other countries the only solution for us is to have regard fixedly and solely to our own interests. If we concentrate on our own business and endeavour to build up our own country, I have no doubt that if the necessary steps are taken&mdash;and they must be strong and definite steps, and taken soon&mdash;the Free State will weather the storm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech that Deputy Derrig has made seems to me to be an extraordinary speech to make in this House.  One would imagine from that speech that there was never a tariff policy in this country until Fianna Fáil entered this House.  Deputy Derrig <Col N="888" /> has had the temerity to say that the introduction of this Bill is a tribute to the policy of Fianna Fáil.  It would have been much more correct had the Deputy stated that the Bill is a tribute to the policy of Arthur Griffith, one of the most distinguished leaders that the Party on this side of the House ever had.  It seems to me a most extraordinary thing for a Deputy who is well informed like Deputy Derrig to make a statement of that kind here. He referred to the dependence of this country upon England.  Anyone who knows anything about economics knows that no country is impervious to the influences of external affairs, and that this country, no less than any other country in Europe, must feel the repercussions of these affairs.  One would imagine, when listening to Deputy Derrig's speech, that this Bill was introduced for the protection of English industries, and was to operate in England and not in the Saorstát.  Surely it is evident to the House that this Bill is meant to protect Irish and not English industries.  As one who has always held fairly strong views on protection, and on the value of protection for the development of Irish industries, I welcome this Bill.  It will certainly make clear to the country that industries that have been established, mainly through the tariff policy of the Government and of those sitting on these benches, will be protected, and that these industries will be protected from the aftermath of the economic troubles that exist throughout the whole world.  This Bill is clear evidence that the 15,000 to 20,000 people who have received fresh employment in the tariffed industries that were set up by the policy of the Government Party, will be protected when this measure is passed.  It means that their employment is safe, and that capital that has been invested in Irish industries will be safe.  I notice that this Bill is being closely followed by a similar measure in England.  The English people evidently have come to the conclusion that a free trade policy spells ruin, as far as English industries are concerned.  We did not come to that conclusion on these benches to-day or yesterday.  We have been imposing <Col N="889" /> tariffs for a considerable time, and this Bill continues the policy of the Party that sits on this side of the House. Speaking as one who believes in protection, I welcome the introduction of this Bill for one very important reason.  Anyone who knows anything about economics knows that the greatest weapon in any system of protection is the weapon of retaliation. This Bill puts the weapon of retaliation into the hands of the Government of this country.  Hitherto, that weapon may be said not to have existed.  We had fixed ad valorem tariffs with no elasticity.  Once a tariff was imposed it remained fixed, practically, until a further appeal to the Commission was made.  Under this Bill that cardinal weakness in the system of this State has been definitely removed.</P>
      <P>I remember on one occasion asking the question here owing to very persistent rumours in the City of Dublin that the Belgians intended to impose a prohibitive tariff on the import and sale of Guinness's stout.  I realised that if these rumours were true our system of tariffs gave us no means of dealing with such a situation, but happily our trade representative in Belgium was in a position to say that there was no truth in the rumours. That situation, if it should arise in the future, could be immediately dealt with under this Bill.  When we consider that we pay Belgium £4 for every £1 Belgium pays us, and that Belgium is in a position under her tariff system to prohibit the sale of Guinness's stout in her territory, and that we had no weapon that we could use, we can realise the weakness of our existing tariff system.  The passage of this Bill puts an entirely different complexion on the system of tariffs that will henceforth operate here.  Anyone conversant with the tariff systems in other countries knows that they possess the weapon of retaliation.  It is one of the most important weapons possessed by France and Belgium.  In my opinion a system of tariffs that cannot apply the weapon of retaliation is an entirely ineffective system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main principles operating in the imposition of tariffs in a small country like Belgium is the principle <Col N="890" /> of the value of the amount of labour in the imported goods.  They have differentiation in Belgium.  They have a maximum and a minimum tariff but we have only one fixed ad valorem tariff.  After this Bill passes through the House the Government will be able to deal with any situation that may in future arise.  Under the Belgian tariff system they have a minimum and a maximum tariff. Under our system we have only one tariff and, as I have pointed out to the House, once that tariff is fixed by the Tariff Commission before there can be any further alteration in it there must be a further appeal to the Tariff Commission on that particular question.  Under this Bill there will be practically no appeal necessary. Immediate action can be taken and if there is going to be a flood of dumped goods into this country, that flow of dumped goods can be immediately checked.  In Belgium, owing to the operation of the minimum and maximum tariff system, they can at once prohibit the import of goods which are being dumped into that country.  They can for instance raise the ordinary tariff of 2,800 francs from the minimum to the maximum of over 8,000 francs. That practically amounts to prohibition.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be speedily applied. I am informed that at the present time Russian sweets are being offered and, if I am correctly informed, are being imported into this country at a price considerably under the cost of production in the Saorstát.  If that be true, I hope that one of the first things to which this measure will be applied will be retaliation in regard to these Soviet imports.  Under our old tariff system we had no cure. Under our new tariff system we have now the weapon in our hands.  I hope, as I have said already, that it will be immediately applied to this sweet industry. I do realise one thing, that the fixed tariff on sweets operates very considerably to the benefit of foreign combines and foreign exporters.  It has operated mainly in one way. Although we have set up several factories in this country, they are not producing the most profitable lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> They are producing what is known to the business man as purely bread and butter lines on which there is a very low proportion of profit.  The fixed ad valorem tariff protects the lower end of the trade, but it fails to protect the luxury end of the sweet trade, which is the most important and lucrative end of the trade.  I hope this Bill will be at once applied to the sweet industry.</P>
    <P>There is only one criticism I have to make as far as the Bill is concerned, and that is that it is a purely temporary measure.  In my opinion a measure such as we are discussing this afternoon should be permanent in any system of tariffs in any country.  If the Minister cannot see his way to make the measure permanent, I hope he will consider the advisability of considerably extending the duration of the Bill. Reading over the Bill in a rather hasty way to-day, I gathered that it will only operate for a period of nine months. I think the scope and the operation of the Bill should be considerably enlarged. The criticism that has been made from the opposite side has been, I regret to say, a purely Party criticism. One of the curses of this country is that economic matters cannot be discussed in a purely non-Party spirit. If a discussion of this nature were taking place in the German Reichstag do you think that criticism would be adduced by the Opposition Party such as has been adduced here this afternoon?</P>

      <P>I have pointed out clearly and distinctly the misstatements that have been made by the Deputy's Party, that this Bill was introduced owing to the lever that the Fianna Fáil Party was using in this country.  I pointed out that before ever the Fianna Fáil Party were in the House the Party sitting on this side was a Protectionist Party.  I pointed out that the real exponent of Protection <Col N="892" /> in this country was Arthur Griffith, the Leader of this Party. These are facts which I would like Deputies on the opposite side to refute if it is in their power to offer such a refutation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an indication that the overwhelming facts of the present situation, so far as Ireland is concerned, have completely justified the policy and the principles put forward by this Party.  The Bill itself cannot be said to be satisfactory from the point of view of these principles, for several reasons.  It is better than nothing, but it certainly is an admission under force of circumstances that the Government policy, which was mildly a Free Trade and mildly a Protection policy&mdash;Protection for the purposes rather of gathering taxes than for the preservation or the creation of industries&mdash;was wrong, and that they have been forced now by a new set of circumstances to provide what would have been provided for long ago if the Fianna Fáil policy had been adopted. They are merely following in the wake of British legislation.  There is to be a measure in the British House of Commons dealing with the dumping which is anticipated, and that is to be followed by a protectionist policy, a large-scale protectionist policy.  I do not know whether the Minister will now find it easy to go further than the British have gone, now that he has gone so far with a protectionist policy. However far he goes, he is all the time justifying the principles which have been preached by this Party for a considerable time back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to this Bill as in some way carrying out the principles of Arthur Griffith.  There is this very great distinction between Arthur Griffith's attitude and the principles involved in this Bill.  Obviously this is a temporary measure.  Its terms are of such a timid nature that I personally cannot see how a tariff can be closely examined, certainly on the record of the Government Party hitherto, by the Tariff Commission within four months.  A Bill has to be brought before this House within the next ten sitting days.  In any case that is a <Col N="893" /> very short period for investigating the whole thing from beginning to end. The Tariff Commission has taken several months, and years even in certain cases, to deal with matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>They will have to change their methods altogether if it is to be made effective.  The effect of this Bill may be to protect industries which are already on their feet but it does not carry out the purpose which Arthur Griffith had in mind.  Griffith was a strong advocate of the views of the German economist, List, and List's views were that free trade might be a good thing for countries where trade was developed but that protection was necessary where new industries had to be built up.  This Bill is not to build up industry but is to stop dumping and it can only be used where industries are doing well.  I cannot see that it can be used for the purpose of building up industry, which was the essential part of Arthur Griffith's programme&mdash;to get the industrial as well as the agricultural arm developed.  It is a sheer necessity and is the minimum measure that could be brought in from the point of view of industry.  Will the Minister apply this in the case of industries where dumping has already taken place?  Will he apply it, say, in the case of Polish bacon and make it possible for the bacon industry to live in this country?  Something has been done in reference to oats but there are other things Deputy Anthony mentioned, for instance, the dumping of ready-made clothes.  How is it going to affect that?</P>
    <P>On the whole I think it will be found that the measure itself although in the right direction, is very inadequate.  It cannot really be used for the purpose of bringing home capital to be invested in new industries.  It would require a different Act altogether to do that.  I do not see how it can possibly be amend d to deal with such matters. In the case of the flour industry there was a delay when flour was being dumped in this country.  The Commission insisted upon receiving vouchers and invoices and all sorts of details in order to come to their decision in the matter.  Will they insist upon the <Col N="894" /> same details in the future, and will matters be held up as they were held up before, or is this Act an indication not only of a departure from past principles and policy, but of a complete change from former methods of administration in this matter?  There is one thing which is perfectly clear now to everybody, and that is that free trade is dead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister, if he were to admit the position he was faced with, would have to admit that he is only tackling really a very small proportion of the trouble which this country is labouring under.  What is the Minister aiming at, and what does he hope to achieve under this Bill?  On the one hand, while our currency is tied on to the British currency every fall in value which the British currency suffers is reflected here, and automatically our purchasing power from outside is diminishing.  In other words a further increase is given to the invisible tariff which the fall in our currency brings about.  The Bill is only going to stop coming in here the surplus commodities that have already been made for England, and for which there can be no market.  We should do this thing from the country's point of view.  It is wrong for Deputy Byrne to think that because Fianna Fáil advocated persistently a definite tariff policy to reconstruct our industries on a proper basis this particular Bill is the policy of Arthur Griffith. The Minister admits that it is purely a panic, emergency measure.</P>

The £ may fall further but at any rate it will be a considerable time before it reaches its parity value.  The exports from this country are chiefly foodstuffs.  Our neighbouring country pays by way of bills for food alone £1,000,000 per day.  If she cannot buy in foreign markets we will have accidental prosperity.

I would like the Minister to assure us that if the £ falls further he will consider adopting what other countries have adopted.  Export licences were insisted on so that the particular country would not be sold out and retain nothing but paper of a ridiculous value.  The Minister knows very well that this Party has always asked that we should develop and be self-reliant and have always suggested that we should prevent an adverse trade balance.  How is this measure going to help us?  Deputy Byrne referred several times to anybody who ever met anybody who knew anything about economics.  I do not know if Deputy Byrne ever met such a person, but economics, as far as this country is concerned, should be considered purely from our own point of view.  What protection is the Minister going to give to this country in respect of the money owing under the Second National Loan, which has to be paid in dollars?  Will he make some move to render this country independent in respect of its own finances or are we going to be tied to everything that happens to our next door neighbour?  I should like the Minister to tell us whether, apart from this emergency measure, which I do not believe will solve our problem, he <Col N="896" /> is prepared, if occasion requires, to prevent the property of the people of this country from being exchanged for currency which will have no value? This may appear to have no relation whatever to the Bill but the whole difficulty is owing to the fall in value of the British £ and the possibility, as the Minister says, of Britain placing tariffs on certain commodities.</P>
      <P>When are we going to be in a position to look after our own affairs here in a proper manner?  This country has suffered a tremendous loss by reason of the fact that £200,000,000 deposited in the banks of this country is invested outside the country and has suffered depreciation by the fall of the £. The Minister knows that the City of Dublin was promised a loan of one million pounds from the banks for the building of houses.  We cannot get that money now because of this financial crisis.</P>

Whatever England does not want to take on account of her present situation, we will keep out &mdash;that is what the present Bill amounts to.  We ought to have a tariff policy and not a tax policy.  Fifteen per cent. or twenty per cent. on clothes or shoes does not constitute a tariff policy; it is a tax policy.  Every tariff imposed has been merely tax-gathering. If we are to have a tariff policy, let us have regard to what the country requires and what will bring peace and security to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government every day prove more clearly the fact that they are unable to take a long view of the situation which faces this country. They are making a great fuss about this Bill.  It will have the effect of safeguarding the foal after the mare has been stolen.  As Deputy Briscoe pointed out, this is panicky legislation&mdash;legislation to deal with a panic which the Government are deliberately allowing to be created in this country. There is no reason, if the Government sat down to protect Irish industries or, as they have it in the Bill, to safeguard the country from a threatened industrial injury&mdash;there is no reason why they could not bring in a Bill which would guarantee the home market years ahead for the native Irish producer.  The difficulty with the farmer, the manufacturer and every other producer in this country is that there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell what he produces here.  The Ministers prate a lot about the foreign market and they are always sneering at the Irish market.  They talk about our exports to England and they suggest that if we cannot continue to export we shall be ruined in this country. The only reason we have to export is to pay for our imports.  If we did not import so much, we could keep a lot of our exports at home and use them for ourselves.  Take wheat, for instance.  If we grew our own wheat, we could keep at home and use for ourselves six million pounds worth of butter, bacon, eggs, beef and mutton which we have to export at present to pay for our <Col N="898" /> imports of wheat.  We have been trying to impress upon the Government that they should give a guarantee of the home market to the native producer, that they should see that it is nationally ruinous that we should be forced in times of low prices abroad to export our native products in order to pay for products which we could produce at home, but which under present circumstances we have to import, As an indication that the country generally is coming to see the correct national policy, we welcome the Bill. The Government are being forced by public opinion to take steps such as they took to-day in dealing with the oat tariff and such as they are taking in this Bill, but we wish that the Government would look ahead and make up their minds properly upon a national policy to deal with the industrial situation. They talk here of imposing, during a limited period, tariffs on goods from abroad to prevent a threatened industrial injury here.  Goods coming from abroad in future may threaten a particular industry that is at present running, but goods are coming in for every day, and have been coming in for years, that threaten to extinguish native industries.  No powers have been taken in this Bill to deal with that situation. The Government have shamefully neglected to take powers to deal with the dumping of foreign products which killed industries which we had in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The few industries that we have left are hardly worth talking about when we think of the potential industries that we should have in this country, the industries which existed here at one time and which were killed by dumping from abroad.  What is dumping? Wheat has been dumped in here. Ministers do not seem to realise it. Our farmers who are paying a pound or thirty shillings or £2 per acre for rent and rates have to compete with farmers in Canada and elsewhere who have no such overhead charges.  Wheat has certainly been dumped in here. Deputy Anthony to-day said a thing that I marvel at.  He said that we have got no forced labour and no slave labour.  What are the farmers and their employees throughout the country? <Col N="899" /> They are being forced to labour on a very low standard of living.  They are being forced to pay rent and rates and to produce goods which they sell at a very small profit, a profit that does not give them a better living than or as good a living as many slaves have. They talk about slave labour in Russia and forced labour in Russia.  No one can be quite certain whether it is going on there or not.  But we can be certain that it is going on here.</P>
    <P>Certainly the unemployed and the ordinary working classes in the towns will tell the Minister truly and pretty plainly if he goes down amongst them that there is slavery going on amongst them in this country, and that they would prefer that he would take steps to deal with the slave labour and the forced labour in this country rather than talk about slave labour and forced labour at the ends of the earth.  I have said that Ministers, if they want to do any good, if they want to give employment here in this country, should introduce a Bill which would guarantee the home market ahead for the native Irish producers so that they might give labour and wages here that would keep the workers in employment.</P>
    <P>Ministers have steadfastly refused to deal with the question of wheat, although the wheat that we import amounts to five or six million pounds worth in the year.  They brought in a Bill to deal with oats to-day, and the Minister for Agriculture said that the reason he was in favour of that Bill was in order that the people who are depending on tariffs may be disappointed. Ministers are doing in many instances the right thing in the wrong way, and they certainly dealt with the oats question in the wrongest possible way.  Instead of putting on the tariff in time to give the farmers the benefit of it, they put it on too late to benefit the farmers but in time to benefit the merchants who got the top and bought oats at a low price.</P>
    <P>Ministers should look ahead and visualise the situation that is going to arise here during the Eucharistic Congress. There have been various estimates of the number of visitors who <Col N="900" /> may come here for the Congress&mdash;a million and a million and a half and so on.  If we take no steps to prevent the dumping of foreign bacon, vegetables and things like that, we shall find without a doubt that the foreign visitors to Ireland next year will be fed on foreign produce.  The greatest possible benefit would come to the country if those visitors got good native Irish produce; if the Government said now at the beginning of November that they were going to prevent the dumping of foreign vegetables or any stuff into the country during the period of the Congress, the native Irish producers would set to work and would be quite capable of giving our foreign visitors a good plateful every day in the week of native produce.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to vegetables and fruit and other goods is this: that you have the South of England and the Channel Islands sending in a lot of their produce a fortnight before it is ordinarily ripe here, and what happens then is that it is the farmers of England and the Channel Islands who get the top prices, and when the native Irish produce is ripe and arrives on the markets the foreigners have lowered the price sometimes to a third of what it was at the start.  There is no reason in the world why that should be so.  Our fruits come in their season and the foreign producers should not be allowed to anticipate our season.  We have something for every season in the year, and our native producers are entitled to the top prices that the first fruits of the season should bring to them.  This is one of the things about which Ministers have never done anything. But it should be done.  If Ministers would give a warning now that they would do that, it would mean a lot of employment here in this country and it would give the people some heart.</P>
    <P>I am always afraid of seeing the Ministers doing the right thing because I doubt their motives.  I know they are trying to put something over on us and on the country. They have wide powers under that Bill.  If properly used they would do good, but I do <Col N="901" /> not think that the Ministers are the people who are going to make the best use of that power.  We have got to agree to the Bill because it is right in itself, but I wish to goodness there were a set of men over there who would use it in the right way.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that it has been brought to my notice within the last three or four weeks that the dumping of goods has been carried on on a really extensive scale during the last month in country towns and villages.  The dumping of these goods is not confined to leaving them at a certain store in the country towns.  Hawkers actually carry these goods from door to door and the people in the towns and villages who have to pay rents and rates, and who have to bear their share of taxation, are unable to compete with the hawkers who carry on this line of business.  I would suggest to the Minister that in addition to the powers he is taking in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I decline to accept the stinted praise that was thrown upon me with reference to this Bill.  It is not an indication of any conversion on my part or on the part of the Government to Fianna Fáil policy in regard to tariffs, a policy which I take to be the imposition of tariffs whether they are necessary or unnecessary, whether they are justifiable or unjustifiable, whether they would have beneficial effects or evil effects.  It is simply and entirely in line with the policy which the present Government have pursued in regard to tariffs.  That is to have tariffs imposed when they thought that the imposition was justified and when they thought that the results of the imposition of the tariffs would be beneficial to the country as a whole and not merely to some small group in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> It is perfectly easy to impose tariffs and to give a benefit to some few.  The difficulty is to impose tariffs without inflicting undue hardships on the general community for the sake of the few.  We have restricted this Bill because we know that everybody who wants tariffs alleges dumping.  It seems to me that allegations of dumping are so widespread that some people understand it in the way in which Deputy Aiken understands it.  I listened to Deputy Aiken's speech, and it seems to me that the only definition of dumping he understands is the importation of goods.  The Deputy used the word &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; when he seemed to me to be talking about the importation of goods from outside.  We are not against the importation of goods in the ordinary way.  Every manufacturer who finds his goods being competed with in the market says that there is dumping.  I realise that the passage of this Bill will lead to a good deal of trouble in dealing with people who will once again rush to the Department of Industry and Commerce and claim that they are being overwhelmed because of the dumping that is going on.</P>
    <P>So far as ordinary dumping is concerned, we think that can be met and ought to be met by the ordinary procedure of the Tariff Commission.  If any manufacturer finds his business suffering by reason of dumping, then in the ordinary course he should apply with the other firms engaged in the industry to the Tariff Commission for a tariff.  I am supposing that in any case where the manufacturers are able to show that they are suffering from dumping or where they can even show that the probability is they are suffering from dumping, they will so apply. It is sometimes very hard to prove dumping.  If they can even show that the probability is that they are suffering from dumping, I am satisfied that in any such case the Tariff Commission will recommend an appropriate tariff to the Executive Council, and the Executive Council will in such case bring the matter before the Dáil.  So that so far as dumping of the ordinary sort is concerned, we are satisfied that the machinery which exists already was and is adequate.  But we are <Col N="903" /> likely, because of our geographical situation, and because of the matter of language to which I have already referred, to be subjected to dumping of an extraordinary character and dumping on an unprecedented scale.  We must be prepared to guard our manufacturers against that sort of dumping.</P>
    <P>Dumping which merely lowers the price, which only takes away a percentage of the market, can be met by the procedure of the Tariff Commission, which is relatively slow.  But if there is going to be dumping that might close a factory, that might cut off three-fourths or nine-tenths of the market within a week or two, then we have got to think of another procedure. This Bill is introduced almost entirely to deal with the emergency with which we are likely to be faced because of the changes in the economic policy of Great Britain.  It can be used if there should be tremendous dumping arising from some other cause and on a very large scale&mdash;a scale that would tend to cripple some of our industries.  But so far as anything on a small scale is concerned, so far as the competition which is alleged to be dumping, and which it is difficult to know whether it is dumping or not goes, these powers are not required.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to imported cloth.  I do not know that there is any dumping of cloth on such a large scale as to cause us to have to anticipate any recommendation of the Tariff Commission, which has an application before it for an increase of the tariff on ready-made clothing.  So far as bacon is concerned, there is no dumping of bacon which would make it necessary for us to anticipate the report of the Tariff Commission on the application which is before it for a tariff on bacon.</P>
    <P>This is not a panic measure.  It is a measure which has been in view for a long time as one which might have to be introduced as soon as the change of policy in Great Britain, which is now likely, became likely.  We must all realise that the possibility of great increases of tariffs in England would make it likely that there would be a diversion of very large significance <Col N="904" /> of goods which had been manufactured for the English market, and which had hitherto been confined to the English market, into this country under the changed conditions.</P>
    <P>It may be that the period which has been set down for the Bill is too short. On the other hand, it is more likely that the changes which we would generally expect in British policy will have taken place before the expiration of nine months, and it will be no longer necessary to have these very drastic powers.  We do not want to have powers if they are not necessary simply because, as I have already said, every person who wants a tariff automatically alleges dumping, and frequently alleges dumping when there is not a shadow of justification for the allegation.  It is very seldom that we have been able to get what seemed to be proof of actual dumping.  I have seen one or two cases that seemed to me to be reasonably well-founded, where the evidence seemed to be fairly sufficient, but in the great majority of cases that came before me it certainly was at least doubtful whether there was any dumping or not.</P>
    <P>The manufacturer who carries on abroad and efficiently sells his goods at a reasonable profit here is not dumping. I would not go so far as to say that he must sell under the cost of production in order to be dumping.  I think that is, perhaps, the strict definition of dumping.  I would not go so far as to say that.  I would not say any person was dumping unless he was selling at such prices that he could not make what could be regarded in the trade as an ordinary profit for himself having regard to his own cost of manufacture.  I do not regard goods as dumped simply because some manufacturer elsewhere was able to make them a good deal more cheaply than the manufacturer here and, accordingly, would be able to sell them here more cheaply.</P>

      <P>But we do not go anywhere near accepting the idea that Deputy Aiken has of dumping, and consequently we regard these as powers that should remain only as long as the dangers arising out of the present situation across the Channel remain.  So far as ordinary trade competition, whether it is fair or unfair competition, is concerned, the needs of the situation here can be met by an application to the Tariff Commission in the ordinary way or, in an extreme case, where the people concerned in the industry cannot agree to make an application, an application might be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <P>SECTION I.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Executive Council is satisfied, on the report of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the immediate imposition or variation of a customs duty on any particular description of goods is necessary to prevent an expected dumping of goods of that description or an expected <Col N="906" /> importation of goods of that description, in either case arising out of financial or other events in other countries and occurring in circumstances which would occasion industrial injury, the Executive Council may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if no customs duty is then in force in respect of goods of the said particular description, by order impose, whether with or without qualifications, restrictions, or exemptions, a customs duty of such an amount as they think proper to specify in such order on all goods of the said particular description imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after a day (not being prior to the day on which such an order is made) specified in such order and (if the Executive Council thinks fit so to specify) on all goods of the said particular description landed in Saorstát Eireann on or after the said day; or</P>
    <P>(b)  if a customs duty is then in force in respect of goods of the said particular description, by order vary, in respect of goods imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after a day (not being prior to the day on which such order is made) specified in such order and (if the Executive Council thinks fit so to specify) in respect of goods landed in Saorstát Eireann on or after the said day, the said customs duty in all or any of the following ways, that is to say, by increasing the rate of the said duty by such amount, or by imposing such conditions or restrictions or by terminating such exemptions as the Executive Council shall in each case think proper to specify in such order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In lines 25 and 26 to delete the words &ldquo;in either case arising out of financial or other events in other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that unless these words are deleted this Bill cannot be possibly operated to prevent the dumping of Polish suits, Russian sweets and Chinese bacon, or anything <Col N="907" /> else which Deputies spoke of.  The Minister has made it quite clear in his concluding speech on the Second Stage that it is not intended that the Bill should be used to prevent the dumping of articles of that kind which does not arise out of financial or other events in other countries.  I am proposing, however, that the scope of the Bill should be extended by the deletion of these words so as to confer upon the Executive Council the power to use it to prevent the dumping which Deputies on both sides of the House have been deploring during the past hour.  I hope these Deputies will support my amendment if the Minister decides to oppose it.  If the amendment is defeated and these words remain in the Bill, I am not at all clear that the Bill can in fact be made effective to deal with any dumping that is likely to occasion industrial injury here.  What the exact significance and effect of the words are is not clear.  I should like the Minister to make it clear.  I am quite certain that if they are deleted the meaning of the section will be clear.  It will confer upon the Executive Council power to deal with dumping at any time, no matter from what cause that dumping may arise.  I am very strongly of the opinion that the Executive Council should have that power and therefore I propose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want power to deal with dumping except dumping that will arise out of some situation such as you have in England, or perhaps dumping that might arise out of a sensational collapse of currency in some country, or some special thing like that that would lead to dumping on an altogether unprecedented scale, on such an extensive scale that immediate action would be necessary.  I do not know how far any variation in the words would actually tie or loose the Executive Council in the exercise of their powers, because the words are put in here more as a headline.  They are rather vague words and put in more as a headline than as precise words that will actually tie up the Executive Council.  They are fairly loose.  They are meant to tie us <Col N="908" /> to action when there are unusual events outside operating.  If they were not in, and if we were left perfectly free to deal with any sort of dumping, I would be afraid that it might injure the efficiency of the machine for dealing with the sort of dumping that we do want to deal with, which might come suddenly, on a great scale, and if not checked do great injury to our industrial machine.  Undoubtedly it would prevent us having to turn away all those people who are going to come with all the unfounded or ill-founded stories of dumping which it would be difficult to refuse to investigate, and which might occupy, to the exclusion of the things they ought to be considering, the officials who will be appointed to watch events in this particular matter.</P>
      <P>The present Executive Council are fully determined not to deal with these ordinary allegations of dumping under this Bill, and if we do not put some phrase in the Bill cutting them out from consideration, then, as I say, we are going to have officers held up by these applications; we are going to have the wheels of the machine really impeded, and the things that we mean to deal with, the things that are a real danger, the things that there is no other method of dealing with, cannot be as well dealt with as if we were able to reserve the time and energy of those who will be dealing with the matter for watching these particular dangers.</P>

      <P>Industrial injury is being caused, we are assured by Deputies Byrne and Anthony and others, by the dumping at present of Polish clothing, Russian sweets and Chinese bacon.  Deputy Byrne told us that this Bill will stop that.  The Minister made it clear that it will not. We are anxious that it should, and that the industrial injury which is being caused by such importation will be prevented without the long delay that any application to the Tariff Commission involves.  We are not asking that the Executive Council should take hasty action or irreparable action.  If the Executive Council decide to act on such an allegation of dumping under this Bill, then they can review their action within ten days before coming with the motion required under the Bill to the Dáil, and if they decide that their action was taken hastily and without proper information as to the circumstances they can undo what they have done.  But, in any case, we think that power to prevent industrial injury arising out of dumping should be in the possession of the Executive Council, whether that dumping is caused by public events in other countries or a policy adopted by particular manufacturers.</P>

      <P>In practically all other countries as I have been able to get information from about their arrangements in such matters, I found that the machinery is that there is an investigation <Col N="910" /> by a Board or Committee or Tariff Commission or some such body, and then, if it is found that there is dumping, action is taken by the Government.  We are proposing here in certain cases to dispense with that because the dumping may suddenly commence and be on such a scale that it would be no use acting after we had received a report from the Commission.  In that sort of a case we may act under this Bill.  In cases that do not seem to be of that character we have the machinery of the Tariff Commission and, while there is not just the same power as some other Governments have, there will be speedy action in dealing with ordinary dumping.</P>

      <P>I rather agree with Deputy Murphy.  I have got a sort of feeling that I must be wrong.  I rather hesitate to go on for fear I might be under misapprehension.  But it seems to me the words themselves are very strong.  The words are &ldquo;arising out of financial or other events.&rdquo;  As far as I can see the words &ldquo;other events&rdquo; would cover nearly anything and, but for the explanation given by the Minister, I would be inclined to think that the particular amendment was unnecessary but, having regard to the statement of the Minister, it does seem to be necessary.  As far as I can see the Minister does not know what the words mean and he does not want us to know what they mean.  But we know <Col N="911" /> what we mean and, therefore, we want the wording to mean what we do mean.</P>

      <P>Entirely too involved for the intelligence of the Deputy.  It is for reasons of this kind that I hesitate to believe that Deputy Murphy meant what he said when I found myself in agreement with him. The Minister apparently wants to take certain powers, that is powers that he is not prepared to use but powers that he can use.  That is what he wants.  He wants the whole thing to be entirely indefinite.  Rightly or wrongly we should know what we mean in our Act.  As far as I can see the Minister wants to have a sort of power of binding or loosing as he likes and not as the Bill says.  Whatever may be the intention of the Minister this Bill when it becomes an Act will have to be construed by lawyers after he is gone.  And it is for that reason that I call attention to the fact that this is only to remain in force for nine months.  The intention is that the Act shall only be in the possession of a Government which does not know what it means by the Acts which it draws.  We object to this Act being confined to nine months and we object to its being in such a vague form that the Minister does not know what it means.  For this reason I am in favour of an amendment which will make it absolutely and precisely clear that the power which, in my opinion, is given in it is the power intended to be acted on and the power intended to be used.</P>

      <P>The Minister denies that this is panic and rushed legislation. I cannot see any reason why this Bill should not be discussed to-morrow or next week in Committee Stage.  I cannot see any reason why it should be introduced to-day and that we should be given from 3.30 to 7 o'clock to see the Bill, put in amendments, and then have the Bill passed to-night.  The Minister should give us time to consider what he means.  If he would read the series of speeches he made upon the Bill he <Col N="912" /> would find he made three different speeches.  On the introduction of the Bill he gave particular reasons why it was necessary.  On the Second Reading he gave another reason and now again on the Committee Stage he referred to different matters.  I ask the Minister what he is keeping back? By other events does he anticipate some country would be in the state of war and that that might be an event that might entitle us to say we will stop their goods coming in here? China might be in a state of war with Japan and the Minister might say that by virtue of this section we are entitled to stop the dumping of Chinese goods in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked the Minister to try and define the word &ldquo;dumping.&rdquo; The Minister defined it in his own way. Some of us might consider that if a country subsidised the manufacturer of a certain commodity, and that commodity being produced under these circumstances in a particular country, might give us the right to consider that that commodity was dumped by reason of the fact that it was subsidised in the country in which it was produced. I do not know whether the Minister could get a definition of dumping that would meet with the approval of everyone, taking into consideration the various views we hold as to what creates dumping.  You might have a country where a manufacturer was producing at a reasonable profit to himself and paying a reasonable rate of wages according to the conditions there, but the money of that country compared, say, with this country might be so depreciated that we would have to call it dumping if they sent goods in here, owing to the low value of their currency as compared with ours.  You have various points of view. The Minister says he does not think this will be put into use immediately. It will be a slow process.  If that is so, why should the Bill be rushed through the House?  Why not postpone the Committee Stage for a few days and give us an opportunity of thinking things out or, at least, digesting the Minister's explanations?  I think there is something sinister behind the use of the words &ldquo;or other <Col N="913" /> events.&rdquo;  There is something more than meets the eye, and the Minister has some other reasons that he does not want to give the House.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to add at the end of the section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that no such order shall be made in respect of any particular description of goods which are not, at the date of the making of such report by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, manufactured in commercial quantities within Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of inserting that proviso is to ensure that this Bill can be used only for the protection of Irish industries and not for the protection of British industries, in other words, so that the Executive Council could not operate to exclude, for example, the importation of German goods&mdash;a class not manufactured here, for the benefit of English importers, or to exclude Russian goods for the benefit of American exporters, or to use the Bill in any way except to protect Irish industries against dumping of the class described in the section. It seems to me that if some such proviso is not put in, the Bill can be used for other purposes than the protection of Irish industries.  After all we cannot protect industries that do not exist, and therefore I am sure the Minister can have no objection to the insertion of these words if, in fact, the sole intention in the Bill is to give him the power he asks to deal with dumping likely to cause industrial damage here.  Deputy Byrne talked at length about using this Bill as a means of retaliation in the event of a tariff being imposed on Irish goods in other countries. I take it that there is no such intention as Deputy Byrne suggests. I would like to be assured also by the insertion of these words that there is no intention to use the powers conferred on the Executive Council as a counter in a bargain with England in relation to protective duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy raises is covered by the phrase in sub-section (1) before the two paragraphs &ldquo;which would occasion industrial injury.&rdquo;  That makes it clear that the purpose of the Bill is to deal with the importation of goods which would tend to close up some industry here. The objection I have to the Deputy's amendment is that a great many disputes might arise as to what were &ldquo;commercial quantities.&rdquo;  You might even have an order challenged on that particular basis.  You might have people with a relatively small industry&mdash;shall I say the leather industry or some other industry like that?&mdash;but still one well enough rooted here, who might challenge what were &ldquo;commercial quantities.&rdquo;  There might also be a question of substituting goods.  You might have a class of article in general use manufactured here.  You might have some article which could be used as a pretty general substitute for it not manufactured here.  Nevertheless, it could be used for the same purpose as the goods manufactured here.  You would be shut out from dealing with the substitute by this amendment as it would not provide for the substituted article.  Generally I think the situation is sufficiently safeguarded by the indication in the first part of the sub-section to prevent industrial injury, and secondly by the provision that the whole matter must come before the Dáil within ten sitting days, and must be confirmed in the ordinary way.  If it is not a matter that the Executive Council feel sure will commend itself to the Dáil it cannot take the risk of acting.  If it is a matter that would commend itself to the Dáil, supposing all the manoeuvres that Deputy Lemass fears take place, then it is not a matter of great urgency and a resolution could be introduced.  The <Col N="917" /> whole purpose of the Bill, is to deal with something that must be dealt with within two or three days to prevent big and sudden importations.  I think certain difficulties might be occasioned by these amendments and that the wording of the Bill and the general provisions for dealing with these proposed tariffs sufficiently safeguard the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the words in the amendment &ldquo;manufactured in commercial quantities&rdquo; are much too loose and general, but surely they are much more precise than the words which the Minister relies on to justify the rejection of the amendment.  He says that the words in line 29 &ldquo;which would occasion industrial injury&rdquo; would safeguard the position which Deputy Lemass has in mind.  I think that the words &ldquo;manufactured in commercial quantities&rdquo; are a much more precise term than the words &ldquo;which would occasion industrial injury.&rdquo;  They are much less liable to abuse.  After all, we have got to remember that we are placing a very great power in the hands of the Executive Council and that the words &ldquo;which would occasion industrial injury&rdquo; are capable of very wide interpretation. First of all the injury might be an immediate injury, injury to an industry immediately concerned with the manufacture of goods which are being dumped here, or it might be an injury to an ancillary or subsidiary industry.  It seems that the words are capable of far too great an extension if they are allowed to stand in the Bill as at present.  The avowed purpose of the Bill is to prevent injury being done to native industries.  If there are no existing industries which would be so injured, then there is no occasion for the Bill and no reason for the wide powers which the Minister asks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I do not think it any safeguard to say that this matter would be referred to the Dáil within ten sitting days.  We know that if the Executive Council make up their minds to take action under the Bill and if they come to the Dáil within a period of ten sitting days, they would make it a matter of confidence and they would <Col N="918" /> compel their usual Party majority to go into the lobby in support of it, particularly if the action which they had taken gave rise to any serious contention here, and if there was a grave difference of opinion between the Government Party and the Opposition on the merits or as to their justification for acting under the Bill.  We would have the Party Whips put on the other side.  In that case it would only result in this, that the Executive Council would act as dictators in this fiscal matter and the country or the people affected by the action of the Executive Council would have no hope of having the decision of the Executive Council reversed or revised in any way.</P>
    <P>I think that, the amendment which Deputy Lemass proposed is one which ought to be accepted by the House.  It is much easier for the general public to ascertain that goods were being manufactured in commercial quantities than to specify that the importation of certain goods was going to occasion industrial injury.  With regard to the question of substitute goods if the principle were once accepted a verbal alteration in the amendment would cover that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies cast their minds back to the first Report of the Tariff Commission dealing with an application for a tariff on woollen goods, they will find there stated on behalf of the manufacturers that there was a class of goods that had affixed to it a well-known trade description&mdash;&ldquo;shoddy&rdquo;&mdash;into the manufacture of which they were not going to enter. It was suggested by the Tariff Commission that by co-operative effort the millers might establish one or two factories for the manufacture of shoddy.  They said that they would not do it, and so far they have not made any attempt to do it. Shoddy is a trade description. Is the Executive Council to be precluded from preventing the importation into this country of immense quantities of articles that would come under the heading of shoddy even though that might do tremendous industrial injury to the woollen manufacturers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of the description of goods.  It seems to me that the Government are trying to avoid the real issue here.  The Minister for Finance talked of the ten days within which an order must be approved of by the Dáil, that is ten days on which the Dáil has sat and which might in fact be six calendar months so that the safeguard is very slight.  The point the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made, even though I grant there is some substance in it, avoids the real issue.  I want to be satisfied in the wording of the Bill that it can only be used to protect Irish industry and for no other purpose.  If German electrical machinery were dumped here in a strict sense and sold below cost of production, could this Bill be operated to exclude that for the benefit of the British electrical machinery industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer would be that the dumping should be such that it would occasion industrial injury. Who is to be the judge?  Could the German importer go to the court for a declaration that the importation of these goods did not cause industrial injury, or is the Executive Council to be the sole judge as to whether or not the injury is caused?  Can their judgment be questioned in any way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be questioned, but there are three ways of dealing with this.  You can adopt some machinery like the Tariff Commission, which will investigate first, and the Executive Council will act afterwards.  You can insist on all the ordinary legislative processes, or you can believe that the clear intention of the Dáil, the pledged word of the Executive, the power of the Dáil to agree with it afterwards, will be effective or not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass raised an important point.  He said suppose electrical machinery was being sold here at a price below that which British or other manufacturers could sell such machinery, could the Bill, with Section 2 as it now stands, be operated to prevent the sale of such machinery here on grounds like these, that a certain agreement had been entered into between this country and another country whereby Jacob's biscuits or Guinness' stout were to be given preferential treatment in that market, but that one of the conditions was that the manufactures of that other country were to be sold here? Supposing the German stuff were to come in, and the British electrical manufacturers were to protest against that, and were to close their markets to our biscuits or stout, the Minister and the Executive Council could say that the dumping of this machinery which was being sold here below the cost of what the British manufacturer could sell it is causing grave industrial injury, and under the Bill they could prohibit its import.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As between Deputy Lemass's amendment and the provision made in the Bill, my liking is for the wider powers which are contained in the Bill.  I believe that the wording here which gives the Minister <Col N="921" /> power to take action on the occurrence of circumstances which would occasion industrial injury is wider and more extensive than the suggestion in Deputy Lemass's amendment, which, in my opinion, would limit the Minister's power.  I can conceive cases where very great injury would be done to industry here by the importation of an article which is not manufactured here, but which might well be used as a substitute for an article which is manufactured here, and which might be bought by the general public in substitution for an article that is manufactured here.  If Deputy Lemass's amendment were adopted, I think it would tie the hands of the Executive Council and prevent them from stopping the dumping here of such an article.  We would not be manufacturing it ourselves here, but we would be manufacturing some article for which this was intended to be a substitute, and in that way grave injury might be done to industry.</P>
      <P>Because of that my preference is for the wider power which is given in the Bill.  If it is a question of giving power to the Executive Council by passing the Second Reading of the Bill, we have, in fact, given power to the Executive Council to take action when in their opinion action should be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of substitution, surely that would be met by adding the words &ldquo;or are substitutes for articles so manufactured.&rdquo; That would protect the situation Deputy Lemass's amendment was designed to cover.  Again, we have it on the words of the Minister for Finance that there would be no power of appeal to any court under this Bill, that once the Executive Council had issued an order, the order would stand until it came to the Dáil. In that case the addition of the words I have suggested would cover the whole position of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what exact significance the words &ldquo;immediately upon the making thereof&rdquo; have in this section.

      <P>What we would have to do is what we really do in the case of resolutions&mdash;we should have to say as from four o'clock on Friday or from, say, 15th of August or whatever date was in question.  If the order comes into force on a particular day it comes into operation at the beginning of the day&mdash;at 12 o'clock midnight.  Suppose we got word that there were ships with goods to which this Bill would apply coming into Dublin and we made an order at three o'clock, we would probably state in the order that it was to take effect as from 3.5 o'clock, so that any goods that had not been landed before 3.5 would be liable to tax.</P>

      <P>Under sub-section (2), it is provided that if the Dáil passes a resolution making modifications in the order, such resolution shall operate to modify the order as from the passing of the resolution.  Subsequently, in Section 4, provision is made for repayment of duties collected which would not have been collected if these modifications had been always in operation. There appears to be a certain conflict there, because it would appear from sub-section (2) of Section 2, that the order without modifications held force until the resolution was passed by the Dáil and was then changed, whereas Section 4 seems to imply that the resolution of the Dáil would have the effect of modifying the order as from the date on which the order was first made.</P>

      <P>We could make a further order but any money that might have been collected under the first order would have to be repaid.  It would be possible to make another order and the Executive would probably do that if it happened to be necessary.  If the duty was sufficient, very little of it would have been collected, so that all that would happen, if we had to make a second order, would be that whatever small amount was collected would have to be repaid to those who paid it.  A further order could be made that would prevent the dumping.  That four <Col N="924" /> months is the period provided in the Collection of Taxes Act and it has been found sufficient up to this.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in refusing to allow Deputies to make representations in person to the Deciding Officer on behalf of old age pension claimants whose cases are on appeal whether at the instance of the Pension Officer or of the claimants themselves.  &mdash; (Deputies Ward and Maguire.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I cannot see any reasonable cause for the interdict of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on Deputies having access to the deciding officers in cases of appeal on old age pensions. I do say that there is something to be said possibly in preventing offices from being disorganised and business being delayed, but I do not think that there is any real cause why the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should put his foot down absolutely and say that no Deputy is to have access to these deciding officers in these cases. Let us endeavour to trace the history of an application for an old age pension. Let us see what happens from its initiation until there is a decision by the deciding officers in the Local Government Department.  There is an application by the particular person seeking an old age pension, there is a visit from the pension officer, there are a certain number of questions asked by the pensions officer of the old <Col N="929" /> person, and I am not at all quite certain in my mind that enough explanation is given by the pension officers in asking these questions of the old people.  That is a matter possibly which does not concern the Minister for Local Government so intimately as it would concern the Department of Finance.  In the majority of cases the old age pension is granted when it comes before the Pension Committee and the reason why it is granted is because the members of the Pension Committee have local intimate knowledge of the conditions of the old persons seeking the pensions.</P>
      <P>The Pension Committees are composed of public men, whether they are elected public men or nominated public men, and they are public men who are intimately acquainted with the lives and conditions of the people seeking these old age pensions.  I do know what information some of these men on the Committee can give to their colleagues on these bodies.  I am a member of a Pension Committee in Clare and I attend as often as I can. I do know in helping us in Mid-Clare to come to a decision in a case in West Clare, the County Councillor in West Clare would give us his intimate knowledge of the conditions of the applicant in that case.  The Committee would decide the case on that information. But the pension officer goes on some information that he has tabulated, something which he has filled in on his form and he makes an appeal to the Local Government Department.  Here is where we come against the crux, that a Deputy is not allowed to go to the Department and to amplify and explain what is the position as regards those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister think that there is not more in five minutes' conversation with a person on any matter in the way of explaining any difficulty than could be put in any number of sheets of writing.  It is not so much what the Deputy says when he comes to the deciding officer, not so much at all what the Deputy says offhand. It is because of the points that are troubling the deciding officer.  Let me, in passing, pay a tribute to the deciding officers.  I want to say that as <Col N="930" /> far as I know wherever there was a reasonable case made by the Deputies up to now, when I had recourse to these deciding officers, I always found that they were prepared to do what was just for the people receiving the pensions.  But the particular points that are troubling the deciding officers, the very points that they want to have cleared up, are not put to anybody who can clear them up.  If these points were known to those people who were sponsoring those claims for a pension, the deciding officers might very easily be put easy in their minds and the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I do not say that I should go down to the Custom House and go in and say that so-and-so from my County should get a pension without these matters being investigated by the Local Government Department afterwards, if the deciding officer considers they are worthy of investigation.  But I do say that they should be in a position to endeavour to set at ease all doubts that they may have in their minds.  These matters should be investigated by the Senior Inspectors of the Local Government Department. Here is where the great injustice is done when a case is decided against an applicant: The applicant applies again in six months' time and in nine out of ten cases the very same case goes up from the pension officer as went up six months previously.  The old age pension claimant is not in a position to put his case as clearly as the pensions officer who sends up the appeal is able to make the case against it.  The pensions officer sends up his old file and that file goes to the Local Government Department again.  In nine out of ten cases it is decided on the first case made by the pensions officer, with out any advertence to the fact that the person making the application has no means of knowing definitely why the appeal for a pension has been turned down.  The person is told that it is turned down on the grounds of means or on the grounds of age or of not satisfying statutory conditions.  There are, however, particular points in all these things which could be met.  There are things which could be cleared up. There are many things that could be <Col N="931" /> investigated.  There are points which are obscure in affidavits which could be made clear and these things could be made clear by a Deputy having recourse to the deciding officer.</P>
    <P>I want to give one case to illustrate what I have in mind.  It was a most glaring instance of what I mean and has remained in my mind.  I was interested in the case of the wife of a neighbour of mine who was looking for a blind pension.  Her husband was interrogated by the pensions officer, who asked him what his weekly wages were and he said so much.  Whatever income he said he had would accrue to him if he had constant work, but the man had not constant work.  As a matter of fact, he had only about six or eight weeks' work in the year.  I said to the man that there would be no difficulty in his wife getting the pension&mdash;that there was no case against her getting it, as she was totally blind.  What did I find?  In about two months' time that man came to me and said the application had been turned down by the Local Government Department.  I could not believe it.  I got a further claim made, as, of course, once a case has been decided they have to make a further application. An appeal was made against the second application on the pensions officer's file without further investigation. I had an opportunity of going to the deciding officer and putting the case to him showing him where the fallacy lay and the woman got the pension. That is only one instance.  I am sure there are many other instances which could be quoted.  For a Deputy to say, &ldquo;I know such a person is 70 years of age,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know such a person has not the means,&rdquo; possibly would not make the case for the applicant. There are certain things operating in the mind of the deciding officer, certain doubts operating in his mind, genuinely operating and troubling the mind of the deciding officer, who is endeavouring to be fair, and if a Deputy had five minutes' conversation with the deciding officer, and the pensions officer put his queries and points, the Deputy could meet these queries and <Col N="932" /> points.  The Department need not take the Deputy's word.  The Department could investigate the matter on the basis of the information given by the Deputy, and then there would be an opportunity of giving these people justice.  I think there is no case for the interdict of the Minister, and I hope he will see his way to allow Deputies to have an opportunity of meeting the difficulties of the deciding officer in reaching a fair decision on appeals from pensions officers.</P>

      <P>They can come. All the machinery necessary is put before them so that they can dictate any statement they want to dictate with regard to the case about which they have information.  The change in the procedure, that had been allowed to develop up to a particular point, is that Deputies are not allowed to approach the deciding officer.  As I say, a practice developed by which Deputies came very often and in very great numbers to the deciding officer, and came with long lists of cases about which they had no firsthand information of any kind, and very often had little information passed on to them of any kind except a notification that a person had applied for an old age pension and the important work of dealing with old age pensions appeals was blocked and held up as a result.  In many cases attempts were made to overbear the judgment of the deciding officer, not by facts, but by <Col N="933" /> pleadings with regard to a particular case.  Two things were made clear to me in connection with the matter.  In the first place, the old age pensions appeals department was not getting a fair chance of doing its work; the work it was doing was being done on a wrong basis, and not necessarily on actual facts properly put before the deciding officer as they ought to have been put before him.  On the other hand, I was put into this position in connection with the machinery which has been established for dealing with old age pensions, that sub-committees were being led to feel that it was pressure and representations at headquarters that were going to be most effective in deciding doubtful cases, rather than a thorough examination of the cases below.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that the whole machinery for dealing with old age pensions was examined into by a Committee set up by this House which reported in 1926; that that Committee emphasised that the local sub-committee was the pivotal point in the whole machinery for considering pensions claims.  After having examined certain other suggestions for dealing with appeals the Committee found that the machinery that existed for appeals was the most satisfactory machinery that they could suggest.  At any rate, they could not better the machinery that existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined, in the first place, that the appeals section of the Department shall have an opportunity of dealing with appeals in the calm atmosphere of having the facts put before them and of deciding on the facts put before them, and not in the atmosphere that can be created by a number of Deputies coming and arguing particular cases.  In the second place I am going to keep absolutely clear in the eyes of the sub-committees dealing with this important work in the country any suggestion of political influence of any kind or influence of of Deputies directly.  I am going to keep the fairness and impartiality of the work of the Appeal Board perfectly clear in the eyes of the sub-committees dealing with these particular matters.  Deputy Hogan really gives his own case away and the case <Col N="934" /> for Deputies presenting themselves.  He feels that in such cases the deciding officers have doubts in their minds which can be eased by Deputies coming in and probing their minds and finding out what those doubts and difficulties are and helping to resolve them; that Deputies have only to come in and say:&mdash;&ldquo;So-and-so has sent in an application for an old age pension; the case was discussed by the sub-committee, and the pensions officer in the area put all the facts with regard to this person's age and means before the sub-committee, the officer disagrees with the sub-committee in their finding and has appealed to the appeal section of the Department against the decision of the sub-committee.  We want to know what are the difficulties in this particular case.&rdquo;  Without first-hand knowledge about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Can you deny a pension to this poor feliow living on a small holding?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I cannot allow that misrepresentation of my statement to go. I did not say any such thing, and the Minister knows that.  I said I knew there were genuine doubts in the minds of the deciding officers, and that in five minutes' conversation between a Deputy and a deciding officer, all the points that were obscure could be discussed.  The Deputy could give all the information and the Local Government Department could investigate these matters.  I never suggested there should be any wrangling or argument or pleading or anything of that kind.</P>

There are no doubts which cannot be settled either by a direct return to the local people or by sending an inspector down.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ward submits in this particular matter that Deputies have a right to go into any particular Department and see that the work is properly done there.  Neither Deputies themselves nor any other self-appointed people can walk into a Department of the State and see how the Department is run.  The claim is made, that Deputies should be able to walk into the Department of Local Government and ask for the files with regard to old age pension cases and go through them. That practice never obtained and that practice never will obtain as long as I have any responsibility for dealing with this matter of appeal.</P>

We have a sample of the lengths to which Deputies will go in the case of Deputy Cassidy the other night, who got up and abused some of us for our attitude towards old age pensions.  He cited a case in which the question at issue was one of age.  He made the emphatic statement that no certificate of birth being available and the only certificate being the marriage certificate, the marriage certificate made no reference to the age of the person in question, whereas in fact the marriage certificate does state the age of the person in question and does show the person to be considerably younger than 70 years of age.  He was aware of that, because all the local people connected with the case, together with the sub-committee, were aware of that.  Yet nevertheless he wants to be in a position to sound the poor old age pensioners' trumpet and to carry on a discussion here on that particular matter.</P>

      <P>In the interests of the old age pensioners I want the sub-committees to do their work.  Sub-committees throughout the country are in many cases doing their work and realising their responsibilities very well.  Deputy Hogan says in the majority of cases they recommend pensions because they know the facts. There is no fact of a case brought out in examination by the local pensions officer that the sub-committee has not before them when they examine the case.  Deputies suggest that the local pensions officer does not appear before <Col N="937" /> the sub-committee.  The local pensions officer is required by his instructions to appear before the sub-committee when they want him and my information is that he invariably does.  There is no meeting of the sub-committee at which the pensions officer will not be present if the committee want him.  There is no use in Deputies getting up here and trying to persuade other Deputies that facts are put before the Department of Local Government for the purpose of appeal that have not been before the sub-committee, and that there has not been an opportunity of arguing out face to face between the local sub-committee and the local pensions officer in the presence of the claimant for the pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was never aware of it.  I know that in some cases the officer may come to the meeting.  My point is that where a committee awards a certain pension, on what they consider to be the means of the applicant, a report is sent up by the pension officer disputing the amount of the award. The officer disputes the award and puts a very high value on a cow, an ass or a few drills of potatoes.  That prevents old people from getting the pension. I can get proof, if the Minister requires it, to that effect.  If the Minister consults local committees he will find that I am stating the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my object in this matter is to get him to do his work properly as a member of a sub-committee in the interests of the old age pensioners. He can do the work much better as a Deputy than by going to the appeal officers in order to have matters decided on his personal representations <Col N="939" /> rather than on the responsible examination of the old age pensioners' conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I very seldom go near an old age pension officer and I have seven or eight years' experience of the work.  I have had complaints in my county from various sub-committees in rural areas that the pension officers go out of their way to place a very high value on the means of the applicants.  Where there is a half acre of land with a cottage the pension officer places too high a value on it, much higher than the local committee would place on it, and the pension officer's case is always upheld by the Department.  If the Minister states that pension officers will go before local committees in cases where there is a dispute and come to an agreement, and if the decision is sent to the Department I will accept that.  It has not been the general practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to think, and I feel that the Wicklow sub-committee are not as neglectful as the Deputy suggests, that when the facts are presented to the Department by local pension officers they are not able to argue effectively when too high a value is placed on the income from holdings.  I must say if we are to accept that, the committees are chargeable with very serious neglect of the interests of the old age pensioners in Wicklow, if they have failed to make the necessary representations to the Minister for Local Government on that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of an old age pensions committee since 1925, and it is only recently that the committee learned that they were entitled to have the pension officer present at their meetings.  I have only seen pension officers present at two meetings.  I am here to make representations to the Minister about the value placed on the holdings of applicants for the pension.  In one case the officer valued the profit from an acre of ground in a rural district at £30. He told the committee that that was <Col N="940" /> all cut and dried in his instructions, that the amount was fixed and that he could not reduce it.  The valuation and other particulars were there.  I know that one of these gentlemen spent three weeks going around after a labourer, over 70 years of age, who had worked all his life on the land.  He had no Treaty rights under Article 10 so that he would get a decent pension. No special cost-of-living bonus is allowed to him by the farmer and he has none of the perquisites that the pension officer will be entitled to in his old age.  The officer spent three weeks going after the applicant to find out where he cut furze and weeded turnips here and there.  The officer even included the price of half an ounce of tobacco that he got on Saturday night. He made out that the board that the man received from farmers was worth 17s. 6d. a week.  That was mentioned in the appeal that was sent up and that was allowed by the Appeal Board.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us we are trying to make political capital out of the old age pensioners.  I have only been in pension offices twice within the last five years and I won the two cases that I was interested in.  If I had not gone in the applicants would not have got the pensions yet.  These unfortunate people are not in the position of officials with whom the Minister has been in touch within the last eight or nine years, and from whose point of view apparently he cannot now separate himself.  These people have no pension rights under Article 10 and no fat pensions to fall back upon.  I maintain that any man who has worked on the land until he is 70 years of age is entitled to a pension, and is much better entitled to it than gentlemen who served three or four years in a &ldquo;buckshee&rdquo; army and who got a couple of thousand pounds.</P>

I am prepared, in my attempt to get sub-committees to stand up to the work that is theirs, and that can be done by no one else except themselves, to deal with any communications with regard to general matters and with regard to difficulties under which sub-committees suffer at present.  It would be as a result of representation from sub-committees with reference to specific difficulties <Col N="943" /> arising from their actual experience, that solution of these difficulties can come rather than as a result of question and answer here.  I think Deputies will admit that what the report of 1926 really emphasised was that the sub-committee had work to do and that in some cases it was not doing it properly, that nothing in the machinery could fill the place of the sub-committee.  I could not say that I have received a single representation from any sub-committee in the country or from any county committee with regard to any particular class of difficulty under which they suffer as a general rule.  I do feel certain that if these were difficulties on the part of the committees which they could classify and discuss in that way, we would have heard about them.  I wish sub-committees would refer to the report made in 1926 and to the difficulties which that report mentioned and follow up that report as to the improvements that could be introduced into the system to enable the work to be performed satisfactorily.</P>

I want also to say in fairness to the Minister that on many occasions we appealed against the decision of the pensions officer, and as often as the pension officer got through, we got through.

      <P>It is not a question of a complaint at all.  It is a question of where you find officers giving a wrong interpretation to the Old Age Pensions Act.  It has been proved time and time again that that has been done. Nobody likes to have a whole State trial about it.  I think the Minister should understand quite well what I mean when I say that.</P>

      <P>A strong case has been made why the Dáil should approve Deputy Ward's motion.  From my experience down the country of pension cases I found the poorer persons were the harder they found it to get a pension.  They have no friends to work for them, and they fail to get a pension. Many pension officers are very fair with regard to old people getting a pension, but there are more who are the exception.  I found some pension officers very much opposed to persons who had no friends to work for them. Every Deputy in this House is aware <Col N="945" /> that from time to time the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance send down to the pension officers in the country very definite strict instructions. The pensions officer is under the Minister for Finance.  It is his duty to delay all pensions, and to try and prevent as many people as possible from getting pensions.  That is my experience.</P>
      <P>We understand the reason is that they are trying to save the Exchequer a certain amount of money each year. We find that in a number of cases old persons, justly entitled to pensions, cannot get their pensions because they cannot find their certificates in many cases.  In other cases the pensions officer puts a certain valuation on means which they have got.  When old people employed all their lives on a farm come to the age of seventy and look for a pension, because they are maintained on the farm and are unable to do any work, a certain valuation is put on their maintenance. In several instances they are deprived of half their just pension.</P>
      <P>A case has been made why Deputies should be allowed to see the appeals officers.  In many instances pensions which were turned down on several occasions by the Department were granted after Deputies had seen the appeals officer.  I am sure that the Minister has every confidence that his officers will not be subject to influence, but when they hear the case put up on behalf of an applicant for an old age pension in many cases they grant the pension.  It is the only State Department where Deputies are not allowed to plead the case of their constituents.  The old age pensioners have very few to plead their case for them and if their representatives are not allowed to go and have the final word it is very harsh.  I would like the Minister to state whether he has found that since the Fianna Fáil Party came into the Dáil the pensions bill has gone up.  I suppose that is why the Deputies were kept out of it.  Another reason is the Fianna Fáil Deputies were more energetic in getting pensions for people down the country than the Deputies opposite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many of them woke up.  The Minister knows also that members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party objected because members of the Fianna Fáil Party were active in getting pensions.  That is one of the main reasons why Deputies were shut out.  The Minister will not admit it I know, but it is one of the reasons.  Objection was taken by members of Cumann na nGaedheal who were too sleepy and would not work and look after the interests of their constituents.</P>
      <P>No other Department of State has been closed against Deputies.  Deputies can go into any other Department except the Minister's Department and plead the cause of their constituents. There is far greater reason why a Deputy should be allowed to plead the case of an old age pensioner.  Many cases of old age pensions have been turned down for flimsy reasons.  I think the Minister might change his attitude and that people when they come to the age of seventy and who are justly entitled to pensions should get them without the trouble they have to go to at present.  If this House would sanction pensions for all persons of seventy years and upwards it would be a good thing and save a lot of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give them nothing at all.  A good case has been made for Deputies being allowed to see the appeals officers.  A case can be explained better personally than by means of writing.  A large number of people who were entitled to the pension did not get it until a year or eighteen months after they became entitled because their representatives were not allowed to go to the Department and explain their cases to the appeals officer.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This list is furnished them from some Department and certain valuations are placed on matters likely to come within the purview of the official dealing with the matter.  A certain valuation is put on <Col N="948" /> land held by the claimant, fowl, value of board and so forth.  I take it from Deputy Reynolds's question that he is aware of this.  This list is carried around and the report states that the farmer claimant has so much land or so many fowl and a valuation is placed on these according to the instructions of the Department&mdash;I presume the Department of Finance.  I should like to know if the Minister has any knowledge, officially or otherwise, of the existence of such a list and if it has ever been brought to his notice that the valuations contained in that list are very high.</P>
