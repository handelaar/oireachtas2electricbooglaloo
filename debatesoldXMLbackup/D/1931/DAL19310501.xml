It enables the Board of Works to acquire premises for the housing of Guards.

      <P>There is a net increase of £2,506 in this Vote, the total being £309,917. The Act of 1929 enabled some savings in the headquarters staff to be made, amounting approximately to £4,000. The amount expended on sickness, disablement and maternity benefits has increased and is still increasing.  It has now reached a point which is causing the Commission and the Societies serious uneasiness.  Conferences have been held between the Commission, representatives of the approved Societies, and the doctors with a view to seeing how far the increase may be due to genuine sickness or lack of food caused by unemployment.  A sub-committee of societies' representatives and doctors have been appointed to make an investigation of these matters.  The importance of the question may be seen by an examination of the figures for the past few years.  In 1927 the amount expended on cash and non-cash benefits, including sanatorium benefit, was £638,596.  In 1928 it was £652,833, in 1929 it was £681,051 and in 1930 it was £713,662, an increase over the four years from 1927 to 1930 of £75,066, or 11 per cent.  During the same period the number of medical certificates increased from 1,117,471 to 1,251,185.  On the other hand there has been a steady increase in the number of insured persons and in the contributions paid by employers and employees.  The total amount of money paid in contributions in 1927 was £509,500, and in 1930, £565,000, <Col N="678" /> an increase of 10.8 per cent.  The third valuation is approaching completion and the final results are expected in a few weeks.  There has been a diminution of surplus on the whole as compared with the second valuation, but so far no Society, with one possible exception, has failed to meet any difficulty which has arisen out of its own Contingency Fund. Some Societies have increased their surplus, but these are exceptional and were composed of members who appeared to have been favourably placed as regards employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is satisfactory to hear from the Minister that the number of insured persons has increased.  I suppose that means that there is increased activity on the part of the officials responsible for inspection. So long as this system of national health insurance is in existence, it is satisfactory to know that it is being worked with increased efficiency.  I notice what the Minister says in regard to the increased number of certificates issued.  Possibly, as the Minister himself suggested, there may be increased sickness owing to unemployment, but I would not like to believe that the total increase in the number of certificates issued was due to that reason.  I had one case reported to me of a doctor who used to leave books of certificates signed at his residence, and people in his area, who were drawing benefits, used to call there, and, whether he was at home or not, the certificates were available for them without examination.  That kind of certification is certainly not satisfactory, and any arrangement that can be made between the Department and the responsible heads of the medical organisation which can reduce that kind of certification, or improve upon it, would be an advantage.  There is a considerable amount of unemployment in our cities and towns, and it is possible that the increase may be due to a large extent to that unemployment.  I cannot say that a considerable amount, but certainly some, of the increase must be due to laxity and improper and inefficient working by some of those responsible for issuing medical certificates.  With <Col N="679" /> regard to the Estimate itself, it is satisfactory to know that the number of officials required to work the Insurance Act has been reduced.  I suppose that has been effected without any loss in efficiency.  The figures show that there has been a reduction of 22 in the total staff.  On the other hand, there has been a total increase in the amount of salaries paid of £884. That seems rather inconsistent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a reduction of 22 in the total staff, even taking the annual increments into account, one would imagine that there should not be such a large increase in the total amount of salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>The office of chief clerk seems to be left vacant.  Does the Minister propose to leave it vacant? There is no salary proposed for the coming year for that office.  There is then the other hardy annual that has been raised here before by myself and others with regard to the number of commissioners.  I think the Minister promised last year or the year before to see if some employment other than in the National Health Insurance Department could not be found for one, if not two, of these commissioners. They seem to me to be redundant.  I think one commissioner would be quite ample to run that Department.  The Minister has not found it possible to get a place for the redundant commissioners.  Has he still any hope of finding work where the abilities of these two assistant commissioners, as well as the considerable amount of their salaries, might be used to greater advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know what is the number of societies actually working in the Free State area.  The number has <Col N="680" /> been decreasing in recent years.  If there has been any considerable decrease we would be glad to hear of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the unsatisfactory practice in the matter of paying benefits.  The average duration of illness in acute cases is about three weeks.  In my experience of certification it is very rarely the benefit is paid under three weeks, and in many cases the benefit is not paid for as long as six or seven weeks.  In exceptional cases the period is even longer.  That is a tremendous hardship on people who are very often the breadwinners in the family and who are entirely dependent upon their weekly wage.  When they become ill they have to depend on the National Health Insurance to procure the necessaries of life for themselves and their dependents. When I drew the Minister's attention to this matter before he seemed to be under the impression that I was not acquainted with the condition of things.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few months I took particulars of cases that I certified myself in order to be in a position to state definitely what the practice is. I presume the practice that exists in the area where I certify is a universal practice.  I have particulars of, at least, seven or eight cases that were certified within the last couple of months in my area.  I will cite eight actual cases for the Minister if he wishes.  In no case has the benefit been paid within a lesser period than three weeks.  The Minister ought very readily to understand the terrible hardship it is on a man who is ill, and who has the anxiety of looking after dependents when he is left for such a long period without any money.  The additional mental worry that affects that man during his illness must have a very serious effect.  If National Health Insurance sickness benefit is to be of any use to a man when he is sick it must be paid during the time of his illness and not when he is back at work.  There can be no justification whatever for a delay of three or four weeks, or even more as occurs in many cases.  The cases I <Col N="681" /> have particulars of are spread over almost all the societies that are working in the Free State.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Scottish Legal Society the insured person's number is 30,217.  The first certificate was issued on 7th March, 1931, and the first payment was made four weeks later.  In the case of the Sláinte Insurance Society the insured person's number is 48,729.  The fourth certificate was issued before any payment was made.  In the case of the Irish Creamery Insurance Society the insured person's number is 23,385.  The first certificate was issued on 10th February, and the first payment was made on 28th February. That was one of the shortest periods I came across in my experience.  In the case of the Irish National Foresters Insurance Society the person's number was 27,916.  The certificate was issued on 24th February and the first payment was made on 21st March.  There was another case connected with the Sláinte Insurance Society and the number of the insured person is 22,116.  The first certificate was issued on 13th February and the first payment was made on 16th March.  During the past two or three months no person has obtained insurance benefit in a lesser period than three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>There is no uniformity in the amount of benefit that is being paid, and I suppose that arises from the financial position of the various societies.  A society in a sound financial condition can pay a much more generous benefit than a society that is finding it hard to make ends meet.  I am not sure if the minimum amount of benefit is fixed by statute or if these people are legally entitled to a certain amount if they have certain stamps on their cards.  I know, however, there is a considerable variation in the benefits that are being paid.  I would like the Minister to give effect to an undertaking he gave in the House on various occasions as regards the unification of societies. It would be much better if the Local Government Department took over the entire administration of this particular service.  The multiplicity of societies, and the fact that many of them are in very difficult financial circumstances, <Col N="682" /> result in great hardship on the classes of the community who are concerned with this form of insurance.  The whole matter would easily be remedied if the Minister would only put into operation some of the suggestions he made at various times.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention again to the position regarding the certification of chronic invalids.  Some of these people have been certified regularly since the National Health Insurance Act came into operation.  I have certified chronic invalids over a period as long as ten years.  Week after week these people come for certificates.  I have been able to get the period extended to a fortnight, and certificates are accepted fortnightly. From time to time these people are brought before a medical inspector to ensure that their chronic illness is continuing.  I cannot see why a final medical inspection should not take place in their cases, and why a book of paying orders or cheques could not be issued to them just the same as in the case of old age pensions.  It is unfair to be hauling these chronic invalids weekly or fortnightly before a doctor, in view of the obvious fact that as long as they are alive they will not be able to do any work.  It is only a matter of administration, and these people could be saved many journeys to the insurance agent in order to get payment.  Sometimes it happens that when they call the money has not arrived, and then they have to come back again or send somebody else.  In many instances they live three, four, or five miles from the residence of the society's agent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly and the Minister appeared to agree that there is something wrong in certification.  It is very easy when you find an increase in certification to come down on the doctors. The doctors are very soft-hearted men and they find it very hard to refuse anybody a certificate.  They are inclined to give a certificate to the man or woman who comes up for certification and complains that he or she is unfit for work.  It is a difficult question to decide that they are not fit.  I suppose <Col N="683" /> we are a soft-hearted and generous class of people, and we are inclined to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt.  I do put it to any sensible Deputy who knows anything about the working of this Act, or anything about ordinary human nature: Will any able-bodied man or woman who can get employment look for this 12/6 or 15/- a week in preference to getting 30/- a week for doing a week's work?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Certification has increased in my own limited sphere, but I do certainly think that unemployment in the country and general economic conditions have contributed to that increase in certification.  It is a difficult question for a doctor to decide if a man who is out of employment comes up to him and complains that he has a pain in his stomach&mdash;perhaps a hunger pain &mdash;or a pain in his back, and says he has lumbago.  If the doctor himself knows that that man is not getting sufficient food to enable him to do a day's work, it is difficult to refuse him the certificate.  Within the technical sense he may not be unfit for work owing to any of the well recognised illnesses, but he is still unfit for work, and in a case like that it would not burden my conscience too much to certify.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly complains that in one isolated case he knew of a doctor who left a book of certificates signed.  I am quite sure that Deputy O'Kelly has personal knowledge of that; otherwise, he would not make the statement, but I think it is unfair to create the impression that because Deputy O'Kelly has located this isolated instance that it is a general practice amongst doctors to certify as carelessly as that.  I can understand that in one of these cases that I have been certifying for the past ten years, where it is merely a clerical matter of filling up the certificate and where no medical examination is required, that such a thing might happen.  They are chronic cases. I can well understand a doctor filling up the body of a certificate and even having it signed.  I suggest that this book of certificates that Deputy <Col N="684" /> O'Kelly came across could be explained probably in that way.  Even if it could not be explained in that way there may be individual doctors who are particularly careless, but I do not think that the medical certifiers as a body should be judged by the isolated instance that Deputy O'Kelly has in some mysterious way located.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Estimate at all but for the speech of Deputy Ward.  I must say that those of us who have been connected with National Health Insurance for a long number of years were wondering as to what was the explanation of the very large increase in certification and the large increase in claims against societies in the last four or five years.  I think the increase since 1925 has been something like 50 per cent.  Those of us who are dealing with National Health Insurance and with its administration from week to week on local committees are quite satisfied that one explanation of it is unemployment.  But there is no person connected with National Health Insurance who is not perfectly satisfied that the main cause for the present position of most of the National Health Insurance societies in this country is due to loose certification by the doctors.  Deputy Ward has told us that he himself is prepared to sign a certificate for a man although he is satisfied that that man is not unfit for work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ward told us that the medical profession was a generous body and that it was very hard for them to refuse certificates. One might say, incidentally, that the fact that the doctors get paid for the certificates they issue would be an added spur to their generosity.  The Deputy went on to say that if a man were unemployed and said to the doctor that he had a pain in his back or in his stomach, that the doctor who would refuse to accept that statement would be very a hard-hearted man.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the Deputy thinks I misunderstood him, but we will get it in the Official Report afterwards.  Doctors have to keep this in mind that unless they are more careful in certification the National Health Insurance Acts will be unworkable.  At the present time, most of the National Health Insurance societies in this country are paying out far larger sums than they receive from their members.  Deputy Ward, I am sure, will be aware that one of the biggest drains on the resources of the societies is through disablement benefit in the case of chronic invalids. Yet, the Deputy suggests that these should get a book.  In other words, they are to be a permanent imposition on the societies.  That is, from tomorrow the man who is now drawing disablement benefit would get a book of certificates which he would present each week at the local bank and be paid 7s. 6d. or 8s. 6d. as the case may be and that there should be no further medical inspection of that particular man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the societies were to adopt those suggestions, and if the Minister were foolish enough to agree to them, I can see what would happen to most of the societies.  In his opening remarks the Deputy complained, and I think very properly complained, of the long delay which obtains with certain societies in the matter of the payment of the claims.  I think, however, the Deputy will agree that in those cases where the delay occurs it arises mostly where the societies are English societies or where they have their headquarters in Dublin.  The delay does not obtain where it is a local county society.  The Deputy suggested also that the Minister should see about the unification of the societies. I think if the Minister were to do that, the Deputy would find that the members, instead of having to wait two months before they get paid sickness benefit, would probably have to wait five months before they would get paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> He also took exception to a statement made by Deputy O'Kelly.  I can tell the Deputy and the House that information was brought to my society with regard to a case in which certificates were being filled in, not by the doctor, but by his wife.  The case quoted by Deputy O'Kelly is not so uncommon as the Deputy might think. We are quite satisfied that, while many doctors are very conscientious and will only certify when they are satisfied that a person is unfit for work through illness, in the case of many medical men there is carelessness.  I suggest to the Minister that he should see whether the whole scheme and method of certification, and the remuneration for it, might not be changed with advantage both to the societies and to the genuine sick person.  We ought to have in mind that when a man is malingering and gets away with his 15/- or 18/- a week, it is from the other members of the society that money is obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tipperary Health Society.  We have been paying full hospital benefit, five-sixths dental, optical benefit, and so on, as a result of which there has been a great increase in certification.  I have no hesitation in saying that, as a result of an increase in malingering, we have been compelled to reduce our cash benefit under the recent valuation by 2/- a week.  I am glad to say we are able to maintain our extra benefits.  During the last two years our expenditure was about 20 per cent. greater than our income, and to meet that we have been obliged to draw upon the reserves we built up since the Act came into force.  What is true of that particular society is true of most other societies except this, that we possibly are in a <Col N="687" /> much better position than most other societies in the country to-day.  I would say, further, that it would be a very bad thing, not only for the workers concerned, but for the ratepayers as a whole, if the National Health Insurance Acts had to go.</P>

      <P>Year after year attention has been called to the cost of administration in this Department. I do not think there is any necessity to labour that point, because apparently we have reached the limit, and no change has taken place within the last few years.  For some years I have referred to the fact that certain approved societies give additional hospital benefits, while others do not. That, of course, depends on the amount of money they have to spare.  The approved societies which give additional hospital benefits give 25/- a week to their people while they are in hospital. I was surprised to hear lately that a letter had been received saying that no longer would additional hospital benefits be given by any of the societies.  I want the Minister to tell me whether that is the case or not.  Deputy Morrissey has already answered my question by saying that the society with which he is connected has not stopped the additional hospital benefits.  In cases where the additional hospital benefits are being cut off I want to know what that is due to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey's speech supplies some answer to it, that it is due to the high cost of certification.  He also mentioned that in addition to that there was the fact that people were getting benefit who did not deserve it.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that point.  I hold no brief for the doctors.  I hold no brief for doctors who would issue certificates in the case of patients that they had not seen. Deputy O'Kelly referred to a certain case.  I think the Deputy should report a case such as that to the Minister.  A person proved guilty of the action complained of could be made an example of.  He should be reported to the Irish Medical Council and dealt with in a very severe way <Col N="688" /> as far as legal proceedings are concerned.  I want to tell the House that a few years ago a man who occupied one of the highest positions in London as a consulting physician was reported to the Medical Council.  He was censured because it was shown that he had signed certificates for people that he had not seen.  When dealing with the subject of medical ethics before my students that is one of the points that I lay greatest stress on: that under no conditions should a medical man sign a certificate for a person he has not seen or has not properly examined.  As I have said if Deputy O'Kelly knew of a case, it would be only right that it should be brought to the notice of the medical profession, and that he should have called attention to it here.  That man should have been reported to the Irish Medical Council.  I can tell the House he would be severely dealt with.  The point I want cleared up is with regard to additional hospital benefits.</P>

      <P>In view of the remarks made by Deputy O'Kelly and the insinuations made against doctors, I think we can scarcely pass over that matter or the refutation by Deputy Ward.  Of course it is pretty difficult for Deputy Dr. Ward at all times to be able to give certificates.  He understands the position of his patients in his particular area.  He is a dispensary doctor and has to attend to his duties as a member of this House.  He has to make the necessary provision while he is absent from his district.  If he has a chronic case and knows it will be difficult for the patient to get a doctor he may leave a certificate entitling that patient to get benefit in his absence.</P>

      <P>Deputy Connolly appears to be under the impression that I stated in the course of my remarks that it was my practice to leave certificates signed.  I do not know whether the Deputy was present when I was speaking, but I want to correct the impression that the Deputy's speech might leave on the minds of members of the House.  I do not leave certificates signed.  What I did say was that it was conceivable, in chronic <Col N="689" /> cases in which the certifier had been certifying over a period of years, and where it was the merest formality to issue a weekly certificate, that the body of the certificate would be filled up by the doctor or even signed.</P>

      <P>It might be any doctor in the position of Deputy Dr. Ward or Deputy Dr. O'Dowd.  They have duties other than their duties as dispensary doctors.  It is unfortunate that they are placed in that awkward position at the moment.  It is not my experience that doctors in general issue certificates indiscriminately.  At the same time the unfortunate position is that these insurance societies have suffered severely from the indiscriminate issue of certificates over a number of years.  That may be due to one or two reasons.  The conditions of the country at times are not quite good.  The vitality of the people goes up and down much like the barometer, and doctors are as a rule soft-hearted&mdash; doctors like Deputy Dr. Ward.</P>
      <P>On the whole I think there should be some means of relieving the financial stress that exists amongst the insurance societies.  These societies were of great benefit where they existed, but their funds are being depleted to such an extent that the honest workers will suffer great hardships.  I do not know if I will be entitled to refer to dispensary doctors on this Vote.</P>

I am surprised that Deputy Morrissey, who always says he advocates the cause of the workers, should be so concerned about the societies.  Judging by Deputy Morrissey's various pronouncements in this House, and on this Vote in particular, we can conclude that he is more concerned about the continuation of the various societies in the Free State than unification and increased benefits for contributors to National Health Insurance.  We have heard a great deal from the Minister about lax medical certification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, it is always imagination where I am concerned. The Minister referred to the fact that he has set up a Committee to enquire why medical benefits have increased from £600,000 to £700,000.  Yet the Minister informs the House that the number of people insured has increased in the same period by 30,000.  The Minister's officials have enforced the Insurance Acts very rigorously in the towns and urban districts.  It is time that they went to the rural districts. One of the great burdens on home assistance is the cost of maintaining sick workers in agricultural districts. In maternity cases men cannot go to work when their wives are sick, and have to get home assistance.  The local authorities cannot supply these people with as much benefits as they would receive if they were insured with a proper society under the National Health Insurance Acts.  If farmers have their grievances they also have their duties to the community.  In the long run it would be cheaper on them, and on the rates, if the Minister's Department saw to it that agricultural labourers were insured. It is time that the Minister's officials went to the country and saw that every agricultural labourer was insured, and that no excuse of being a casual worker was put up by employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard about medical benefits, oculist benefits, dental benefits, and hospital benefits.  We heard from Deputy Morrissey about his society having to cut down some benefits and of the possibility of certain other benefits being done away with.  That is a clear indication of the necessity for either unification or nationalisation of this service.  When the Bill was before the House to do away with committees it was pointed out that steps should be taken by the Minister to prevent any new society starting. We reiterate that demand.  We say that the Department has been shamefully neglectful of the service by allowing mushroom societies to exist <Col N="692" /> at the expense of the workers.  If the societies did their duty to the worker in regard to benefits they would be in bankruptcy long ago, but the fact that they wriggle out of their responsibility keeps them and their officials in office.  There would be no complaints here about lax medical certification if this was a national service, or if there was only one society dealing with it.  Deputy Dr. Ward has referred to the delay that takes place in paying benefits.  If there was one society, or if this was a national service that delay could be avoided, because the Department would have only one body to deal with, and the Commissioners could deal effectively with it.</P>
    <P>The way the medical referee work is carried out is a scandal.  The medical referee is more concerned with his own comfort and convenience than the people whose cases he is supposed to deal with.  He will come down, when it suits himself, to a place 20 or 30 miles away from where the worker lives and the worker will get short notice to come in and wait on his august majesty.  He cannot afford to do this, and consequently his claim falls through.  The referee has not such a lot to do.  He is well paid for his transport.  There is adequate provision in the Estimates for it.  He should go to where the worker is, hear his grievance and deal with it.  If we took the balance-sheets of all these societies, with the balance-sheet of the National Health Insurance Commission, and compared them with the balance-sheet of an ordinary insurance company, we would see the terrible waste there is in administering the various National Health Insurance Acts, and we would get a clear indication as to the necessity of nationalising this service, putting it on a businesslike basis or, in the meantime, unifying the present societies.</P>
    <P>Another reason why unification is necessary is that the benefits in some societies are so much and in others are lower.  The worker has not a choice, because in his particular area only a certain society exists.  He has to go miles if he wants to get into the society giving better benefits, whereas if unification <Col N="693" /> came about a branch of the unified society would exist near hand, and he would enjoy all the benefits which only obtain in a few societies at present.  The Minister has shamefully neglected this whole question, and until there is either unification or nationalisation, this insurance remains a burden on rather than a benefit to the worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. George Wolfe Mr. George Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. George Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is satisfactory that the numbers of those insured have increased to the extent they have.  It shows that both employers and employees are being made to see what is their duty and their interest in the proper working of this Act.  It is a very common thing even now for employees to come to work and have no card.  It is curious how blind people are to their own interest, especially agricultural labourers, but I think on the whole that there is very considerable improvement, and the fact that, as the Minister states, the numbers have increased, is a proof of that.</P>
      <P>I think it is rather a drawback on the working of those societies that there is not uniformity in the benefits that are given throughout the whole of the State.  To my mind, there are far too many societies.  I think that the stability of the societies and the good that can be got from them would be infinitely increased if they were far fewer, and the cost of working, as far as officials of that sort are concerned, would necessarily be much less. I think that some day it would be a very good thing to have fewer societies. I would be glad if there were only one great society that would administer benefits evenly throughout the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that in some cases there is a delay in paying to the applicant what is due to him, and of course, getting the money after he is well is not the same thing as getting it when he is laid up and not able to do anything, and when extra comforts and so forth are a necessity.  I think the County Kildare insurance societies act very fairly in regard to that and are punctual in the payment of benefits.  I do not think that is universal.  I heard that there is considerable delay sometimes from one cause or another.  That <Col N="694" /> is very hard on the man or woman who wants the money urgently.  I have heard it said that it is difficult to get certification.  I do not know how much truth there is in that, but that ought not to be the case, and, of course, it adds to the inconvenience of the recipient when it does occur.  The Minister says that all the societies, with the possible exception of one, are working satisfactorily, but I understood Deputy Morrissey to say that a large majority of these societies are not solvent.  If that is the case, it is not a very satisfactory state of affairs, and it would be better if there were an amalgamation of these societies, so that greater stability could be attained in that way.  I do not know whether Deputy Morrissey is quite accurate in that or whether I am accurate in my interpretation of what he said, but, if it is so, the amalgamation of societies is becoming a necessity.  Most insurance societies have the power&mdash;I do not know whether the National Health societies have&mdash;of giving bonuses under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>A considerable class of people, men and women&mdash;I could give the names of a good many at the moment&mdash;have been paying into societies for 23 or 24 years and never had a single benefit out of them.  These people are dissatisfied with that state of affairs. They say, &ldquo;What is the use of this? What good is it if you are paying a lot of money and getting nothing out of it?&rdquo; I think if it were understood when these people arrive at the age of 70 that they would be certain of getting a bonus, however small it would be, varying according to the amount of money they drew during the time they were insured, it would be a tremendous boon to old age pensioners, who for the remainder of their lives would have to depend on their old age pensions.  I think it would be a thing that would be greatly appreciated, and it would make a large number who are now negligent and careless about seeing that the money should be paid into the national insurance societies a little more interested.  The benefit and the comfort that would come to old people who are past their work and who would <Col N="695" /> have nothing but the 9/- or 10/- a week to live on, would be incalculable. Whether it could be carried out under the present rules I do not know, but I am quite convinced that it would be a great thing to bring about, and by doing it it would greatly increase the popularity of the insurance societies generally.  I think the greatest thing of all for the country and the working of these societies would be the conversion of these societies, if necessary into one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I think it would be regrettable if the impression were allowed to get abroad that any number of approved societies are insolvent.  I do not think that that impression should be created. I am sure that Deputy Wolfe misunderstood what was said from these benches.  I do not think in any debate that I heard so many contradictory statements as I heard on this Estimate. I heard people advocating amalgamation and unification, and in the same breath I heard them objecting to the delay in paying benefit.  I wonder does anybody imagine that unification or amalgamation is going to make the payment of benefit anything easier? It is going to delay payment.  Everybody knows when you do concentrate or amalgamate or unify that payments have to pass through relays of officers, and that there is a corresponding delay in consideration.  I was surprised to find people who, on every occasion, would probably pillory the Minister for Local Government for his amalgamation schemes, to-day advocate amalgamation of approved societies.  The amalgamation of unions, although it had a bad effect, would not have half the evil effect of the amalgamation of approved societies, because it would simply mean that one or two big societies would gobble up all the small societies which are doing effective work throughout the country and paying benefits regularly and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there has been a good deal of loose talk about medical certification also.  I do not think there is so much lax certification as we hear about.  There may be a share of lax certification or a few cases where certificates <Col N="696" /> are given in a slipshod or irregular fashion, but I do think that the majority of people&mdash;99.9 per cent. of them&mdash;are entitled to their benefit and come within the statutory regulations for the receipt of benefit.  I think it is foolishness to talk about lax certification and about people drawing benefits who are not entitled to them.  If there is any cause for the deficits in societies it probably could be traced back to the origin of National Health Insurance in this country. Under the actuarial estimate.  I think anybody who has any experience of the administration of National Health Insurance will agree that there was too much allocated for administration and too little for benefits.  The administration fund is taken out of the contributions and you have the benefit fund taken out of the contributions. You will find when the administration fund is made up that any insolvency or threatened insolvency that societies are suffering from to-day, is in regard to the actuarial estimate that was made in the first instance.  Apart from suggesting that there should be any alteration or any rigid regulations governing certification, I think there is more looseness in the system of medical referees.  The medical referee in order to justify his existence knocks off five or six or ten from the number of people receiving benefits.  If there are any doctors who are doing ill service towards the people contributing to the National Health Insurance they are the medical referees and not the medical certifiers.  I think most of the loose talk about medical certification ought not to have been indulged in because there is no basis in fact for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connolly made two and a half speeches since he came into this House four years ago, and on each occasion he directed his fire at the medical profession.  Deputy Connolly evidently thinks that there are some great scandals in the practice of medical certification.  Perhaps when the Longford-Westmeath election was on he did not speak in such a way of the medical profession, but that has nothing to do with this Vote.  I would <Col N="697" /> like to know from the Minister definitely how the payment of the medical certifiers was estimated, because I have been told by officials of the National Health Insurance that it is immaterial to a doctor how many certificates he issues.  If that is so&mdash;I am issuing certificates for ten years, and I do not see any difference whether I issue 20 or 40; the payment is very nearly the same thing&mdash;I do not understand the idea that exists amongst a lot of people in this House and outside that medical certification is lax because by issuing a big number of certificates a doctor gets more money.  The method by which the payment to doctors is arrived at is rather difficult to follow.  It appears that if a certain amount of money is allocated for a certain area that money is spent, whether there is one or twenty certificates issued, and to blame the medical profession for issuing certificates too freely because they might make something extra out of it, is wrong.  If that is so, the Minister should let us know. Whatever blame would be on the medical profession for the issuing of too many certificates might be attributed to their good nature and kindness to the poor, rather than their wish to enrich themselves from the Insurance Fund.  I know that in the country districts the amount of money paid to any dispensary doctor who has travelling to do, would not recoup him for the travelling expenses that he incurs in the course of his duties on National Health Insurance work.  If a doctor has three or four patients who are confined to the house, and if the average distance he has to travel to see these patients is ten miles each way, which is a usual thing in the West of Ireland, the quarterly payment allowed to him would not half pay his travelling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe brought out a point which is well worthy of consideration, namely, giving a bonus to those people who have never drawn any benefit.  I notice that many Deputies seem to look upon that as rather a joke. Deputy Wolfe pointed out that some people have been paying into this fund ten or twenty years without drawing any money out of it and they <Col N="698" /> think they are being done out of something.  I have been speaking to many people who have been paying into the fund since it was started and have never received a penny benefit and they feel aggrieved.  I think Deputy Wolfe's idea that a bonus should be given to these people is a very good one.  That is already being done by some insurance societies where people insure against sickness.  A certain amount is taken off their premium if they do not make any claim within the year.  In all insurance schemes, in fact, some bonus is given to those who have not drawn on the funds.  I think it would be a very good idea to give a little bonus to those people who have been paying for a number of years and have never drawn anything. The bonus could be given by way of cash or by a reduction in the amount they pay.</P>
    <P>I am very glad Deputy Hogan spoke after Deputy Morrissey, because the Labour policy on this question, if it is that advocated by Deputy Morrissey, is more like what I would expect to hear from Deputy Byrne or Deputy Gorey.  I have never heard a more reactionary speech in this House than Deputy Morrissey's on this question.  He says that there is very little delay in the payment of insurance benefit.  My experience is that there is a very big delay.  It would take a man who understood the Einstein theory of relativity to understand by what method the weekly payments which they issue are arrived at because in no two cases can I find the payments to be equal.  I do not know by what method the amount is arrived at, but I do know that there is considerable delay between the issuing of the first certificate and the making of the payment.  People suffering from, say, influenza, for four or five weeks are in many cases recovered and back at work before they get the payment.  I believe a good deal of this delay is with a purpose because it is the experience of the societies, and it is my experience too, that if a man gets a certificate for two or three weeks and then recovers the society keep writing to him asking him for a certificate as to age and for all sorts <Col N="699" /> of documents, until the man gets tired of it and drops his claim.  I have known numerous cases of people who during the influenza epidemic got three and four certificates and then returned to work.  They were so annoyed with receiving letters asking for an age certificate which necessitated writing to the registrar's office and such things that they dropped the whole matter, and of course the society gained whatever benefit should have been paid to them.</P>
    <P>In that connection Deputy Hogan spoke against amalgamation, and said it would increase the delay.  It would, perhaps, increase the delay if the same methods were followed by the amalgamated society as are at present followed by individual societies.  I should like to point out to him that I believe, and a number of insured people believe, that this delay is for the purpose of avoiding payment.  I know several cases where payment has been delayed and where documents were sent to the persons to be signed and forms to be filled up, so that the people, especially in the Gaeltacht area, got so tired of the business that they gave it up.  A lot of the delay is for that reason.  The societies see that if they keep on annoying people by asking them futile questions, sending them forms to fill and requiring them to get certificates of age and such things, the people will not think it worth their while applying for benefit for, say, three weeks' illness.</P>

      <P>Some of them are in Galway or in the provinces anyway. Deputy Hogan also said that the medical referees were in some way responsible.  I have nothing to do with the referees&mdash;I never met them in an official capacity.  Medical referees can make mistakes too.  I have not anything to go on, but from the amount of money paid to dispensary doctors, I imagine that the medical referees cost just as much.  If a medical referee comes from Dublin to Galway he insists upon the people whom he is going <Col N="700" /> to examine coming into Galway, perhaps a distance of thirty or forty miles. Even though these people are able to go around the house, they may not be fit to travel that distance, and it is a great hardship upon them.  Besides that, it is a big expense for them.  They may have to be away from home for a day and a night, or even two nights.  I remember one case seven or eight years ago of a patient of mine who was knocked off benefit by the referee. I had been certifying the man for about three years before he was knocked off. That man afterwards died of the complaint he was suffering from.  The medical referees are not infallible. From the point of view of cost, I do not know that the system is a saviour to the State or that any benefit has accrued from it.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate until I heard the wild talk about indiscriminate certification.  That matter has been dealt with by Deputies Tubridy and Hogan.  I should like to point out to Deputy Morrissey that some of his statements should not be made by a Deputy in his capacity, representing, as he claims, the labouring section of the community.  He alleged that there was a considerable amount of malingering on the part of some claimants for benefit.  From my experience I will characterise that as nothing more or less than a libel on the claimants to benefit.  He stated that doctors were paid for every certificate.  That is not so.  It is true that in urban areas the doctors are paid per certificate issued, but in rural districts payment is made on a different basis&mdash; it is made on a pool basis.  I hope the Minister will clear that up when he is concluding the debate.  Deputy Hogan said the administrative costs were far too great and that if the administration cost less there would be more money available for benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that at all.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain a great amount of money could be saved in the case of the medical referees.  The system that prevailed some years ago was that when a society had reason to think any of its patients drawing benefit for a considerable time should be further medically examined, they asked some neighbouring doctor to examine him.  A medical referee now comes into a town and brings in 20 people who may have to travel 20, 25 or 30 miles in order that he may examine them.  They have to be paid their expenses so that when a medical referee comes to a district for a certain number of examinations it costs a huge sum for one day.  The expenses under that head are far too great.  I submit there is no need at all for what I may call this system of espionage, sending down medical referees to judge whether a local medical certifier is correct or not.  There are other methods of doing it and the old method of having a claimant examined by an independent local medical man was quite sufficient.</P>
      <P>Some chronic cases are brought even before the referee, to my own knowledge, at least every three months by some societies.  I know the case of a girl in the last stages of phthisis, who has been brought a distance of 25 miles every three months in order to appear before the medical referee.  On the last two occasions on which she was summoned she was unable to attend, and a certificate was supplied, but they were not satisfied, and she was summoned to another centre 30 miles distant a month later.  In such a case as that, when the medical referee is satisfied, once and for all, that the case is hopeless, I submit that that person should never again be called upon to attend. I think that when a case is characterised as chronic and hopeless of recovery the patient should not be submitted to further examination.</P>

      <P>I, like others who have spoken, would not have risen except for the frame of mind that seemed to find expression in the speeches of some Deputies on the Opposition benches. Deputy Morrissey was accused of being <Col N="702" /> a reactionary in regard to matters affecting the class of people he represents in this House.  Deputy Morrissey is a member of the Labour Party.  He is an advocate of medical benefits, and he is a member of a board dealing with that matter, but he is accused of being reactionary simply because he recognises there is such a thing as malingering in this age.  There was such a thing as malingering in every age, but if we are to believe what Deputies on the other side say, there never was such a thing in any age, or even to-day.  They do not believe it.  Deputy Ward said that anybody working would be in receipt of something like 30s. a week.  There is no such figure as 30s. a week to be earned among agricultural labourers in Ireland to-day.  There is not one per cent. of the agricultural workers in the country paid any such thing as 30s. a week.  If the amount were given at £1 or 22s. 6d., as the wages paid among agricultural labourers, it would be nearer the exact truth than any other figure, and I speak from experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ward mentioned the figure, but I did not catch it, and he said no man would be content to be idle drawing a certain figure when he could earn 30/- a week.  He could not earn 30/- per week as an agricultural labourer.  There may be one per cent. among agricultural labourers earning 30/- a week, but not more. What is the use of living in a fool's paradise and talking about 30/- a week which does not exist.  If you take the actual wage that a man receives and compare it with the benefits he could receive you will find the margin between the one and the other very small.  But because Deputy Morrissey recognised that there was such a thing as malingering, which is an ordinary <Col N="703" /> human failing that existed since the world was created, he is described as a reactionary.  Because he is honest, and has some idea that the country should be raised to a level of national self-respect and self-reliance, he is described as a reactionary.  I need not attempt to defend Deputy Morrissey.  He is able to defend himself, and his Party are able to defend themselves, but because he recognises that it is more desirable to encourage self-respect and self-reliance than malingering, he is denounced as reactionary.  It would be more appropriate, apparently, if I or Deputy J.J. Byrne made such a speech.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, the time is ripe when this whole question of National Health and Unemployment should come up for reconsideration, with a view to ensuring a higher standard of national self-respect and national self-reliance than we have at present.  There is a frame of mind here which seems to be peculiar to the West, judging from the three or four doctors who have spoken here to-day, which would seem to me to be the &ldquo;louser&rdquo; type of mind.</P>

      <P>I think it is up to anybody connected with medical benefits and with these societies to see that the benefits are available for the people for whom they are intended, and, if payments have to be made, to see that the money is there for the people who most deserve it.  I say a small society has this advantage over a large society, that it is better able to supervise its own area.  There are societies in every country, some local and some with headquarters in Dublin, and some with headquarters outside the country.  What is the difference? The local societies are very closely supervised, whereas there is little or no supervision in the other societies.  The local societies would come nearer to the ideal of what a society ought to be, having regard for the idea that we ought to aim at propagating, and that is the idea of self-reliance.</P>

      <Col N="704" /> There is a danger of a new generation growing up which will not want to work.  We have it in England and we have it, perhaps, in our towns here, but we do not want it extended to country districts.  We want something done that will discourage and prevent that growth.  The new generation may grow up with soft hands and with no desire to work.  The job will be to get them to work, but the people who have worked and who are easily kept at work are the people on the land. If a man can get fifteen or eighteen shillings a week by way of sickness benefit, if he has six or seven days of the week at his disposal, and if he can in some other way supplement that benefit, it is quite natural to expect him to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word or two in regard to the delay in paying insurance benefits.  During the past few months my attention has been called to cases where the home assistance officer had to give assistance owing to the delay on the part of some societies in giving benefit.  In one case a whole family was laid up owing to the 'flu and it was scandalous to find that there was a delay of five weeks in paying benefit.  The head of the family had the full number of stamps to his credit and had not drawn benefit for six years.  In that and some other cases the ratepayers were called on to do the duty which should by right have been done by the societies.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is the hardship suffered by certain persons who were deposit contributors up to the passing of the 1929 Act.  They suffered much hardship by the passing of that Act.  When the national health insurance scheme was initiated they were led to believe that if they became direct depositors to the Commissioners they would at death have the right to dispose of that money as they liked.  The 1929 Act, however, did away with that right, and took over any contribution which they had made.  There is another grievance about which some people have come to me.  They complained that they were compelled to go into a certain society against their will.  They had a right to go into any society up to a certain date, but some refused to join any society, and were compelled against their wishes to join a certain society.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us when replying whether they have still the right of joining a particular society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. Law Mr. Law">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Law</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously a good deal of unpopularity still attaches to the working of the National Health Insurance Acts.  If there is, as I know there is, a good deal of delay in the payment of benefits, I think it may be put down to three causes which I propose to summarise, because I think that all <Col N="706" /> three are deserving of the Minister's attention.  In the first place there are delay and uncertainty attaching to the payment of benefits, a matter to which a number of Deputies, including the last speaker, have referred&mdash;delay, uncertainty and the quite incalculable variation between benefits paid by different societies.  Then there is also the impression, perhaps well-founded, that in many instances they cannot receive benefit at all without the intervention of other people.  I do not say that that applies to the majority of societies, but I am afraid that it applies to some.  The second point to which I desire to call attention is the fact that a large number of people enjoy what Mr. Lloyd George described when introducing this form of legislation as the greatest benefit of all, good health.  Many persons find themselves in the position that, having contributed practically all their lives to the Insurance Fund, they can never get benefit, though had the insurance been carried out on an ordinarily commercial basis with an ordinary insurance company, they would have received either a reduction in premiums or have been given a bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third matter which has not been touched on so far, which affects mainly the poorer parts of the country, and which goes to the root of the unpopularity of the Act. In my experience dislike of the Act and, in fact, very often evasion of it, is encountered more among employees than among employers.  I know many employers who find the greatest possible difficulty in persuading their men to get insurance cards.  That is particularly true of one particular class of man.  I think it is quite natural, and I have every sympathy with it.  As Deputies know, in the West of Ireland especially, there are a number of young men, sons of small farmers, who work for the greater portion of the year on their father's land, but for a short period of the year work for other small farmers.  Owing to the fact that they have been almost constantly engaged on their father's farm&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;they do not receive sickness benefit.  They find themselves in the <Col N="707" /> position of casual labourers, because they never have a sufficient number of stamps to their credit to entitle them to benefit.  They go on contributing year after year to the Insurance Fund, but they never receive any benefit.  I believe that those three causes, which I have mentioned, go a long way to explain why the Act in many parts of the country is exceedingly unpopular and why it is enforced against the grain.</P>

Once they are poor they are entitled to benefit under the Act, and he is going to certify it for them.</P>

What I did was to ask the Minister what the basis of payment was, and I suggested that if there is too much certification, as it has been suggested there is, I would rather that he would attribute it to mistaken kindness than to the fact that we are getting more <Col N="708" /> money out of certificates when I believe we are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that is practically the same thing, but in different words.  In regard to national health insurance, the number who will come under that class of insurance in Deputy Dr. Tubridy's district, Bealadangan, could be counted on ten fingers. He apparently has great experience of the National Health Insurance Act.  I say that it is coming to the time when both the national health insurance and unemployment insurance will have to be re-modelled.  Probably Deputy Dr. Tubridy is mixing up unemployment insurance and national health insurance, because in recent years I know he was concerned very much with unemployment insurance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ward said that he believes that a man earning 30/- a week will not give up that 30/- a week to get a benefit of 18/- a week. As Deputy Gorey stated, there is no agricultural labourer earning 30/- a week.  Labourers in other occupations may be earning that wage, but they will not earn it as agricultural labourers.  Deputy Dr. Ward stated that they will not give up that wage to get 18/- a week benefit.</P>

      <P>Probably the official report next week will show whether you said it.  I have seen time and again men who were fit for employment certified by doctors as being entitled to national health insurance benefit.  These men will refuse to take employment at 30/- a week.  They will prefer the 18/- a week benefit to the 30/- per week wages.  Things are certainly much worse in unemployment insurance.  I was wondering as to the cause of delays from the time certificates are issued until payment of benefit is made, but this debate has enlightened me.  From the number of certificates issued, and the way in which they have been issued, my impression is that instead of a delay of three or four weeks, it will really involve a delay of 8 or 10 weeks, if the Insurance Commissioners are to be sufficiently watchful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make any accusation.  I am put on the defensive so far as the medical profession is concerned, though I admit it is easy to merge from the defensive to the offensive.  We have heard a good deal about patients not being examined although they receive certificates of unfitness for work.  I would like to hear the explanation of the accused doctor in these cases.  In the medical certificate a doctor is supposed to put down that he has this day examined the patient. The doctor may have seen that patient three days in advance of the day on which the certificate was called for, but he knew that the patient was ill, that he was suffering from a chronic disease.  It is not such a very immoral thing to certify that so-and-so was suffering from a disease on that day, which he knew he was suffering from three days previously.  That explains a lot of the accusations made in regard to doctors certifying without seeing patients.  I am not prepared to say that there is not malingering.  There is malingering in every grade of society. There may be an excuse amongst poor people like working men who often, perhaps, can even persuade themselves, either unconsciously or sub-consciously, that they are ill when really they are debilitated and not in a very high state <Col N="710" /> of nutrition.  I think it would be a good thing if there was some provision made under the Insurance Act for those people who have always been healthy, who have remained healthy, and who have good employment by which no inducement would be offered to them to go sick.  They should, on the other hand, be offered some inducement to keep well in the way of giving them some benefit for the amount of money they have contributed.</P>
      <P>I have known employees of my own who since the Act first came to be administered in this country have not got one week's sickness benefit nor have they applied for it.  At the same time they have not got one bit of benefit from the payments made both by the employer and employee.  I think that is wrong.  There should be something done for such people.  There should be a bonus for those who do not make any claim against the sickness funds.  As I am on the matter of complaints against the doctors I know one approved society which I might say is the chief complainant. They say that the doctors will bankrupt the approved societies.  Nevertheless in their returns I see that since the establishment of the Insurance Act they have invested three quarters of a million of money notwithstanding the loose certification alleged.  I think that in itself is a very big defence on the part of the doctors.</P>
      <P>We have time after time asked them to specify a particular case where the doctors wrongly certified.  It was once said that a man was certified as sick when the man was actually in jail. When that was referred to the Medical Association we said the proper way to deal with that doctor was to refer him to the Penal Body of the Irish Medical Council and we say still that where there is a gross offence like that, he should be referred to the Medical Council and the man not only removed off the certifying panel, but also off the Medical Register.  If that were done we would be in a better position to appreciate those charges about gross abuse of medical certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> A good deal has been said about additional medical benefits.  I think it is a fact at the moment a very extensive scheme of medical benefits has been arranged and that this additional scheme of medical benefits consists mainly of treatment at the hands of specialists.  I admit from what I saw of the scheme with regard to the specialists that they have been exploited; they will be giving their services for nothing or next to nothing.  I do not think that such a state of affairs should exist.</P>
    <P>There is one question which I would like to ask the Minister, but perhaps that question might more properly be addressed to the Minister for External Affairs.  I would like to know from the Minister if, as is the case in Northern Ireland in connection with medical benefits, he has received any representation from Geneva for the establishment of medical benefits? In Northern Ireland a scheme of medical benefits has been included in the National Health Insurance Acts.  I think it should be a matter of having first medical benefits before making any effort for any scheme of additional benefits.  I know it will be said that we do not want medical benefits in Ireland; that the people are treated under the Medical Charities Acts.  They have the same Medical Charities Acts in Northern Ireland as we have here.  Still there was a necessity there, especially in the cities, for a scheme of medical benefits.  Northern Ireland in that respect contrasts favourably with Dublin.  The dispensary doctor in Northern Ireland, where medical benefits are in existence, retained his old salary, but in addition he receives 7s. 6d. for each insured person.  Insured people here, they tell us, are treated under the Medical Charities Acts by the dispensary doctors.  A dispensary doctor here in Dublin has about 20,000 new cases in the year.  I am giving an average of three attendances for each case&mdash;that is 60,000.  I do not know how a doctor could attend to so many and have the work well done.  In England that would be considered work for half a dozen doctors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> I am alluding to the point that if the National Health Act were amended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a necessity for an amendment of the Act, and it is on that I am making my claim.  References have been made here to the medical referees.  We are told that these men are paid big salaries.  Like every medical officer, the medical referees are paid very bad salaries.  They are supposed to be outstanding men in their profession, and so they are.  I can say with truth that they are men of high professional standing.  One is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.  He has an initial salary of £450 per annum rising by £15 annually until it becomes £600.  That is a very modest salary for a man of such standing as a medical referee.  I do not think it is a position of leisure either, because there are only three of them in the country.  They have to cover the whole area, and they cannot possibly visit persons in their homes. They must, because of the fewness of their numbers, go to some central place, and sometimes, perhaps, the insured persons whom they have to see may live 20 miles away.  The remedy for that would be to employ additional medical referees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question that we must address ourselves to.  When a doctor is certifying incapacity for work the professional interpretation of incapacity for work differs evidently from the statutory interpretation.  The approved societies maintain that while a man is fit to do any work the doctors should not certify him as unfit.  For instance, if a man is a ploughman and the doctor knows that he is not fit to follow that work, naturally the doctor will certify him as unfit to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> According to the approved societies, if the man were able, say, to pick daisies, he should not be considered unfit.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I really think the time has come when some amendment of the existing Act should be made.  If the legislation is to be just there should be some inducement given to the people who never make a claim for sickness benefit; they should be allowed some sort of bonus.  When that alternative is held out to them there will be far less inducement for them to go malingering.  A labourer is getting, let us say, £1 or £1 2s. 6d. per week.  Sickness benefit given to a man in that position would amount to 15/- a week.  The slight difference between the two payments is altogether unjustifiable.  I am not saying that he does not want the 15/-; in fact, he badly wants it. The point is that our agricultural labourers are paid such low wages as £1 2s. 6d.  In my own case I have to pay them 30/-, but I am competing with the Department of Forestry and they pay 30/-.</P>

      <P>The question of the delay in making payments has been raised here on this Estimate, and it has been raised annually.  Deputy Ward gave cases, and suggested that in his experience the first payment was never made earlier than, say, three weeks.  I consider that delay to the extent of three weeks in the first payment is too long.  It is inexcusable as a general thing, and I would be very glad if any Deputy who has that experience would discuss the matter <Col N="714" /> with the Commissioners.  Very many Deputies complain from time to time that they are not allowed to see the deciding officer in connection with some old age pensioner.  But here is a case where there is apparently a general claim that there is a delay in making these payments.  Yet from one end of the year to the other I never hear a claim made along these lines, and I know of no cases in which systematic representations have been made by any Deputy in the nature of Deputy Ward's experience.  No such case has been made to the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners go very systematically into any individual complaints they get in the matter of delay.  Their experience is that in a large number of cases the complaint is not justified.  There have been either non-surrender of cards, arrears of payment, or non-notification of the illness inside the required period, and a number of other causes.  The first payment ought to be made within about ten days or so.  The first three days' sickness do not count.  Where everything is right, and where the certification of the case is not challenged by the society, there ought to be a payment within ten or eleven days.  I think the complaint as to the delay refers to the first payment. Once the validity of a claim has been established there is no delay in any subsequent payments.  Systematically we get after all complaints of delay and we are prepared to continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the chronic cases societies insist on getting weekly certificates, but they also agree to accept monthly certificates.  The general experience of societies is that where the case is really a chronic case they do agree with the suggestion of the Department to accept a monthly certificate.  In the chronic cases, such as Deputy O'Dowd mentioned, of people being forced to go to the medical referee, I would say that the chronic cases are only forced to go to the medical referee when the society to which they belong require that they should do so.  That, therefore, is not a matter for the Commissioners at all, but for the society.  I take it the cases <Col N="715" /> are very exceptional, and no ordinary society in anything like ordinary cases will insist upon chronic cases going to the medical referee weekly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen had some difficulty about deposit contributors.  He mentioned, I think, that deposit contributors were allowed to join societies of their own choosing inside a certain period after the passing of the 1929 National Health Act.  Where they did not join such a society they were allocated to a society.  That was done after the passing of the 1929 Act.  On a payment of a fee of 2/- they could transfer from the society to which they have been allotted and join any society of their own choosing.  The depositor contributor has been abolished as a class because of the reasons given when the 1929 Act was passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig raised the question as to why in certain cases hospital benefits were given by certain societies, but that hospital benefit has now been stopped.  I said in my introductory remarks that a third valuation was now nearing completion, and, in fact, the report has been received in the majority of cases, but it has not been finally concluded.  Where the report has been received the societies have been notified, and, according to the condition of their surplus, they have had to reduce their benefits. Deputy Morrissey spoke of a case of which he had experience in which there was increased cash benefits to the extent of 3/-, which, as the result of the condition of affairs disclosed in that society by the third valuation had to be reduced by 2/-.  In the same way there are no doubt other societies which, as a result of the disclosure of the position of their surplus on the third valuation, have had to reduce their benefits. They have had to reduce their hospital benefits, because these were the only benefits available.  It arises not on account of any change in policy on the part of the Commissioners or on the part of the societies, but it is simply due to the fact that the societies have to cut their cloth according to the measure to which they are forced to cut it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> So far as the general question of hospital benefits is concerned the Commission recommend non-cash benefits such as hospital benefits rather than increase the cash benefits above 15s.  Deputy O'Kelly referred again to the position with regard to the Commissioners, and a number of Deputies touched on the question of unification or amalgamation.  Arising out of the discussion on the 1929 Act, I was agreeable to do it within the limits of the Act as then framed to take statutory powers to enable amalgamation to be brought about in a voluntary way so as to reduce the number of societies in the country.  I think the figure of twelve and the figure of five were mentioned.  That is an indication of our desire to reduce the number of societies that there are at present.  In the meantime no mushroom societies as Deputy Kennedy suggested have been allowed to grow up.  No additional societies have been sanctioned since the original societies were brought into being under the 1911 and 1912 Acts.  A considerable amount of reduction has taken place. No society has been dissolved within the last two years, but the position with regard to two societies is such that we are contemplating their dissolution.</P>
    <P>Following the discussion that took place on the 1929 Act, a certain number of conversations took place between the Commission and representatives of approved societies.  A certain number of alternative lines of action were brought to light.  The Government, in the conflicting opinions and general circumstances that exist, have not been able to come to a conclusion to proceed with amalgamation, any more than we are at present able to proceed on the voluntary matter.  If we see no prospect of bringing about amalgamation or unification in the near future we will have to codify our present National Health Insurance law and our regulations for the convenience of societies.</P>
    <P>I have hesitated to dissolve the National Health Insurance itself when it would mean getting rid of the Commissioners while we were in a position <Col N="717" /> of indecision with regard to what might be required to be done in the future.  There is a statutory requirement that at least some of the Commissioners will remain as they are until we change the law.  I do not see what kind of action we can take in the matter.  The whole thing is involved in the changes that are likely to be brought about in the organisation of National Health Insurance in the near future.  That is all we can say about it at the moment.</P>
    <P>On the question of medical certification, I think a lot of what has been said has arisen out of a rather loose discussion of the position and of expressions of opinion from some of the doctor-Deputies as to their attitude with regard to certification.  The difficulty, as far as we can estimate it, in the matter of certification is the hesitancy of doctors to put a person who has been in receipt of national health insurance benefit on the working list again by their certificates.  An extra two or three days in the matter of the extension of a certificate materially affects the amount of benefits required to be paid.  The weakness in medical certification is probably in that end of the position rather than in any other.  Deputy Tubridy asked on what basis medical certification is paid. I think he knows how the amount available for certification is distributed.  It is on the basis of dispensary districts.  The amount of money available in any dispensary district is divided amongst the doctors in that dispensary district on the number of certificates that they have issued.  If there is only one doctor in a dispensary district, then, of course, there is no question of the amount of money being based on the number of certificates issued by that doctor.</P>

      <P>In what has been said by some of the medical Deputies they have put strong arguments into the mouths of those Deputies who want to argue that there is a tendency that the national health insurance system is not being kept an insurance system because some of the people who touch and influence that system are influenced, not by the illness basis of insurance, but by a certain amount of kindness.  As I have said, a very small number of days added to each illness means a great drain on the amount of money available for benefits.  However, that matter is being investigated by a Committee consisting of representatives of the societies and of the doctors.  It is being fairly and squarely looked into.  We will see what exactly the situation is and what improvements can be brought about there.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are old grants for certain hospitals in the city of Dublin and they go back as far as 1854 or 1855.  Exception has been taken on different occasions to the payment of these grants to these hospitals, and I have argued in reply to that criticism that the economy of the hospitals for a great number of years back to 1855 has been built to some extent around the getting of the grants.  I said that I did not think it reasonable to withdraw the grants where the financial position of the hospitals showed that they were required to help them.  Last year, and the year before, certain reductions were made in the grants payable to certain hospitals because, from an examination of their accounts it was seen that they could afford to do without them.  In this way, the House of Industry Hospitals in 1929-30 had the grant reduced from £7,600 to £5,000, a reduction of £2,600.  The grant to Cork Street Fever Hospital was reduced from £2,500 to £2,170, showing a reduction of £330.  Last year, the grant to that hospital was further reduced by £700.  These reductions were made because, on examination of the accounts, it was seen that the hospital could afford to do without these grants.  In the current estimate, we propose reductions in the case of the House of Industry Hospitals, the Coombe Hospital, the Meath Hospital and in the small grants to infirmaries&mdash;Jervis Street Hospital and the Meath Hospital.  The reductions are respectively £5,000; £200; £600; £89; £44 because examination of their financial conditions showed that the hospitals were able to get on without these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of exception has been taken in certain quarters to the proposed action on the part of the State to take away grants from hospitals because they had got moneys from the Hospitals Sweeps.  It is true, almost entirely, that the moneys these <Col N="721" /> hospitals have got from the sweep-are responsible for their being in the position that we can bring about these reductions.  But I do not think we can depart from the reasonable policy that was adopted in the light of the discussion that took place here during the last three or four years, simply because the money coming in comes from the sweeps.  Before any deduction took place the amount of the Estimate was £16,158.  The amount of the Estimate now before the House is £6,595.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. S.T. O'Kelly Mr. S.T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question on several occasions, and each year stated that I criticised the amount included in this Estimate as given to the hospitals, but not because I objected to the sums given to them.  What I objected to was the fact that these hospitals, and these hospitals only, were selected for help out of State funds.  I emphasised in previous years, and I will not go over it at length now, that, as far as Deputies on this side of the House were aware, the hospitals had been doing good work and had given very considerable service to the public.  On this side of the House no one wishes to detract from the services the hospitals have given, or the credit that is due to them for such services.  But we objected before, and we still object, to a certain number of hospitals being selected when similar institutions in the City of Dublin, and all over the country, that are doing equally good work are getting no grant of any kind.</P>
      <P>Since these protests were first made the Estimate, as the Minister has stated, has been considerably reduced. I will not say that we are glad of that. It is a satisfactory thing inasmuch as it saves the State certain expenditure, but we are not glad to see any money taken from any institutions that are doing good work for the public, and such can be said of these institutions.  I am glad that the State is being saved, but I would be more pleased if every other institution that is doing equally good work could be helped from State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen in the Press that objection has been taken to the proposed <Col N="722" /> action of the Minister in reducing the grants given to certain institutions out of State funds because these hospitals and similar institutions have received aid from the hospitals sweepstake funds.  I know that some of these hospitals have got out of the sweepstake funds amounts far in excess of anything that the State would ever be able to give them.  They have got these funds through the action of the State and through the action of this House in allowing sweepstakes to be held. They got huge sums into their exchequers that were undreamt of three, four or five years ago.  Why they should protest or object to the amount of money hitherto given to them by the State being withdrawn is to me not understandable.  They are getting a favour.  They had hitherto been getting a favour that was not extended to the general body of hospitals doing equally good work.  They were in a very privileged position as far as the State was concerned, and, during last year, they have been placed in a much more favoured position as a result of State action, and got very considerable funds into their exchequers.  Therefore, I do not see that they have a right to complain that the comparatively small sums the State did give as a privilege in recent years should be withdrawn.  As far as one can see they are well provided for from other sources.</P>
    <P>As long as the hospitals in the Estimate are placed in a privileged position, that does not bear comparison with similar institutions all over the country, and in the city of Dublin, I at any rate, will continue to protest against their continuance in that privileged position.  I think the action already taken by the Minister in reducing the amount takes away considerably from the complaint we have to make.  A reduction from £16,000 to £6,000 is considerable.  The £6,000 is not much to complain of.  It is not the amount but the privileged position of these hospitals that I protest against and, in so far as there is still an Estimate for £6,000 to be provided, so long as they are continued in that privileged position, naturally <Col N="723" /> our protest, in a modified form, remains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the policy of the Government is a most unwise one, allowing the report to go out that they are going to benefit financially to the extent of practically £6,000 because sweepstakes are being run for the hospitals.  The second point is, I want to know is this a permanent reduction or is it only temporary, to last during the time the sweepstake is being run.  I consider it is a most unfair arrangement to cut off grants from three of the hospitals because they have come into the sweepstakes.  Let me deal with this for a moment or two.  The reason why certain hospitals do not come in to benefit by the sweepstakes are these. First they are not attending 25 per cent. of poor people for nothing.  They are not able to come under the Act because they are not doing enough work for the poor; secondly, they do not come in because they are not badly off.  There is no necessity for them to come in, or they may have a feeling that if they did come in, the subscriptions from the public would be taken from them and the grant from the Government would cease.  I am sure one of the most important reasons which they gave for it was that they thought the grant from the Government was going to be continued.  The third point is on the ethical question. I am not going to deal with the ethical question, perhaps it is better that a certain number of hospitals are not coming in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is certain hospitals did not come in because they were not treating enough of the poor or else were well enough off and these are the hospitals that will continue to get their grants.  Certain hospitals came in because they were not able to pay their debts and wanted money or they were attending so much of the poor that they were able to come in under the Act.  Does anybody in this House consider that it is fair treatment to cut off from the hospitals that came in their grant and continue the grant to the other hospitals without <Col N="724" /> considering that the hospitals that have not come in could not come in?</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not put down an amendment to divide the House upon this matter because I consider the hospitals have been treated most unfairly.  I sympathise with all Deputy O'Kelly said last year that the grant was given to hospitals and that it might be better that it should be spread over a larger area, and that certain other hospitals were doing as good work as these hospitals and getting no grant.  The point Deputy O'Kelly made last year was that the hospitals in Cork and Limerick were getting no share of the Government grant.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with that but I think that it is a most unfair arrangement that the Government are going to benefit to the amount of £6,000 because sweepstakes are being run for the benefit of the hospitals.  Remember too that they have selected the hospitals which did not come in.  Some of the reasons why they did not come in have already been given.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter and to state also whether this is temporary or whether it is meant to be permanent.</P>

They were selected 77 years ago, and for each one of the 77 years they have got these amounts.  They would not be put into this list passed by us this year if their income were sufficient to meet their expenditure.  We have, to the best of our ability, satisfied ourselves that their expenditure this year will be such that there will be a deficiency of at least the amount that we have down here.  The policy that we have adopted in connection with these matters is to examine the accounts of the hospitals that are involved in this particular scheme, and not to give them a grant if their income and their expenditure be such that they can be shown to do without the grant.

      <P>I am not prepared to distinguish in our policy with regard to these hospitals whether they get their money from sweeps, from a bequest, whist drives, race meetings, or in any other way.  I am concerned with the income for the year, and on that basis the deduction, as far as our present outlook on the matter is concerned, is only temporary.  I do not say that if&mdash;as some of these hospitals have got £35,000 a year from the sweeps&mdash;over a period of, say, six, seven, or ten years they get £35,000 a year or £20,000 a year in income from sweeps, and if at the end of that time their sweep or general income falls, that we will go back and reinstitute the grant of £1,000 or £5,000, as the case may be.  Within reasonable contingencies the reduction is temporary.</P>
      <P>I should say this, that any complaints or any criticism of the action of the Department in reducing these grants have not come from the hospitals from whom these grants have been taken.

    <P>On previous occasions I have gone into this Vote in great detail.  I do not intend to repeat that this year.  I have not had any information up to the present as to any special point on which Deputies desire detailed information.  Presumably, these points will be raised as we go along.  I will take the Vote under the two or three main headings, under which it is divided. As far as the statistics branch is concerned, there are at the moment being published the results of the 1929 census of production, according as the results of each industry are compiled. We have issued some fifteen of these, and the remaining eighteen will be brought out as we have them to hand. They are mostly in an advanced state, and they ought to be issued before the end of the year.  We are making preparations to take a complete census in 1932, relating to production in the year 1931.  We are also preparing a printed report covering the census for the years 1926 to 1929.  As far as the census of population is concerned, considerable delay has been caused, and is still being caused, owing to the volume of industrial status, generally spoken of as the unemployment volume, about which I have spoken here on many occasions.  Other volumes are proceeding, while a certain amount of delay has been caused in the compilation of other statistical matters.  I tried to get an advance as far as possible in Gaeltacht and Irish language volume, the industries volume, and the fertility and dependency volume.  They are held up by reason of the delay in the industrial status volume.  With regard to that I have to come to a decision almost immediately as to whether or not I should separately publish that volume in what I consider to be an unsuitable form, that would not make such a useful public document, or else to see if I cannot speed up the written matter which is to be attached to it in order to get something which would be of use to the public.  That decision must be taken in the next four weeks.  That volume being got out of the way, it will be possible to get to the completion of these other three volumes very <Col N="727" /> speedily, and publish at least one of them almost immediately.</P>
    <P>During the year we changed the method of publication of certain trade statistics.  A new series of monthly reports is being issued.  We are also going to produce an annual trade report. The first of these is in preparation and will be issued during the course of the year.  In connection with these trade statistics, in conjunction with certain other groups, we collected statistics showing the countries of origin as distinct from countries of consignment. That is an idea that will turn out to be very valuable.  We propose to continue that work; also the collection of statistics with regard to agriculture, transport, prices, live stock, cost of living, unemployment, labour exchanges, industrial disputes, and so on.  We have in an advanced state of preparation a statistical abstract that will contain in one volume a number of statistics of the Free State. The first issue of that abstract should be available in a few months time.</P>
    <P>The second section of the Department, to which I will refer briefly, is the section called the Trade and Industry Branch.  Here the work is so multitudinous that I find it very difficult to concentrate on any one thing more than another, in the absence of any precise request for information on a special point.  The work is varied.  I described it in very considerable detail on another occasion.  The varied activities of the branch have been kept up.  On the labour side there has been great activity during the year, investigating such things as wages, conditions of labour, so as to have these in handy form for the purpose of comparison with other countries, and for the purpose of putting information before prospective industrialists when these make enquiries as to rates that would have to be paid here, and the conditions in which workers in a particular industry would normally live. We have had considerable difficulty with one big item in connection with disputes during the year.  It is not generally recognised that some of these <Col N="728" /> disputes stop short and do not become known to the public.  It is not generally recognised how much work is done in the conciliation line.  Roughly there has been through the year one trade dispute of an important type to be dealt with pretty nearly every week. Of course, once a dispute starts it does not mean that it is finished within a week.  There have been some forty to fifty of these disputes to be decided during the year.</P>
    <P>During the year also this side of the branch had considerable investigation to do arising out of the report of the Commission on technical education and the production of the Apprenticeship Bill, which was before the House a few days ago, by means of which we hope to effect considerable improvement in the conditions under which apprentices are taken into business, and particularly considerable improvement in the training of a particular kind in an industry.  On this side of the branch's activity in connection with the international labour office conventions, the post-war view has been that it is better to level up conditions through the world, particularly on the Continent, so that in any conflict that emerged after the war in the economic plane there should be something approaching equal conditions. This country has a pretty good record in the matter of the number of conventions that have been received, accepted and put into force in the country.</P>
    <P>On the general side of inducing industrialists to embark on enterprises in this country, we have to rely in the main on the officers of the branch who have to deal with the Advisory Committees.  I spoke at length last year of the work done by these committees. There are some thirty or so of them, composed of representatives of industries, grouped in certain ways.  With these we have frequent contact, and in conjunction with them we approach people who are the cause of difficulties and seek to have things remedied.  We are gaining more and more the confidence of these industrial groups. These committees are making more regular application to us in connection <Col N="729" /> with difficulties that arise, and to a greater degree than ever before they are paying very definite testimony to the work that is being done by the Department's officers in getting conditions improved for them.  I have spoken already of the work that has to be done on the conciliation side, through intervention in labour disputes and in conjunction with the collection of material relating to wages and conditions of labour.  The information that is so derived hardly ever relates entirely to the particular matter that is in dispute.  In the course of the dispute almost all the conditions of a particular industry are brought to the surface.  The result is that the officials who deal with it are very well informed as to the general conditions in industry, and this information, added to the information that is derived through the Advisory Committees, leaves us in a very good position to adjudicate on difficulties as they arise, and to give good advice to people who may be seeking to open up in the country.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the main work of this side of the Department is regarded as procuring the best survey of industry as it exists in the country and clearing the ground for prospective new industrialists.  This we can do, as I said, through getting a pretty good idea of the conditions that exist in business.  We have to pay special attention to these industries which have received the benefit of tariffs. We have the special duty of seeing how far employment has increased, how far increases in prices may have been caused by the first imposition of a tariff, how far these are being progressively lowered and how far we are sure at the end the prices have reached a point which in all the circumstances of the country is fair.  We then, I say, put some of the information which we have at the disposal of people who come to us from time to time seeking new openings.  I make a discrimination by saying that we put some of that information at their disposal, because, clearly, some of the information gathered through an intimate connection with an advisory committee is most confidential and cannot be broadcast to people, who if they <Col N="730" /> entered into the country's work, would be in the position of rivals to some of those already existing.  On the whole we have effected pretty good touch on many occasions between people who seemed interested in certain things&mdash; the people who had technical skill&mdash; and those who had money.  Some of the industries, in particular one or two, which have received the benefit of the tariff in the country have found that in order to keep employment at the figure which it had reached in the earlier years of the tariff they have to turn their attention towards an export market.</P>
    <P>In this connection there is another side of the work, to see that the trade relations of this country, and any other country to which there is likely to be an export outlet, are put upon the most favourable terms that we can secure.  The trade relations as between this country and the other countries where there might be an export outlet are in the main satisfactory. Some of them are regulated by temporary agreements.  Some of these temporary agreements will have to be continued for quite a long time.  Two treaties have, of course, been signed.  One is on the point of being signed and a few others are in the course of preparation. There are tendencies observable with regard to a change in the conditions on which countries will enter into very close trade relations, so that it is not always easy to get speed in this matter.  Some countries desire to wait until they see how certain continental tendencies are developing before they commit themselves to a new rigid convention.</P>
    <P>We have also a duty which we carry out of giving to any of our business people whatever information we can collect through the medium of our representatives abroad, or whatever information can be collected even by correspondence, as to the openings in other countries, the tariff system in other countries and the impediment put upon goods going into these countries, and the standing of these people with whom it is desirable to do business.  A certain amount of the information collected in the branch is given publicity through the medium of the <Col N="731" />&ldquo;Trade Journal.&rdquo;  A certain amount of other matter is given to inquirers when they come along, or given through the medium of officials, when they get in contact with industrialists, arising out of disputes or any other matter, and where it seems to them that there is any prospect of these people whom they meet being encouraged by the receipt of this information to develop in a particular way.</P>
    <P>On occasions during the year action has been taken in connection with the sale of products supposed to be manufactured in this country, and which are being falsely described in that way.  A subsidiary activity of that type has preceded applications which are made for registration of trade marks which would seem to indicate production in the country when, in fact, the production is not here, when these should not be registered.</P>
    <P>The producers in the country have I think, some of them certainly, expressed their agreement that the branch has been of great assistance to them through the medium of the Government contract.  I have representatives on the committee which deals with these matters and we, in every case, try to see, where an article is procurable in this country, that there should be a very vigorous attempt made to have the contract limited to the home manufacturers. We have a corresponding duty on the other side to see, if there is going to be a preference given, and in nearly all of these cases there is, that that will be used in a proper way and that the consumer will not have to pay anything beyond what is reasonable if the contract, as it is in many cases, is definitely confined to applicants from the country.  We have through meetings for special purposes had an examination made of prices in special trades.  The public has had the benefit of a reduction in prices particularly in one item and in certain sides of two or three other matters.  There are certain disputes about prices still going on and we believe that this method of getting to grips with the particular people involved, on a special case <Col N="732" /> being made, is likely to produce better results and is less wasteful in administrative energy and expense than a system of compulsory regulation of prices.</P>
    <P>During the last year attention was called to two movements of a type that seemed to be very close to unfair restriction of trade.  Both of these were taken up after attention was called to them.  In one case the combination has practically disappeared and in the other the activity which was feared has certainly not developed.</P>
    <P>Another branch specially referred to in the report is the geological survey. I should like just to direct special attention to that particular branch. Its work is hardly known.  In fact, any comments passed upon the geological survey in this country seems to be based almost entirely on a misapprehension as to what is being done. Foreign observers are much more acute in their remarks on this and have on occasions on which any of them visited the country passed the comment that there is as good a geological survey here as any country can point to.  The system under which the survey works&mdash; it has only been in conjunction with my Department for the last three years&mdash;is this, that year after year there is plotted a field programme for the year.  That field programme is carried through as well as conditions allow, and generally, results in the production of matter of a particular type and information added to it in the form of a memorial.  The maps are produced in the Ordnance Survey and the memorials are published.  If I might take an example.  Last year&mdash; 1930-31&mdash;the field work consisted in mapping parts of the Connaught coalfield.  That is a piece of work which has been going on for a considerable number of years and is thought likely to be finished in one other field year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>What coalfield did the Minister mention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mainly the Arigna area.  In addition to that they had in their programme for the last year <Col N="733" /> the investigation and mapping of the phosphate in County Clare, and certain copper deposits in Kerry, Cork, and Waterford.  As far as the copper and phosphate deposits are concerned the work has been practically completed. A special memoir describing the Clare phosphates mapped is about being published.  It is in an advanced stage of preparation and should be published very soon.  The coalfield work which is being done is only a continuation of certain other field years and is not likely to be finished for some time.</P>
      <P>In the last three years we have tried to direct the attention of the survey more to operations which seem likely to have economic results, but from time to time we, unfortunately, had to interrupt the work entered upon in the beginning of the year, because we were getting inquiries of an urgent nature as to certain matters, and where it seems reasonable and important enough we sometimes do divert from the original programme mapped out for the year to other matters.  That is one of the reasons why the map of Arigna field is not completed.  Last year, for instance, arising out of certain inquiries a particular map of Blessington area was put in course of preparation, and a preparatory memoir descriptive of the work done is almost completed.  That was the result of certain inquiries made, and, as a result, attention was directed to the upper reaches of the valley of the Liffey, where certain valuable brickclays and other builders' materials are known to lie.  A development last year was the attention paid to the silver mines district with regard to certain zinc ore deposits.  There is at present very full investigation being carried out by means of boring and investigation, and there is reasonable hope from the operations in progress that there may be a relatively good mining project established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two special maps were called for from the Survey Department last year. One, made for my own branch, showing the distribution of certain heavy clay soils and sub-soils in a particular county, was called for for a special reason.  Another map called for <Col N="734" /> urgently by the Department of Lands and Fisheries showed the areas occupied by limestone and certain calcarcous drifts in the country.</P>
    <P>Technical advice has been given to inquiries on a variety of matters. People interested in obtaining information as to the location of a variety of raw material, such as pipe clays, fire clays, china clays, reef quartz, silica of certain types, barytes, crude black pigment, peat, common ores, and certain other matters were all dealt with in the course of the year. I would direct the attention of the House to the importance of the work done by this survey, and to the various maps and the publications which are issued by them from time to time, because if one were to take serious count of the remarks that are commonly made through the country from time to time there is, apparently, a belief that the whole geological survey has been neglected.  I ask anyone who would be likely, at the beginning, to express a point of view like that to pause, and see what material the geological survey can put at his disposal before that comment is made.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work done by the survey, through its programme of field work each year, there is an economic geologist attached to the Department with a tremendous personal acquaintance with the whole geology of the country.  He is put in immediate contact with any person where an inquiry seems to be a good one and where it is likely there are going to be developments.</P>
    <P>In that connection attention has been drawn to comments made on the mines and minerals legislation which has been promised.  I have seen it stated that certain people who might be working here have left the country by reason of the absence of legislation.  I do not know of those people, and I do not know why they should have left the country, because although the legislation has been delayed for quite unavoidable reasons, there are a considerable number of people making preliminary investigations and borings. They have done so at my request <Col N="735" /> when they came to me and explained their difficulties.  I have explained the situation as I see it and the difficulties that are inevitably going to confront people while the Constitution remains as it is, but I have indicated to them ways in which preliminary work which is generally very long and sometimes expensive might be got on with while legislation is being awaited.  The draft Bill has been received from the office of the Parliamentary Draftsman, and is now being finally discussed by the departments.  Leaving out one important point which may have to be left afterwards to the courts for determination, the Bill ought soon to be in final form, and there is every expectation that it will be law before we rise for the summer.</P>
    <P>The transport side of the Department is a side to which I am not going to refer to-day, at least on the general question, because there are at least three Bills on transport which are now being considered, and on which the whole general transport question will have afterwards to be reviewed.  I think I cannot say anything more than indicate the hope, and I have every hope, that they will certainly be introduced before the House rises for the summer recess.  I had certain proposed legislation in connection with my side of the transport problem considered last year, and very definitely considered, but I make no secret of the fact that that was specially directed to the betterment and the preservation of the existing railway systems.  During the end of last year and early this year, after consultation with the directors of the railway company, I found it necessary to embark upon another line.  In all these matters, having a very definite view that the railways of the country must be preserved, I had to pay special attention, at least I felt myself bound to pay special attention, to railway requirements all the time, of course ruling these by what I think the transport requirements of the country are, as opposed to the mere railway requirements.  As I did not receive any final opinion from the <Col N="736" /> railway company, on certain points I put up to them, until the early months of this year, that legislation has had necessarily to be postponed.  Certain minor points may arise on the Vote but as far as transport generally is concerned I am leaving that matter over for discussion when these Bills, probably three in all, are introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate roughly what he means by three Bills?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give no indication, because I am not going to indicate policy ahead.  There is another piece of legislation which has been completed by my Department for a long time, but, owing to the congestion, was crushed out of the draftsman's office until some time ago.  It is now practically completed by the draftsman, and will receive speedy consideration in the Department after I receive it back from that office.  That is the Merchandise Marks Bill dealing with the marking of goods coming into the country.  I shall also have, within the next two or three weeks, a Bill about which Deputy Hogan asked dealing with the fisheries on the Shannon.  I think that is all I have to say on the Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;  This amendment was put on the Order Paper for the purpose of giving members of this Party and the House generally, so far as they may desire to do so, an opportunity of expressing their disapproval regarding the failure of the Minister's half-way house policy for industrial development, his failure to admit and deal with the problem of unemployment, his failure to produce a solution of the chaotic conditions of the transport industry, and his refusal to admit and deal with the profiteering evil which is causing such hardship amongst the residents of our towns and cities.  Citizens in this and every other State and every thinking politician will readily admit that the man or woman who works pays, either directly or indirectly, for the person who does not work. <Col N="737" /> Scientific development and the replacement of man power by machinery has undoubtedly added considerably to the list of unemployed in this and in every other country.  We have Ministers going out on parades, especially at week ends, throughout the country endeavouring to persuade and gull the people into the idea that this country is in a much more prosperous condition to-day than when they took over office seven or eight years ago.  After all, those of us who wish to analyse the position and to look at it in its proper light will have to study the figures available and try to find out to what extent the Minister's statements on these matters are accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government admitted here yesterday that for the week ending 28th March, 1931, the number of people in receipt of home assistance reached the remarkable figure of 84,396.  The figure in 1914&mdash; I admit that the comparison may not be a sound one&mdash;was 14,663.  The last figure available to Deputies in the report of the Local Government Department showed that for the year ending 31st March, 1928, a sum of £404,556 had to be provided for home assistance. For the year ending 31st of March, 1931, the amount was £547,984.  Is there anything in those figures to justify the repeated statements made by Ministers all over the country regarding the present position of the people and the prosperous condition of the country? It is generally admitted by those who know more about the subject than I do, those who serve on public bodies, that about 50 per cent. of those who receive home assistance are eligible for work if it is made available for them.  Coming back to the figures quoted recently by the Minister in regard to the registered number of unemployed, he said that the latest figure was 25,642.  We know perfectly well, as well as the Minister, though he will not admit it, that that figure does not represent the actual amount of unemployment.  In order to prove that let us take the case of the City of Dublin.  Last week according to the report of the South Dublin Union Commissioners, there <Col N="738" /> were 7,200 people in receipt of poor law assistance in the city.  Out of the 25,642 unemployed persons in the country we have figures to show that about 8,000 are resident in the City of Dublin alone.  It is fairly well known also that people who are eligible to apply for, and to receive, home help cannot at the same time be in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit.  That, so far as I know, is the attitude taken up by the authorities responsible for administering home assistance.  The real figure, therefore, for the unemployed in Dublin is approximately 15,000 instead of the 8,000 which, the Minister claims, represents the number of registered unemployed.  I have been a resident of Dublin for 25 years, but never have I come across so many able-bodied men looking for work, which they are unable to get.  Let us study the latest report of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and add the figures they give to those which I have given, and let us ask ourselves honestly whether the position is as it is represented to be by the President and the Ministers during their tours throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I venture to express the opinion that the President and Ministers, when speaking in the country on these matters, rely more on the information they get from the lords and ladies who attend Cumann na nGaedheal receptions than on the information which they sometimes get from ordinary citizens.  Let them get away from royal reception rooms and get into the country, and, if they do, they will admit that the position is different to that which they describe.  I should say also, and I do not know what impression it will convey to the public, that I notice from a report in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; that the number of tall hats worn at Punchestown recently showed a considerable decrease compared with previous years. I wonder whether that is a sign of a return to sanity amongst the ranks of the new and the old aristocracy?  What impression does it convey to the Minister's mind?  The worsening of the position, as I claim to see it at the moment, in the rural parts, at any <Col N="739" /> rate, is due to the considerable fall in prices of produce which our producers have for sale, either in the home or foreign market, and the fact that prices, particularly for agricultural produce, are so low is mainly due, though I am sure that Ministers will not admit it, to the British banking policy to which we are so closely tied. British bankers are dictating the prices <Col N="740" /> at which they will buy the food which our people here produce for the British market.  The sooner we face that, problem the better.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until Wednesday, 6th May.</P>
