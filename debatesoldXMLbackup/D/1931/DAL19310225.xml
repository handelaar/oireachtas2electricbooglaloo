      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken (for Mr. T. Crowley)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether he has refused to meet a deputation from the South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee to discuss the matter of the Irish House, Tipperary; whether he gave an undertaking in 1927 that if a business proposition in connection with the Irish House were put before him he would give the matter his closest and most sympathetic consideration, and, if so, whether he will state the reasons for his refusal to receive the deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago a deputation mentioned to me the question of the compensation awarded in respect of the Irish House, Tipperary, and I indicated that I would be prepared to give consideration to any suitable proposal that might be submitted to me.  I was recently requested to receive a deputation to discuss a proposal which I learned could not be accepted by the Minister for Finance.  In the circumstances it seemed to me that it would be quite unfair to put a local deputation to the trouble and expense of coming to Dublin to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the conduct of a former Principal Clerk in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and of one other officer in that Department has recently been the subject of a disciplinary inquiry; if so, to state (a) the rank of the other officer concerned, (b) the respective duties of the officers involved, particularly in relation to <Col N="414" /> the administration of the Betting Act, 1926, and (c) the exact nature, subject-matter, findings, and disciplinary consequences of the inquiry in relation to each officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>No disciplinary inquiry of the kind indicated by the Deputy has been held recently.  Such an inquiry was held two years ago, but I can see no reason why the officials concerned should, in addition to the disciplinary action then taken, be pilloried after this lapse of time by a discussion of the matter in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As the question appears to have arisen from the recent discussion regarding the mitigation of Excise penalties by the Revenue Commissioners, I may add that the information sought would have no relevance whatever to that discussion, since nothing relating to the mitigation of penalties arose during the inquiry referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that he is not to be the sole judge of relevancy in this matter and that this information is required for the purpose of enabling the members of the House to determine their attitude in connection with the amendment before the House in relation to the Betting Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken (for Mr. P. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the services which have been rendered by the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission since he became entitled to his existing pension will entitle him to a further pension on his retirement from his present post, and, if so, on what scale will such pension be based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission being a Judge of the High Court of Saorstát Eireann would be entitled to a pension on the scale laid down in Section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, on his retirement from that office.  I may say, however, that the judge in question has waived all claim to pension in respect of his present judicial office.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state the number of subscribers and the total amount of subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919 and 1920 from the Youghal urban and rural districts (East Cork) and the number and amount of the subscriptions refunded in these areas, and if he will state when it is expected to refund the remainder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The form in which the records in my Department are kept is such that the preparation of the information regarding the number and total amount of the subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan 1919-20, received and repaid in the Youghal urban and rural districts would entail an amount of labour on the part of the staff concerned which would not, in my opinion, be justified. With regard to the latter part of the question, the claim of every subscriber who applied in writing to my Department within the prescribed period will be dealt with, with as little delay as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware, of course, that to bring about the stabilisation of that payment into the Local Taxation Account, it was arranged that where licences would not be renewed the licence fees would correspondingly go up pro rata on the balance of the licence holders in the particular area and that, since then, no particular case of increase has been recorded, though several licences have been abolished.

      <P>Representations have not been received by me recently with regard to the difficulty of raising money for the repair of schools.  The responsibility for the repair and maintenance of school buildings devolves upon the managers and local parties, and grants for this purpose are not normally made by my Department.</P>
      <P>In a few instances appeals have just been made by managers that money from the Vote for the relief of unemployment might be used in connection with building or the reconstruction of schools.  Where the school plot is vested grants are made for this purpose from State Funds specifically allocated for the service, and, in the regulations governing their award, special provision is included for cases in necessitous districts.</P>
      <P>I have made no representations of the kind suggested to the Minister for Finance.  It does not seem to me proper that the specifically &ldquo;local&rdquo; contribution should be paid out of central funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Three series of index numbers which show the trend of wholesale prices in Saorstát Eireann have been published for the past few years, viz., (1) the import price index number; (2) the export price index number (both of which are published in the annual Trade and Shipping Report), and (3) the index number of agricultural prices (published annually in the Irish Trade Journal).  Monthly index numbers of import prices have been published from January 1924 to December 1929.  It is recognised that monthly series of both export and agricultural price index numbers would be desirable, but the seasonal elements in agriculture introduce considerable technical difficulties into their construction. These difficulties are in process of being solved and it is hoped that monthly series of export and agricultural price index numbers will become available soon.  I am advised, however, that sufficient progress has been made in the production of these index numbers to fulfil our obligations under the International Convention. It was generally recognised when the Convention was signed that each <Col N="422" /> country might require more or less time to bring into effect the re-arrangements which the Convention involved.</P>

      <P>It will be appreciated, as I stated in the Dáil on the 19th November last, that these figures were not ascertainable directly from the replies to the Census questionnaire, and that many kinds of cross-checks must be applied to the persons who then described themselves as &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; before it can be decided whether they fall into the category of &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; or not.  All the available data are being utilised for this purpose, but the results so far are not such as to promise that sufficiently reliable information will eventually be forthcoming. While I have not given up the examination, I cannot in the circumstances name any date at which this particular Census volume is likely to appear.</P>

He appealed against the decision to the Court of Referees which recommended that the claim should be disallowed.  Benefit was not, therefore, payable on the claim.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kinsella was engaged in carting for the Wexford County Council during certain periods in and since the 1927-28 Insurance Year under conditions which did not constitute insurable employment.  Contributions were accordingly not payable in respect of it.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(4) In sub-section (2), line 51, to delete the words &ldquo;an excise penalty&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;a penalty.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flinn was speaking when the debate on this amendment closed.  I feel that in putting the case for this amendment before the House our hands are greatly hampered by the extraordinary attitude which the Minister for Finance took in relation to the question I put to him to-day, because that question goes to the whole root of the matter. If Deputies will remember, the Minister in opposing the amendment devoted his whole attention to the question of what he called penalties <i>in terrorem</i> and altogether disregarded the issue which was definitely raised from these benches, namely, that the collection of the fines imposed under this Act should be entrusted to the Department of Justice in the ordinary way.  I may say that excise penalties originated in the extraordinary circumstances which prevailed at the end <Col N="444" /> of the 18th century.  At that time you had an extensive smuggling trade in wines and laces with France, and those who, very often, were the instigators of the business were themselves the magistrates before whom the offenders would eventually be brought.  The courts to which smugglers were summoned were often held in a harness room and even in the cellar, which the wines were intended to replenish, of a country squire.  Naturally, in these circumstances the person engaged in running wine for the replenishment of his own table would take a lenient view of the offender when brought before him.  These excise penalties were definitely fixed by the legislature in order to ensure that a conviction would be recorded and that an opportunity would afterwards be given to the ordinary officers of the law to apprehend the smuggler and imprison him.</P>
      <P>Circumstances to-day have alto gether changed.  Transport and communications have improved and a person cannot be brought now before a court held in a drawing-room in an obscure part of the country and allowed virtually to go free, particularly for offences against the revenue.  Therefore, because circumstances have changed we say that there is no reason whatever why the extraordinary measures which then had to be adopted should be retained at present. These penalties were originally designed to prevent corruption, but in actual fact, if the information which has been conveyed to us is correct, they have now become a source of corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy, first that there was no corruption, and secondly, that the matters which were the subject of disciplinary punishment had no connection with the question of penalties good, bad, or indifferent.  No names have been mentioned, but nevertheless the Deputy in a sense is making a charge against individuals who can be identified&mdash;charges for which there is no foundation whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have to make those charges and to repeat what I <Col N="445" /> am going to say in this House it is merely because of the attitude the Minister for Finance took up.  If the Minister will put the true facts of this matter, and all the facts, before the House, possibly my speech may be different, but if he refuses to give the House the information which we think it should have before it in order to determine this question, then I must repeat in this House what is commonly said outside.  If what I say is inaccurate I regret it very much.  If I do repeat an inaccuracy I want to make it clear that it is merely because of the extraordinary attitude taken up here to-day by the Minister for Finance.  He has the option to put the true facts before the House in regard to this matter.  I am simply repeating here what common, public rumour says in regard to these officials of the Inland Revenue.  Before I proceed, does the Minister wish to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The option is with the Deputy.  I leave it to his own sense of fitness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  In the discharge of the duty which I feel has been thrust upon us I must make the House aware of what is commonly repeated in the City of Dublin in regard to certain officials.  I regret it should be so, but in the absence of the exact truth I have got to use what I believe is an approximation.  Two officers of the Revenue Commissioners were, some time ago, connected with the administration of the Betting Act of 1926.  For some reason or other we know that the conduct of these officers was the subject of a departmental investigation, and that whatever they were charged with must have been a serious matter because the penalty which, I believe, was inflicted upon one of them had serious monetary consequences for him.  He lost, I understand, in salary and bonus something like £200 per annum and has been debarred from further promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were the offences?  The Minister himself has admitted that, in the course of their duty, certain officers of the revenue are obliged to have betting transactions with bookmakers. It is said that these officers had betting transactions with bookmakers, <Col N="446" /> not upon the public account, but upon their own private account, and that the returns made in the ordinary way by the bookmakers disclosed that these officers were in receipt of much more generous odds than the odds offered to the ordinary public.  I do not know whether I should ask the Minister if that is true or not, or whether he is prepared to contradict me and say that it is not true.  The fact that we do know is that these two officials were very heavily involved, and that apparently no effort was made by the bookmakers to get them to fulfil their obligations in regard to these transactions.  That is the information which has been conveyed to me.  I think it is serious.  I am repeating it with every reserve.  I am only repeating it because I feel that, in view of what has transpired already within the short period during which this Act has been in operation, there is a public duty upon me and upon the members of this Party to secure that henceforward the collection of monetary penalties from bookmakers will be dealt with in the ordinary way by the Department of Justice and not by the Department of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he must have a maximum penalty.  I have not yet had from him the information that I asked for on the last day, as to the exact amount of the penalties collected from bookmakers by the Inland Revenue Department where the fines were in sums of £500 and in smaller amounts.  My information is that the amount accepted by the Inland Revenue Department has been very much less than the fine which the court was compelled by statute to impose; that not only were the amounts very much less, but that there were very serious differences in the amounts which the Inland Revenue Department accepted in discharge of the penalties imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister pleaded here for a maximum penalty.  I want the House for a moment to leave that question aside and to consider whether the system of collection that at present prevails is to continue, because what happens is that though the penalty is imposed in open court the remission <Col N="447" /> takes place in a star chamber.  Take a case of a wealthy influential bookmaker. He is dealing in large sums, with perhaps a turnover of £50,000 or £100,000 a year, and he breaks the law. He goes, this man who is extremely affluent, to deal in private, in one room and without any witnesses, with an official of the State who is charged with the collection of a fine from him.  Who can say what takes place between these two people?  Who can say what is the consideration which is sometimes offered, and which we know has been offered, in order to secure a remission of the penalties which have been imposed by the court?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy knows of any consideration having been offered, then he should give the information. No such information has ever reached me.</P>

      <P>What we are dealing with here is a matter that touches the administration of the Act in some of its most vital particulars.  If we can, shall we say, show that there is a strong suspicion that officials of the Inland Revenue Department have received concessions or privileges from the bookmakers over whom they are supposed to exercise supervision, can we not use that as an argument against permitting the excise penalties to continue, the excise penalty which carries with it this Star Chamber remission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the Act does not entirely concern remission or imposition of penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent yes, because it is only when breaches of these provisions of the Act, which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners, have been made that the question of excise penalty arises.  It is what is used&mdash;the excise penalty or the big stick, as Deputy Little says &mdash;to compel people to keep the law.  The big stick may remain, but if the arms of the officials who wield it are tied by their transactions with the bookmakers I suppose the big stick will remain on the shelf or at least be whittled down.  Now, I say that in the short time this Act has been in operation the things which have happened, not happened, mind you, to subordinate officials but to responsible officials in the Department, and the facts which, I am sure, are within common knowledge as to the conditions which used to prevail before 1926 in relation to the administration of the Betting Laws, should make us very chary about continuing a system which is, at any rate, likely to be easily and seriously abused.  I said I did not want this point of the excise penalty mixed up with the question of the maximum penalty.  I would suggest that the House should take a separate decision with regard to amendment 4.  If the word &ldquo;excise&rdquo; is deleted from the section then the penalty would become one enforceable in the ordinary way by the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are good grounds for making any remission with regard to <Col N="450" /> these penalties those grounds can be stated in open court.  The magistrate or judge sitting on the bench can determine in the full light of public opinion whether any mercy or remission is warranted, and if the remission is made I suppose public opinion would be satisfied.  If, on the other hand, the maximum penalty is imposed public opinion will also be satisfied that the maximum penalty will be collected and that the law will be enforced with equal justice between them.  Supposing that that is the issue we have at stake, we want, as I said before, to try and get every transaction under this Betting Act carried out, as betting is now done, in the full light of public opinion, so that the public themselves may form their own conclusions as to whether these penalties are warranted and as to whether the abuses which take place under the Act are such as to make it virtually impossible to regulate betting.  Then they can come to a decision one way or another as to whether the present position of regularising betting is to continue.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that apart from our having discussed the principle which runs through the Bill we must also pay attention to the particular clauses where the words &ldquo;Excise penalty&rdquo; occur.  Whatever case the Minister may have later on in other clauses I would like to point out to him that in clause 2 you are not dealing with a matter which comes so much under the purview of the excise department as under the ordinary police. That is the clause prohibiting the non-licensed bookie from doing any business, and the detection of that particular crime is largely in the hands of the ordinary police.  It is far more a matter of public order, and has less to do with the technical side of the collection of excise revenue, and it is an added reason in this case, whatever view the Minister holds with reference to excise penalties under other clauses, why he should allow the word &ldquo;excise&rdquo; to be deleted in this clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer again to <Col N="451" /> the points raised by Deputy MacEntee, and I want to present back to the Minister the suggestion he makes that we are anxious on this side of the House to pillory or further punish officials who have been punished departmentally. We are not concerned with those officials at all&mdash;in fact, I feel very sorry for them&mdash;but we have to use this particular case to enforce the arguments and to show the reasons why we want to try and insist on all cases being tried through the District Justices.  The Minister will not deny the assertions made or will not give us the information concerning the cases themselves.  At the same time the Minister will not give us the information wanted to be able to form an opinion for ourselves as to whether the statements made to us from people outside the House are based on truth or are as near truth as possible.  The Minister will not give us the particulars of the fines imposed on bookmakers from early after the administration of the Act.  He will not give us particulars which I requested when last speaking on this particular amendment.  As far as I can judge, and as far as my information goes from men in the bookmaking business, they are quite prepared to face the open court on whatever charge may be brought before them, but they are not prepared to stand over people who are fraudulently committing offences, and they are just as anxious as the Minister that those particular persons should be dealt with by the forces of the law.  They agree that there is great injustice done to men who commit technical offences and are treated on the same basis as the Revenue Commissioners treat those who are fraudulent.  It is all very well for the Revenue Commissioners if they bring certain cases that tend to fraud to the court, but they cannot deny that they themselves have on several occasions imposed a penalty on particular bookmakers who submit to a certain fine imposed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has given details of what is current abroad.  The Minister has got to deny that all these suggestions are false and that the disciplinary action against <Col N="452" /> these officials had nothing whatever to do with their intercourse with bookmakers in the administration of the Betting Act.  I want to say, as far as I can understand and as far as I know on fairly good authority, these officials, prior to this, had records second to none in the Revenue Commissioners' Department.  They were excellent and efficient officials, and their punishment now was a result of the position they were put in in administering that particular Act. Unless the Minister gives us the particulars of the cases of either of those particular officials, or unless the Minister can definitely deny that the circumstances had no connection at all with the offences they committed, I think he will either have to meet us on this or show us where we are wrong.  The Minister answered the question put to him to-day by Deputy MacEntee, but he did not give us any new information.  The only information that we have is information got from outside sources. The Minister stated that he wanted evidence from us.  The Minister will not deny that in dealing with a particular bookmaker whom they had sent for, they pressed him very hard to give information against these particular revenue officials.  I wonder would the Minister deny that his Department sent for a particular bookmaker and tried very hard to get him, as he said himself, &ldquo;to squeal&rdquo;?  He refused to give that information, and he complained that his subsequent treatment was because he had refused to give the information that the Revenue Commissioners wanted.  If that is not true, then, of course, the information I have been given is wrong; but I am inclined to believe, and, in fact, have good proof of it, that the information is true.  If that is so, then the revenue officials themselves were looking for the information, or proof of the information, which is at our disposal now, namely, that these officials, in administering the Act in the way in which the Minister for Finance still wants it administered, were put in a position that might arouse a feeling that there was some attempt to corrupt the officials, and <Col N="453" /> that the officials themselves had taken part in transactions which they were not allowed to do by the laws which governed their employment.</P>

I might say at the outset that I know nothing whatsoever of these matters which form the main subject-matter of the two speeches we have heard to-day.  I do not intend to deal with this matter from that point of view.  I would like to be clear on this point: Before any penalty can be inflicted I take it that the bookmakers must be tried in open court and that the question at issue here is the right of the Revenue Commissioners to make certain remissions of the penalties inflicted.</P>

      <P>To make a remission, in any case.  This practice of putting on this class of penalty for these offences is an old one, and it applies to a good many other matters relating to the collection of taxes as well as this one.  I think Deputy Little suggested that it was for the police to prosecute in these cases.  The same argument might be applied to other taxes, such as the entertainment tax. I do not think that that would be a proper matter for the police.  In any case, what have we revenue collectors for except for the collection of taxes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that this particular clause deals with the penalties which the person who has no licence would incur for betting at a street corner?  It is a thing which would come under the notice of the police, though, of course, we are dealing with the general principle.</P>

      <P>It is very likely that a circus man would not get tax tickets printed.  As I say, it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners and their servants to collect it.  Deputy Briscoe has said that these men have stated that they are not afraid to face anything that may be brought against them in open court.  How are the remissions <Col N="454" /> to be made?  Suppose the matter is handed over to the Department of Justice, how is it to be met by the Department of Justice, For instance, a sentence of imprisonment may be inflicted on a man for an offence that has nothing to do with revenue offences.  The man is sent to jail; representations are made to the officials of the Department of Justice, and, in certain circumstances, they have the right to make a reduction in the sentence, to release the man or to inflict a smaller penalty on him, but that is not done in open court.  I think it is a matter that could not be done in open court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell has misunderstood either Deputy MacEntee or myself.  There is no suggestion that the mitigation of penalties shall take place in open court.  The complaint is that the District Justice has no power but to inflict the minimum penalty, and even if on the merits of the case a man may appear to him to have committed only a technical offence he has no power to inflict the minimum penalty.  The Revenue Commissioners themselves may deal privately with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the thing properly, the minimum penalty is fixed in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>He can reduce it by one-fourth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it becomes the minimum penalty.  He must inflict the minimum penalty.  I do not see anything wrong with the principle of having a minimum penalty in any Act. As a matter of fact, it is found in a great many cases that if a man is convicted of a definite offence a definite minimum penalty must be inflicted on him.  That is quite a common thing in our Acts of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am coming to the question of remission. It is not done in open court. If the thing is referred to the Department of Justice, how is the Department of Justice to get the information on which it is going to act in giving a decision as to whether or not the penalty ought to be remitted?  It seems to me that they will be forced back again to the position that is <Col N="455" /> being complained of here, that they will have to go to the Revenue Commissioners and inquire generally as to what particular type of character the man who is applying for a remission is.  Is it the kind of case that ought to get favourable consideration from us?  Is this the man's first offence? That is the sort of thing that is done where anyone makes a recommendation to the Department of Justice to have a reduction of a penalty inflicted in open court for an ordinary offence.  It strikes me that where there is a question of remission the Revenue Commissioners cannot be kept out of it and that their considerations must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what advantage there is in bringing the Department of Justice into it.  I am not speaking of open court, but of what is being done in the Department of Justice and in the Department of the Revenue Commissioners which is intimately connected with it, and generally knows the sort of thing that is going on.  I think that the question of remission would be more fairly and justly decided by the Department that has the greater knowledge of the particular kind of offence than the Department that has to get its information in the long run from the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the way I view it, and I cannot see that there is any point in the objection that has been made.  I stand, of course, for the infliction of the penalty by the court.  That is a principle that all are agreed on.  But as to the rights to remit, I do not see that any great point has been made in what has been suggested by the other side, as to whether the minimum penalty is to be great or not; that is a totally different question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy hold that the proper person to exercise a power of judgment in this case should be the Revenue Commissioners?  That is the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always the prerogative of mercy, which is not in any way analogous to the power of the Revenue Commissioners.  The prerogative of mercy is there and must be there.  It is embodied in the State. It is obvious that under the ordinary functions of the law the judge is the person who gives judgment and decides the penalty.  If there is any remission of that it is abnormal, and a complete exception to the ordinary course and current of law, whereas in the other case the power of judgment is in the Revenue Commissioners, and it is normal and the current of law that they should be the deciding voice in what the penalty is to be.  The function of a judge in the matter is purely that of a recommendation of mercy which may be accepted or rejected by the Commissioners.  If Deputy O'Connell wants to leave that power in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners he should, in some way or another, explicitly amend the Constitution, as otherwise you are simply making new ground for doubts and litigation in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there may be danger of corruption, that danger will not arise in connection with the mitigation of penalties.  It will arise in connection with detection and proof in court.  The bookmaker who wants to corrupt anybody will try and carry out the corruption before the conviction has been recorded against him in court, and he will not wait until afterwards. As a matter of fact, so far as the bookmaker is concerned, in the ordinary way, the damage is done when he has been convicted, because there are grounds for the refusal of his licence when he applies for it afterwards. So that all this talk about the great danger of corruption of the public service because of the penalties <Col N="457" /> being remitted by the Commissioners is without any foundation whatever and can only be based on views that have not sufficient regard to the facts.</P>
      <P>I have already stated the case. There must be stinging penalties in revenue cases.  The minimum penalties must be made rather high.  They must have a terrorising effect, because you have not the same public opinion and you have not the same working of the individual conscience in regard to revenue offences that you have in regard to ordinary offences.  Therefore, you must contemplate that on many occasions there will be a need for a remission of penalties.  Somebody must remit, as Deputy O'Connell stated&mdash;either the Department of Justice or the Revenue Commissioners. One does not hear of these charges in connection with smuggling.  For instance, exactly the same thing exists in regard to smuggling.  There is a minimum penalty and then sometimes there is a remission, if a case is made for it.  It is done by the same machinery.  This only arises because a great many more bookmakers are inclined to break the law than you find in any other profession&mdash;and that is due to the fact that they were carrying on illegally before the Betting Act was passed&mdash;and because they carry on an enormous amount of propaganda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all ready to admit that there is considerable difficulty in this case to secure, on the one hand, that those who try to evade their legal obligations with regard to paying taxes and so on will not find it easy to escape, and, on the other hand, to do justice to the individual and to prevent corruption.  I do not agree with the Minister that there are not great opportunities for corruption in the case of mitigation of penalties.  It is obvious that if a very heavy penalty is imposed the person who hopes to get off a large fine will have a direct incentive to corrupt the person who may be sent to negotiate privately with him. I think the Minister has not made his case.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial stages, anyhow, as far as we can see, are those of direct personal negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, anyhow, that you ought to change the procedure in that respect, and there is either of two courses open to us, so far as I can see.  One is that the ordinary judicial procedure should obtain and the case be brought before an open court and liberty given to the judge, having heard all the evidence and all the circumstances, to impose the penalty that he thinks proper in the case.  It is obvious that there must have been fairly good reasons for departing from that, as that departure has actually been made and it is not the custom.  The next thing is to set up a special tribunal to deal with the mitigation of penalties, not necessarily a public court but somebody sitting in a judicial capacity who will hear all the evidence that is capable of being put forward by the Revenue Commissioners on the one hand and whatever evidence the person fined can put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far the present procedure actually approximates to that latter idea.  Is there, in fact, some sort of tribunal that sits on these cases and considers, as a judicial tribunal should consider, what the amount of the remission should be, if any?  It seems to me, at any rate, that the present system is particularly bad.  There are opportunities of favouritism; there is danger of corruption and a number of other dangers that anybody can see.  In any case, it is not right that the individual citizen should be left at the mercy of the Executive in a case like this.  The functions of the judiciary, as I understand them, are to stand between the Executive on the one hand, who administer the law, and the individual citizen and protect him within the law against any unfair power that might be <Col N="459" /> assumed by the Executive.  Apart altogether from the dangers of corruption, you have not these safeguards here at all.  Consequently, my opinion is that either you will have to go back definitely to the open court and leave it to the judge, having heard all the evidence that can be put forward by the Revenue Commissioners, to impose the penalty and sacrifice whatever there may be by having this high penalty, which is to be the minimum, or you will have to set up some independent tribunal to hear these cases of remission in private, and to decide in a judicial manner upon them.  Perhaps the Minister would give us an indication of the present procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>An attempt is made to deal with them in as judicial a manner as possible.  I have occasionally seen certain files in connection with them. Some person is deputed to examine the case and to make a submission, and either all the Revenue Commissioners or at least two of them sit and read the appeal and the case put in by the person; read any evidence that is available to them; read the submission that is made by the person who has more particularly considered it, and they come to a decision on that. Two or three things have to be taken into account: (1) You have to take into account the previous record and all that is known about the particular person&mdash;whether he is a hardened offender; whether he is a person whom they are always having difficulties with; whether he is a person who in fact has broken the law on many occasions but has not been caught.  That will be one aspect.  The other aspect is really the question of ability to pay. A penalty that might be very light on one particular person who is a wealthy bookmaker might be very heavy on a poor bookmaker, and there has to be an attempt made to meet the circumstances of a man who is poor.  I have seen cases dealt with in the Department of Justice, as I once operated there for a short period during the illness of a Minister.  Very much the same procedure is followed there, except that, instead of having two Commissioners, <Col N="460" /> they have the Minister and the Secretary of the Department finally considering all the documents that may be brought up in connection with the matter.  I assert that no abuses have occurred in connection with this matter, that the same procedure is being followed in connection with customs and many other things, and that this is all due to the extremely good propaganda carried on by a number of people who feel sore at being subjected to any penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing Commissioners are the chief executive officers in charge of the collection of revenue.  There are none of these set aside&mdash;independent, so to speak, of the Executive side&mdash;and sitting as Judicial Commissioners.  The same Commissioners who are charged with the collection of the revenue are the people who will sit and decide on any question of remission.  Is not that so? However well they may do it, is it not perfectly obvious that the protection ordinarily given to the citizen is not provided for here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The protection ordinarily given to the citizen is given by the courts.  If the citizen does not break the law he would not come before the Commissioners at all.  He must have broken the law and must have been convicted before he comes before the Commissioners.  I repeat, in spite of what Deputy Briscoe has said, that there was no such thing as bringing anybody forward for a technical offence unless so many technical offences have been committed as give very good ground for believing that the technical offence is a part of some sort of a regular campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will not the Minister admit that there is this difference between that system and the ordinary administration of the law in open court: that the judge is at liberty to impose ordinarily a generally suitable penalty for the offence having taken all the facts into account?  In regard to the Department of Justice there would be relatively, I am sure, very few cases of remissions, whereas it is an every-day fact, and part of the general procedure of the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="461" /> I may be wrong about that, but it seems to me in the one case every one knows there are likely to be offences occurring which will lead to penalties being imposed that in fact the offender cannot pay, and that it is more or less part of the every-day procedure of the Revenue Commissioners that they deal with remissions.  The occasional case that goes to the Department of Justice is not to be compared with that.  Probably the existing machinery is good enough for the remissions of the ordinary course, but it is not good enough for the case of every-day affairs of the Revenue Commissioners. Whatever attitude the Minister may take up, upon this particular section I would suggest that he should carefully consider the possibility of having in addition to the ordinary Revenue Commissioners some sort of a court established of Commissioners to deal with the judicial side, meaning by that the question of the possibility of remission.</P>

      <P>I want to contradict the Minister for Finance on one definite statement he has made.  If he examined the circumstances I do not believe he would have made it.  The Minister said first of all that every case was brought into court and that it is only after the court has inflicted the penalty that the question of mitigation starts.  I say that is not true.  The Commissioners have themselves imposed penalties when the defendant was never brought before the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find I am correct.  The Minister has on several occasions in this debate given the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners as to the bookmaking fraternity. He speaks of them as men likely to be engaged in defrauding the Revenue Commissioners because, prior to this Act, they were engaged in an illegal business and, therefore, they are always going to be practising illegality.  I say that is one reason, if there was no other, why these men should be given a chance in a court of justice, for the judge or justice, having heard the facts of the case, to inflict a penalty and not to have it inflicted by a prejudiced body of Commissioners who believe that they are men engaged in illegality and who are out to defraud the Revenue.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that the whole method of finding out evidence against these people is based on a principle that we all hoped had long since been disregarded, namely, the principle of felon-setting.  He described how a man disguised as a corner-boy hangs round betting shops and gets into the good graces of betting men, and if they make a bet with him without putting it on the book he turns on them.  The Minister should know in his own experience that in pre-truce days it was the bookmakers we went to to help us out of serious difficulties.  They put their hand in their pockets and we did not ask them where they got the money, and he should not turn upon these men now and call them a bunch of rogues and thieves.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister called them rogues.  The Minister is prejudiced against these men, and his Department is prejudiced against them, and it is nothing short of felon-setting to get his men to get friendly with these men and to go round the premises of these men, as they have done.  It is like a man going to a publican for years and then getting the publican to give him one drink after hours and immediately reporting him to the authorities.  It is the same means that are employed to get the bookmaker into trouble.  The Minister has not given the House the true fact of how the Commissioners' men act with regard to these men.  It is absurd to have minimum penalties of £125 when a man is likely to be fined on ten different counts, and when the justice knows that a man has not so many pence.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not deny this: that in many cases men have submitted to certain penalties on agreement on the understanding that they would not be sued for other penalties, and these were wiped out.  I am not out to aid the men who want to defraud the Revenue, but to see that the man who is entitled to justice should have it. Take a man at Fairyhouse Races, where there are big crowds and hundreds of people betting with him. He may make one or two slips, but because they occur twice the Commissioners say they are calculated offences.  That man may have two thousand bets, and he may have made a slip in two cases, and I am not asking the House that this man should be let off, but I suggest that he should be given an opportunity of coming before a judge or justice to answer his case.  Let the Revenue Commissioners come forward and state their facts. Let the defendant put his case and let the justice inflict his penalty.  If he thinks it is below the penalty of £125 he should have the power to do so.  In that way you would avoid all these appeals for mitigation of penalties. The Minister has not answered the main question.  He did not give the particulars he cited the other day. Nor has he disputed the fact that what was very nearly corruption arises out of the very thing we are objecting to.</P>

      <P>I have not any sympathy with the bookmakers.  It is a long time since I made a bet, and I have not any personal contact with any of them.  What we are concerned with is that we think the present procedure, apart from the Department of Finance and the general administration of the law, is very undesirable. Deputy O'Connell said that the Revenue Commissioners cannot be kept out of this.  We agree.  But we think that the Revenue Commissioners ought to come into it in open court.  They have either to make a case for or against the remission of the penalties in open court before a justice.  But if that would not meet with Deputy O'Connell's views, and if we were to consider the proposition he put before us to the effect that the Department of Justice was to be the remitting authority, it would certainly be better than the present situation, because we think that at least the Department of Justice, before it made any remission, would consult the Revenue Commissioners, and the Revenue Commissioners would have to take the responsibility of recommending the remission to another Department, or otherwise oppose that remission.  They would probably have to give grounds upon which they would base their attitude. That is a safeguard which does not exist at the moment.  There would be the certain safeguard that before any remission would be made two Departments would have to be involved. As the debate develops I can see that amendments 5 and 6 are really complements to amendment 4, and, though I did think otherwise, I can hardly think now that they could be discussed separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say that in actual fact the minimum penalty for which the Minister is pleading in this House is really only a theoretical penalty and that it is very seldom imposed; even the mitigated penalty is very seldom made effective. We say that in the majority of cases a remission is made.  In actual fact, the final adjudicating authority in this matter which determines the gravity of the offences of which a person has been convicated is not the judge who funds a person guilty, but the Revenue Commissioners, admittedly upon <Col N="465" /> grounds which they themselves could not have produced and which could not have been accepted by the judge in open court.  The House heard the Minister recount the extraordinary procedure which takes place.  The Minister said that certain negotiations are entered into by the person involved or by his solicitor; that a remission is made, and that at least two of the Revenue Commissioners sit in private and these two ask the opinion of a third officer&mdash;very often the officer whose duty involves him in betting transactions with these people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not said that.  We, however, are contending that they have, and their contact is so intimate that we submit it is unsafe that the question of the remission of penalties should depend upon the word of an officer who may himself be involved with the very bookmaker whose case is the subject of consideration. That is a danger we are striving to overcome.  I was discussing the procedure for the mitigation of penalties. Is not that procedure one that could be better carried out in the light of day?  Would it not afford additional protection both to the people engaged in betting, the general public, the bookmakers and the Revenue Commissioners? Would it not be much better if this thing were threshed out in the open court, if the judge fixes the penalty and if the mitigation of that <Col N="466" /> penalty is left to the Department of Justice?</P>
      <P>The Minister says that one of the reasons for the retention of this is that very often the question of remission depends upon whether the Revenue Commissioners think a person is guilty of other offences.  The final factor in determining the real penalty in this matter, the amount which the Revenue Commissioners are ultimately going to accept in discharge of the offence, is determined entirely by the suspicions of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;by that and nothing more.  That is one of the reasons which the Minister adduces to this House for continuing this procedure, and men will be punished not upon evidence but upon suspicion.</P>
      <P>I think we have said enough in this matter to convince the House that the whole of this procedure is dangerous and some further consideration should be given to it.  The excise penalty originated in circumstances which do not exist to-day. The Minister tried to establish an analogy between the position of the officers administering the Betting Act and the Customs officers who have to deal with smuggling.  The position is altogether different.  The officers administering the Betting Act come daily in contact with the bookmakers, some in the discharge of their duties and others, many of them, come into contact with the bookmakers simply because they happen to be of a sporting frame of mind and they may indulge in betting.  The bookmaker is in a position to offer very substantial advantages to officers of the Revenue Department, advantages which a person smuggling a watch over the Border is not in a position, and would not dare, to offer.  It is because these dangers lurk in the Bill that we are anxious to see that everything will be carried out in the light of day, in the open court, and will have to stand the verdict of public opinion.  I think the matter is very serious, and before our amendment is rejected those who are inclined to vote against it should very seriously consider the alternative, a continuance of the present position.</P>

      <P>Any person (other than a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons) who is ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann and desires to obtain a bookmaker's licence may, after publishing the notice hereinafter mentioned, apply in accordance with this section to the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána for the district in which he has or proposes to have an office registered under this Act or, if he has not and does not propose to have any such office, to the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána for the district in which he ordinarily resides for a certificate (in this Act referred to as a certificate of personal fitness) that he is a fit and proper person to hold a bookmaker's licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 19 and 22, to delete the words &ldquo;superintendent of the Gárda Síochána,&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; in each line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the certificate of the fitness of the person who is about to make application for a <Col N="471" /> licence.  The principle involved is really the same as that which was involved in the other amendment.  If you examine the nature of the work of the superintendent of the Guards in this direction you will see that he has really to act as a judge.  The Bill is quite explicit on the point, because when we come to sub-section (4) we see that the superintendent is to act in his discretion and shall decide the matter in his discretion.  Those words are unusual, but whoever is the person to grant the certificate of fitness he must exercise an unusual amount of discretion, because, if you turn to the grounds upon which a certificate of fitness may be refused in a further section, you will find that one of them is &ldquo;general character and known habits.&rdquo;  That is a very vague and rather unsatisfactory limitation, but there does not seem to be any other way of dealing with it than to leave it to the discretion of someone acting in a judicial capacity.  Another ground is &ldquo;financial circumstances,&rdquo; but there again the exercise of a considerable amount of discretion is required, because it does not mean merely that a man may have a bank balance or not be bankrupt, but rather that he is in good credit.  That is a matter that should be decided by some authority who constitutionally should have powers to act as a judge.  Another ground of objection to the granting of a certificate is that the applicant has been carrying on business in a disorderly way or has caused loitering. That is a matter which a judge can decide.  I would remind the Minister that this is very much on all fours with the case of the Master of the Court, which caused a great deal of difficulty to the Dáil owing to a decision of the courts, to the effect that the Master could not act, as previously, in a judicial capacity.  Apart from the argument bearing on the constitutional point, it is also objectionable that a superintendent of the Guards should be a person to decide the question of fitness, because he is the person who has to carry out and administer the law in regard to the applicant afterwards from year to year when making <Col N="472" /> his application.  It places the police in a position in which they can bully people and in which they may be open to acting in an irregular manner.</P>
    <P>Anyone who imagines that the law relating to bookmakers has been carried out in a perfectly regular manner in the past is not aware of the facts because, before this law was passed, it was known that the police winked at the practice of bookmaking.  It was well known that superintendents of the police arranged amongst themselves as to how many raids they would have and how many fines they would secure. The particular bookmakers who were going to be raided were told beforehand about it, and the raid was carried out in a most polite manner.  On some occasions when the magistrate imposed a fine much heavier than that which was usually imposed as a matter of practice, no one was more discomfited and amazed than the superintendents of the old police.  In another case where an over zealous policeman managed to get the warrants before the superintendent, the usual practice was upset because one of the superintendents had more penalties imposed in his district than the superintendents in other districts.  It is more or less inevitable that a practice of that kind arises from time to time in dealing with bookmakers.  It is wrong, in my opinion, that the police, while administering the law, should be put in the position of acting as judges in regard to persons applying for a certificate of fitness of character.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Little is rather prone to raise far-fetched constitutional points.  It seems to me that if the amendment is carried it will give a little extra work to the solicitor profession, but I do not see what other good it will do.  What will happen is that instead of making application to a police superintendent the applicant will apply to the District Justice, and, if he is refused a certificate, he will then appeal to the Circuit Judge.  It seems to me that the present machinery imposes no undue burden, and it gives no opportunity to the police of bullying. Everyone knows that the District Justice will not be afraid, if he thinks that a superintendent has done wrong. <Col N="473" /> to reverse him and to grant a certificate if he thinks that the superintendent has refused the certificate on unsatisfactory grounds.  I think that the real objection to the amendment is that it throws an unnecessary expense on a certain section of the public.  I do not see any reason why they should have that expense thrown on them unless there are really good grounds for it.  I do not regard the Deputy's far-fetched constitutional points as counting for anything.</P>

      <P>I would not like to accept the suggestion of Deputy Little that everybody in the service of the State who acts in a judicial way, except a judge, is really violating the Constitution.  That would appear to be the conclusion to be drawn from Deputy Little's argument, but it would make administration impossible.  Every executive officer and every higher administrative officer in the Service acts in a judicial capacity in one form or another every day.  Lawyers may attach a special meaning which the ordinary man does not attach to the word &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; or to the exercising of judicial functions in ordinary administration. Surely Deputy Little knows that the higher officers in the various Departments must exercise these functions every day in making decisions as to what should be done in this, that and the other case.  I think if you were to follow that argument to its logical conclusion you would have to take a great many other powers out of the <Col N="474" /> hands of the superintendent of the Guards.  Is the superintendent of the Guards who makes up his mind to oppose, say, the granting of a licence to a club or to an ordinary publican acting in a judicial capacity, or if he makes up his mind that he will not oppose it, is he acting in a judicial capacity?</P>
      <P>I take it that if there is a question of the granting of a licence to a club or to an ordinary publican to be decided the police will decide whether or not they will oppose the application. In doing that the superintendent of the police for that particular purpose is acting in a judicial capacity.  The same argument applies in the case of a gun licence.  A man will apply for a gun licence and the superintendent may say: &ldquo;This is not a proper person to have a gun licence.&rdquo;  Of course, he has another remedy if he has a right to carry a gun, just the same as the bookmaker has in this case, but we would be going very far indeed if we accepted the suggestion of Deputy Little that all officers exercising a judicial capacity should be judges and only judges.  I think it would make administration impossible if that were so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that there is a considerable volume of opinion in favour of the amendment and that a considerable number of witnesses who appeared before the Joint Committee on the Betting Act were in favour of the procedure outlined in the amendment.  It is not an extraordinary procedure at all.  The same procedure is adopted in relation to publicans' licences and also in the case of licences for dance halls.  My impression is that even the bookmakers themselves are not opposed to the procedure contemplated by Deputy Little's amendment.  I have not heard anything justifying the new procedure first established under the Act of 1926, which I do not think is giving satisfaction to the bookmakers or to a number of the general public.  Why should the procedure be different in this case from that which appertains to liquor licences and dance hall licences? That is the case which the Minister has to meet.  That is, can he justify the departure which was made in the <Col N="475" /> 1926 Act from the procedure then in force in relation to similar things?  I do not know that there is the same feeling in regard to this amendment as we had in regard to the excise penalties, but there is too much of the Star Chamber procedure altogether. It would be much better that they should be held in open court, because, first of all, it would attract more public attention from the point of view of preserving the character of the applicant. It would be much better that bookmakers' associations themselves might have an opportunity of stating in open court the objections which they might possibly have to an applicant getting a licence and that others who might know something about a man's personal character might have an opportunity of appearing there.  It is an extraordinary thing, one of the things which struck me in the evidence heard by the Joint Committee on the Betting Act, that while responsible people were quite prepared to go into open court and state generally their objections to an applicant getting a licence, they very much disliked the idea of writing a letter which would possibly be a privileged or confidential communication to a superintendent of the Civic Guards making these objections. They felt it carried with it the suggestion that they were acting as informers. The Minister says &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but I was on the Committee, and every witness, that is, those who might be taken as representing general public opinion, was strongly of opinion that it would be much better if these applications were made before the District Justice, and if he had discretion to grant or refuse licences, rather than the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no parallel to the certificate of personal fitness and the present machinery seems to me to be quite satisfactory.  I do not pay any great attention to the statement that people would come into open court and would not lodge objections with the superintendent.  Persons who have experience of the work of administration do not find that there are people who will rush into open <Col N="476" /> court in that way.  The amendment would simply throw business on the District Court when there is no need for it, business which is not of a character for the District Court.  It would also throw business on the Circuit Court which should not go there.  It is a minor type of business and I really do not see any reason why the superintendent of the Civic Guards should not have this power.  I do not see why the procedure should be changed unless there is some good reason for it.</P>

      <P>The way in which an unfair influence is brought to bear by having this power in the hands of the superintendent of the Gárda is this: A man makes an application for a licence and the superintendent refuses. He then goes to the District Court and gets the superintendent's refusal reversed and starts to conduct his business.  An unfair discrimination is made against that man afterwards in the carrying out of the law.  He may be raided.  We have had examples of people being raided for certain offences while other people guilty of the same offences were not interfered with.  It prejudices that particular applicant in the eyes of the superintendent that he has succeeded in reversing the superintendent's refusal on going to the District Justice.  The object of the amendment is to make the law analogous to that in the case of applications for liquor licences or dancing licences.  That is, it is made a matter of judicial decision.  In answer to Deputy O'Connell, I would like to point out that the making of a decision is not necessarily a judicial decision.  If a superintendent decides to oppose an application for a liquor or dancing licence in court the fate of that application will be decided by a Justice after he has heard all sides of the case. He has authority to make a final decision between the parties.  That is very different from the decisions made by an officer when he is making up his mind to take a particular line of action.  In this case the District Justice hears all the evidence and he comes to a judicial decision as between the parties.  I do not want to do anything <Col N="477" /> that is not done in principle already under the liquor or dancing laws.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Little's fears as to the position in which a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána would be placed in connection with these matters are unfounded, because if the amendment were carried, presumably in the ordinary way some person must be in the position of opposing the application of a person who is unsuitable to obtain either a certificate of personal fitness or a certificate of suitability of premises as the case may be.  The person who, in the ordinary course, would be placed in the position of having to oppose an application if, in the first instance, it was brought before a Justice of the District Court, would be the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, so that if we say that the application were brought before the <Col N="478" /> Justice and he refused to uphold the opposition offered by the superintendent, and that an appeal were brought to the Circuit Court from the decision of the District Justice, the very same results would flow as, the Deputy fears, flow from the present procedure.  The present procedure, so far as I have had experience of it, works extremely well.  In any case, where a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána saw fit to refuse a certificate of personal fitness the person aggrieved had the right to go before a Justice of the District Court.  His doing so did not really bring an end to his remedies in the matter, because if the Justice saw fit, and if any question of law is involved, he has the power, a power which has been resorted to in the past, to state a case for the decision of the High Court on a question of law and fact.</P>

    <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>(1)  Any person (other than a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons) who is ordinarily resident outside Saorstát Eireann and desires to obtain a bookmaker's licence may, after publishing the notice hereinafter mentioned, apply in the prescribed manner and form to the Minister for Justice for a certificate (included in the references in this Act to a certificate of personal fitness) that he is a fit and proper person to hold a bookmaker's licence.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 48, after the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;in Ireland but.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment enables a certificate of personal fitness to be issued to a person who is resident outside Saorstát Eireann.  The amendment is to this effect, that the certificate might be issued to a person who is outside Saorstát Eireann but who is a resident in Ireland.  In other words, I think it would meet the Minister's real object, which is to provide for certain cases of persons living in the Six Counties who come in from time to time and act as bookmakers at race meetings.  It does not deal with premises, but with persons who go on the course.  I think it would cover all the cases that the Minister wants to deal with, and, at the same time, prevent the objectionable practice arising of bookmakers coming from across the water to get licences to go on racecourses in Ireland. I would like to know if the Minister is willing to accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>There is not a great deal in it.  In the past a certain number of English bookmakers of good standing came over, and I have been led to understand that their exclusion was a definite loss to the ring, as it is called here.  Moreover, there is this position, that Irish bookmakers can and do bet in Great Britain.  I do not think, if we pass Deputy Little's amendment, that they would be excluded, or that any steps would be taken to exclude them.  Nevertheless, I cannot see any objection to allowing reputable English bookmakers come in here under present circumstances, and consequently I think it would be better to let the section stand.  It is true that we are mostly aiming at admitting certain Northern Ireland bookmakers. I do not see any good reason for confining it to them.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 51, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;District Justice for the Dublin Metropolitan District,&rdquo; and in sub-section (3), line 62, to delete the words &ldquo;the Minister for Justice may in his absolute&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the District Justice for the Dublin Metropolitan District may in his.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has taken up the attitude he has about No. 11 I think it is all the more reason why the question of deciding the character of this person should be done publicly and by a judge, because it should not be in the hands of a Minister.  If some extremely influential person comes to the Minister for this licence, or this certificate, he is always open to the charge of political influence, and it is a very serious matter to leave in the hands of the Minister.  It is really a matter which should be decided by some authority publicly and in a judicial capacity as to whether this person coming into Saorstát Eireann should be entitled to such a certificate. It is really more serious than the last amendment, and I will move it.  I think the Minister should consider carefully the accepting of it and allowing this matter to be decided by the District Justice of the Dublin Metropolitan District rather than by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a kind of case most unsuitable to be dealt with by the District Justice of the Dublin Metropolitan District.  Of course a man might not have any intention of carrying on any business in the Dublin metropolitan district.  I cannot see any reason then in dealing with a foreigner who is being given a privilege subject to his complying with certain conditions.  It is really more satisfactory to have that dealt with administratively than by some form of judicial procedure.  I can imagine cases where it might be difficult to have any idea in advance of what line <Col N="484" /> the courts might take.  The court might take the line if something could not be proved against a man that he ought to get it.  To be dealt with administratively only people of high standing would be admitted.  If you left it to the court you might either have the Justice taking the view that he would demand certain proofs which would be impossible to give, or he might admit everybody.  Everything would depend on his particular view of the matter.</P>
      <P>I think because we cannot really control these in the precise way we can control people resident here that the matter should be dealt with by the Department of Justice along certain lines which, when the matter comes to be worked out, can be explained to the Dáil if necessary, or embodied in some sort of document, but I think it should be possible to keep the things tighter by dealing with them administratively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the Minister's point of view in this matter, because, first of all, there may be a considerable number of bookmakers with whom these people would be competing for business who may object to their getting a certificate.  They may possibly, on publication of the notice provided for under sub-section (2), give notice to the Minister that they object to the application being granted, and nevertheless they are not able to substantiate that objection before any tribunal.  If the Minister overrides their objection they are not able to carry the matter further.  The final decision rests with him, and he makes that decision in secret.  That is, I think, a very objectionable feature. After all, a number of people may apply for these licences which may be granted to them.  They are all resident outside this country.  I am speaking entirely impersonally in the matter. We may know nothing about them.  They may be objectionable people to whom attention would be directed if they had to make application in open court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the manner in which these notices are published, <Col N="485" /> and very few people advert to them.  I wonder how many people read the notices which a bookmaker publishes when he is applying for a licence.  Fewer people even would take notice than in these cases of people who are living in their own locality and with whom they were acquainted. I think the procedure should not be purely administrative, but that application should be made in the court and that an opportunity should be afforded to people who might object to come into open court and prove their objection and have the case decided there once for all.  After all, once these licences are granted they are to remain valid until they are removed for some offence under the Act. Therefore, since the number of applications necessarily are going to be small, since they are only to be made once, it would not cause an undue burden on the court to sit and hear applications of this kind and adjudicate upon them.</P>

He can only be refused the renewal if he does not pay his debts. He may go a whole year without paying <Col N="486" /> his debts, and the only remedy people have is that at the end of twelve months he will not get a renewal.</P>

How will the Minister be able to deal with him if he commits an offence and goes abroad?  The Revenue Commissioners cannot look him up if he is across Channel.  In the interests of getting the most desirable class of bookmaker there should be proper and rigid control; at least we should have some assurance that the man is a bookmaker by profession on the other side.  That should be stipulated in the Bill.  Secondly, there should be some special regulations dealing with him, because he might defraud the public and also the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>Section ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>A superintendent of the Gárda Síochána may refuse an application for a certificate of personal fitness on any one or more of the following grounds and on no other ground whatsoever, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that at the time of the application for the certificate arrears of any duty for the time being payable <Col N="491" /> on or in respect of bets are due and owing by the applicant;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the applicant had been previously convicted of a crime or of an offence under this Act or under the Betting Act, 1926, or of an offence in relation to the duty on bets or has since the commencement of the Betting Act, 1926, been convicted of an offence under any Act relating to gaming or gaming houses;</P>
    <P>(c)  that a bookmaker's licence held by the applicant under this Act or the Betting Act, 1926, was revoked;</P>
    <P>(d)  that a previous refusal by a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána to give a certificate of personal fitness under this Act or under the Betting Act, 1926, had been confirmed on appeal to the District Court;</P>
    <P>(e)  that the applicant is by reason of his general character or his known habits not a fit person to hold a bookmaker's licence;</P>
    <P>(f)  that the financial circumstances of the applicant are not such as to render him a fit person to hold a bookmaker's licence;</P>
    <P>(g)  in the case of an applicant who had previously held a bookmaker's licence under this Act or the Betting Act, 1926, that he had without reasonable cause failed or refused to pay sums payable to persons who had won bets made with him;</P>
    <P>(h)  that the applicant had ordinarily resided in Saorstát Eireann for less than twelve months before making the application;</P>
    <P>(i)  that, in the case of an applicant who previously held a bookmaker's licence under this Act or the Betting Act, 1926, the business of bookmaking had been conducted by him in a disorderly manner or in such a manner as to cause or encourage persons to congregate and oiter in or outside the premises where such business was conducted;</P>
    <P>(j)  that the applicant is acting as <Col N="492" /> agent for a person whose application would be refused on one or other of the grounds set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 13, at the end of paragraph (b), to add the words &ldquo;or been convicted of an offence under the Street Betting Act, 1906, or in relation to the advertisement of betting whether under the Betting Act, 1874, or the Betting and Loans (Infants) Act, 1892; or the Ready Money Football Betting Act, 1920.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am anxious, by means of this amendment, to learn from the Minister what is the policy of the Bill with regard to advertisements.  Certain sections of the Bill prevent a bookmaker from advertising on his premises or putting out anything which would be an attraction, or anything, I suppose, which would constitute an advertisement. It is very difficult, however, to know what is the policy of the Bill, because at the end the Bill repeals the Ready Money Football Betting Act, which is purely an advertising Act&mdash;an Act preventing the making of bets through advertisements or coupons. That Act has been ignored for some time.  There has been a considerable amount of duty paid and recognised as payable upon transactions of this sort carried out upon coupons.  There have been recognised abuses of the law in the past, and the law in this matter has been administered in a partial manner.  Some people have been raided because they have a particular political point of view, while others were not interfered with.  I should like to know the Minister's attitude generally with regard to allowing any sort of advertisement under the Bill, or whether the Bill deals with it in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection on the Report Stage to put in a slight modification of this amendment, providing that where there was more than one conviction under the Ready Money Football Betting Act that should be ground for objection.  The reason I would like it altered in that way is because after the Betting <Col N="493" /> Act was passed many bookmakers genuinely believed that all kinds of betting on football was legalised, and, in fact, so did certain people in official circles.  It was only after the point had been raised that it was ascertained definitely that this particular Act was still in operation and that it was not legalised.  The question of whether that Act should be retained in operation can be decided later on on this Bill.  Meantime, if the principle of this amendment were to be adopted it should be adopted with some modification. I would be quite willing to put that in on the Report Stage, with the modification I suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Act of 1874, which is to be read as one with the Act of 1853?  A good deal of the Act of 1853 is gone because, of course, the houses are now licensed.  At the same time, the Act of 1874 prevents advertisements, and yet you do see occasionally bookmakers' advertisements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To add to paragraph (e), line 22, the words&mdash;&ldquo;and in the case of an application for a bookmaker's licence by a person, who has not previously held a licence, that such applicant has not furnished as a reference either the names of two house owners or that a recognised Bookmakers' Association has not vouched on his behalf.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister has given any thought to what is underlying this amendment.  I am anxious to be assured that where a man who has never held a licence before applies he cannot be judged on the basis underlying the whole of this Bill.  I should like the Minister to consider that aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, a person must first have the signature of two Peace Commissioners.  Therefore there <Col N="494" /> is no reason to add two householders to that.  Then, as far as recognised bookmakers' associations are concerned, I do not know yet whether we wish to give any sort of statutory or official status to the bookmakers' associations.  Generally I think this amendment is unnecessary, because at present a person must have the certificates of two Peace Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose was to make sure that if a person of some respectability applied he would not be turned down.  If the Minister is satisfied with two Peace Commissioners that would meet the point.  I am not anxious to press the point about the associations, except to say that now that betting has been legalised the bookmakers' associations are interested in seeing that the members will conform to the regulations and they would have some knowledge as to the fitness of applicants.  While it may not be advisable from one point of view to recognise the associations as statutory bodies, the Minister might consider giving them some say in the matter of an application for a licence.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (i), line 38, before the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;permit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object is to tighten up the clause a little so as to throw the onus of proof on the bookmaker that he has not permitted persons to congregate or loiter in or outside his premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that it would be very hard if we put in the word &ldquo;permit&rdquo; with reference to loitering outside the premises, because the bookmaker really would not have any power to prevent loitering outside. If he caused or encouraged persons to loiter outside, that is provided for in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of paragraph (j), line 44, to add the words &ldquo;or for a person with no licence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think this fills a gap which requires to be filled up here.  It really is to add at the end of sub-clause (j) if the applicant is acting as agent for a person whose application would be refused on several grounds set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), and to add as a further ground &ldquo;or for a person with no licence.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I believe under Section (e) that would be covered.  If a person acted for a non-licensed bookmaker he would be objected to on the ground of (e), and that would be amply covered.  Sub-section (j) is to cover a different class of case, where a person would not get a licence himself and puts up a dummy to get a licence but where he would be the real proprietor and perhaps nominally a clerk.</P>

      <P>I think it would be quite unfair to penalise a citizen, and that because he is of another business he must be prevented from becoming a licensed bookmaker.  We have a number of people in one business carrying on another business.  I do not think that such a penalty should be put upon a decent citizen simply because he is in another form of business. If the Dáil accepts that principle it will have eventually to cover a great deal more ground and to rope in a number of other people who have licences and who at the same time carry on other business in a proper manner.  I do not think the Minister should accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little has not spoken on this, and I do not know what his views are, but what appealed to me was this: If you have licensed moneylenders also carrying on betting business it might occur that they would encourage persons to go into debt for the purpose of betting, and you might have people going a good deal further in the way of getting themselves into financial difficulties than they would if they were not dealing with people in a double business. If there was any great objection by the House to it I would not stand over it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this whole matter of the premises will have to be further considered.  One of the things we were most anxious to do was to prevent the position arising where value would attach to the premises by reason of having a betting licence attached to them.  If you want to deal with a house having a licence for the sale of liquor one knows how difficult it is to get a conviction for an offence, because it is said that you are destroying property.  When we first brought in the licensing of betting houses we did not know whether this would be allowed permanently.  We thought we might have to abolish licences.  We do not want property to rise in connection with betting licences, and I want nothing to be done now which would seem to equate the premises licensed for betting with premises licensed for the sale of liquor, or to do anything that would give an idea that there was a property in bookmakers' licences. One of the ways in which we could keep down the number of shops is to have some increase on a graduated scale of tax.  There are districts in which there are too many betting houses.  That would be the better way to keep down the number.  I would not like to deal with the problem of keeping down the number by treating it in the same way as ordinary licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill in another part meets this difficulty, because it extinguishes licences of bookmakers when anything happens to the person.  When a person parts with the premises the licence is extinguished and any other person who comes along must get a fresh licence, so that in that way the value attaches not to the premises but to the person.</P>

    <P>I would like to know whether the Minister thinks this is necessary or not. We want to prevent the premises connecting internally.  What is meant is that the shop should be structurally separate from the residence to prevent the younger members of the family from having to pass through the shop in order to go to the residence part. That would be an easy thing to do, and it would prevent people escaping in the event of a raid on the premises.  It would be better that the betting premises would be entirely self-contained and that it would not be possible for people to abscond by the back door with papers which the police may be looking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (f) to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that the annual rateable value where the premises are situated within the Dublin Metropolitan District is less than £15, or where the premises are situated elsewhere than within the Dublin Metropolitan District is less than £5.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment goes with the section relating to the annual valuation.  This supplies the machinery for getting the shop valued separately from the rest of the premises.  Its real aim is to try to prevent sheds and undesirable places in an unsanitary condition in slum areas&mdash;premises which are of no valuation&mdash;from being used for the purpose of betting shops. It would be to the detriment of the health of people going there, and this amendment will help to raise the status of the business as far as it is possible to do so.  I have fixed on a valuation of £15 because I find on looking up valuations in different streets&mdash; I do not mean the main traffic streets or other places where the valuation is <Col N="503" /> high&mdash;that £15 would be about the average valuation.  I rather think that £5 is high for a country town, and perhaps £3 would be sufficient there.  I suggest that this would have a very good effect and would ensure that the premises would be in a good condition and that the business would be carried on in a reputable manner.  I think that would be the result if some such standard of valuation as I suggest were fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not see very much objection to this proposal if we could find a suitable level.  I would not be prepared to say that the level the Deputy suggests is right.  The whole thing is being tightened up.  I do not know whether this is necessary, but it is one of the matters which I am looking into.  I would not be prepared to accept the amendment.  I would rather if the Deputy left it over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Little would be prepared to go a little further.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that it was the declared opinion of the majority of those on the Betting Committee that it was a desirable thing to make it as difficult as possible for a certain class of the population to spend money on betting that they could ill afford.  I suggest that Deputy Little should go the whole hog and raise the valuation in each case.  We are all agreed that a large amount of money is spent in betting that should not be so spent, and it is spent by a class of person who can least afford it. If Deputy Little is sincere in this matter he should go the whole hog when he is discussing it with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other sections which serve the purpose the Deputy has in mind.  There are other sections in the Bill which deal with the desirability of premises.  I do not think that one could deal with the matter in the way the Deputy suggests.  It must be remembered that there are numbers of respectable persons, quite honest people, carrying on this business. They are not well enough off to take premises which would have a valuation of, say, £50, although I admit that <Col N="504" /> that would be an exclusive figure.  To raise the valuation would throw the whole business into the hands of one or two extremely rich persons, and I do not think that is the object of the Deputy on the Labour Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there are many of these premises in slum areas, and he must know that all this business is dangerous and bad for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but is it not clear that portion of this Bill relates to a residential area, a place where workers reside?  Unfortunately, a great many of the workers reside in the slums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the Deputy is therefore anxious to afford facilities for betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer Deputy Anthony to paragraph (c) of Section 11.  If he reads the Bill he will see that one of the grounds for refusing a licence because of unsuitability of premises is that the premises are situated where large numbers of persons congregate, or that they are situated in a residental area.  I take that to mean a slum; otherwise I was going to move an amendment somewhat on the lines of Deputy Anthony's remarks. I do not take a residential area to mean a place like Merrion Square; I rather think it means the place where the poor people or the workers reside.  The place where they reside, to my mind, is the residential area set out in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Anthony's point is met by the terms of Deputy Little's amendment.  I do not know of any slum area where, in the case of a shop and dwelling-house, the shop alone would be valued at £15.  I think it is essential, in order to set up a premises for betting, that it should be on a main thoroughfare.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the premises are not fronting on a public thoroughfare and are not structurally separated from any other premises.</P>
      <P>This amendment, if carried, would deal with very small streets which might be in slum areas.  If the premises were in such small streets they would not be suitable as premises to be licensed.  The same would apply to premises in a cul-de-sac.</P>

      <P>I agree that premises must be structurally separated, but whether we should insist on them being in a public thoroughfare is a matter about which I am not so sure. For instance, premises in a slum street might be fronting on a public thoroughfare. I do not know that much would be effected by this.  People have complained that betting offices were on public streets and were temptations to people to bet.  There may be something in that.  I have seen notices at the end of a lane indicating that there are betting offices at the far end.  I do not know if they are proper offices, or if it would be better in the interests of the public to force them to come out and put up notices in the street.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The registered proprietor shall not allow newspapers containing lists of horses nor other lists of horses to be displayed in such premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was not quite clear whether Section 19 actually dealt with newspapers containing lists of horses, because higher up in the Bill there is a prohibition regarding any lists or statements, but it seemed to me that it was not sufficiently complete, so I put down this amendment as a further precaution in order to make sure that the proprietor shall not allow newspapers containing a list of horses or other lists to be displayed inside his premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the other section nothing can be displayed inside which can be seen from the street, and if there is a newspaper inside it can be seen only by a person who has gone inside the premises for the purpose of <Col N="510" /> betting.  I have not much experience in the matter, but I can conceive a person making a mistake if he has not a newspaper in front of him.  When I go to vote in a proportional representation election, for instance, I would probably be in great difficulty if I had not the party list in my pocket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The person coming in to bet must have his party list with him. One of the causes of loitering is the display of newspapers which those inside consult before making their bets. It is only when they go in and see the newspapers that they make up their minds as to what horses they will back.  I think that the bookmaking community would welcome this amendment, as it makes it easier for them to keep their premises clear of loiterers.  It is clear that the intention of the Bill was not to prevent these lists or newspapers being in the shop.</P>

      <P>It does not always happen as Deputy Anthony states.  If the Minister wants to get the behaviour in these premises that he desires he will not allow these newspapers to be exhibited.  The ordinary man entering a betting shop buys one paper, but he would not be satisfied with one paper in the betting shop.  These bookmakers have been forced to pin up in their places a whole series of newspapers.  A man perhaps sees a poster of a newspaper stating &ldquo;we gave seven winners yesterday.&rdquo;  He immediately wants to see what are the seven selections for to-day.  If you want to do away with loitering on the premises bookmakers will not object to removing these newspapers off the notice board.  They give the selections of the various tipsters.  Deputy Anthony is quite right in talking about a poor wretch looking at his paper, but at the same time some bookmakers have made a regular practice of hanging up all the racing papers&mdash;the &ldquo;Racing Chronicle,&rdquo; and the racing news of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  People look at these papers and they tempt them to bet.</P>

I understand <Col N="512" /> that there are a number of betting shops in country districts.  People in the country are much more occupied than in the city, and they do not spend a considerable amount of time in reading newspapers.  They may occasionally desire to put on a bet, and surely when they go into the office of the bookmaker they are entitled to ask: &ldquo;Have you a newspaper until I look up the runners?&rdquo;  If we accept this amendment we are inflicting a hardship on people living outside the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 2, to delete the word &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;twenty-one.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has for its object the raising of the age from 18 to 21 on the ground that it is an internationally recognised age.  In Monte Carlo the age fixed is 21 and not 18.  As one anxious to prevent young people going into betting shops, I hope this amendment will be accepted.  It does not prohibit them from actually betting, because somebody else can place a bet for them, but it does keep them away from the atmosphere of these betting shops.</P>

      <P>I am always afraid of raising the age too high and of making the law difficult to enforce, because generally it does not carry the support of everybody concerned.  I think we ought to carry it as far as it can be done.  There have been varying opinions as to the age.  Certain witnesses were willing to allow betting up from sixteen because that is the age in the Children Act, but I think the age of 18 is as high as we would have real support for.  It is as high an age as we would have the full support of public opinion for the enforcement of. It is always bad to go too far in these matters, because everybody tries to take an easy view of the thing if you make the law too extreme.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to fix an age at which you can enforce the law, but still I am inclined to think that as between the ages of 18 and 21 it is just as easy to enforce it up to 21 as it is up to 18.  After all, that is the age at which people get the vote. Generally speaking, there is supposed to be a legal distinction after a person has reached the age of twenty-one which was not there before.</P>

      <P>Betting has, unfortunately, increased so much in the city that I think we ought to do something to make it a little harder for young people.  Many cases have come to my knowledge in which young people about the ages of eighteen and twenty-one have been indulging in betting.  We have seen many cases reported in which young people have been charged with stealing and embezzlement.  The explanation given in almost all cases was that these young people had taken to betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to impose a penalty upon a bookmaker for having betting transactions with a person aged nineteen or twenty, a person who has misinformed him as to his or her age, then I think that is unfair. If you are to put an additional restriction of that kind upon the bookmaker I think you are going to keep him sitting up all night thinking out how he is going to carry on his business.  This Bill proposes that it is the person who takes the bet and not the one who makes it will be made liable.  I think you are putting too much responsibility on the shoulders of the bookmaker. How is the bookmaker to judge whether a person is eighteen or not? In regard to more serious matters the law only gives protection up to the age of eighteen.  I cannot see why, in regard <Col N="515" /> to the minor offence of betting&mdash; if it can be called an offence at all&mdash; the age should be put up to twenty-one. Even if the age is fixed at eighteen, that is not going to keep people who want to bet from betting. They can get some other people to put on the bets for them.  I am afraid you are not going to reform the morals of people by a regulation of this sort.  I think the age of eighteen is sufficiently high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy Alton.  I also think that the point of view put forward by Deputy Briscoe is well worth considering.  I am of opinion that the age of eighteen should be allowed to stand.  When we inquired into this matter we found that even schoolboys at the age of fourteen were betting.  We all know the demoralising effect all this must have on young people.  We found that schoolboys gathered their pennies and their twopences together in order that they could gamble.  We also found that a number of persons in or about the age of eighteen were engaged in bookmakers' offices where bets were put on. In many cases they were engaged in the collection of bets, and we felt it would be wrong to inflict an injustice on that particular class of the community. This is a matter that should be considered by Deputies without regard to Party affiliations.  It is a great evil&mdash;a canker that is eating into the heart of the whole community.  In my opinion it is a thousand times worse than ever the drink evil was, and that it has done a tremendous lot to demoralise the whole country.  I am not a pious person, but I feel strongly on this, and I agree that this is a great evil.  Of course the popular thing would be to be on the side of the angels, but I have the habit usually of not being found on that side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should not be pressed to alter the age from eighteen to twenty-one.  The age suggested in the Bill meets, I think, the views of those who acted on the Committee to consider this matter.  They had the advantage of examining a great number of witnesses such as <Col N="516" /> bookmakers and their clerks, and representatives of all the Churches. When the age of eighteen was suggested I do not think there was one dissentient.  I suggest to Deputy Little that he should withdraw his amendment and leave the age at eighteen.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Briscoe, my sympathy is altogether with the young people.  I have no sympathy with the bookmaker obliged to sit up all night, as the Deputy said. In my opinion we have made betting too easy already.  I think it is better that it should have been legalised than have it carried on as it was before, but at the same time I do not think we should make it too easy for people. You cannot walk along the streets to-day without seeing how betting is encouraged.  It is spreading amongst every class and every age.</P>

      <P>What weighed with me in the matter is the fact that boys, when they come to 21, are earning a little money.  It is more a town problem than a country problem.  At that age boys have more money and more freedom.  Their habits are unformed between 18 and 21.  They get in with people who are interested in betting and go to these shops.  There is nothing in public life to tell them that that is a thing they should avoid.  If they are addicted to betting they can get some one else to do it for them. Nothing is going to prevent them doing so, but we should establish a standard and make a beginning in the interests of those who are learning to use their freedom, so that they might be kept from developing the habit of betting.  I think there is nothing so important as the training of youth and <Col N="517" /> character, especially at a formative age.</P>

      <P>This is a matter upon which everyone is going to have a personal opinion.  I do not think the arguments in favour of one age or another will carry very much conviction with our opponents.  For practical reasons I feel that 18 is about as high a limit as you could have.  What struck me most in Deputy Little's speech was the fact that whether the age was 18 or 21, those who want to bet will be able to do so by getting someone else to act as messenger.  In view of that I do not see that there is much of a case for fixing the age limit below 18.  I suppose that 18 marks a fairly definite stage in a boy's career.  Most boys are thrown on the world at that age and they have to make their way in life. Even though they are not nominally regarded as fully-fledged men, nevertheless, as far as maintenance is concerned, they have then to fight their own battles.  I do not think there is <Col N="518" /> much to be gained by hedging them around with a great many restrictions which would meet with the support of public opinion, and which is the only thing that counts.  I do not know whether public opinion would enable the age to be made 21, or whether in every-day life it would be practicable to enforce that age.  In view of that I think 18 is as high as we can go.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that a great many of the workers in factories and restaurants are between 18 and 21 years of age.  If the age is raised the Bill would be setting up a new type of individual, a kind of commission agent, to collect the bets for the bookmaker while the bookmaker himself would be free.  As it is I think you will have that state of affairs arising, where an outsider will act as agent and will collect the bets while the bookmaker will be free from committing an offence.</P>

    <P>(2)  Any officer of customs and excise or any member of the Gárda Síochána may at any time enter any premises (not being registered premises) in which the business of bookmaking is being carried on, or in which such officer or member of the Gárda Síochána suspects that such business is being carried on, and may there make such searches and investigations as such officer or member shall think proper and may demand of any person found in such premises his name and address and may ask of any such person such questions in relation to such premises and the business carried on therein as such officer or member shall think proper.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with the power of entry and investigation. Under the former law the police had always to get a warrant to raid premises.  Under the present law they do not require a warrant to raid premises which are licensed premises. It is undesirable that the police should be given power to raid premises other than licensed premises without a warrant of some sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not mean publicity for a policeman to get a warrant.  It only means that he applies in the District Court, gets his warrant as a matter of course, and then goes and raids the premises.  In almost all other kinds of legislation of a semi-political nature a warrant is required, and I think in this case it is very undesirable that police should have the power of raiding <Col N="521" /> premises which may have nothing whatever to do with betting business without a warrant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It would make the detection of offences almost impossible. There might be cases down the country where it would take a day before people would find a District Justice and get a warrant, and the evidence would be gone.  There is no sort of offence in which it is more difficult to get a conviction than betting offences, where it concerns the altering of documents or the preparing of faked documents and destroying the originals, and it must be possible to raid as soon as suspicion is aroused.  It is even more necessary than in other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister addressing himself to sub-section (2)? I presume the offence that section is designed to guard against is a continued practice of making a book on unregistered premises.  It is only in relation to premises which are not registered that the warrant is requested. In that case, there would be time for the officer to get the warrant from the District Justice.  It would only be a warrant to raid the premises where he suspected betting was carried on.  Normally that would mean that it was carried on over a period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very great difficulty.  The stuff may not be on the premises, and it is moved to and fro. There are extraordinary difficulties in connection with these.  For the moment I thought the amendment was referring to licensed premises.  There is the likelihood with the restrictions put on licensed premises that there will be more unlicensed bookmakers' premises than there have been.  Up to the present, when there was less difficulty in getting licences and less restriction on the premises there was not the temptation that might be anticipated to carry on unlicensed betting, but I believe there is likely to be more danger in the future, and unless you have speedy action you might have much of the old difficulties of the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers under the sub-section are very general and virtually give the Gárda or revenue officers power to enter any premises merely on the plea that they believe they are being used for the purpose of carrying on the business of bookmaking. It gives such wide powers of entry that I do not think the House should assent to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the powers of entry before, and I do not know that any abuse has arisen in connection with them.  Shebeening is very easy to detect as compared with bookmaking offences.  It is far more difficult to hide a quantity of stuff.  In the other class of cases often detection has to be made by special officers, and there are all sorts of difficulties. In many of these cases nothing can be done by a local officer, and there are all sorts of difficulties connected with any delay.  You would not have any delay in Dublin, because you could find a District Justice easily. But in a country place it might be a different matter, and there must be prompt action.  While I do not promise to agree with the Deputy, I am prepared to examine the point again with reference to our experience during the past few years.  I have grounds for thinking that there is greater danger of having unregistered bookmaking in the future than there has been in the past, and that will increase every time we tighten up the law with regard to registered premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in districts where District Justices are not easily available or where it is not easy to get a warrant, it is just as likely that the number of people engaged in betting would be very limited and that there <Col N="523" /> would be very little attraction for a bookmaker to carry on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In practically every big country town you have a licensed bookmaker. The principle involved is too serious to be bartered away for the benefit of the Revenue Commissioners and I feel that we will have to press this amendment.  The Minister also stated that as compared with shebeening, on the one hand, and bookmaking, on the other, the greater evil was that of the bookmaker.  I contend that if the House were to decide it that they would come to the conclusion that the effects of shebeening are a far greater evil than those of the man making a book illicitly.  The Minister admits that in the metropolitan area he does not have that excuse.  I think he should be inclined to sacrifice the little outlying districts in the interests of maintaining a big principle.  Anybody's house could be entered or examined on the grounds that it was suspected that the person was using it as a bookmaker.  A person might ring a bookmaker on the 'phone and put on a bet.  Somebody might overhear the conversation, and the Gárda would have the right to enter because of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. Hennessy Mr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was prepared to examine this particular section before the next stage of the Bill.  I do not think the House ought to give such wide powers either to the Revenue Commissioners or the Gárda Síochána as are proposed under this Bill.  It is quite possible that any Deputy in the House, even the Minister himself, might be in the company of a bookmaker and probably that evening find the Revenue Commissioners raiding his house.  I do not think the Revenue Commissioners have sufficient evidence to warrant a provision of this nature. If there has been such abuse of this Act as to warrant it, I would be prepared to accept it, but I would be very much surprised to hear it.  There may be one or two abuses, but that is no reason why we should penalise the community.  These are extraordinary <Col N="524" /> powers, and I would like the Minister to examine them before the Report Stage, and provide that either the Revenue Commissioners or the Gárda Síochána, on entering a private house, would be provided with a warrant.</P>

      <P>Having heard the Minister, I do not think these powers are necessary at all.  As he has indicated, for the detection of certain offences under the Act it will be necessary, in the case of the smaller towns, to bring down a special officer.  Did I understand the Minister to say that?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in connection with that, I do not think that the Minister has succeeded in making a case.  He has admitted that the difficulty of procuring a warrant is confined almost entirely to towns other than boroughs and county boroughs, but in those towns there will be one or two licensed bookmakers, and, therefore, the opportunities for carrying on a business as unlicensed bookmaker with profit will be decidedly limited. I suggest that they could be further limited if the Minister would inflict a penalty on people found on those houses.  So far as I see, there is nothing in this section that makes it an offence to be found on premises conducting the business of an unlicensed bookmaker.  If it were made an offence there would be no inducement for any person whatsoever to enter the premises of an unlicensed bookmaker for the purpose of making a bet. Therefore, there would be no inducement to any person to set up the business of an unlicensed bookmaker, and there would be no necessity for the powers which the Minister seeks in this sub-section.  I cannot see what would call for the prompt action which the Minister considers is justified, and the <Col N="525" /> only justification for these extraordinary powers.  In view of that, I think that the Minister ought seriously to consider whether he cannot withdraw his sub-section or insert the safeguard that we ask, that the Revenue Commissioners can only enter a premises under the warrant of a District Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider the section, to see if there are any safeguards that could be introduced if they are necessary.  I think there has been no suggestion of any abuse at all.  I have not heard the slightest suggestion of one, and I do not think there is any likelihood of an abuse.  But, leaving that aside for the moment, I am prepared to consider whether there are any restrictions or safeguards that we could introduce that would enable detections to be made and that would prevent the bare possibility of unjustified raids, and at the same time not make the detection in cases very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said that there would be no carrying on of unlicensed bookmaking in a country town where there are one or two licensed bookmakers. You may have somebody whose licence becomes disqualified and who does not readily turn to anything else.  He has not to pay any personal licence or any licence in respect of these premises, and he does not pay the 5 per cent. on the bets made with him.  Such a person may be able, in certain cases, to offer terms that would induce a certain number of people to bet with him. Apart altogether from the mere personal support he may get from old clients if he were still able to serve them, there is a very definite danger, and, as I say, a danger that increases with every tightening up of the procedure, that you will have people carrying on as unlicensed bookmakers. The detection of these is extremely difficult, and it is not a good thing to put any unnecessary difficulty in the way of enabling evidence to be got against them if they are carrying on this business.  It is for that reason that I do not want delays.  Perhaps we can find something that will provide some safeguard against the mere possibility of abuse, and at the same <Col N="526" /> time not occasion these delays.  I am willing to look at the whole thing with that object in view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's undertaking to reconsider the matter, I am willing to withdraw the amendment for the time being, with the power of reintroducing it on the Report Stage.  I would remind the Minister that it is a very important principle that people should not be in a position to be raided without some authority in the form of a warrant.  It is a principle that people have always been very careful about, and the whole law has been very careful to see that they are protected in that respect.  A warrant must be issued before the police can enter the private house of any individual.  As it stands at present, this drives the coach-and-four through that principle.</P>
      <P>Then, again, in any ordinary district in Ireland a policeman or excise man can easily get in touch with the District Justice with a motor car within an hour.  Certainly it would not take him more than two or three hours to get his warrant in any part of Ireland that I know of.  This thing is not going to happen in the wilds of Donegal or Connemara, but in the ordinary districts, where it is likely that you will have the type of case that the Minister has mentioned.  It is ten to one that the District Justice will be at hand within half an hour with a motor car.</P>

Is the Minister not prepared to make that person liable for the offence as well as the bookmaker?  Representations have been made to the Commissioners that in some cases where a penalty was imposed on bookmakers for a fraud on the Commissioners the fraud was actually committed by an employee, who himself benefited by it.  The bookmaker was made responsible unless he proceeded to swear an information against the employee.  The Minister may not have heard about that, but representations have been made to the Commissioners.  Will the Minister, therefore, not consider the imposition of penalties on the persons who are the managers of these branches?</P>

I do not know whether it would be right to carry out the suggestion of Deputy Briscoe, that is to say, without relieving the proprietor of responsibility to make the employee also responsible. The difficulty is that it might tend to lighten the responsibility of the proprietor and, as I say, enable him to escape conviction, and have the employee convicted, and used as a scapegoat.</P>

The bookmakers are anxious to get protection against the lackadaisical methods of some employees.  In the way I suggested you would not be releasing the proprietor from the full penalty, but, at the same time, you would be lessening the opportunities for the employees.</P>

He goes to the bookmaker's office and makes the bet.

      <P>The object of this amendment is simply to prevent what certainly happened on one occasion in reference to orders laid upon the Table of the House.  If orders are laid upon the Table of the House they are open to be dealt with within twenty-one sitting days.  That is the usual time; and if a motion is tabled in that time unless it is discussed under the present Standing Orders, it goes by the board. If there are several other motions before it in Private Members' time and it is not reached then the order comes into operation and the motion ceases to have effect.  So in order to prevent that occurring I drafted this particular form to deal with regulations laid upon the Table.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> I think it is a mistake to repeal the Ready Money Football Betting Act.  It is purely an advertisement Act, and I do not know whether it is the policy of the Government to allow this football betting to go on by advertising and the circulation of coupons.  The Minister already mentioned that he was going to reconsider a certain section where the Ready Money Football Betting Act is mentioned.  I suggest he should also take into consideration now that that Act does not deal directly with the ready money football betting, but with advertisements and circulars issued which make them illegal.  Perhaps the Minister would accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to be very familiar with this system of coupon betting, but as far as I can gather it is rather illogical.  You can bet on a football match, cash or credit, in a bookmaker's office, and the only thing prohibited is this particular system of betting on the result of a certain number of matches on a coupon. If a person writes out his own coupon and hands it in, it is all right.  It is only illegal if he takes a printed coupon and makes his bet on that.  The present position is illogical.  It does not prevent betting on football.  It creates an exception from the general principle that betting is really legal. I was approached very soon after the Betting Act was passed on this question, and suggestions were made that it should be amended.  I promised to consider that when amending legislation was before the House, but no suggestion is made that any harm would be done by repealing this Act, which really creates rather an anomalous position.</P>

      <P>A few months ago an organisation representing 89 per cent. of the regular officers serving in the Army and 79 per cent. of the retired officers declared that since 1924 over £14,000,000 has been voted for the defence purposes of Saorstát Eireann. That statement said: &ldquo;There is not, and there has never been, any considered policy with regard to the Army such as would be calculated to make an adequate return to the taxpayer for his money.&rdquo;  Further, this statement declared &ldquo;that it is doubtful whether it (the Army) is capable of acting in any circumstances as a useful instrument of national defence.&rdquo;  That summarises our criticism of the Army for many years.  We believe that the taxpayers of this country&mdash;of the Twenty-Six Counties of this country&mdash; are not getting an adequate return for the moneys that have been spent on the Army.  The incomes of the people who have to pay for the Army have gone down considerably in the last year, and yet the Estimates show that the expenditure on the Army has gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question of cash, we are not doubtful of &ldquo;whether the Army is capable of acting in any circumstances as a useful instrument of national defence.&rdquo;  We believe that it is not capable of being used as a useful instrument of national defence, seeing that it is dependent altogether for its supplies upon England.  We are wasting money on it.  Unfortunately also we are wasting the lives of a lot of young men who could be much more usefully employed.  The Army is providing a certain amount of employment for a large number of men.  But we believe that there is very much more useful work for them to do. Depending as they are upon England <Col N="537" /> for their supplies, it is a humiliating position for any officer in the Army, for anybody who has any sort of a national outlook, to be in that position, and we think that an end should be put to this system.  We have, on several occasions, appealed to the Minister for Defence to make some arrangements whereby the Army could be self-contained in the matter of munitions.  The Minister for Defence has never dealt with that, and we would like to know why he has not. Until he does, we believe that it is a waste of public money to spend one and a-half millions on the Army.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to touch on administrative matters that could be more properly raised on the Army Vote.  I do wish to say that the Minister and the Government are treating this House and the country generally in an extraordinary manner in regard to the Principal Act.  I quite remember the circumstances under which a great mass of Army law, under which the Army has been administered at present, was put through this House in 1922 or 1923.  The Act under which the Army is administered at the present time, and which we are asked to renew here once more for the seventh or eighth time, is a very comprehensive measure, consisting of several hundred sections.  Not one of these sections was ever debated in this House.  After all, this is the Parliament that is supposed to be responsible for these Army measures, and it is open to criticism for anything that may be faulty in the measure.  It is open to criticism for anything that is found to be faulty or deficient in any way in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several years past the Government spokesmen came along here to the House and said: &ldquo;We are not quite ready with the new Army Bill which we are to introduce.&rdquo;  That position has been abandoned by the present Minister.  He comes quite casually to the House and says: &ldquo;We want this Act renewed for another year,&rdquo; and gives no justification whatever for taking up that attitude.  I suggest that is not a right way to treat this House and to treat the country. The House should be given an opportunity of producing an Army Act in <Col N="538" /> circumstances different from 1922 or 1923 or whenever that voluminous Act was passed.  That Act was passed with a definite promise and a definite understanding given to the House that it was to be purely a temporary measure that would be examined and debated section by section inside a very short time.  That was the undertaking, promise, or pledge given to the House. It has never been redeemed, and I protest in the strongest way I possibly can protest against the cavalier manner in which the Government is treating the House and the country about Army legislation.</P>
    <P>I repeat that there was a distinct understanding and pledge given at the time this measure was put through which has never been redeemed.  The Minister has now got to this stage when he does not make any excuse for it.  I would not object if the Act were passed through this House and passed as an Act should be passed with all the consideration that should be given to it.  But that was not the case.  Then it is proposed to have it renewed each year in this fashion.  Under the present circumstances the method which has been adopted is worthy of the condemnation of the House, and as a protest I will vote against the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of those given utterance to by Deputy Aiken.  A statement appeared over the name of a number of ex-officers of the Army, including a Deputy of this House, which constituted a very severe criticism of the Government's policy in respect of the Army.  I think some attempt to reply to that criticism should be made by the Minister before the Dáil is asked to pass this Bill.  I am surprised that Deputy McKeon has not seen fit to take part in this discussion. I do not think he has usually been affected by cold feet, but his silence on this occasion would seem to indicate that he is not prepared to repeat here the statements for which he took responsibility in the Press. Those statements were of a serious nature.  Very serious allegations concerning the Government's administration of the Army were made, and Deputies would be negligent of their <Col N="539" /> duty if they did not take them into account, now that this particular opportunity for doing so is afforded them.  The queries to which I would like the Minister to give an answer&mdash; and they are taken from this document to which I have referred&mdash;are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There is not and has never been any considered policy with regard to the Army, such as would be calculated to make an adequate return to the taxpayer for his money.</P>
      <P>(2)  While the existing force is well disciplined and trained in an elementary fashion, its organisation and the system upon which it is administered are so defective that it is doubtful whether it is capable of acting in any circumstances as a useful instrument of National Defence.</P>
      <P>That is a statement endorsed in this House by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>(3)  No attempt has been made by the authorities to consider or put into operation any plan by which its effectiveness could be improved in the future.  On the contrary, there has been nothing but arbitrary and capricious dealing with every matter of importance as it arose.</P>
      <P>(4)  Large sums of public money have been spent on the professional and technical training of officers, numbers of whom are sent abroad from time to time for this purpose.  No practical steps have been taken to make proper use of the knowledge thus acquired.</P>
      <P>(5)  Considerable sums have been expended on the equipment of Special Corps by the provision of guns, aircraft, and other military material but no attempt has been made to coordinate the organisation and training of these Corps as elements of a properly organised Defence Force.</P>
      <P>(6)  Flagrantly illegal attempts have been made to interfere with the impartiality of Officers serving on courts-martial and bound by Oath to administer justice.</P>
      <P>(7)  The ordinary methods of preserving discipline observed in all Armies have been largely set aside and a series of petty restrictions have been imposed calculated only to create dissatisfaction and quite valueless from a disciplinary point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> These are definite criticisms of the Government's policy in relation to the administration of the Army.  They were published in a document issued by an organisation which said it could speak on behalf of 89 per cent. of the serving regular officers and 79 per cent. of the retired officers.  It is signed, amongst others, by three Deputies of this House, only one of whom is present. Deputy McKeon signed the document, which concludes with this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Executive Council is prepared to substantiate all or any of the foregoing statements in detail.</P>
    <P>I may say that Deputy McKeon was chairman at the time.  I want the Minister to tell us whether these officers were asked to do so, and whether they have done so.  I now ask Deputy McKeon if he has done so, or if he is prepared to do so.  I do not think the Dáil would be justified in passing this Bill in view of the fact that this document was published by this Association, and no reply to the criticisms of the Army contained in it has been published by the Government.  It is true that the immediate effect of the publication of the document appears to have been the winding-up of the Association, following a communication from the Minister for Defence that it was no longer approved of by him.  We are not concerned with that matter now, but we are concerned with the statement affecting the efficiency of the Army as a defence force, made upon excellent authority and that must be answered before the Dáil can be satisfied that that statement is without foundation.</P>

      <P>Deputies Aiken and Lemass have stated that a document was issued on behalf of an organisation representing 80 per cent. odd of officers in the Army and 79 per cent. odd of retired officers, or something like that. No statement representing any section of officers has been issued.  No statement was published on behalf of any Army organisation.  An unofficial document may be published over signatures, but that does not imply any agreement, beyond the signatories, with the document.  The statement <Col N="541" /> the Deputies referred to had no authority whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It was not made on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Officers' Association.  There is no such thing as an Executive Committee of that Association.  The Deputy seemed to think that the effect of the publication was to wind up that organisation, and he seemed to imply or to understand that it was wound up by my action. The Association was wound up without any action on my part.  It was wound up by the officers of the Army who had been members of that Association. The Deputy quoted this unofficial document about the organisation of the Army and so on.  Obviously, the people in a position to speak authoritatively about organisation in the Army and its discipline and so on are pre-eminently the members of the standing Army.  No member of the standing Army was associated with the document the Deputy refers to.</P>
      <P>The Deputy quoted a statement which seemed to imply that I had sought to defeat the ends of justice in the Army by interfering with courts-martial. That is a thing I have never done.  I have never, in any way, interfered with the procedure at a courtmartial.  I am not prepared to enter the lists with newspapers or otherwise in an argument on unofficial matters.  I am perfectly satisfied that the discipline, the organisation and the effectiveness of the Army have improved steadily from year to year. I am completely satisfied with the discipline of the Army, and I am completely satisfied with the general progress of the Army.  I think anybody who knows the details of the work of the Army will know that the statement the Deputy made, and the document he quoted from, are contrary to facts.  That is all I have to say on those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell complained about the method of debate on the original Army Act.  That Act was passed by the Dáil and, although I quite agree that at some period we must have a different Bill, I think the Deputy's arguments should really have been based upon some point to the effect that either the present Act contains <Col N="542" /> clauses which are detrimental or that it lacks certain powers which should be there, the absence of which militates against the effective control of the Army or the effective working of the Army.  So far as my experience goes, the Army is, as I have explained, developing rapidly.  Personally, I think that as we have a temporary Act it is just as well to postpone a permanent measure until we have as much experience as possible.  The whole form of the Army during the last three years has been completely changed.  We have not had any long experience, and I have stated here, quite frankly, that the new developments that I have brought about during the last three or four years are developments about which I have refused to make any prophecies, because they are purely experimental. I may say that so far as I can judge from my experience, I am more than satisfied that the developments have been much more successful than in my most sanguine moments I anticipated. The Dáil passed the original Act.  It may not have had very adequate discussion&mdash;I do not remember the circumstances as well as Deputy O'Connell does&mdash;but the Dáil passed the Act.  I do not want in any way to appear to take an unfair advantage of the generosity of the Dáil at the time, but I would be loath to suggest that the Dáil had done an irresponsible act.  I can quite understand that they passed an Act which later experience might have found to be unsuitable, but so far this has not been found so.</P>

      <P>That was a very unwise promise, I must say.  The Deputy realises that to have brought in a permanent Act at that time when the whole circumstances of the country and the Army were abnormal, to say the least of it, would have been unwise. Then again, we lacked the experience that we have gained in the <Col N="543" /> meantime.  I think that the Deputy and all of us are to be congratulated that a permanent Act was not then brought in, because if it had been it was practically certain that it would have to be amended.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can hardly say that, seeing that annually we have had to bring a Bill similar to this one before the Dáil.  It may be possible for a Deputy to get up here and say that certain desirable things were unattainable by virtue of the form of the present Act.  I am very far from saying that the present Act is a perfect piece of draughtsmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I think it is quite conceivable that the Deputy may have definite proposals that he could bring forward for the purpose of debate so as to enable the Army to be administered more satisfactorily and to be controlled to the satisfaction and the safety of the people of the country. So far, my experience is that whatever defects it may have, they have not interfered with it in any way, and personally I would deprecate any attempt to hasten the bringing in of a permanent Bill, especially during a period of transition.  Personally, I would like to have as much experience as possible of the new form of Army, which new form is not by any means complete yet, before I would commit the country to a permanent Bill. From the point of view of this House having complete control, I myself am not an enthusiast for too great control on the part of the Dáil in the administration of things, but, if I were, I would think that this position whereby we have annually to bring this before the Dáil would be better than having a permanent Bill, though personally I agree that it is desirable that a permanent Bill should be brought in on some future occasion.  I have not seen any case made, and my <Col N="544" /> experience does not justify me in believing, that it would be for the benefit of the Army or the country at the moment to bring in a permanent Bill.  When I bring in a permanent Bill I want to have the Army, approximately in its ultimate form, as elastic as possible.  I regret that the circumstances of 1923 put the Dáil in the position of passing a Bill which it had not adequately considered.  I would think it much more regrettable if later experience had proved that the Bill had been so unworkable as to cause the Army to be developed or maintained in an undesirable form.</P>
      <P>I might prophesy that a permanent Bill would be brought in within a certain time but I am loath to go beyond my own knowledge.  If I had seen the Army in a permanent form with all its branches and elements completely developed I should then certainly be in a position to promise that, but I think it is better to leave these things unpromised rather than to break a promise hereafter.  Deputies seem to complain that whereas many promises have been made prior to my time I have ceased to make these promises.  I do not think that Deputies have been any worse off by any lack of promise on my part.  I think it would be undesirable at present to bring in a Bill which would necessarily have to be subject to considerable revision after a year or two when we had experience of what our needs were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken complained that the Army was not self-contained, meaning that we were not able to produce here the material which the Army needs.  I do not know that we shall be ever in that position.  At present we are examining, largely from the point of view of economy, the possibility of producing certain things to meet our requirements, but at present I cannot say what the result of that examination will be.  I think that the raw materials for military action are not likely to be produced here completely for a considerable time.  We may within the next year or two develop the manufacture of raw materials instead of importing raw materials.  We are not confined to any one market.  We are naturally buying where we get the <Col N="545" /> stuff we want of a satisfactory quality and at the cheapest rates.  We are not any more bound to buy from England than from America or Japan.  In so far as we are buying from one place more than another it is a question of the suitability of the stuff for our needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the decision of the Executive Council accepting the majority recommendation of the Tariff Commission that the application of the Irish Coachbuilders' Association, the National Union of Vehicle Builders, and the Irish Engineering Union be not granted.</P>
      <P>On 31st January, 1927, an application from the Associations mentioned in the resolution for a 50 per cent. ad valorem duty on imported bodies of mechanically driven vehicles and on the parts of such bodies with certain exceptions, together with a duty at the rate of 10/- per vehicle on imported vehicles intended for animal traction, and 33½ per cent. ad valorem on the parts of such vehicles, was referred to the Tariff Commission.  In November of last year there was presented to the Executive Council two reports in respect of that application, a majority report signed by two members of the Commission, and a minority report signed by one member. The majority report recommended that the entire application be not granted. We assume, from the fact that the report has been published, that the Executive Council have considered it, and have decided to accept the recommendation of the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding to state the case in support of the motion, I would like again to make a protest against the practice of the Tariff Commission in submitting recommendations in respect of applications that come before it. The Tariff Commission is not required by the Act that established it to make any recommendation at all.  Its function is to ascertain and report to the Government all the facts relating to the industry concerned.  The original intention, I take it, was that there should be an expert inquiry into each application, that the fullest possible information relating to the industry concerned would thus be made available to the Executive Council and the <Col N="549" /> Dáil, but that the decision whether or not the application should be granted or refused would rest, in the first instance, with the Executive Council, and then with the Dáil.  The practice of the Tariff Commission in making recommendations as well as supplying information has, in fact, destroyed that original intention.</P>
    <P>In respect to previous reports we suspected that they were written not for the purpose of supplying the Dáil with the information that it should possess but of supporting the recommendation, and that relevant facts were either not presented or were presented in such a manner as would make them appear to conform with the recommendation. These suspicions are now shown to be justified.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which we have had a minority report from the Tariff Commission.  There is contained in that minority report important information relating to the application which is not contained in the majority report and which, we must assume, would not be made available at all if there was agreement amongst the members of the Tariff Commission. Apart from the fact that the practice of the Tariff Commission in making recommendations in respect of applications that come before it has destroyed its judicial character, the fact that the Government has bound itself to accept these recommendations means that the Tariff Commission is put into a position which the Dáil never intended.  It, and not the Executive Council or the Dáil, determines questions relating to tariffs.  It is obvious, in view of the fact that applications are finally decided when the report of the Tariff Commission is published, that to that extent the fiscal powers of the Executive and of the Dáil have been surrendered to an unrepresentative body.  That matter is of particular importance in relation to the application which is now before the House.</P>
    <P>This application has been under consideration for a very long time.  From the nature of the case it was assumed by those concerned in the industry that a favourable decision would be forthcoming, and consequently commitments <Col N="550" /> were entered into which have been proved to be unjustified by the event.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be well if, before going into details in respect of the application, I attempted to give a brief outline of the history of the industry and of the application for a tariff.  At the time of the Act of Union there were from 1,700 to 2,000 hands employed in the coach-building industry in Dublin alone.  For many years after that the coach-building industry was one of very considerable importance in the country.  In 1849 there were in the City of Dublin 25 carriage works.  A slump came after the famine, and for a long time the industry experienced very lean days, but in due course a revival came, and by 1885 the industry had been completely re-established.  At that time it enjoyed a very substantial export trade.  In fact, the products of the industry went all over the world and established a very high reputation, which to some extent still persists.  A change in the fortunes of the industry took place with the advent of the motor car and the disappearance of horse-drawn vehicles, on which the reputation and experience of the industry were founded.  But the more progressive firms in this country adapted themselves to the new situation and made bodies for motor cars. They made them satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The industry was rapidly acquiring in the new branch the same reputation it had acquired in the old when the war occurred.  What happened then was that the skilled workers on which the industry depended were absorbed in war work, and, as Deputies are aware, it became impossible to secure chassis.  The import of chassis of motor cars ceased for the entire period of the war.  During the course of the war the world learned the immense possibilities of the motor car for transport purposes.  When it concluded all countries endeavoured to equip themselves, and to provide their requirements in motor transport, as far as possible, within their own shores.  During the course of the war the British Government imposed duties upon imported cars, which gave the <Col N="551" /> British industry a great advantage, and enabled it to make very great strides, when the demands of the war ceased, and it was possible for motor manufacturing firms and coach-building firms in that country to engage in ordinary commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in this country the termination of the world war marked the beginning of our own troubles and it was not possible, with the factors existing here, to engage actively in such work for some years. When the troubles ended and the proprietors of these factories came to review the situation they found that a practice had grown up in the trade which made it particularly difficult for them to secure in it the place that they thought they were entitled to.  Motor cars were habitually imported in the form of complete vehicles.  In other countries, into which motor cars are imported, it is the usual practice to import the chassis only and have the body put on by native labour.  Here, however, the practice is the reverse.  Agents exist for the sale of the cars in whose interest it is to sell not the chassis alone but the complete car.  The coachbuilders of this country found it very difficult to maintain themselves in that situation.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the Free State Government the coachbuilders in the Free State agitated for increased protection.  They did acquire some form of protection automatically because, of course, the duties imposed in England during the war came into operation in respect of the Free State when it was established.  These duties, however, were completely inadequate for the purposes of protection.  I think I can say that the coach-building industry was one of the first to ask for protection from this Government, and it is a noteworthy fact that the Fiscal Inquiry Committee, which the Government set up in 1923, and which was composed of people definitely free trade in their outlook, and which produced a report of a very conservative nature, nevertheless singled out this one industry, <Col N="552" /> and recommended that the existing duties should be revised, so as to give it a measure of protection which would result in its development. Certain alterations in the existing duties were effected but merely for the purpose of securing additional revenue.  The increased protection which the coachbuilders required was not granted.</P>
    <P>When the Tariff Commission was established in 1926 the coachbuilders were one of the first industries to apply to have their case heard by that body.  As I have stated the application was referred to it in January, 1927, and the report was published in January, 1931.  Altogether, I think it can be stated that the Government has treated this industry in a very cavalier fashion.  It has had its difficulties brought to its notice repeatedly since its inception, and yet no action has been taken to enable those engaged in it to overcome these difficulties. That attitude of the Government is all the more extraordinary in view of the importance of the industry.</P>
    <P>This industry is important for several reasons.  In the first place, it gives a considerable amount of employment and is capable of giving a much greater amount.  The number of persons at present engaged in it is set out in the report to be not more than 400 excluding tramway and railway companies' employees.  The amount of employment which it is capable of giving, if developed to its fullest capacity, is one of the points in respect of which there is considerable dispute.  I want to direct the attention of the House, however, to the figures which can be calculated from the recently-published trade returns for 1930.  During that year the value of the touring and commercial cars imported into the Free State was £1,267,000.  It is contended that half of that figure can be taken as representing the value of the body-work imported, that is, £634,000.  If we deduct from the second figure 20 per cent., representing the profits of agents, transport charges and the like, we get a figure of £509,000, of which, it is contended, 60 per cent. represents the wages paid to workers.  In other <Col N="553" /> words, by the fact that we imported the bodies of these 8,700 touring and commercial cars in 1930, we deprived Irish workers of wages amounting to over £300,000, and I submit to the Dáil that in present circumstances we cannot afford to consider a loss of that kind lightly.</P>
    <P>If, as I think, I can demonstrate that the case for the granting of this protection is overwhelming, I am sure Deputies will agree that the majority members of the Tariff Commission and the Government were wrong in refusing it.  It is an industry in respect of which the relation which labour costs bears to the value of the gross output is much higher than in any other industry, with the exception of building and contracting.  Labour costs, according to figures published in previous reports of the Tariff Commission, are 50 per cent. of the value of the gross output, and that falls to be compared with the figure, 5 per cent., for baconcuring, 6 per cent. for grain-milling, 28 per cent. for woollen and worsted manufactures, and 32 per cent. for the boot and shoe industry.  We must also bear in mind that the type of labour employed is of considerable importance to us.  It is not unskilled, or even semi-skilled, labour.  It is very highly skilled labour, and, as I pointed out some days ago in a discussion upon another report from the Tariff Commission, it is very important for us to preserve every opportunity there is for providing employment for skilled labour in this country.  We have plenty of opportunities, if they are availed of, for employing the unskilled, but our resources in skilled labour are so small that we should be very slow before we take any action likely to diminish them.  It is also to be noted that a large proportion of the raw materials used in this industry are available within the country, and that relates particularly to the timber used in the manufacture of motor bodies.  The exportation of the hard wood used in the construction of the coach and motor bodies, that is, ash and oak, is at present going on at a pace never witnessed before.  The country is being denuded of valuable timber which will take a generation to replace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I have here a letter which I received in June last from Mr. O'Gorman of Clonmel, a prominent coachbuilder, an extract from which I would like to read to Deputies.  He said &ldquo;Our native hard wood in the shape of ash trees, the finest in the world, the principal raw material for the industry is being exported before our eyes from every station up and down the country. Notwithstanding the recent enactment regarding the cutting of timber, Scotchmen who are over here buying up these groves of ash tell me they can have a permit to cut the trees from the Department concerned by wire after receipt of their application and these trees take 60 years to mature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The industry is also important because its development will assist in the development of a number of subsidiary industries which are referred to in paragraph 123 of the report.  The applicants contended that beneficial results would accrue to the tanning industry, cotton and woollen industry, poplin, paint and varnish making, brass and metal founding, cushion spring and case making, sheet metal work and brass and nickel plating.  I want to emphasise the importance of this industry for us and I would ask Deputies to bear these remarks of mine in mind when we come to consider the evidence and arguments on which the Tariff Commission's recommendation is based.  We consider that this application is of very vital importance. The case for the granting of it is so strong that if it is refused there is no existing industry which can possibly hope to succeed.  A much stronger case was made by the coachbuilders for protection than has ever been made in this House or out of it, at the Tariff Commission or anywhere else, for a number of industries which have succeeded in getting protection. The case of the coachbuilders is certainly much stronger than any case which could be made for the protection of the boot and shoe industry.  It is one hundred times stronger than the case set out in the Tariff Commission's recent report in respect of butter.  The real question which the Dáil will be asked to decide upon this motion is not so much whether this particular <Col N="555" /> tariff should be imposed but whether any opportunity at all is going to be afforded for the development of industry in this country.  The attitude of the Tariff Commission and presumably the attitude of the Executive Council is that owing to our small market and limited resources it is not possible for any industry, no matter how long established or how efficiently managed, to reach the standard of efficiency which prevails abroad.  They take the stand therefore that any attempt to develop these industries by protection is useless and should not be attempted. The vote upon this motion must be taken as one of approval or disapproval of that attitude.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised the importance of the industry and the significance of the Tariff Commission's report because I think it essential that members of the Dáil should bear these facts in mind when they come to consider the actual details of the application and the case made against a tariff.  The application can be divided into a number of parts, which are set out on page 12 of the report, paragraph 14, and I propose to deal with it in respect of each part separately.</P>
    <P>First it relates to the manufacture of the bodies of vehicles intended for use on railways and tramways.  We can leave out of account the question of tramways.  There is, in fact, no importation of tramcar bodies, nor does it appear likely that any such importation will take place in the future.  There is no case to be made for a tariff.  There is no case to be made against a tariff.  In respect of the application in so far as it related to railway carriages and waggons, the members of the Coachbuilders' Association stated that they had not engaged, and did not propose to engage, in that work.  They gave no evidence in support of the application, which part of the case was left to the representatives of the workers' unions concerned, which are mentioned in the motion.  Evidence was given by the railway companies that some 20 third class corridor carriages were imported in 1907, and 260 waggons in 1919, for the Great Southern Railways, and 250 <Col N="556" /> for the Great Northern Railway in the same year.  Since then no importations have taken place except certain combined engines and carriages brought in for experimental purposes.</P>
    <P>The railway companies stated that if the application was amended to exclude from its scope certain parts, a list of which they submitted, they would be relieved of any apprehension of immediate loss if the application was granted.  The applicants endeavoured to meet the difficulty of the companies by amending the application so as to exclude raw materials and parts common to other lines of industry.</P>
    <P>I will quote from paragraph 48 of the report.</P>
    <P>The companies submitted a fuller and more detailed list of such materials and parts, and the applicants, although they did not specifically refuse to accept this list, did not definitely adopt it.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the railway companies admitted that if the application was amended by the exclusion of the parts to which they referred they did not anticipate they would be involved in any immediate loss if the application was granted, they nevertheless opposed the application, and they opposed it on this ground.  They said they wanted freedom to purchase in the open market as an inducement to their employees to produce work of good quality and to give a reasonable output.  That is the only case against the tariff.  There is no condition in this report, no other argument whatever against the tariff, except this desire on the part of the railway companies to be able to threaten the importation in order to force a better output from their employees, or possibly to effect a reduction in wages.  The applicants, on the other hand, stated that they desired a tariff so that the workers who are only employed for four days a week might be given fuller employment. It is between these two cases that the Dáil must decide in respect to this part of the application.  On the one hand, you have the fact that workers in the railway works have been employed for only four days a <Col N="557" /> week.  You have the fact that the importation of railway carriages and waggons has taken place in the past and may take place in the future.  You have the admission of the companies that if the application was amended in the manner they suggested they had no apprehension of immediate loss, and against those arguments and admissions you have only the desire of the railway companies to be free to import for the purpose of forcing on their employees the working conditions that they thought should prevail.</P>
    <P>The Tariff Commission do not appear to have considered this part of the application at all.  They merely state in paragraph 108 that the fears expressed by the railway companies as to the possible ill-effects of a tariff are not without foundation.  Deputies, however, can read the report two or three times, and I do not think they will succeed in discovering what exactly were the fears expressed by the railway companies concerning the possible ill-effects of the tariff.  The Tariff Commission forgot to put that in the report.  The railway companies secured considerable benefits from the State, and it is not unreasonable to ask in return that they should give the maximum employment possible here. It is our view that they should be given definitely to understand by this Dáil that the importation of railway waggons and carriages which are capable of being made here will not be permitted in any circumstances whatsoever. Remember there is no question whatever about the efficiency of their works.  Tribute to their efficiency is contained in the Tariff Commission's Report.  The witnesses who appeared on behalf of the railway companies testified as to the efficiency of the workers.  The only case against the tariff submitted to the Tariff Commission was that to which I have referred, the desire of the railway companies to be in a position to use a threat of importation against the workers.</P>
    <P>Let us take the next part of the report, the part that refers to the manufacture of the vehicles for animal traction.  The evidence produced before the Commission shows that the work at present available for coachbuilders <Col N="558" /> on horse-drawn vehicles, lorries, floats, drays, is largely repairs and maintenance.  It is stated, however, that there is still an extensive demand for what are known as governess cars and traps, a demand which is at present being met by the importation of second-hand vehicles from England at prices with which the Irish coachbuilders cannot and should not be expected to compete.  It is to be noted that in respect of this part of the application there was no opposition forthcoming.  Whatever statements are contained in the Tariff Commission's Report are not based upon the evidence of opponents to the application. The Dublin Carriers' Association opposed the application in respect to the component parts of horse-drawn vehicles, but on the applicants agreeing to the exclusion of springs and axles from their application the opposition ceased.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, to be assumed from the Tariff Commission Act, and from the speeches in relation to it which have been made here by Ministers, that the function of the Tariff Commission is to hear evidence in relation to the applications, and furnish that evidence in handy form to the Dáil. If there is no opposition to the application, if no individual or no organised section of the community considers their interests sufficiently affected to justify them in giving evidence against the application, it surely is not the function of the Tariff Commission to set itself up as the Devil's Advocate against the applicants and make a case which no other section of the community is prepared to make.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt as to the efficiency of the Saorstát coachbuilders in the manufacture of those horse-drawn vehicles.  I have told you before that in the past they established a world-wide reputation for their products in this particular line. At present they are capable of producing those cars and selling them at prices with which English firms cannot compete.  The competition comes from imported second-hand cars, cars which are no longer required in other countries, and which are dumped in here because there is no other country <Col N="559" /> in the world into which they can be dumped.  There is considerable doubt as to the prices which these cars fetch.  Certain values are declared on the Customs forms which are mentioned in the Tariff Commission's Report, but as the cars are not subject to duty there is no necessity for accuracy on the part of the importers in computing the value of the cars they are bringing in.  It has been brought to my notice that on occasion these cars have been sent in to agents here with instructions to sell them at whatever price they can get for them.  In fact, I have been brought into touch with cases of people who bought these cars under the impression that they were getting good value at prices for which they could have secured new cars with the usual maker's twelve months guarantee. The second-hand cars they bought were worthless.  They looked all right and were freshly painted, but were, in fact, of no value whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number imported in 1928 was 1,327; in 1929, 1,239; in 1930, from January to June, the first six months, 504.  The average was slightly over 1,000 per year.  The value in 1928 was £18,000; in 1929, £17,451. The manufacture of these cars provides employment for a number of small coach-building works scattered throughout the country.  It is true, of course, that the demand for them is declining, and in due course it will disappear altogether.  But while it remains we ask that the benefits of it should be secured to the Irish manufacturers. We think it undesirable that people should be deprived of their employment and that families should be deprived of their livelihood because some people are finding it profitable to dump these second-hand cars here and dispose of them at prices which, in <Col N="560" /> some cases certainly, have been very low.  The Tariff Commission holds that there would not be an increased demand for new cars produced in Free State coach-building works if the importation of these second-hand cars ceased.  They hold that the purchasers of them are attracted by the low price and that if they could not get these second-hand cars they would do without cars altogether.  I do not think that that contention can be maintained. I have mentioned cases in which the second-hand cars fetched prices higher than those at which new cars are obtainable.  In any case, I am convinced that there would be a considerably increased production of these cars in this country if the importation of the foreign vehicles were prohibited. Remember that the only case made against that part of the application was the case made by the Tariff Commission. It was not made on any evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission. There was no opposition from any other source whatever.</P>
      <P>Let us now turn to the application in respect of motor cars.  Deputies who have read the report will have noticed the reliance which the majority of the Tariff Commission places upon the difficulties of the Irish coach manufacturers in respect of what is known as the standardised closed van.  The position in respect of this particular class of vehicle is referred to so often in the report that it is quite obvious that the Tariff Commission considered it the strongest point they have in support of their recommendation.  No doubt they considered that the case in respect of the private car was as strong, but they felt that the recommendation might not be as popular in that case, because the private car is generally regarded as a luxury article, as in the case of the standardised closed van, which is generally regarded as being essential for the conduct of trade and commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is set out in the report that these vans were made by British car manufacturers, who produced both the body and the chassis in such large numbers that they can use economically the most up-to-date and expensive equipment and sell bodies at low cost.  The <Col N="561" /> Tariff Commission contends that if the entire home market for this class of vehicle was secured for the Free State coachbuilders they would, nevertheless, find it possible to instal the equipment which they found to exist in English works and at the same time sell van bodies at a price equal to those now prevailing.  They go on to add, in paragraph 80, that apart altogether from the question of equipment, it is their opinion that the Saorstát coachbuilders could not possibly compete with the British products at present prices in view of the relatively small market here.  The applicants maintain that their difficulties arose mainly in consequence of the practice of motor agents in pushing the sale of complete vehicles.  They argue that they can produce the bodies of these vans at a price at least equal to those prevailing, and gave to the Tariff Commission a guarantee, that in the event of their application being granted, their prices would not exceed the prevailing British prices, plus the existing duty of twenty-two and two-ninths per cent.  Their ability to produce the number of these vans required is not in question.  It is admitted that they can supply our requirements, but the contention of the Tariff Commission is that they cannot do so unless they increase their prices very considerably above the prices now prevailing.  Against that we have very definite statements made by those supporting the application.  We have it stated on behalf of the applicants that their difficulty is that they cannot get for their products the prices quoted in the catalogues of the British manufacturers.</P>
    <P>In relation to this particular part of the application there is a definite conflict of evidence.  You have the statement of the Tariff Commission that the coachbuilders cannot produce these vans at prices equal to those prevailing. You have the statement of the coachbuilders that not merely is the Tariff Commission's contention wrong, but that they would be quite satisfied if they could get for the vans they produce the prices quoted in the British manufacturers catalogue.  Since the report was published a statement <Col N="562" /> was issued by the Coachbuilders' Association which contained a definite proposal for resolving doubts in relation to this question of fact.  The coachbuilders undertake to build in one of their factories a standardised closed van, using existing equipment, availing of the services of existing workmen, using only materials at present in their factory, charging against that van a due proportion of overhead costs, and they say they can market that one van at a price equal to, or less than the price at which British vans are now available here.  They say, and they say rightly, that if they can produce one van in that manner at that price, then obviously they can produce ten vans at a lower price, because overhead charges would be less. They say that if they can produce ten vans at a lower price, they can still further reduce prices if they get reserved for them the entire market available in this country.  That was the definite challenge issued by the coachbuilders.  They are fighting for their existence.  They undertake to have this test carried out under the supervision of any competent person appointed.  Surely before they are condemned and their industry condemned to extinction this challenge should be taken up.  The opportunity should be given to them to prove the truth of their contention.  They argue that the statements of the Tariff Commission in respect to this particular class of vehicle are entirely against the weight of evidence submitted, and they are quite confident that they can prove that to be so, if their challenge is taken up.  They say it will probably and naturally now be asked if this can be done what is the need for protection. This aspect, they say, has been fully thrashed out in evidence tendered to the Commission, and the simple answer is that manufactures, without the country, have a market here and will hold it unless the people desire it otherwise.</P>
    <P>When we leave the question of standardised closed vans and come to consider the application in respect to other commercial vehicles, we come up against a most extraordinary part of the Tariff Commission's report.  The increased protection in this case is <Col N="563" /> sought to enable the applicants to obtain a stronger hold upon the home market and to turn the attention of users of such vehicles to the home industry for the supply of their requirements. They argue that the existing duty of 22 2-9 per cent. is not high enough to compel every Saorstát Eireann purchaser to buy his vehicle at home.  Now the majority of the Tariff Commission admitted in their report that the existing factories in the Free State are efficiently equipped to produce all our requirements in this class of vehicle.  They go further and admit that the bodies produced are satisfactory in comparison with similar bodies produced in other countries, and that they are being sold here at prices less than the price at which these bodies are being produced in other countries.  They were forced to make that admission by the evidence given before them by the opponents of the application in respect to other cars who said that the prices of Saorstát Eireann trucks and lorries and special kinds of closed vans are lower than those at which similar bodies could be obtained at the works in other countries.</P>
    <P>Then I would like to turn to paragraph 106.  Having admitted what I have just said, that both in quality and in price the commercial motor vehicles produced in Saorstát Eireann works compare favourably with similar bodies constructed elsewhere, they go on to admit that if the application were granted it is possible that the home market, in trucks and lorries, would be entirely supplied by Saorstát Eireann coachbuilders, and the additional output, they say, would undoubtedly tend to increase efficiency in the construction of these vehicles. They say elsewhere in the report that despite the existing duty a considerable number of these vehicles are imported. Note their admission.  They admit that those vehicles are produced in this country now at a price less than they are produced in other countries, but remember that those cars imported here from other countries have to pay a 22 2-9 per cent. ad valorem duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> The Tariff Commission are not referring to the prices at which these foreign cars can be secured here.  They are referring to the prices at which they can be secured ex-works in the country of production, and they admit that the Saorstát works are producing them at prices lower than they are produced ex-works in other countries. They admit that if the application was granted the increased market made available here would result in an increase in the efficiency of the Saorstát coachbuilders in the production of this class of cars, and by that presumably they mean that Saorstát coachbuilders would be able to produce, and market them more cheaply still, but they say they recommend that the tariff be not granted, because if it was granted it would be burdensome upon the consumer.  Is there any Deputy who can make any sense out of that?  &ldquo;We consider, however, that the existing tariff rates afford a sufficient protection to the home coachbuilders without being unduly burdensome to the home consumers.&rdquo;  Surely that is nothing but sheer blithering idiotcy.  Is there any Deputy who can pretend to make sense out of it?  They admit the coachbuilders can produce them at a price less than elsewhere, and they admit that if the tariff was imposed they would produce them more cheaply still, yet they say that the imposition of a tariff would be unduly burdensome on the consumer.  It is by arguments such as that that this industry is to be condemned to death. I wonder are Deputies satisfied to have it so.</P>
    <P>They next refer to the manufacture of bodies for motor omnibuses.  It is pointed out that in consequence of the manner in which bus transport was introduced into this country the demand for new buses in the early stages arose principally in the spring months, and immediate delivery was required.  The Saorstát coachbuilders, having no experience of the construction of bus bodies, were unable to meet the demand, and the completed vehicles were imported from England.  But to gain experience, it is stated in paragraph 35, the Saorstát Eireann coachbuilders quoted prices <Col N="565" /> when tendering for contracts without being fully satisfied that the transactions would at such prices result in profits.  And although they first sustained loss, they ultimately put their business on a paying basis.  It is argued in the report that such success as they attained was not attributable to the existing duty, but to the action taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the operation of the Railway (Road Motor Service) Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered by Deputies that it is not the practice in England or elsewhere for the bodies of omnibuses to be produced by the manufacturer of the chassis.  It is the practice for the manufacturer of the chassis to sell it as such, the agent who sells it being usually an agent for some coachbuilder as well, and, having arranged for the sale of the complete vehicle, he has the chassis sent from the manufacturer of it to the bodybuilder, and then it is imported into this country as a complete vehicle. The Saorstát 'bus-owners at the commencement of 'bus traffic transport in this country, wanting rapid delivery of their cars, placed orders for same with the agents in their own locality, and these agents passed that order over to British agents, who were generally in a position to offer hire-purchase facilities. These facilities were a considerable inducement to the purchasers to place the orders with them.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 36 of the report the Tariff Commission admit that it is now possible for 'bus bodies to be produced here and sold at prices which are less than those at which British bodies of similar capacity can be obtained.  The applicants urged that the additional protection should be granted, not because of any inefficiency on their part, but in order definitely to compel all purchasers in the Saorstát to obtain home-made articles.  They pointed out that although the bodies produced by them are cheaper and better than those imported, they could not hope to secure the entire home market so long as intending purchasers would not place their orders sufficiently long in advance of the time when they would <Col N="566" /> want delivery to enable the Saorstát coachbuilders to meet their needs. Incidentally, the applicants urged that the existing protection is considerably reduced by the fact that duty is levied upon certain parts which could not in any case be produced within this country.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that the Saorstát coachbuilders are at present capable of producing bus bodies at prices lower than those at which British bus bodies can be obtained here.  Nevertheless, considerable importations of buses takes place because of the hire-purchase facilities which the British manufacturers are able to offer and because of the fact that intending purchasers do not exercise prevision as to their requirements and so place their orders sufficiently long in advance.  There is also, of course, the constant difficulty that the agents for the chassis are usually agents for the English bodybuilders as well, and they generally succeed in securing orders for completed cars.  Nevertheless, the Tariff Commission say that this increased protection should not be granted. They admit that if the increased protection were imposed, the importation of foreign bus bodies would stop and that the increased business thus secured for the Irish coachbuilders would further increase their efficiency and presumably enable them further to reduce prices.  They appear to have the impression that the existing duty is enough.  They say that if we wait long enough the importation of foreign buses may stop, and then the coachbuilders will have got what they desire if they are still there, without having their application granted.  They do not advance one single reason why the application should not now be granted.</P>
    <P>It surely is no answer to their case that in the fullness of time the existing duty may prove to be sufficiently effective to stop importation.  These foreign buses are coming in.  Irish workers who could be engaged in the production of the bodies for them are idle.  The equipment in our factories is not being used; some of our factories are closing down; the capital <Col N="567" /> invested in the industry has been wasted, and yet the Tariff Commission are prepared to contemplate a continuance of that situation, without being able to advance one good reason for it, sooner than recommend an increase in the duty.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to paragraph 128 of the report, which states that evidence was given on behalf of the Irish Omnibus Company that they had reason to fear that if the application were granted there would be a combination amongst the Irish coachbuilders to force up prices, and that they had found in the past some such tendency to combine operating. The Tariff Commission go on to say: &ldquo;We are satisfied from inquiries which we have made that the prices tendered&rdquo;&mdash;in the cases which they examined&mdash;&ldquo;were identical and were settled by the coachbuilders concerned in consultation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will Deputies believe that that statement of the Irish Omnibus Company, to which the Tariff Commission referred, was not submitted in evidence? It was a written statement of which the applicants were not aware.  Those associated with the application have informed me that they did not know of the existence of that statement until the report was published, and they were given no opportunity of offering rebutting evidence.  This Tariff Commission, whose duty it was to get all possible information in relation to this industry, did not ask for that rebutting evidence in connection with that statement.  The coachbuilders, of course, deny it entirely, but their denial is of little value.  They were not given an opportunity of denying it before the Tariff Commission when the case was under consideration.  We now come to the final part of the application&mdash;that is, in relation to private motor cars.  The Tariff Commission state, at the beginning of the report, that they found four of the five principal applicants have not engaged in the manufacture of bodies, and the fifth had little experience in producing them.  They further state that they consider the application as being one in respect of articles which it is proposed <Col N="568" /> to manufacture here if a tariff at the rate suggested by the applicants is imposed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware applications for a tariff can be made either in respect of existing industries or by persons proposing to engage in the industry concerned if the application is granted.  Having stated that they considered this part of the application as having been made in respect of an industry which it was intended to establish if the tariff were granted, they then proceed to make the case against the application on the ground that the existing factories are not efficiently equipped for the production of these bodies.  Their entire case against this part of the application is based upon a criticism of the existing concerns. They say these concerns are not as efficiently equipped as some of the factories they saw in England.  They criticise the coachbuilders because they have not availed of the existing duty to engage in the production of bodies for private cars.  They did not consider the application at all as being one in relation to an industry not yet existing but which it was proposed to establish if the application were granted.</P>
    <P>There are, as Deputies will learn from the report, three types of bodies for private cars.  There is the all-metal body, the body consisting of a wooden frame covered with metal plates, and the body consisting of a wooden frame with a fabric covering. It is admitted it would be uneconomic for any coach-building factory here to instal the machinery required for the production of the all-metal body.  In paragraph 23 the Tariff Commission state that during their visit to the works of some of the largest manufacturing firms in England they were informed that owing to the high cost of these presses&mdash;the presses required in the manufacture of the all-metal body &mdash;they did not instal a sufficient number of them in their own works to produce all the metal body parts and panels they required.  These metal presses are very expensive to instal. The dies used in the stamping out of the parts are also very expensive. They cannot be fully availed of unless <Col N="569" /> there is a huge market for the bodies they produce.</P>
    <P>The question which we must ask ourselves is: Were we so desirous of having all-metal bodies upon cars used in this country that we are not prepared to take action for the development of an industry for the production of wooden bodies with either metal or fabric covering?  It is our view that we can meet our transport needs if we have the cars equipped with wooden framed bodies, and that if necessary we can do without metal bodies.</P>
    <P>There is a Minority Report which recommends that the duty upon completed car bodies should be increased and that the duty on parts should be maintained as it is, to encourage the industry for the assembling of these bodies here with imported parts.  It is pointed out in the Minority Report that such an industry would be capable of giving employment to 700 men.  It is argued by the member of the Commission who wrote the report that in the construction of bodies for private cars there are two divisions of labour; in the first place, the making of the standard parts from the raw material, and, in the second place, the assembling of these parts.  The signatory of the Minority Report goes on to consider the opportunites for employment available in the assembling of these parts. He concludes that these opportunities are very considerable and that that work could quite well be done in this country.  As I have said, he demonstrates that on the number of cars imported into this country in 1929, work in the assembling of the parts alone could be provided for 700 men.  I say, therefore, that we can establish and maintain here an industry for the production of wooden bodies covered over with imported metal parts&mdash;the parts to be imported duty free&mdash;or covered with fabric, and that we can get on very well, utilising the cars equipped with such bodies.</P>
    <P>The coach-building industry has been considerably developed in other countries by the imposition of tariffs, even though it has not been found possible to instal machinery for the production of the metal parts from raw material in these countries.  That applies even <Col N="570" /> to Australia where metal parts are imported and assembled and a very considerable amount of employment is given in the process.  The Tariff Commission argue that if an increased tariff were imposed there would be an equivalent increase in the price of the bodies and that the higher tariff would, therefore, not be effective in preventing the importation of the completed cars.  I do not think that that contention of the Tariff Commission can be sustained at all.  There is no reason whatever why motor bodies other than all-metal bodies cannot be produced in this country as cheaply as they can be produced elsewhere.  The Tariff Commission state that none of the applicants possesses the plant or equipment necessary for the production of standardised lines of wooden parts for the frame-work of coach-built or fabric bodies.  They state that in paragraph 30.  That statement is simply not true.</P>
    <P>There is at least one factory in the country equipped for the production of these parts on standardised lines, and it is our view that if the protection asked for was afforded a substantial industry could be built up capable of giving employment to a very large number of skilled workers in this country.</P>
    <P>The opposition to this tariff came from two associations.  The first of these was the Royal Irish Automobile Association.  The witnesses who appeared on its behalf, however, admitted that not merely were they not in a position to speak for the general body of motor users, but they could not speak even for their own members. The membership of the Association is stated to be 1,800 out of a total number of 25,000 users of private cars. The witnesses who appeared against the application could not speak for even 1,800.  They did not consult them and their evidence must be regarded as valueless.  They appeared solely in their personal capacity.  The other association was the Irish Motor Traders' Association, and in respect of their opposition I would refer Deputies to the paragraph concerning it in <Col N="571" /> the Minority Report, paragraph 9, which says:</P>
    <P>During the hearing of the application counsel for the applicants handed in copy of an extract from the minutes of a general meeting of the Irish Motor Traders' Association held on 16th December, 1926, recording a resolution by the Association in which it was agreed not to oppose the application for an increased tariff on motor bodies, provided the coachbuilders were pre pared to work for the free admission of chassis or a reduction of the duty to which these are subject to not more than 5 per cent. ad valorem, and also that they reduce their demands to a maximum of £20 duty on a two-seater car and £30 duty on a four-seater car.  It would appear, therefore, that in December, 1926, there were not any serious misgivings on the part of the Irish motor traders as to the efficiency and capacity of the Saorstát manufacturers to meet the demands of the motor traders' customers in car bodies, and that, on their part, there was no objection in principle to an increase in the tariff on such bodies when imported.</P>
    <P>That disposes of the opposition.  I think I have gone very fully into the case for the passing of this motion, much more fully than I intended on rising.  I will ask Deputies, when considering the facts which I have been able to put before them, to consider also the whole question of industrial policy which should be operated in this country.  Do we wish to develop industries here for the purpose of providing employment for those who cannot be engaged on the land?  If we do, then here is one industry which should be developed but unfortunately it is disappearing.  It is definitely stated in the report that the employment now being given in the industry is gradually decreasing.  As Deputies know, since the application was made, the productive capacity of the industry has been definitely diminishing.  While the Tariff Commission was sitting in judgment on the applicants' case the industry was going.  If the Dáil rejects the motion, and if the protection asked <Col N="572" /> for is not given, the industry will disappear altogether for all effective purposes.</P>
    <P>No doubt some coach-building works will remain for the purpose of executing repairs and will be successful in getting occasional orders, but an efficient industry capable of supplying our own needs, as is possible, will not be there.  I have said already, and I now say it again, that there is no industry now protected or likely to seek protection in the future which can make a stronger case than that which the Coachbuilders' Association has made.  I would ask also that this question should not be decided on Party lines.  I am certain that if we can get a free expression of mind on the part of every member in the Dáil we will find that there is a majority of the members prepared to give this industry a chance.  I am certain that that plea will be supported by some of the members opposite, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who, I think, has given an undertaking that he will not vote against it in any case.</P>

      <P>I withdraw the statement, but I say this, namely, that the coachbuilders who operate in the Deputy's constituency are under the impression that the Deputy did give such an undertaking.  I do not say that, however, for the purpose of making any debating point.  I hope to have an opportunity of visiting the Deputy's constituency again.  I have said all I want to say, and I ask the Dáil to consider the motion on its merits.  I am certain that if Deputies read the report and examine the case made in support of the application they will agree with me in saying that the Executive Council were wrong in accepting the recommendations of the majority of the Commission.  The Executive Council had the report before them for some six weeks before they published it.  Presumably, therefore, their decision was only arrived at after the matter had been given very <Col N="573" /> considerable consideration.  I am quite certain, therefore, that if a strong expression of opinion is forthcoming from the Dáil the members of the Executive Council will be prepared to reconsider their attitude.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the next business might I ask the President what is the idea of allocating Government time for a discussion of a motion of this sort when no member of the Executive Council, apparently, is prepared to define the Government's attitude in the matter?  As pointed out by Deputy Lemass, the death-knell of a very important industry has been rung by the action of the Executive Council.  Surely the Executive Council must have discussed this matter amongst themselves, and there must have been some reason in justification of their attitude in agreeing with the report of the Tariff Commission. It was not an ordinary report, as there was a difference of opinion among members of the Commission. Are we to assume that there is a difference of opinion also in the Executive Council with regard to the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unusual to answer a question such as that which the leader of the Opposition has put, but I should say offhand that there were two very good reasons for not answering the case that was put, or rather, the motion.  First, no case was made by the Deputy who moved the motion, and secondly, he got no support from his Party, or from any other Party in the House, and there was no case to answer.  The reading of the report would afford ample opportunity to any person of business capacity or knowledge of affairs to see that no case was made and that the report answered practically everything that the Deputy said in moving the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the President does not mean to give that as a serious answer?  Is it not obviously frivolous? A very full case was made by the mover of the motion and, naturally, we expected to get a reply from the Government Benches.  When the case was made completely for the motion why should we go on making the same case again until some answer is given?  I think it is ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that on the motion for the adjournment I would raise a question with regard to the rate of progress made in giving effect to the provisions of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act.  As Deputies will remember, the Act was passed before the Christmas Adjournment of 1929.  In all parts of the House there was agreement as to the necessity for it in view of the bad state of housing generally in the areas affected.  It was stated by the Minister at the time that the sum of £250,000 would be ear-marked for the purposes of the Act. During February and March of last year tens of thousands of application <Col N="577" /> forms were printed, and a great deal of interest was taken in regard to the Act in the Gaeltacht areas.  On this day week I asked a question as to the progress that was being made in putting the provisions of the Act into operation.  I was informed that up to 31st January there were 11,520 applications received for grants under it, that the number of inspections made was only 1,508, while the number of applications actually sanctioned was only 369, for which a sum of £34,260 10s. was ear-marked.  I also asked the Minister if he could state the number of cases in which the work of building had actually commenced. The Minister was not in a position to answer that, but he did say that in 76 cases sufficient progress had been made to qualify for instalments of the grant, and that the amount so paid out&mdash; presumably to the 31st January last&mdash; was £2,069.</P>
      <P>It was admitted, as I have said, by Deputies in all parts of the House that there was great urgency for this Act. Yet twelve months after its passing we have the statement from the Minister that the actual number of cases in which grants have been paid is only 76, while the total amount of money paid out is only £2,069.  There were inspections made in 1,500 cases, so that the remaining 10,000 applicants have got nothing except the usual sheaf of circulars.  This Department seems to be almost as prolific in the production of circulars as the Department dealing with the Dáil Loan.  The position is that these 10,000 applicants have not had their applications dealt with.  An inspector has not visited them.  They do not know what is going to happen their applications.  In this respect it may be no harm to look back to the debates that took place when the Housing (Gaeltacht) Bill was under discussion here.  I find in Vol. 32, column 1632, that Deputy Aiken asked: &ldquo;Has the Minister any time limit set for the expending of that money?&rdquo;  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries replied: &ldquo;That is a rather difficult question to answer.  I should say, considering all the examinations that will take place, and so on, that it will take three years to expend the whole of the £250,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> That was the Minister's conservative estimate.  Protests were made against the Minister's statement that it should take three years to spend the money. The Minister replied: &ldquo;I am merely making my own estimate,&rdquo; and later said: &ldquo;It may be speeded up.  As far as we are concerned, it may be taken that we will speed up that work as far as it is humanly possible.&rdquo;  In column 1634 of the same volume the Minister is reported to have said: &ldquo;I hope that a considerable amount of money in connection with the Bill will be spent in this financial year&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the financial year 1929-30.  &ldquo;I cannot give any guarantee that all the money will be spent.  So long as I have the feeling that it is being spent wisely, and that we are dealing with the persons with whom I want to deal, the more quickly the money is spent the more I will like it.  A sum of £250,000 will be made available by the Government. If we are able to spend it quickly, well and good; but I want to make sure that we are going to touch the persons I have set out to deal with.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin asked the Minister: &ldquo;What portion of the estimated cost of £250,000 covering the work which is going to be done will be made available in the estimates for the coming financial year?&rdquo; The Minister replied: &ldquo;First of all we will have to look for a Supplementary Estimate before the new Estimates will be considered. Before money will be available in the new financial year there will be a Supplementary Estimate introduced. It will be introduced almost immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak subject to correction, but as far as I can discover no Supplementary Estimate was introduced last year to make provision for grants under this Act in the financial year 1929-30.  Perhaps it was that they found shortly afterwards that they were not able to spend any money before April, but there was a suggestion that as much money as possible would be spent before April, 1931.  In any event, we find in the ordinary estimates for the current year that the sum of £60,000 <Col N="579" /> was set down for the purpose of making grants under this Act, but up to 31st January they had only paid out the sum of £2,000 odd.  I am not alleging for a moment that the Minister in making the promise that the work would be speeded up was not sincere in doing so, but I want an explanation from him as to why the administration of the Act has failed, as it undoubtedly has.  No one can say that the progress made, as evidenced by the figures supplied to me by the Minister, is anything but utterly disappointing.  There is very grave discontent in these particular areas with regard to the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Not only has there been delay, but the very fact that this Act was in existence, and that applications were made under it, has prevented many people from taking other steps to erect houses or to take advantage of grants available from other Departments Generally speaking, this Act would be more favourable to them because they would be eligible for bigger grants. At the same time a good many of them would undoubtedly have taken steps before this to provide dwellings under previous Housing Acts or to secure grants from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It appears to me, on examining the Minister's reply, that the difficulty has arisen on the question of inspection, and that it is there the trouble lies.  I agree that it is necessary to examine all the applications carefully, in order that people who are deserving of grants and who fulfil all the conditions necessary, get them, but what is the explanation of the fact that out of 11,500 applications received only 1,508 inspections have been made in nine months?  What I believe to be the trouble is that the number of inspectors put on the work is altogether insufficient to cope with it, and that with 1,500 inspections in nine months it is unknown how long it will take before the inspections are made in the 11,520 applications that have been received, in addition to those that will be received this year and next year.  At that rate what is the Minister's estimate of the length of time it will take <Col N="580" /> to spend the £250,000 that was to be spent in three years?</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter for the areas concerned, and I think that an explanation is due to the House from the Minister, especially in view of the urgency that was said to exist when the Act was passed, and the general agreement there was amongst all Parties that the work was urgent, and should be proceeded with as quickly as possible.  Surely there has been a great failure at some stage of the work when we find that such little progress has been made since the Act was passed.  I do not need to go into the matter at any great length.  I have quoted the particulars that appear in the Minister's answer to my question.  They speak for themselves and demand an explanation from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with Deputy O'Connell in his protest against the manner in which the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act has been administered.  I did not quite follow whether the 11,520 applications received included applications for improvements as well as new houses.  I know that in the part of the Gaeltacht from which I come the majority of the people have applied for improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are included in the figures.  The Minister's answer to my question was that the number of applications for assistance received under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act to 31st January was 11,520.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the majority of the applications received from the part of the Gaeltacht from which I come are for improvements. That is because the grant of £80 is not sufficient to enable poor people to build houses.  The only people I know who applied for new houses are those who have three or four sons, and who can get assistance in that way. People in the Gaeltacht could not afford to employ labour to build houses on a grant of £80.  The very poor only have applied for grants for improvements so as to provide roofs, windows, floors and doors.  Out of the 1,500 inspections I have not heard of a single inspection made of a <Col N="581" /> dilapidated house, or of any house where the owner applied for an improvement grant.  I was on the island of Gorunna recently, and in the village of Trabane, which was a thriving place when the fishing industry was prosperous, and, as far as I could learn, 30 or 40 of the people had applied for grants for improvements.  I was told they had not been visited by any inspector, but that an inspector did visit one or two cases where new houses were required.  I imagine when an inspector is sent around to visit forty miles away from his headquarters that it would be quite easy for him to inspect all the applicants in that particular village.  It should not be necessary for him to go forty miles and come back forty miles, and then to take another car in a week's time to inspect another house in the same village.  I do not see why an inspector, when he goes out to an isolated village in the Gaeltacht, should not do all the visits in one day.  It may be necessary to appoint additional inspectors, but at the same time if the inspectors were told to hurry up the work, and if they were given a certain time to do a certain amount of inspection, they could do a lot more than they are doing.  I know in that portion of South Connemara in which I reside a few houses have been built, but in the vast majority in which they have been looking for improvement grants nothing at all has been done and people are beginning to think that the housing scheme is going to fall through.  I have had some trouble in explaining to them that eventually they will get inspection, but if they were given some encouragement they could get on with the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the reply which was given to Deputy O'Connell by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries it was pointed out that approximately 11,500 applications have been made under the Gaeltacht Housing Act, and although a year or nine months have elapsed since that particular Act has been passed by the Oireachtas, the Minister admitted that approximately only 1,000 inspections have taken place since that time.  On 26th November last I had a somewhat similar <Col N="582" /> question addressed to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and, as far as Donegal was concerned, on that particular occasion the Minister pointed out that 1,905 applications had been made there for grants under the Gaeltacht Act.  I presume that number has now increased to over 2,000.  On the day I raised that question the Minister pointed out that as far as he was aware no houses had been erected under that particular Act in County Donegal.  When the question was put, how many houses were in the course of construction, he was not able to give me an answer.  As far as the Donegal Gaeltacht is concerned, the people believe there is a great necessity for the Minister's Department to introduce some Yankee hustle into this scheme in order that houses may be built in the Gaeltacht.  It is needless to point out to the Minister the great necessity for erecting additional houses as far as the Gaeltacht area is concerned.  I think his Department should understand that without any Deputy endeavouring to impress it on them.  I would appeal to the Minister to speed up this machinery as far as this particular Act is concerned.  The necessity for the houses is there. Applications have been put in.  Money has been provided by the Oireachtas, and the only thing that is holding the thing up is the slow motion as far as the Minister's Department is concerned. I appeal to the Minister to speed the matter up so that additional houses should be provided, not only in Donegal, but in other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. F. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that the greater portion of the delay that has been complained of occurred during the earlier months.  There was considerable difficulty in recruiting the type of staff required for this particular job.  Not only had the man to have technical knowledge, but he would have been rather useless unless he was able to conduct his business in Irish.  Portion of his inspection would have been as to whether or not Irish was the normal spoken language of the household.  The inspector, therefore, would have to find out <Col N="583" /> whether that was so.  I may say on one occasion, when we were looking for six inspectors, the board set up by the Civil Service Commissioners were only able to supply us with two.  Of all the candidates who appeared before the selection board only two had both the necessary technical qualifications and the qualifications in Irish.  Therefore considerable delay prevailed at the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that has been radically changed in recent months.  We have now recruited a staff of ten inspectors or assistant-inspectors.  The position as given to Deputy O'Connell in the answer last week was that on 31st January last there were 11,520 applications. Of these 377 were immediately declared ineligible because they came from areas outside the scheduled Gaeltacht area.  Of the 1,508 cases which have been reported on he was told in reply to a question last week that 369 applications had been approved; 135 others have been deferred because Irish was not the home language.  That is why they have been postponed for a time for further consideration to see if the condition of the language in the household changes.  A further 96 were found to be ineligible on various grounds.  Forty were withdrawn and 863 are at the moment under examination at headquarters or elsewhere.  By &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; I mean either the Land Commission or the Local Government Department.  We have to inquire before giving a grant or loan whether the Land Commission may not have some re-settlement scheme for the particular area which would qualify our attitude towards giving a grant or loan.  In the same way, we have to find out from the Local Government Department whether or not a grant had been made under the Housing Acts.  Eight hundred and sixty-three cases are in that position, under examination in my own office or in either of these two offices. There are at the moment a further 1,865 cases in the hands of the inspectors for report.  The files are with the various inspectors in the different Gaeltacht areas.  Reports are coming in at the rate of something between <Col N="584" /> 400 and 500 per month.  I can give you the figures for each month from September last.  Up to the end of August only 98 cases had been reported on, but during September, 150 cases were reported on; October, 135; November, 216; December, 465; January, 439.  We expect that about 450 will be maintained for each month for the future. In addition to the 10 inspectors or their assistants we have six gangers employed for the purpose of advising the handymen who are engaged, with a view to avoiding any serious faults in the construction of the houses.</P>
    <P>I might say that the ten inspectors are distributed as follows:&mdash;One in County Donegal; three in County Mayo; four between County Galway, the Arran Islands and Clare, and two between the Counties Cork and Kerry. We have applied for one additional inspector, who is to be allocated to County Donegal.  Their services will only be retained until the Department is satisfied that the existing handymen or the new men coming into that type of job are fully competent.  It is anticipated that sanction will have been given this summer for as many houses as there will be skilled labourers available to build in the Gaeltacht.  I think that the present speeding up meets the case.  While I agree that there was, perhaps, undue slowness at the start, that is the period from about March or April last year until September, since that period I think there has been sufficient speeding up, and in recent months the number of reports having been brought up to between 400 and 500, I think it is sufficiently fast.  By the summer we hope to have as many sanctions as as there will be skilled labour available for construction.</P>
    <P>I might mention, of course, that preferential attention is being given to those areas in the Gaeltacht where Irish is the ordinary spoken language of the people.  You will remember that three-fifths of the money is allotted to those areas where the valuation divided by the population amounts to one guinea.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the powers conferred upon me by Section 4 (1) of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, I fixed the 30th April, 1929, as the final date for making applications for repayment in respect of sums subscribed to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan.  As Mr. Laurence O'Reilly's application was not received within the prescribed period I regret that I am unable to authorise repayment in respect of the sum which he claims to have subscribed.</P>

      <P>There is no trace in my Department of a receipt for a subscription to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-1920, by Mr. Eneas Lane, Ballycummane, Tournafulla, County Limerick, now resident at Ballylangan, Ballagh, Charleville.  An application for repayment in respect of a sum of £1 subscribed to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-20, was, however, received from Aeneas Lane, of Ballylangan, Ballagh, Charleville, on the 3rd April, 1929.  Mr. Lane gave his address on the date of subscribing as Cahirlevoy, Mount Collins, County <Col N="441" /> Limerick.  These particulars corresponded with those of an entry in the primary Register of subscribers and on the 28th June, 1929, authority to issue a Savings Certificate to Mr. Lane at his new address was given to the Accountant, Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the certificate was issued to Mr. Lane on the 1st July, 1929, and was acknowledged by him on the 6th idem.  Mr. Lane has not yet, however, made application to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for payment of the amount of the certificate.</P>
