      <P>I wish to support Deputy O'Connell that the Dáil should meet next week and discuss the resolution in his name; that the Executive Council should forthwith institute remedial matters calculated to provide useful constructive work at fair wages for unemployed workers in town and country, and to meet the special needs of agriculture occasioned by the abnormal fall in wholesale prices.  I think Deputy O'Connell has a right to press that the Dáil should meet next week to consider the motion in his name. We rushed through business here last week, which was of vital importance to the nation, and there was no time to <Col N="717" /> discuss it properly.  Now the Government proposes to take another holiday, although the Dáil has only been a fortnight in Session.  I hope Deputies will press that the Dáil should meet next week to discuss this motion.</P>

I certainly think the Dáil could be engaged in no more useful work than discussing that motion. There are also other motions of importance on the Paper.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee on Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose two motions to the Dáil that arise out of a report of the Tariff Commission, which considered a reference made to it by the Executive Council as to the desirability of imposing a Customs Duty on oats imported into Saorstát Eireann.  The report presented by the Tariff Commission has been received by the Executive Council within the last two or three days, and it recommends the imposition of a tariff on oats and an increase in the duty on oatmeal. Resolution No. 1 is as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Customs duty at the rate of two shillings and sixpence the hundredweight shall be charged, levied and paid on all oats imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 24th day of October, 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall <Col N="719" /> apply to the duty mentioned in this resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though oats were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the general duty on oats should be 2/6 per cwt., the Imperial preference rate being 1/8 per cwt.  Consequential upon that the Tariff Commission recommend that the duty on oatmeal be increased, and the second Resolution is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That in lieu of the duty of Customs chargeable under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926), there shall be charged, levied and paid on all oatmeal imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 24th day of October, 1931, a Customs duty at the rate of six shillings the hundredweight.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though oatmeal were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which two-thirds of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(3)  That in lieu of the drawback payable under Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1927 (No. 18 of 1927), there shall be allowed as from the 24th day of October, 1931, on the due exportation or the due shipment of stores for use as stores of any goods in the manufacture or preparation of which in Saorstát Eireann any imported oatmeal chargeable with duty under this Resolution has been used <Col N="720" /> a drawback equal to the duty paid under this Resolution in respect of the quantity of such oatmeal which appears to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been used in the manufacture or preparation of the goods.</P>
    <P>(4)  That in allowing the drawback under this Resolution the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may, in order to facilitate trade, modify or dispense with all or any of the requirements of Sections 104 and 106 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, as to the giving of security and the examination of the goods.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the duty on oatmeal which is at present 2/6 per cwt. without any Imperial preference rate should become 6/- per cwt., with an Imperial preference rate of 4/-.  That is, broadly speaking, that the effective duty on oatmeal should be increased from 2/6 to 4/- per cwt., corresponding with the imposition of an Imperial preference rate on oats of 1/8, and 2/6 as a general duty.  I think it would be better not to discuss this proposal at any great length to-day.  The report is ready to be sent to the printers and will be in the hands of Deputies when the Dáil next meets.  A good deal of evidence was submitted to the Tariff Commission.  A considerable number of people volunteered, or were invited to give evidence, representing farmers, agricultural committees, trainers of racehorses, oatmeal millers and people variously interested, and, in general, the view of the Commission was that the duty should be chargeable on all oats; that although there has been constantly an importation of seed oats, it would be difficult, if not impracticable, to exempt seed oats. Furthermore, the Commission was satisfied, having heard all the evidence, that there was no good reason for the importation of seed oats; that in fact better seed oats could be produced <Col N="721" /> in this country, and that oats that were being imported as seed oats were simply good commercial oats, and not a special pure line of oats at all. It would be better that the quantity of seed oats required should be produced at home, and that the importation of seed oats should be confined to whatever small quantities were necessary for the introduction of new varieties.</P>
    <P>There was opposition also on the ground that imported oats were required by the trainers of race horses. The Commission were satisfied that only in wet seasons were small quantities of imported oats necessary for this purpose, and that no appreciable hardship would be inflicted by the imposition of the moderate duty on oats that is proposed.  The view of the Commission is that the imposition of the tariff will prevent, in certain circumstances, the importation of commercial oats which would depress the market.  There is a certain tendency towards increasing imports and this will prevent the market being depressed by that particular kind of import.</P>
    <P>It will also give an increased market and, in fact, develop a certain line of oat growing by causing the seed oat requirements of the country to be produced at home.  Undoubtedly, while this increase on oatmeal is necessary, it will, in fact, I think further substantially increase the preference that home oatmeal millers enjoy and tend to further exclude the oatmeal produced outside.  It is necessary to increase the tariff on oatmeal because if, in any season, it was necessary for the oatmeal millers to import substantial quantities of oats and pay a tariff on them, they would be at a disadvantage with competitors outside if the tariff were allowed to remain as at present. It is not anticipated that, generally speaking, substantial quantities will have to be imported by the oatmeal millers.  This increase in the tariff will, I think, have the effect of improving their position, and in that way of increasing, or giving some addition to, the market for home grown oats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish very heartily to <Col N="722" /> congratulate the people and the electors of Kildare on the tardy conversion of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture.  For several years we have been pressing the Government to protect cereal growers.  We have used practically the same arguments that the Minister for Finance put forward here to-day, notwithstanding the fact that four or five years ago he turned them down. As the Tariff Commission have made up their minds to put on this tariff&mdash; rather I should say that the Minister for Agriculture made up his mind five or six months ago that he was going to put it through&mdash;I am sorry they did not apply it on the 31st August instead of the 31st October.  The hardest hit farmers have had to get rid of their oats already.  It is too bad that they did not know that the Government were going to apply this tariff.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the discussion on the motion should be postponed until we get the Report of the Tariff Commission.  We have no intention of discussing it to-day.  I certainly think that the people of the country, the electors of Kildare and the Grain Growers' Association, are to be congratulated on bringing the necessary pressure to bear on the Government to do something for agriculture. It is to be hoped that if they keep up the pressure the Government will be forced either to do something for agriculture as a whole or to get out and let somebody else do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is better not to discuss the tariff until the Report of the Tariff Commission is available.  I merely want to give my opinion that the tariff will be as useful as the tariff on butter.  From my point of view if it has any use at all it is this: it will get the farmers' minds off a perfectly unimportant point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his conversion.  In the Budget for 1928 I looked for this tariff.  The Minister then told me that instead of being a benefit, such a tariff would be a decided hardship on the agricultural community.  If our presence here and our education of the <Col N="723" /> farming community throughout the country has done nothing else except to bring this eleventh hour conversion of the Minister, who will soon have to face the farmers at the polls we have at least done some good.  I welcome the tariff because I believe that next year if he is here the Minister will find himself compelled to double it.  If he is not here then there will be somebody else in his place to do so. I wonder whether the Minister is going to follow the tariff on oats by imposing the tariff that has been demanded on bacon and on foreign barley. We have succeeded in bringing the Minister a long way on the road to see our point of view on this question, or at least the impending election has brought about his eleventh hour conversion.  Perhaps before he faces the country again he will see the absolute need for a tariff on bacon and on foreign barley as well as on oats. If he does then we will have got him almost completely round to our point of view.</P>
      <P>I wonder what change has come about since the Minister told us in 1928 that this tariff would be a decided hardship on the farming community. I would like to hear that from him.  At any rate he is to be congratulated on his conversion, the people are to be congratulated and I think the Fianna Fáil Party is also to be congratulated on educating the Minister.  We get so much education from those who sit on the front bench opposite that I think our education of the Minister in this matter will undoubtedly prove of benefit to the country.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say whether any estimate has been made of the revenue that he expects to get from this tariff either during the remainder of this financial year or in a normal year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No such estimate has been made.  It is of no consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the awkward method adopted by the Tariff Commission for taking evidence, the awkward time at which it was taken.  A good many farmers <Col N="724" /> believe that it is through sheer ignorance in those who control the Tariff Commission that evidence was taken at that time.  I do not like to have to say that, but that is the case, because September is generally the month in which farmers sell their oats. The Minister for Agriculture thought that oats was not sold for cash&mdash;that it was fed.  Now he realises that is not the case.  A number of complaints have reached me during the last week or ten days that while a number of men wanted cash they did not want to sell their oats.  A number of them will now be put in a very awkward position.  Some of them have been compelled to sell.  I think it is a pity this tariff was not brought into operation a month or two ago.  There should be no trouble in calculating these things.  We think that this tariff should have been introduced when the Dáil met or before it met.  If that had been done farmers would have known what they were going to get for their oats.</P>
      <P>I think that when the Tariff Commission did impose this tariff it might as well have prohibited the importation of oats altogether.  If that had been done outside countries would have thought a lot more about us.  It is a poor thing to say that we have to import oats, that when we have a fine season and a good harvest and perhaps a surplus of oats we have not business capacity enough to store it to meet the requirements of a season when the supply is short or perhaps not of good quality.  I do not think that any oats should have to come in here at all.  The Minister admits that he will get nothing out of this.  If oats does come in the collection of the tariff on it will cost something.  I think it would simplify matters if the importation of oats was prohibited altogether.</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 1 put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. S.T. O'Kelly Mr. S.T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Resolution No 2, I just wish to say it is my opinion that, in any normally governed country where the policy of the Government either through force of circumstances or the force of public opinion or whatever the force might <Col N="725" /> be had been so completely reversed as the policy of the present Free State Government has been on this question of tariffs, the Government would get up and resign.  That is what would have happened in any normal country. This country has not yet probably, according to some people, reached a stage of normality.  Therefore, the Government, despite the fact that they have been completely reversed, that they have had to completely reverse their own declared policy on tariffs as instanced in the case of this tariff on oats and as recently happened in the case of the tariff on butter, still hang on to office.</P>
      <P>I know they have claimed that their policy has been to refer these matters to the Tariff Commission.  They have claimed that in the House, and sometimes elsewhere, but there has not been anywhere a more vigorous opponent of tariffs in general than the present Minister for Agriculture.  He has in season and out of season declared that he has no belief or faith in tariffs of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but in this instance he has had to reverse his policy in standing up here to advocate and to agree to the advocation and adoption by the Government of a tariff on oats.  He had to do the same recently in regard to the tariff on butter. Despite that he has the face to remain in office.  Having been completely, as much as any public man can be, reversed in policy, he still holds on to office.  It shows what political morality and public morality are so far as the Government are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House at this stage, but I think it right to express complete dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce towards this Bill.  When the Bill was in Committee, very great pressure was put on the Minister from various sides of the House to amend Section 2 so as to give him power to apply the Bill to all trades whether or not application was made by these trades to have it applied.  The general feeling of the Dáil appeared to be that that compulsory power should rest with the Minister.  He has, however, made it clear that he has no intention of availing of it, although he has in response to various requests amended the Bill. It is my view that the Bill, if applied in the manner in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated, will be practically useless, that in fact the Bill will only operate in respect of such trades as do not require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I would like to express dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Minister in relation to the question of premiums.  The general view of the Dáil as expressed in the course of the Committee Stage was that the premium system in respect of apprenticeship was undesirable, and that even though it might not be possible to abolish it completely at the present time, it should be modified and restricted. In response to that general view the Minister for Industry and Commerce brought forward an amendment on the Report Stage designed to restrict the premium arrangements in respect of trades that were designated. A certain flaw in that amendment was pointed out by Deputy Moore.  He <Col N="727" /> showed that there was a certain interregnum in respect of which confusion might arise, and the Minister took advantage of that flaw to vote against his own amendment and to get his Party to vote against it, with the result that the position in respect of premiums has been left unchanged. I think that although no advantage will be secured by refusing to pass the Bill now, we can only do so in the knowledge that it is not likely to be effective, and that the Minister has only introduced it here because he considered it his duty to do so following the report of the Committee on Technical Education, without any intention of making their recommendations effective.</P>

      <P>I have to support the views expressed by Deputy Lemass.  I want to draw attention to the new section in the Bill, Section 23, in regard to which the marginal note is &ldquo;Interference with premiums.&rdquo; There is nothing in the section in regard to premiums any more than in any other section.  That is the marginal note which also appeared on the amendment paper, in regard to some of the amendments, but I did not draw attention to it at the time.  I think it will be seen that it has no reference to the section.  I wish to say, as I said briefly on the occasion of the Committee Stage, that I believe this amendment will have the effect of making the Bill inoperative.  It is looked on with very great suspicion by those whose co-operation is necessary to make the Bill a success.  Since this section was before the House I have learned that very many of the trade unions regard this as something which will interfere very seriously with their possible activities.  Whether that is so or not, the effect of it will be undoubtedly that the unions will be very suspicious and, in my opinion, there is very great danger that they will simply have nothing to do with the Bill at all.  They may be liable to be hauled before the courts, convicted and fined a sum not exceeding £20, if they engage in, what they regard in any case, as legitimate union <Col N="728" /> activities.  I therefore throw out that warning to the Minister and I sincerely hope, before the Bill is finally completed and passed into law, that he will reconsider his attitude in regard to the acceptance of Section 23.  I pay special attention to that because I do happen to know that while the unions are anxious to do what they can to work the Bill and make it operative, the insertion of this section, almost at the last moment, and the manner in which it was inserted, have, I believe, removed any hope from their minds that it is going to be in any way beneficial.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to reconsider the position with regard to that particular section.</P>

      <P>Personally I am not very enthusiastic about this Bill.  I would have much preferred if we had a Bill on quite different lines, as I pointed out on Second Reading.  In view of what Deputy O'Connell has stated about Section 23, I would like to point out to him that Section 23 only operates after a decision has been arrived at by the Apprentices Committee. On that Committee are representatives of the trades and representatives of the employers, and the object of this particular clause is that when that Committee, so composed, has come to a decision, no outside body should interfere with that decision.  If we do not get a regulation of that kind, how is the Bill, imperfect as it is, to operate?  In other words, as I pointed out on the last occasion when the Bill was before the House, if the Apprentices Committee gave a certain instruction to an employer to carry out a certain regulation perhaps the Union official would come along and say: &ldquo;Well, if you carry out the instruction of that Committee it is contrary to the regulations of our Union and we will have to consider the position and possibly deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the employer to do in those circumstances?  Which authority is he to follow&mdash;the authority of the Committee on which there are representatives of the Trade Unions, or the authority of the Trade Unions on the other hand?  This would make it clear to any employer, should such circumstances <Col N="729" /> arise, which authority he was to follow.  I think the Deputy, in what he said on this particular section, visualises quite a different state of affairs to what would arise under the Bill.  He forgets that this instruction is given by an authority composed of representatives of both sides.  It is not, in any sense, a decision arrived at by the employers' organisation, nor, on the other hand, by the trade unions.  It is a decision arrived at by a joint body, and they have authority for dealing with this problem of apprentices. We ought to give to that decision the authority that is necessary to carry it out.  That is all this does.</P>

      <P>I must endorse what our leader, Deputy O'Connell, has said in this connection with regard to Section 23.  As one of the supporters of this Bill since it was initiated I feel that Sections 22 and 23 are unacceptable. Although it is said that the trade unions are rather conservative I have always held that every trade and craft in this country should be opened to the poor man's son as well as the rich man's son.  I have always felt it was wrong to make trades and crafts closed boroughs, but I am amenable to reason, and when we find that many of those trades and crafts might if not made closed boroughs, eventuate in certain employers demanding and receiving premiums from boys who had no connection with the particular trade, through percentage or otherwise, I feel the Bill is imperfect in that respect.  I would prefer to see some section introduced which would make it possible by arrangement with the trade union&mdash;and I feel the trade unions would be agreeable in this&mdash;to provide that a certain percentage of vacancies in the various designated trades should be kept open for boys who had given evidence of their fitness for these particular crafts or trades.  In my view the premium system is a scandal and has been abused very much in this country.  I know cases where boys were apprenticed and parents or guardians paid fees of anything from £40 to £100 and these boys got nothing whatever in exchange.  They were not taught a decent trade, profession or craft.  I <Col N="730" /> personally would like to see this whole system of premiums abolished, and though it may be an inherent fault in some of the trades unions that they will not permit others to enter their crafts I feel a greater abuse is that of extracting premiums from parents and guardians of boys entering certain crafts.  I was rather astonished to hear Deputy Moore defending the premium system some time ago.</P>

I feel that the Bill would be more acceptable if accommodation could be found with regard to these two sections.  I do not know whether it would be possible under the Standing Orders to refer this back so that something might be done to reach accommodation between the views represented by Deputy Good and the suggestion made by Deputy O'Connell.  I do not know if that could be done, but I think a way out should be found.</P>

      <P>I have had urgent representations setting out the facts in this case.  It appears to me that it is most unfair that individuals who have been so public-spirited as to go to the expense of carrying this case to the highest court in the land, who have produced results such as have been produced for the benefit of the country and who have forced the Ministry to remedy the defects of their own negligence, should be victimised.  There <Col N="732" /> was no reason at any time why the Minister should not have prevented this from occurring.  It is well known that members of the legal profession and several of the judges tried to prevent a case like this from coming on before until the Ministry had an opportunity to set matters right.  It was a matter of which everybody with expert knowledge was aware.  Now that a case has been brought and public attention concentrated on the matter, the individual who went to the highest court of the land will only get out of the action £85.  He will be obliged to pay a great part of his costs, which are very considerable, because costs will only be allowed on the old County Court scale.  That is absurd, and these people are going to be victimised because of some abstract principle about not interfering with a judgment.  As a matter of fact, this does not interfere with the merits of the main case at all.  It is purely a technical point. It is only a matter of costs and has nothing to say to the essence of the decision or the merits of the case as between the parties.  It is only setting right the machinery of the law which should have been set right long ago. If the Ministry want to maintain some abstract principle, which it is very difficult to understand or see any reason for, they should, as an ex gratia matter, a matter of justice and from the point of view of the public, indemnify these people to the extent of the costs in which they have been involved for the benefit of the public.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Little will not press this amendment.  If he does, I shall be obliged to vote against it.  Although the Deputy refers to this as an abstract principle, I think it is a very important principle.  The amendment would introduce a new principle and a very objectionable one. This House would, in effect, be reversing a judgment of the Supreme Court. Deputy Little says that this only refers to the costs and does not interfere with the merits of the case.  That is quite right, but the question brought before the Supreme Court had not to do with the merits but with the question of costs.  It was the question of <Col N="733" /> costs alone that came before the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court decided in a particular way in that case and if this Parliament were to do something which would, in effect, reverse the decision of the Supreme Court, it would be wrong in principle. If that were extended, as it might well be extended, I think it would lead to a very objectionable practice, in which this Parliament would reverse decisions pronounced in the courts.  There is a very grave constitutional danger involved in this amendment, even though the principle be an abstract one, as Deputy Little suggested.</P>

This reversing was done in Lynam &amp; Butler where it was applied directly to the case.  The result was to reverse the whole position.  Then, again, the judges have reversed their opinion as shown by the case of the Sligo Corporation. There is no constitutional question at issue.  The thing has been fractured in every limb so far as reversals go.  Here, it is only a question of doing justice to a particular individual. I suggest that that is the supreme principle and ought to over-rule the others.</P>

      <P>So far from doing justice, Deputy Little's amendment would do injustice.  There were certain parties to the case.  One of them has got certain rights against the other as regards costs.  These rights are to be swept away from that individual because Deputy Little has got an interest in the other individual. That is precisely the suggestion that Deputy Little is putting before the <Col N="734" /> House at the present moment.  Deputy Little says the administration should remedy the defects of their own negligence. There was no negligence on the part of the administration.  Deputy Little knows perfectly well that if the Rules of Court had been passed here in March, 1930, this case would never have arisen.  Deputy Little knows that I brought the rules before this House and that, so far from being negligent, I impressed upon the House as vigorously as I could that those rules should become law.  Deputy Little was one of the gentlemen who voted against that.</P>

We did all in our power, by sitting during holiday periods and at other times, to expedite the reports on the working of the Courts of Justice Act.

      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it possible for the lessees of property to insure the property with whatever firm they think is best.  Under the present arrangement very often head landlords who are only interested in ground rents insert in their leases a clause obliging the lessee to insure with some particular insurance company.  That is purely a matter of personal interest. Very often it happens that the particular agent or solicitor is the agent for some insurance company and in order to forward their own interests <Col N="737" /> they are placing a restriction on trade. They are preventing the other ordinary first-class business firms from getting that insurance business.  It is an absurd and out-of-date arrangement altogether because in the case of the ground landlord he is perfectly secure. There is no question in that case of his losing anything by the particular company that he is insured with.  The lessor in that case is entirely liable. No matter what happens to the premises he is bound to pay that rent and persons who pay head rent like that are always persons who would not be so foolish as to victimise themselves by insuring with a company which would go bankrupt or could not pay the insurance money, so that is one of these fossils which we ought to get rid of, something which is simply in itself a restraint on trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal more in this than has come out in what Deputy Little has said.  This is really in my mind a very great protection to the lessor.  For instance, I could give cases where it has meant a great deal of money to the lessor. It is not so much that one company is a better company than another, but that the lessor has more intimate dealings with one company than another.  A case I have in mind is one where the lessee was bound to insure with a certain company in accordance with a lease and did so. He afterwards withdrew from that company and insured with another. Instead of insuring in his own name alone he insured in two names leaving out the name he was pledged by the terms of his lease to put in, that of the actual lessor.  The insurance was effected leaving out the lessor's name altogether and the names of a bank and of the lessee were put in so that the lessor's interest in the premises was not secured at all.  If the terms of the original contract had been adhered to information in that respect of the change of names would have been supplied to the lessor and his interest would have continued to be protected.  It is really to avoid cases which do arise of unfair dealings with the lessor that this contract with a special company is insisted on.  It <Col N="738" /> is not because of interest in one company more than another or because one company is safer or it is not to interfere with business.  It is to protect the lessor's interest and I hope that the Minister will not agree with this amendment.  It is not only bad because it is retrospective, but it is bad in principle because of the damage to the lessor's interest in the premises.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  Deputy Little says that in the case of a ground landlord the ground landlord would not be interested whether the premises would be insured or not.  I cannot follow that argument.  In the first place I would like to point out, however, that I have seen it confined to the case of a ground landlord and tenant.  It is put in single lease whether it is between the <Col N="739" /> ground landlord or the building tenant or between the owner of a house and the tenant who is only there for a couple of years.  The clause is, according to this amendment, to be exactly the same, and if I take it even in the case of a ground landlord the ground landlord insists on insurance because if he gets his insurance his rent is secured.  He has got valuable premises which are there as security for his rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the house is burned down security for his rent goes, and if the premises have been insured with an insolvent insurance company or an undesirable insurance company he may not get the value of the premises.  But he is vitally interested in having the premises rebuilt in order that he may have security for his rent.  Deputy Little says that the rent would continue to be payable after the premises had been burned down.  I do not think that that is quite the case.  I have not been dealing with real property for some few years now.  My recollection of the subject is not as good as it was, but there is a section in Deasy's Act which voids leases when the premises have been burned down.  That is certainly my recollection.  I have not got the Statute here to refresh my memory.  The real thing is that the lessor should be entitled to choose his company, that he should be able to be satisfied that he has a solvent company to deal with.  Deputy Little says that some companies are smarter than others in getting business.  Some go to the landlord's solicitors and manage to get them to give them their business.  I do not see how we could give any assistance to non-energetic insurance companies at the expense of energetic insurance companies.  I would advise the insurance companies that if other companies are getting at the soft side of landlords who are giving leases, they should go and exert themselves and look for business.  That however, I submit, is completely alien to the question which we are debating now, because as to whether one insurance company is doing well or showing good business methods or not, has really nothing to do with the Town <Col N="740" /> Tenants Bill.  What we have got to consider is whether it is not right that the person who leases property should have security, the ordinary accepted security that his contract will be carried out.</P>

      <P>The idea of a landlord letting premises for a few years allowing anybody except himself to insure the premises is absolute nonsense.  If he is giving a short lease he insures his own premises.  I left that argument out entirely because I paid the tribute to the Minister that he knew it, but apparently he did not.  I am really dealing with the other kind of case.  In the other cases there is only one way of getting out of paying your head rent, that is by assigning the property to a man of straw.  I am sure that is as well known to the Minister as it is to me.  There is no other way of getting out of paying a head rent if premises become such a burden on your shoulders except assigning them to the first beggar you meet on the street.  Otherwise your obligations are there all the time to pay your ground rent or your head rent.  Everybody in the property market knows that the securest interest a man can have for investment is head rent.  If a man wants to have substantial security he goes in for head rent.  They do not pay such a high rate of interest because they are such absolute security. So from the point of view of the head landlord he is not directly concerned to any great extent in the matter of whether he is secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of it which I did not press.  Most of these agreements unfortunately are to the injury of Irish companies as against British companies.  From that point of view there is a serious national issue involved. It is always to the victimisation of Irish companies that these particular leases work and they are going to continue to work like that.  All the valuable property in and around Dublin and other parts of Ireland are <Col N="741" /> in the hands of people who hand a large amount of valuable insurance business to the companies.  It means that money is pouring out of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has proved a great deal too much because the Deputy has really put forward an argument which if followed to its logical conclusion would mean that every covenant contained in a ground lease for insurance shall be null and void because he says it is no value to the head landlord.  Why force a tenant to insure at all?  That is the only logical conclusion to which you can drive Deputy Little's argument.</P>
      <P>The difference between Irish insurance companies and non-Irish insurance companies I do not know nor do I know that the tenants would be more likely to go to Irish insurance companies than they would be to go to English insurance companies, or that the landlords are more anxious to go to English insurance companies than Irish insurance companies, but I am pretty sure of this, that the average tenant would go to the insurance companies which charged him the very smallest possible premium.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:</P>
      <P>In page 28, Part VII, before Section 56 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The lessee or tenant in any lease made after the passing of this Act shall not (in the absence of any agreement in writing to the contrary) be liable for or called upon to pay the law costs or any part of the costs (other than stamp duties) of the lessor or landlord of or incidental to such lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  There is a considerable amount of abuse, especially amongst certain types of agents who sell property. Very often the layman does not understand these things.  He knows that the price of a house is so much, but he does not know that he is being involved in the costs.  It is the practice with a great many good firms of <Col N="742" /> solicitors always to do exactly what is suggested in this amendment, so that the client may know exactly where he is and how much money he is being let in for.  It often happens that the purchaser is very disgusted afterwards when he finds that he is being let in for a considerable amount more than he expected.  This is a small matter and one that is very fair to the general public and does no injury to anybody. It really means that by doing something that is fair you add to the credit of the profession, because clear bargains make good friends, and this is really making a clear bargain in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The law of vendor and purchaser has been very well settled through many generations as to what is right and proper.  It is one of the principles of the ordinary law of vendor and purchaser that the lessee will pay the costs of the lease. That has been settled for generations. I agree with Deputy Little that in most cases before a lease is entered into there is an agreement for a lease. The agreement for the lease sets out the terms for the contract and invariably it is that the lease will be executed at the expense of the lessee, not at the expense of the lessor.  That has been invariably the custom whenever there is a written document and is the ordinary custom where there is no written document.  I do not think that we ought to accept an alteration of such a long established implied custom.  There are similar implied customs.  Of course the Deputy knows that the law of vendor and purchaser is such that the mortgagor pays the cost of the mortgage.</P>

      <P>Of course a mortgagor is in a different position.  In any case I am sure the Minister realises that this will not mean a change of practice.  It will make those agreements to be put in a slightly different form because in every case what it really does is to insist that it should be expressly set out in his agreement that the purchaser will pay, so that he has full knowledge of what he is going to pay for.</P>

      <P>The Bill as it now stands is a considerable improvement upon the measure introduced into this House.  In so far as improvement has been effected, we are glad.  We are particularly glad that the amendment which has caused the Ceann Comhairle so much difficulty has been inserted. That amendment will confer benefits upon the tenants of shops and houses in rural areas as well as in urban areas. Unfortunately, however, the main defect in the measure is unchanged.  I refer to the conditions to be complied with by the tenants of residential houses desiring statutory right to a new tenancy.  The ridiculous provision that these tenants must have had forty years occupation either by themselves or their predecessors in Title has not been deleted.  To a very large extent the efficacy of the Bill and its benefit to town tenants have been destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was thought when the Town Tenants' Commission Report was published and when it was known that the Dáil was at long last going to tackle this problem that a new Magna Charta for tenants would be forthcoming. Some attempt to improve that Magna Charta has been made, but the attempt has been largely nullified by the Minister's insistence on the retention of this provision.  I do not know that it is possible that anything I say now would influence the Minister or soften his heart so that he might be induced to consider an amendment of that particular section before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  If he re-examines the whole thing he will find that no dangers <Col N="745" /> will arise from a substantial reduction in the term of years and that considerable advantage will be conferred upon a large number of people who are expecting that this measure will give them the security which at present they have not got.</P>
    <P>The desire on the part of the average householder to feel that he cannot be disturbed except he refuses to pay his rent or breaks his contract has not been met.  There are very few householders who can comply with the extraordinary conditions in the Bill. They are being denied security and I think they will feel that undue influences were placed upon the Executive by those representing the landlord's interests in order to deny them that security.</P>
    <P>The case the Minister made against the amendment of that section was very weak.  I am sure he will realise that if he re-examines the matter in the interval between this debate and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad.  I have very little hope, however, that the Seanad will of its own initiative endeavour to force the Minister to amend that section.  If he takes the initiative he will no doubt have his way.  It rests with him, therefore, whether or not these tenants will be protected.  In the interests of the people who are most likely to welcome the Bill if it meets their requirements, I asked him to reconsider the matter and see whether it is possible to reduce the period of 40 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that before the Bill finally passes the Minister should read his own speech in defence of the section to which Deputy Lemass refers.  I think that speech is the strongest justification for altering the section.  The Minister said there that one reason for giving a new tenancy was that the tenant had got into the habit of regarding his residence as his home; that it took forty years to establish that feeling; and that it would be ridiculous to say that that feeling would arise after five years.  Apparently the Minister forgot that as the section stands he gives this privilege to a person who may be only one year in the house.  That confusion arises through the Minister and other <Col N="746" /> Deputies who spoke on the section forgetting all about the phrase &ldquo;predecessors in title.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In my opinion &ldquo;predecessors in title&rdquo; should have been left out of the section.  Why should any one benefit by reason of the fact that he goes into a house that has been inhabited for years by predecessors in title, whatever that phrase means?  I doubt if any two Deputies are in agreement as to what it means.</P>
      <P>Assuming there were a general meaning for it, why should it be that if I go into a house inhabited by my predecessors in title for 39 years, I am entitled after one year to certain privileges denied my neighbour who has been in continuous tenancy of his house for, say, 35 years?  That is ridiculous legislation.  I am sure more will be heard of it in the Seanad. It is certainly a most curious principle of legislation to give people an advantage in law through a circumstance that they have had nothing to do with bringing about.  If a person is lucky enough to enter a house inhabited by those vague people known as predecessors in title for say 39 years, at the end of one year he becomes entitled to certain privileges. His neighbour who has not been lucky enough to get possession of such a house, but who may have been a continuous tenant for even 37 years, cannot enjoy such advantages if he is given notice to quit.</P>

      <P>I have really nothing to add to what I have already said on the Bill.  This question now raised by the Deputy was very fully threshed out.  It was one of the very few points upon which we divided in the course of this Bill.  Deputy Lemass has said that the Bill has been very considerably improved.  The Bill has been improved on the Committee Stage.  The main principles have remained, but some of the Bill has been improved.  If I may say so, I would venture to say that that was because this Bill was tackled in Committee in a very much better spirit than the ordinary Bill which comes before the House is tackled.

    <P>Question again proposed: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is called the Road Traffic Bill.  It might be more accurately described as being a Public Safety Bill, and, as such, it is likely to be the only Public Safety Bill introduced by this Government that Deputies on this side will welcome.  In fact it is a Public Safety Bill, much more urgently needed than any of the others for which the Government has been responsible.  We hear a lot about the effects of civil disturbance, and so on, but I do not think we ever had a war or civil war in this country which has produced the same number of casualties per year that the ill-regulation of traffic has been responsible for.  As I pointed out last night, we have had for the last few years in the Twenty-six Counties an average of four killed and 70 injured per week in motor accidents. These figures indicate the extreme necessity for the bringing in of a Road Traffic Bill in order to bring traffic under control in some way so as to reduce the danger to life and limb on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, in fact, the size of these figures which leaves the Minister open to such criticism for having delayed so long and so unduly the introduction of this measure.  I said last night that as the Bill is designed to make the roads safer for users than heretofore and to reduce the number of accidents, it has one outstanding defect, and that is that it ignores the pedestrian.  That fact becomes of particular significance when we study statistics relating to accidents which are available to us. These statistics show that in the great majority of cases accidents arise out of the negligence of pedestrians and not out of the negligence of motorists. <Col N="748" /> The figures for 1929 show that in respect of fatal accidents ten occurred as a result of collisions of one kind or another; four occurred through persons falling from vehicles; sixteen through pedestrians crossing the road not at road-crossings; three occurred through people boarding or alighting from vehicles in motion; three from persons walking on the roadway; eleven from persons suddenly rushing off the footpath on to the roadway, and two from persons playing games on the street.</P>
    <P>Our experience as to the cause of accidents is similar to that in England and I think in most other countries. In England very valuable data were compiled for the British Commission on Road Traffic by the National Safety First Association from information voluntarily supplied by a number of coroners.  From that information it was shown that 43 per cent. of the fatal accidents were attributable to the negligence of pedestrians and only 39 per cent. to causes presumably under the control of motorists; 7 per cent. were due to defective vehicles, and 11 per cent. were due to the state of the road, weather conditions, fire, or similar causes.</P>
    <P>If our main purpose is not merely to facilitate the enforcement of the licensing regulations and matters of that kind but to make the roads safer for the people to use whether as pedestrians or motorists, then this Bill falls very far short of our requirements.  It is, of course, possible that the Ministry are contemplating action of a supplementary nature designed to diminish accidents.  But we should be quite clear in our minds in any case that this Bill is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the most fruitful causes of accidents and particularly accidents to young people is the absence of adequate playing grounds in our cities.  I am satisfied that no matter what Traffic Bills are introduced here, so long as the children of the poor have to play on the streets, accidents will continue to occur.  We would do much more to reduce the danger to these young children by providing them with proper playing grounds than by introducing one hundred <Col N="749" /> Bills of this nature.  Similarly the provision of footpaths on the country roads would also reduce the number of accidents considerably.</P>
    <P>I think that in this Bill steps should be taken to suppress what the Americans call jay-walking.  I think that we have in Dublin a higher percentage of jay-walkers per head of the population than most cities in Europe.  If we make it a criminal offence for a motorist to drive his car negligently to his own danger, we should also take action to prevent pedestrians walking on the roadway to their own danger.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a Public Safety First Campaign for the purpose of instructing pedestrians as to the dangers arising out of the careless use of the roadway.  There should be imposed upon everybody who is using the roads the obligation of providing for his own safety and we should see that he has means of doing so.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill itself have been dealt with in considerable detail by Deputy O'Kelly.  He has indicated that although we approve of the general purport of the measure, we will try to amend it in a number of important points.  The part of the Bill which deals with driving licences provides the police with increased facilities for enforcing licensing regulations. That is all to the good. An innovation in this regard is the declaration of fitness which persons applying for a licence will have to make, or the necessity to secure a medical certificate in order to obtain a licence.  It is my view that that particular regulation will be of very little value.  It has been said that at present a blind man can get a licence to drive a car.  While that is undoubtedly true it is also true that very few blind men do get a licence.  I am personally satisfied that there are many more accidents caused by persons driving cars who are mentally unfit to do so than by persons driving cars who are physically unfit.</P>
    <P>The remedy for that would appear to be an actual driving test.  There are, however, as the Minister and other speakers indicated, very strong objections to that.  We should not, however, give ourselves the impression <Col N="750" /> that the new regulation which this Bill is going to make will be of very considerable benefit.  Although it is not likely to do any harm and will only create a little more trouble to persons desiring to obtain a licence, the benefits are likely to be small.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with speed limits.  It is proposed to retain maximum speed limits for all classes of cars except light motor cars, in which case the speed limit is abolished, although there is a provision designed to set 30 miles per hour as the standard speed.  A strong case has been made in this and other countries against speed limits of all kinds on the ground that they obtrude a criterion of illegality which is not the best one.  It has been, I think, established that excessive speed in itself is seldom the cause of accidents. The other argument has been that it is very difficult to make maximum speed limits effective without very costly police supervision.  In the case of the ordinary light motor car it is my personal experience that under ordinary circumstances 30 miles per hour cannot possibly be described as dangerous driving.  On the majority of the new trunk roads in the country, on which traffic is not excessive and on which there are few pedestrians, a speed of 35 or 40 miles, or even 45 miles per hour, is seldom dangerous. There are circumstances, as Deputy Kelly said, when a speed of 20 or 25 miles per hour might be highly dangerous, and I think that we should direct those responsible for the enforcing of traffic regulations to devote their attention not to the speed as such at which a car is travelling, but to the speed in all the circumstances.  It is therefore advisable in my opinion that this provision concerning the 30 miles per hour for light motor cars should be deleted from the Bill.  I do not think it will be any advantage.  It will merely mean that a motorist who is travelling, say 35 miles per hour under circumstances which appear to make it quite safe for him to do so, should he become involved in an accident, may be charged with and convicted for negligent driving even though he was not driving negligently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> There remains, however, the case for speed limits in respect of other classes of vehicles.  At first sight, it does seem strange that we should abolish the speed limit for the ordinary private car and retain it for the commercial vehicle, which is generally driven by a person much more experienced and skilful than the private car driver.  However, in respect of omnibuses and heavy commercial cars, there are other considerations which make a speed limit desirable, but they are considerations which do not properly apply under this Bill.  The first is the fact that one of these heavy omnibuses or lorries travelling at a fast rate over a modern road very quickly pounds it into pot-holes and waves, and makes it dangerous and uncomfortable for other traffic.  There is also the fact that the majority of our roads are not very wide, and that 22 or 26 seater omnibuses travelling along one of these roads at 40 miles per hour become a very potent source of fear to anybody else trying to use the roads.  They create a vibration which affects houses bordering on the roads, and generally speaking, there is a case for restricting their speed, apart altogether from whatever additional safety may be secured by doing so.  On that account, we do not propose to suggest that any of these speed limits should be abolished, but it seems to me on a personal view, that the maximum speed of 25 miles per hour for omnibuses is somewhat too low, and that it might be slightly increased without in any way making the roads more dangerous than the Minister intends.</P>
    <P>A further section in the Bill deals with the question of compulsory insurance. It can be said almost straight away that that particular part of the Bill has nothing to do with safety on the roads.  Its passage in fact might have the opposite effect by making persons less concerned with the consequences of an accident to themselves. I think that the percentage of motorists who are not insured is probably very small.  I would be glad if the Minister could give us an estimate of that position.  Of course, the fact that there is any motorist driving an uninsured <Col N="752" /> car upon the roads which may become involved in an accident, makes this section of the Bill desirable, because it is generally the person who cannot afford to pay the insurance premium who, when he becomes involved in an accident, is unable to compensate the person he injures.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly has made a suggestion, which I very strongly support, that if the State intends to make insurance compulsory it should itself provide facilities for insurance.  I think a State scheme of motor insurance could without difficulty be operated in conjunction with the licensing regulations and might prove profitable for the Road Fund.  There is a problem to be dealt with there in any case.  At the present time insurance companies have what is called a &ldquo;knock for knock&rdquo; system.  If two motorists become involved in a collision both of whom are insured the insurance companies do not waste money fighting out in court who is responsible for the collision but each company settles the claim of its own client.  Because of that system the actual responsibility of a motorist for an accident in which he may have been involved is not examined and it has happened that a perfectly innocent victim of a series of accidents has been denied insurance. What is to be the position of that individual under this Bill?  The decision as to whether or not he is going to get an insurance policy is going to rest with privately-owned insurance companies and apparently the effect of this Bill will be to set up these insurance companies as censors of the road.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is not in accordance with public policy that the insurance companies should be given the power of deciding who shall or who shall not be permitted to drive a motor car.  If the insurance companies feel themselves compelled to take on everybody who applies for insurance under this Bill, whether he is a good risk or a bad risk, there is a possibility that there will be a rise of rates all round. In any case, we think it undesirable that compulsory insurance should be made law without some control over the rates charged for insurance.  If <Col N="753" /> this Bill goes through as it is framed, it is possible, whether it is likely or not, that insurance companies might combine to raise the rates which would have to be paid by anybody who desired to drive a car.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made in some quarters that if the State was not prepared to go the length of initiating a State insurance scheme covering motors, that they should, at least, provide for such persons as are not likely to be taken by the ordinary companies.  The big argument against that is that if that were done every bad risk would be left for the State and almost impossible premiums would have to be charged in order to cover these risks.  It is proposed that drivers of public service vehicles must procure certificates of competency from the Civic Guard authorities.  My personal view is that that regulation is unnecessary. I am completely unable to visualise the kind of test that the Civic Guard authorities are likely to apply.  Either that test will be too severe, to the extent that it will be unjust, or too general to the extent that it will be useless.  There is the danger to which Deputy O'Kelly referred, that a uniform test may not apply all over the country.  The authorities in one area may apply a more drastic test than in another with consequent unfairness.  I think justice demands, however, that persons who are at present engaged and who have been for a period of, say, six months, driving public service vehicles for hire, and who have not become involved in an accident, should be exempted from the obligation to procure this certificate of competency.  I think there are very few people who attempt to drive buses who are not fitted to do so, and I do not think the Minister can give us an account of any accidents which have occurred because of incompetency as distinct from carelessness or recklessness on the part of omnibus drivers.</P>
    <P>Public service vehicles under this Bill are to be licensed by the Civic Guard Commissioner with an appeal against refusal of a licence to the District Court.  There is not in the Bill, and the Minister has not given us any indication <Col N="754" /> of the principles upon which the Commissioner will act.  Will he refuse a licence on any other ground than unsuitability of the vehicle or the applicant? Is it intended to use the powers of the Commissioner under the Bill for the purpose of reducing the number of vehicles on the road, or reducing the number of companies operating vehicles?  The system adopted in the British Act is, in my opinion, preferable. They establish three Commissioners in each traffic area, the chairman being nominated directly by the Minister, one member from a panel prepared by the county councils, and another from a panel prepared by the borough councils.  These Commissioners hear applications in public, and the representatives of the public are entitled to attend the sittings for the purpose of giving evidence concerning the services available on a particular route, and the necessity of or otherwise of increasing these services.  It seems to me that it would be preferable that a similar system should be established here, and that we should have a licensing authority meeting in public and operating a general policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remaining parts of the Bill, 8, 9 and 10, I have not much to say at this stage.  Points will, however, arise in Committee.  I would like to draw attention to the protest which has been made by Cork Borough Council concerning the excessive powers which are being given to the Civic Guard of making bye-laws for the regulation of traffic in the city.  The power to make these bye-laws formerly rested in these councils, but they are being taken from them and given to the Commissioner of the Civic Guard. The councils are not, apparently, even to be consulted in the matter, and certainly have no power to make their wishes effective against the decision of the Civic Guard authorities.  It seems to me that throughout this Bill there is an excessive tendency to leave matters to be fixed by regulation.  Some of these matters could have been dealt with in the Bill itself, and submitted to the House for approval.  I realise the necessity for keeping this Bill in a <Col N="755" /> form which will permit of its adaptation to changing circumstances, but in my view the tendency to leave things to be done by regulation has been carried to too great an extent.</P>
    <P>One curious omission from the Bill is that there is no provision relating to pillion riding.  I think it is generally recognised that pillion riding on motor bicycles is a very fruitful source of accidents.  The British Act made it illegal to carry more than one person as a passenger on a motor bicycle, and provided that that passenger should ride astride.  Recently, I was motoring back from Donegal and I was not travelling at 30 miles an hour when I was passed on the road by a motor bicycle carrying three people.  The roads were wet and the night stormy. I followed that bicycle for a considerable number of miles and I may say that every few minutes I expected to see all three people spilled on the road.  How they avoided an accident at the rate they were going with such a load on that machine I do not know. Consequently, I think it should be made illegal to use a motor-bicycle in that way, or to carry more than one passenger, apart from the driver.</P>
    <P>I would like also to endorse the suggestion made by Deputy O'Kelly in respect to the system of fines adopted here.  A feeling is growing generally throughout the world that maximum fines are undesirable as class legislation. There is no doubt whatever that a fine of £10 might be a mere trifle to one man and a very serious thing for another.  Under this Bill persons guilty of the same offence may be fined the same amount irrespective of what it means to them individually.  Whereas on the face of it they receive the same punishment, in actual fact one person may be much more severely punished than another.  In certain of the Scandinavian countries they have in operation a system of what they call &ldquo;Day Fines.&rdquo;  A person guilty of an offence is not charged the fixed amount, but so many days income, that income being calculated in accordance with fixed administrative rules.  I think we might usefully consider the adoption of such a system here.  It is <Col N="756" /> quite obvious that a man with £3 a week who is fined £50 is much more severely punished than a man with £1,000 who is also fined £50.  Some attempt should be made to adjust the scale of fines so as not to make it easier for the wealthy man who commits an offence than the one who is not so well off.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken power to make general regulations concerning the use of the road by motors.  I think there is an obvious need for a very definite code for the guidance of motor users so that standardised instructions will take the place of the loosely defined and disregarded conventions that are now practised.  The Minister has also power by regulation to prescribe the equipment that will be carried on cars, particularly on public service vehicles.  There is one point on which I am very keen in this connection; it is that buses operating in the city should be equipped first of all with a stop light at the rere or some other sign which will indicate to any one travelling behind when they are going to stop. These buses are supposed to pull in to the footpath when they are about to slow down, but very frequently they pull up in the middle of the street, with the result that quite a number of accidents occur.  It is impossible for the driver of the bus to indicate when he is going to stop.  Similarly, with regard to large buses.  The method at present in use of a driver putting out three or four fingers to indicate that he is going to turn around a corner is altogether unsuitable.</P>
    <P>In Berlin, and in other continental cities, buses and, in fact, all cars are required to be equipped with mechanically signalling arms of sufficient size, particularly on the left side, that make it possible for anyone coming behind to know at once when it is the intention of the driver of the bus or of the car to turn.  I think it would be desirable if a regulation of that kind were enforced here.  These, of course, are all matters that can be far better discussed in Committee than on this stage of the Bill.  I have expressed the general pleasure felt by members of all Parties at the form of the Bill and <Col N="757" /> the manner in which it is worded and framed.  If we succeed in getting it amended in respect to the matters that I have referred to, its passing, I believe, will be a very great benefit to the country and to those who use the roads in any way.  The members who acted upon the Committee, those who gave evidence before it as well as those who assisted in the preparation of the Bill, are to be congratulated on their work.  The only regret I have is that the evidence of their work was not brought before the House earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with the other Deputies who have spoken in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  My main purpose in getting up is to object to the section that puts an obligation on farmers to carry a light at night when driving cattle along the roads.  I have had as much experience, I think, as any member of the House as a motorist, and except on one occasion I have never heard of an accident resulting from a motorist driving into a bunch of cattle on the road.  In that case the man concerned was drunk. No experienced motorist would do that.  There is no danger I think of accidents resulting from that cause.  A good deal, of course, turns on the point that was dealt with in the opening part of his speech by Deputy O'Kelly.  He pointed out that it would be rather difficult to define what would be a safe speed limit.  One man may drive carefully at sixty miles an hour while another man may be driving dangerously at twenty miles an hour.  The Deputy expressed that point of view and I agree with him.  It would be impossible to set down a speed limit which would make everyone a careful driver.  I do not think there is any need to set down a speed limit in the Bill.  If all motor drivers were as careful as, I think it will be agreed, most drivers are, there certainly would be no danger of any motorist driving into a drove of cattle or a flock of sheep.  I cannot conceive any careful driver in charge of a modern car, equipped with the most up-to-date system of lighting, driving slap-bang into a drove of cattle on the road.  The section, in my opinion, is <Col N="758" /> not only unnecessary but it is almost an insult to the farmers of the country.</P>
      <P>I, like many farmer Deputies, have had experience of driving cattle on the roads.  I ask Deputies to consider what the position of a man would be under this section.  He would have to carry a lamp for perhaps fifteen or twenty miles in his hands.  In the course of the journey some of the cattle might rush into a gap.  He would then have to lay down the lamp, run after the cattle and get them back to the road again.  The other cattle in the bunch might have gone on a distance of three or four hundred yards in the meantime. When he returned to pick up his lamp he might find that the wind had blown out the light or that something else had happened to it.  A man would also have a difficulty in carrying a lamp on a rainy or a stormy night.  As a rule it is candles that are put in the lamps used by farmers.  Farmers are not millionaires and cannot afford to provide themselves with electric lights. If, in the case of a man driving cattle along the road at night, the candle is blown out by the wind, what is his position going to be if a Guard comes along?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difficulty may also arise in the case of farmers driving cattle in the evening from a home farm to an outlying farm two or three miles away.  The farmer sets out shortly before sundown and expects to get to his destination before darkness sets in.  If he fails to do that and a Guard meets him, is he to be prosecuted for not having a lamp?  The same thing may occur in the case of a farmer taking cattle to a fair in the early hours of the morning. Although the light at the time may be good enough for the farmer's purpose he may be on the road at an hour when, according to this Bill, he is required to have a lamp.  He may find himself stopped by a Guard and asked why he has not his lamp.  The Guards, generally speaking, display great commonsense in the discharge of their duties, but an officious officer may interfere in a case like that with the result that 15, 20 or 40 farmers taking cattle to a fair in the early morning under such circumstances, may find <Col N="759" /> themselves summoned in the next district court for failing to carry lights.</P>
    <P>I believe that this section in the Bill is quite unnecessary.  As I have already stated, I cannot conceive any motorist in charge of a car with up-to-date lighting equipment driving into a drove of cattle on the public road.  It might be possible that coming around a bend a motorist could not see a drove of cattle on the road.  That also might happen if the man in charge of the cattle had a lamp.  If a motorist drives recklessly round a corner and runs into a bunch of cattle, he does not deserve protection from anybody.  To most farmers this section will prove a very obnoxious one, and if the Minister himself does not bring in an amendment to delete it, I will have to put in one myself.  I cannot see any possibility of danger, and I do not think the section is required.  There may be danger in parts of the city where there is great congestion of cattle, but even there protection is afforded by the city lighting.  Even in regard to the cities I do not think the section is required, and I am of opinion that the Minister should agree to its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very good Bill, but rather marred by being too thorough.  There is too much law; it gives far too much power to the Gárda, and contains too many provisions for Regulations&mdash;all of which are reserved from the Bill&mdash;they will only come later by instalments&mdash;and there is too great a tendency towards the principle of dual responsibility making two different parties responsible for the same offence.  I am sure, for instance, with regard to the excessive amount of law, that anybody reading sub-section (2) of section 131, would agree that it looks a singular matter to be made the subject of legislation.  I hardly think that the question there dealt with is much helped by making a law around it or that any necessity would ever arise for such a law.  Similarly with regard to section 157, I could understand that section being in the Act that was passed during last week, but surely it is hardly <Col N="760" /> necessary as part of the civil law, that &ldquo;any member of the Gárda Síóchána may demand of any person in charge of a pedal bicycle or a pedal tricycle his name and address, and if any such person fails or refuses to give on such demand his name and address or give the name and address which such member reasonably believes to be false or misleading, such member may take such bicycle or tricycle as the case may be, by force if necessary, and retain it until such time as he is satisfied as to the identity of such person.&rdquo; Surely it is driving the law to extremes when any member of the House, cycling from here to Naas, for instance, can be challenged five, seven or a dozen times by a Guard and if the latter has any reason to doubt the name and address of such person, he can at once seize his bicycle and retain it.  I do not think there can be any excuse for such a law as that.  It is tyranny for one thing, and it cannot possibly be necessary.  Then there is that precious phrase &ldquo;reasonably believes.&rdquo; Both in that Section and Section 159 &ldquo;reasonably believes&rdquo; on the part of the Gárdai gives great opportunity for abuse, as everybody will I think admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another instance of what seems unnecessary law, the two Sections which govern the finances of the Bill. First of all, all expenses incurred in connection with the Roads Act, to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, may be defrayed out of the Road Fund and for that purpose moneys out of the Road Fund are to be paid into the Exchequer.  Then in sub-section (3) of the same Section, where the Minister for Finance likes to do so, he can defray the expenses directly out of the Road Fund.  Is there any need for such a provision as that?  Would not the first sub-section be quite sufficient in all the circumstances, that the money would be paid out of the Road Fund into the Exchequer and there dealt with according as it was required.  It must be remembered that the Road Fund does not come under the Public Accounts Committee and if the Minister for Finance decides that a lot of the expenses incurred under the Roads Act of 1920 <Col N="761" /> or under this Act, shall be defrayed direct out of the Road Fund, to that extent the Dáil is robbed of its supervision over the expenditure of such moneys.</P>
    <P>The enormous powers given to the Gardai is I think well illustrated in Section 86.  There it is proposed to enact that any member of the Gardai at any time or in any place, can inspect and examine any public service vehicle, and for that purpose do all or any of the following things: he may enter into any place in which such a vehicle is; if such vehicle is in motion he may require such vehicle to stop; he may require the driver of such vehicle to drive such vehicle forthwith to a convenient place indicated by such member for such inspection and examination; he may require persons in such vehicles to leave it, and then, after he has done all these things, he may decide to prohibit the use of such vehicle for carrying passengers for reward until repairs have been executed.  He may prohibit such vehicle from being moved under its own power until repairs indicated by him have been executed and he may require the owner or driver to submit such vehicle to a further and more detailed inspection.  All of that, mind you, is not merely given to the Gardai. It is given to every individual Garda. Any individual Garda, in the case of a public service vehicle, is entitled to do all the things which I have read out.  Surely the Minister will admit that the ordinary Garda is hardly competent to exercise such functions as these.  Would the ordinary Garda at Rathcoole, Blessington, Balbriggan, or elsewhere, be expected to be able to judge whether a public service vehicle was in a proper condition to continue its journey or whether it was dangerous to allow it to carry passengers or not?  Is there not great room there for interference with the owners of public service vehicles, such interference as would cause much trouble, annoyance and expense?  I hardly think there is need for such extreme powers as those.  I do not know if anybody could believe there is such a need.</P>
    <P>I notice with regard to the regulations that are mentioned in Section 13 <Col N="762" /> that the Minister himself is empowered to make regulations regarding the construction of mechanically propelled vehicles, the equipment, fittings, instruments and so on.  These regulations can be made and put into force. They come before the Oireachtas on the first occasion it meets thereafter, but months may elapse before that may happen.  The Minister takes no power to amend or to revoke regulations he himself makes.  The Minister will admit that it has happened before that Government Departments have made serious mistakes and since mistakes can occur, here is a position being created where if a mistake is made, no matter what the effect of the mistake may be, no matter what danger or confusion or annoyance it may cause either to the public or people owning mechanically propelled vehicles, there will be no power to amend or withdraw it in any way.  I suggest to the Minister that it would have been worth while&mdash;I think Deputy Lemass has already suggested it&mdash;that in that case at all events, seeing that those regulations will be as important, he should attach the first schedule of these regulations to the Bill and have them discussed in connection with the Bill. Seeing that they are to come before the Dáil as soon as possible after publication, I think, considering the length of time the Bill has been in preparation, it would have been a very useful thing to have these regulations attached to the Bill so that the Dáil could see them and give its opinion as to whether they were reasonable or not.</P>
    <P>On the question of compulsory insurance, does the Minister propose to continue the existing law with regard to accidents which are covered by insurance?  So far as I know, the existing law is that if a person is killed in a motor accident, unless negligent driving can be proved, the insurance company is not liable.  If a car skids, runs on to the footpath and a person is killed on the footpath, there are no damages recoverable in respect of the death of that person.  That seems to be a very unfortunate state of affairs and I would like to know if the Minister <Col N="763" /> considers that it is right and just that it should continue.  The number of persons so affected would be large enough to justify special consideration of the question.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is rather a sorry thing for the Dáil that though they may protect property where the accident is due to neglgent driving they cannot give that protection when the accident occurs without the driver of the vehicle being in any way culpable.  For instance, a man who has his cow killed through the skidding of a car cannot recover anything.  If there were negligence, he would be able to recover. The situation of the man who has his animal killed is governed by something that is beyond his control.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what the reasons are which induced the Government to decide in favour of compulsory insurance against damage to property as well as compulsory insurance against damage to life. If my information is correct, that means a difference of about thirty-three and one-third per cent. in the premiums.  As insurance against damage to property is not compulsory in Great Britain, the reasons which induced our Government to enforce it would be interesting to hear.  In most cases, the property of town and city people is insured already.  Seeing that the provision will involve such a very big increase in the premiums, it is open to argument whether the probable benefit to property owners will compensate for that difference.</P>
    <P>Section 51 mixes up, in my opinion, two things that are not quite related to each other.  It would be rather a pity where a case for negligent driving is being tried that at the same time the case for damages should also be under consideration.  An amendment is before the Minister, I understand, from another source on that question, and I shall not dwell upon it at the moment. I hope the Minister will explain what is meant by clause (d) of sub-section (4) of Section 51, dealing with &ldquo;excluded persons.&rdquo;&ldquo;Excluded persons&rdquo; are persons who cannot get damages under this section.  These persons include, in the case of a public <Col N="764" /> service vehicle and in relation only to injury to property, &ldquo;any person who on the said occasion was being carried in or upon or was entering or getting on to or alighting from such vehicle.&rdquo; I wonder what the meaning of that is? Take the case of a farmer who is passenger in a bus.  His cattle happen to be on the road and one of them is killed by the bus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case it will be very much a Committee point.  If the Minister reads the clause carefully he will see that that is not the meaning that would be ordinarily taken out of the section as it stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has one unfortunate feature. If it goes through as it stands, a number of young men will lose their employment.  The Bill prevents licences being given to drivers of public vehicles who are under 21 years of age. Quite a number of drivers of such vehicles at the present time are under 21 and are very competent.  It would be a rather heartless thing if, where no offence has been proved against these young fellows, they were to be told to clear out of their employment until they were 21.  I hope the Minister will agree to amend that provision when the Bill is in Committee.  On the other question of dual responsibility, it seems to me a very foolish thing to make two different parties responsible for the same offence.  For instance, Section 18 (2) makes the motor-owner responsible for the driver if the latter fails to renew his licence.  There is no need whatever for that.  The driver of any vehicle is a responsible person, <Col N="765" /> and it is utterly unnecessary to make another person responsible for his failure or negligence.  I submit there is no need whatever for it, and it will only cause worry and unnecessary trouble.  With regard to the proposals relating to taxis, the proposal which makes it an offence to cause or to induce or direct the driver of a taxi to exceed the speed limit is going to lead to a frantic lot of cross-swearing, a lot of perjury, and a lot of annoyance to people who are perhaps strangers to the city.  Not everyone can read speedometers; and to make an offence of such a harmless remark as &ldquo; I hope you will be able to get to the railway station in time&rdquo; or &ldquo;to reach the hotel before 12 o'clock,&rdquo; on the part of a person who hires a taxi, is making the law ridiculous.  The driver of a taxi ought to be as responsible as any other person in the community.  To take part of the responsibility off him, and to suggest to him that if he is brought up the way out is to accuse the person who hired him of inducing him to exceed the speed limit is not a useful thing in law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He will surely expect it to save him, if he is able to say that he was influenced by the fact that the person in the taxi urged him and said it was a life and death matter that he should get to the hotel or railway station.  That must surely appeal to the driver as a way to get out of the difficulty he finds himself in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It inevitably will affect the judge.  It may not be an excuse in the eyes of the law theoretically, but surely the Minister will admit it will affect the person administering the law.  It is accepted that one of the duties of a judge is to examine all the circumstances of a case and impose sentence in accordance with what those circumstances seem to demand.  If he <Col N="766" /> hears that the driver was urged to commit an offence, and that he was trying to do a good turn to another person, I think the Minister will admit that the judge in that case would be inclined to be lenient.</P>
      <P>There is one section to the operation of which we will all look forward with great interest.  Under Section 3 the Minister is to make regulations for the control and conduct of passengers in public vehicles.  That will give our Puritan Minister a wonderful opportunity, and we will be all agog until the regulations are issued.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that this Bill will be received with acclamation all over the country. It has been waited for for a long time by those who use mechanically-drawn vehicles and also by pedestrians, who have a certain claim for the protection of their life and property.  The Bill should be improved and made as perfect as is possible.  To that end the best brains of the House, on all sides, are apparently being devoted.  There are one or two things that I should like to mention.  I think all drivers should be examined.  I agree there is difficulty about it, but I think it is one of the most important matters in connection with the whole thing that the competency of drivers should be established, and that can be done only by examination.  It is necessary under the Bill in the case of bus-drivers, but apparently it is not thought necessary in the case of private drivers.  But it is among private drivers that the very worst instances of bad driving are to be found.  One may come upon persons among private drivers who are hopelessly incompetent and who should not have a licence at all.  The efficiency of everybody and the competency of everybody to drive a motor car should be determined, because it is not so much the speed as the manner in which a car is driven that makes the danger. Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, I think, remarked that a car might be driven by one person at 45 miles an hour with perfect safety, while another person driving it only 20 miles an hour might prove a positive nuisance to the community. I think it is a very important <Col N="767" /> matter that the competency and physical fitness of a person to manage a car should be clearly established before he is allowed to drive to the danger of the public and himself.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that a matter that I brought forward once or twice, namely, that it should be compulsory on those who use push-bicycles to have a rear light is dealt with.  In Dublin and the country districts these people constitute a very real danger to pedestrians even more so than motor cars.  You are looking out sometimes for a motor-cyclist or a car when suddenly a push-bicycles comes forward and is in to you before you know where you are.  That constitutes a very real danger.  On the road between this and Naas I have seen push-bicycles without a light, long after lighting up time, and in may cases, no rere light at all. There is little or no expense in providing these rere lights.  You can get one in one of Woolworth's establishments for 3d. which will show sufficient light at the back.  There is no expense in regard to it and it is a very real danger not to have one of these lights.  I am glad to see that matter is provided for in the Bill.  Deputy Lemass mentioned the great danger there is in the way buses are pulled up suddenly in the streets.  That is a danger of which I think everybody who has to use the streets at night is conscious.  It is a very real danger.  Many times I have seen accidents of this class averted by an absolute miracle.  These buses are suddenly pulled up without any warning although there are many cars behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the age limit for licensing drivers should be raised.  Fourteen years is altogether too young.  At that age a boy is only just out of school and not fit to drive.  I think that is a matter which should be given serious consideration.  There is another matter which Deputy Sir James Craig spoke to me about, and that is that some regulation should be made to prevent the raucous noises made at night by motors both in the City and in country towns.  These noises are quite unnecessary and are most detrimental to <Col N="768" /> people who are sick or in a bad state of health.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has had the misfortune to be in a nursing home in Dublin or in any big town will know that at night the unnecessary noises that are caused by motorists passing all night by these houses is a great nuisance. Deputy Sir James Craig will no doubt put that matter more clearly than I can, because he has vast experience of it.  I think it is quite plain that the matter should be regulated, and that it cries out very urgently for something to be done about it.</P>
    <P>I think that covers most of the matters that I feel concerned with.  I do think this is a great attempt to make motor travelling in both cities and in the country safe for us, and that when this is improved, and the Bill is passed through its different stages we shall have cause to congratulate ourselves for having put forward such a measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unnecessary to waste a great deal of time in discussing the second reading because the principles involved in the Bill have been accepted on all sides already.  It is during the Committee Stage that a good deal will have to be said in regard to the changes to be made.  As Deputy Wolfe has stated I was afraid I would not get here in time, as I was lecturing, and I asked him to mention the matter of noises. I want to ask the Minister whether any power is taken in the Bill to deal with the excessive or unnecessary noises that arise through the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.  The immoderate use of raucous horns on ordinary vehicles and the want of silencers on motor bicycles create a disturbance about which I have heard complaint after complaint.  If those people are using the ordinary arteries of traffic it is almost impossible for people who are sleeping in the region of these areas to get any sleep after 11 o'clock at night.  Only yesterday a complaint was made to me that the street which runs from Merrion Square through Fitzwilliam Street and Fitzwilliam Square to Leeson Street, a long stretch, is nearly <Col N="769" /> every night used as a racing track by motor cyclists, and that it is almost impossible to get sleep in that locality when those cyclists come out on it.  It is a very serious matter if people are unable to get sleep, and these things should be looked to.  There is no consideration whatever for people who sleep in the front of houses when those vehicles are out at night.  I sleep in the front in Merrion Square, a main artery of traffic, and I know what it means, fortunately I am so used to it that I get sleep.  It is hard, but after a few hours you get your sleep, and when one is asleep one is often aroused.</P>
      <P>I want to know whether attention has been drawn to the fact that it is necessary that silencers should be used for motor bikes because in the majority of cases they seem to ignore the law. If there is a law it certainly has not taken effect.  It is a most extraordinary thing that cyclists are allowed to use bicycles without an efficient silencer.  The second point is that the excessive speed at which motor cyclists go through ordinary traffic is the cause of a great many disasters.  I do not think that anyone will deny that motor cyclists go at far too great a speed in the ordinary traffic to prevent accidents occurring.</P>
      <P>The other thing I object to most strenuously is that the pedal cyclist, when there is a hold-up of traffic, comes in on the right and on the left and catches hold of your car.  In short, when the traffic is held up, people on pedal cycles are allowed to do what they like.  There should be an end put to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to a matter that appears to have been dealt with.  I am sorry I did not hear the discussion, but the regulations and the by-laws must be very clearly defined with regard to buses.  I do not think there is anything more disgraceful in the whole traffic system than the fact that three buses are allowed to start at the same hour for similar destinations, and during the time these three buses are proceeding to their destination they are passing and repassing one another at various points without any consideration for the rest of the traffic.  That <Col N="770" /> must be stopped.  There must be a time-table whereby three buses cannot start for the same place at the same hour.</P>
    <P>The next point which apparently Deputy Lemass mentioned, is that many of the buses stop without any warning quite suddenly, not on the side of the street but actually on the tram-tracks.  Only yesterday a bus stopped absolutely suddenly without any warning in front of me, and it was by the merest chance I was able to get my brakes on to prevent my car running into it.  That must be put an end to also.  These men must do something in order to help the traffic.  With regard to the Bill itself, there will be a great deal of discussion on the Committee Stage.  There is one sub-section that I hope will go, namely, sub-section (3) of Section 46.  Section 46 deals with the prohibition of dangerous driving.  Then there is this foolish sub-section put in: &ldquo;Proof that a person charged with an offence under this section was, at the time at which such offence is alleged to have been committed, driving a mechanically propelled vehicle at a speed exceeding thirty miles an hour shall be prima facie evidence of the commission of such offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who is going to prove that he was driving over thirty miles an hour?  Is it the onlooker?  No onlooker can tell. Is it the man himself?  He is not likely to prove that he was driving over 30 miles an hour.  In other words, it would be very much better to go into the open and say that the law will compel a man to keep within thirty miles an hour than to have a foolish thing like this put down.  How proof can be obtained that a man was driving over thirty miles an hour I do not know.  I would not be in a position as an onlooker to say that any vehicle was going over thirty miles an hour.  Most of us know that fifteen miles an hour would be very much more dangerous driving in congested traffic than thirty or forty miles an hour on the open road.  I am all for careful driving at all times.  I am particularly for slow and careful driving when you come into traffic, but on the open road I have enough of the sporting spirit <Col N="771" /> within me to say that we should not be tied down to even thirty miles.  I was brought on one occasion to the Kingstown Police Courts to answer a charge of having driven at 26? miles an hour on the Stillorgan road.  What happened? I was not told a solitary thing about it.  I did not know where it had happened; I did not know that there was a trap laid for me.  I remembered going down the road and that there was no traffic on it.  The police, who had nothing else to do, brought me down to Kingstown to answer that charge.  I hope there will be no more of that sort of thing.  That was the only time that I had been in the clutches of the law.  On one occasion, when I told a policeman that I never had an accident, that I was a careful driver, he asked: &ldquo;How do I know that you are speaking the truth?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Do you think I would tell a lie?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are all glad to see this Bill.  We want to see certain changes effected in the control of traffic, and this Bill is a tremendous advance on what has been done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The first criticism of the Bill which I make is one that I do not imagine will have any effect on the Bill, but it may affect the mind of the Minister in the administration of the Act afterwards.  This Bill is a codifying act; it is gathering together all the law previously in existence, reinforcing most of it, adding to it, and changing it to some extent.  In doing so the Minister has changed the wording of the old law.  It is always advisable in codifying law to stick as far as possible to the former wording, because it is the law the people have been accustomed to.  It is the law that lawyers know and that policemen have learned to use in framing charges and matters of that kind.  It is necessary to have it as simple as possible, because the mind of the policeman is not very highly trained, and it will take a very considerable time to get them accustomed to the new forms of what is really the old law.  Therefore, it would have been far better to have stuck to the wording of the old law as <Col N="772" /> far as possible whenever it was adopted, rather than to have done what they did.  I hope the Ministers will keep that in mind and that their attention will be given to training these people who are concerned with it to accustom themselves to the law as it has been redrafted.</P>
      <P>Another matter which interests me considerably is giving power to the judge to fix the damages after the jury has made a decision as to who is liable. That, I think, is a very bad departure from an important principle.  The function of a jury, as has often been pointed out from these benches, is not merely to give a technical decision on a matter.  They may sometimes be defective in a thing like that.  It arises from the nature of a thing that laymen might make mistakes of that sort, but it is the lesser of two evils.  It is very much more important that public opinion should get this way of expressing itself in saying what is the general justice in the matter.  The complaint in a great many cases is that juries are too severe in imposing damages.  The reason why juries are severe is because they, as part of the general public, feel that it is too much to be having seventy casualties per week arising out of the traffic, as it is at present, and so in that way the juror gets an opportunity of asserting what is a right judgment from the point of view of the public.  Now the tendency of the Government is to centralise&mdash;to give over powers which properly belong to the public to individuals.  In this Bill power is being taken out of the hands of the juries and handed to the judges. I think that is a very unhealthy change and a breach of principle which is very valuable from the public point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matters to which I wish to refer are details.  The Minister will have to introduce somewhere or other a definition of locomotive because at present by a process of elimination a flying machine in certain circumstances will be included.  I understand there are some important bodies that feel it would be necessary to put in a definition of a locomotive.  One source of security has been found in English motor traffic of which there <Col N="773" /> is no mention in this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will have it in the other Bill that he is going to bring in soon, that is the use of the white line at corners of the road.  It has been found by experience that this is more valuable than taking off corners and breaking down walls.  As long as motor vehicles keep to their own side of the white line turning corners very few accidents will occur.  On all dangerous corners the white line should be used.  It is not expensive and in some cases it is used with great advantage even in this country.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sir James Craig about the silencer.  In a great many countries there are very severe laws and regulations dealing with noise as a nuisance in the public streets.  The law should be vigorously applied in the case of the cities and towns where there must be people suffering severely from this nuisance.</P>
    <P>On the point of speed, I am rather inclined to think that speed does count in the question of negligent driving because according as a person increases his speed he is putting his machine to a much greater test of efficiency. I must say I do think that 30 miles an hour is a reasonable limit because the real danger does not begin until you reach about 35 or 38 miles an hour.  In the case of ordinary cars which have been suffering from a certain amount of wear and tear I am inclined to think that when going at 38 miles you cannot be quite certain about your brakes unless you are very careful in seeing to them beforehand.  Certainly over 45 miles an hour becomes a danger from the point of view of the tyres.  A curious thing is that in most of the very bad accidents that occur it is very competent drivers that are involved.  The learner is not a very great menace on the road.  He may be a bit of a nuisance when you want to pass him out.  If we were to be logical what we should do in applying a test is to prevent the really competent drivers from driving because it is in their case most of the accidents occur.  The fact of the matter is I believe that speed does enter into the situation, even where it is not a question of the cities or public <Col N="774" /> thoroughfares.  We have not got roads like they have in Italy where there are roads exclusively used for motor traffic with no cross-roads.  Some sort of a limit is required.  I agree with Deputy Sir James Craig that the present arrangement in the Bill is perfectly futile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I am glad that this measure has been introduced.  Like other Deputies, too, I feel that in some parts it will require amendment.  I will deal with one or two sections in the hope that the Minister will see his way to tighten a nut or screw here and there and so make the Bill as nearly fool-proof as possible.</P>
      <P>Section 20 deals with an application for a driving licence, but it does not indicate how the assurance in regard to physical fitness is to be arrived at.  The applicant for a driver's licence signs an ordinary form: &ldquo;I hereby declare that to the best of my knowledge I am not suffering from any disease or physical or mental disability which would be likely to cause the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place by me to be a source of danger to the public.&rdquo;  What I am rather anxious to include in the Bill is the granting of a certificate of fitness, physical and otherwise, on the same lines as in the case of the ordinary railway guard or locomotive engineer.  They have to undergo certain tests at stated periods, physical tests, eyesight tests, and so on, to prove their fitness to act as locomotive drivers or guards on railways.  I fail to see why a test of a similar character should not be applied to a man who wants to drive a motor car, either privately owned or plying for hire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 21 the granting of driving licences is referred to and we find here, just as in the previous section, that the age of 14 years is mentioned. With Deputy Wolfe and other Deputies I feel that 14 years should be changed to 18 or 19 years.  I do not think it is right to give a driving licence to a young lad of fourteen, especially in view of the congested state of traffic in cities and towns in the State.  There is no reference to <Col N="775" /> a proper medical test here either: there is simply a declaration that a man is physically fit and capable of driving a motor car.</P>
    <P>Section 28 sets out a special disqualification order.  A Gárda Síochána Superintendent is empowered to disqualify. I suggest that a Superintendent or any Gárda Síochána officer is not an authority competent to decide whether a man is physically fit.  That is a job for the medical profession. Sight and physical tests and general health tests are purely matters in the domain of the medical officer, and should not be left to an officer of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the endorsement of driving licences.  Here we have a number of offences set out which would justify the endorsement of a driving licence.  I do not see reference to any penalty that should be imposed on the driver of a motor car or mechanically propelled vehicle who knocks down a pedestrian and, when called upon to halt by witnesses to the accident, refuses to do so and drives away.  I think there should be some deterrent and I suggest there should be some section inserted which would provide very drastic punishment for the cowardly ruffian who knocks down a pedestrian, drives away and is not brought within the domain of the law at any time for the offence. I have in mind an accident which occurred in Cork City within the last three or four weeks.  A woman was knocked down by a motor car driven at a rate, I am informed, of 35 to 40 miles an hour.  Having knocked down this woman, who, I understand, is in danger of death, the motorist escaped over the North Gate Bridge and he has not been heard of since; as far as the police authorities are concerned, they could not trace him. He drove over the bridge at a terrific rate.  There should be some section in the Bill enabling the authorities, when a scoundrel of the class I have referred to is run to earth, to mete out very drastic punishment apart altogether from whatever the civil law might do.  Such a person ought to <Col N="776" /> be deprived of his driving licence for all time.</P>
    <P>I am in thorough agreement with the principles outlined in the Bill.  I hope it will be amended here and there so as to improve its sections. I feel sure that the Minister will agree that in a Bill of this character which, of course, must have taken a great deal of time to draft, it will be necessary for him to respond to any commonsense suggestions that will be made by Deputies who have experience of conditions in the country.  One individual has not been mentioned in this Bill except in a haphazard way. I refer to the ordinary pedestrian. There is no suggestion for empowering, as they have done in other countries, the local authorities to erect stations in a public street such as O'Connell Street, in Dublin, or Patrick Street in Cork, where pedestrians might stand until such time as the policeman on duty would give the signal for traffic to pass.  These things are very necessary and they would be a natural corollary to a Bill of this character.  I trust the Minister will give favourable consideration to my suggestions.  He should, if possible, make it compulsory on local authorities to have safety stations erected in busy thoroughfares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points of importance to which I would like to refer.  Deputy Anthony dealt with special disqualification orders and he mentioned that power is placed in the hands of a Superintendent to decide the grounds upon which a person should be disqualified.  That particular section gives rather extraordinary powers to an individual, in this instance a Gárda Síochána officer.  I notice there is a right of appeal from his decision.  There might be, for instance, a cranky Superintendent or a man with peculiar ideas, and he might object on grounds that would be utterly absurd.  I agree that certain tests should be imposed.  I might perhaps have personal reasons for objecting to a too stringent, eyesight test.  A Superintendent might insist on a certain eyesight test that many of us who have driven without accident for years <Col N="777" /> would be unable to pass.  I think some definite regulations should be laid down with respect to the qualifications required for an eyesight test.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 46, which has been referred to by Deputy Sir James Craig, is absurd.  That sub-section sets out that proof that a person charged with an offence under the section was at the time of the offence driving at a speed exceeding 30 miles an hour shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the commission of such offence. Who is to know that he is driving at over thirty miles an hour?  The driver is the only man who can look at the speedometer and at the time of the accident he would scarcely be looking at it.  He certainly would take a very broad view of the speed at which he was travelling.  People looking at an accident are very often incapable of estimating the speed.  I think that the sub-section is absurd.  The majority of accidents of this type occur as a result of other parties entering the main road from a side road.  The person entering from a side road has a very great responsibility; a greater onus is thrown on him.  Very often cars will enter from a side road on to the main road at considerable speed, and it is generally in such cases accidents occur.  A big share of responsibility should be placed upon the person driving on to the main road from a side road.  Emphasis should be made not so much upon the driver on the main road as upon the driver emerging from the side road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carrying of rear lights by persons who drive cattle on the roads at night-time is a very necessary regulation. I know there will be a certain amount of hardship thrown upon farmers and those who have to go out driving cattle in the dark along our roadways, but for their own sakes it is advisable that they should carry some warning light, and I consider this a salutary regulation.  Apart from being a safeguard for the drivers of the cattle, it is also a safeguard for the drivers of motor vehicles, and it is in every way a good provision.  I know it will be said that it will cause a lot of trouble to farmers, who will have to keep their lamps lighting and in good <Col N="778" /> condition, and I know farmer Deputies will object; but I think, in the interests of everybody concerned, the provision in the Bill is a wise one.</P>

      <P>We have only until 2 o'clock, and if any Deputy desires to make a statement on the Adjournment Motion I will make this suggestion.  As far as the Traffic Bill is concerned, much of the discussion dealt with Committee points.  There are certain things I would have liked to say, given time, but in order to help Deputies I will refrain from making any statement now.  There may be on the part of Deputies a considerable amount of trouble in framing amendments to this measure.  The important thing, from my point of view and from the point of view of the House in connection with the Traffic Bill, is that the Committee Stage shall be taken at the earliest possible moment so that as much consideration as possible can be given to the large number of amendments that have been submitted by various organisations connected with the motor industry.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>I contemplate a very early Committee Stage; that is to say, to have the Committee Stage on next Wednesday week in order to get the first run over it as early as possible with a view to recommitting the Bill again on Report. I think it would be much more satisfactory if we had the Committee Stage on Wednesday week.  Then there would be a fortnight intervening between the time when the Bill was brought in and the Report.  If it were recommitted on Report, the House will probably agree that that is a satisfactory way of dealing with it.  In that way a lot of unnecessary discussion would be avoided and time would be saved.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept the closing of this discussion now without any further debate on the Second Reading, and I would be prepared to move the adjournment of the House in order that such Deputies as wish to do so can say a word as to whether we should adjourn or not over next week.

      <P>I want to protest very strongly against the Dáil not meeting next week, especially in view of the reason which the President gave this morning for not meeting, namely, that there was no work to be done. I suggested then, and I suggest now, that the motion standing in my name, No. 18 on the Order Paper, does provide very important work for the Dáil. There is no motion that we have had before us since the Dáil met that is more important from the point of view of the people than the motion which asks the Dáil to consider remedial measures for providing useful work for those who are unemployed and to meet the special needs of agriculture.  That is a matter which ought to concern Deputies, as it does undoubtedly concern the people of the country.  If we sat next week to consider this motion we would be only responding to the appeal made in the recent Pastoral of the Bishops, in which they asked people of all political opinions to sink their differences and join together in an endeavour to find a solution for our social and economic problems which will be in accordance with the traditions of Catholic Ireland.  I believe that there is very important work to be done, even if we did nothing else next week but discuss that motion.  I do not wish to go into any argument in support of that; I think the thing is obvious; but I protest strongly against the adjournment.</P>

      <P>I should like if the President would tell us exactly what the members of the Government were doing during the adjournment.  Before the adjournment there were at least four Bills the First Reading of which was taken and which have not yet appeared. There are other Bills the introduction of which was promised before the adjournment, but which <Col N="782" /> were not introduced then and have not been introduced since.  Have the members of the Government been absolutely idle during that time?  No evidence that they have been attending to their duties has been furnished to us.  The sole reason why it is proposed that the Dáil should not meet next week is because of that inactivity of the Government and the failure of the Government to do the work which they had to do.  If the Government will not give us facilities to discuss the matters that they want discussed, they should not deprive the Dáil of the opportunity of discussing matters that the Opposition want to discuss.  We think that the matters which the Opposition are drawing attention to are in the main and in the long run much more important than the various measures which the Government have in contemplation.  There are urgent social and economic problems to be solved, and the proposal of the President to adjourn until next Wednesday week means that the Dáil is going to be denied the opportunity of expressing its views on the manner in which a solution of these problems should be sought.</P>

      <P>I wish to protest against the adjournment.  The Dáil has been on holidays for four months, the greater part of which was spent, apparently, by the Government preparing a Coercion Bill.  Then they come here and spent last week discussing that Coercion Bill and now they have no more work to do.  I say that while the agricultural industry is in its present very depressed state it is the duty of the Ministers, who apparently were too busy settling disputes between the Chinese and Japanese during the last few months, to consider that situation and to propose measures for its relief. I suggest that next week could be very usefully devoted to considering the condition of affairs in this country, particularly in regard to agriculture.  It is unfair and unjust that Ministers, who are paid good salaries for doing the people's work, should start this kind of general holiday stunt.  If they want a general holiday, let them go to the people, and the people will be very <Col N="783" /> glad to give them a chance of a general holiday.</P>

      <P>The best case I have heard for the adjournment has been made by the three Deputies to whom we have listened.  There is an absolute lack of appreciation of what the problem of Government is, of what an economic problem is, and a lack of interpretation of what the Bishops stated in their Pastoral last week.  Just consider for a moment the motion that Deputy O'Connell wants us to discuss next week.  On the one hand, he asks apparently for money, which must come from somewhere, and there is only one place to find it, and that is in the people's pockets.  On the other hand, he wants remedial measures considered for the purpose of relieving the major industry of the country, the one industry in which the major portion of the wealth of the country is involved.  The Deputy lightly puts down that motion, having in mind I presume what the Bishops stated, that we ought to sink our political differences.</P>

      <P>The Deputy got out of swaddling clothes much too soon. The Executive Council, when it considers any proposal, takes a long time to consider the heads of it and to decide upon them to make sure that they are in the best interest of the country. When that is done, what is the next step?  The Deputy knows well that the various instruments making up the decision of the Executive Council are sent to the draughtsman.  How many Bills are before the draughtsman's office at present?  The Deputy never considers that.  He would rather make his speech on the adjournment first and find out afterwards.  That is the problem to be solved&mdash;whether we can get out of the machine that is turning out Bills, more <Col N="785" /> Bills, or Bills more quickly.  As far as the Executive Council's decision on them is concerned, it was given a considerable time ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state whether any Government engineers have been asked to report on the causes of the recent disastrous floods in County Dublin and County Wicklow; and, if so, whether he will require a full investigation to be made with a view to the adoption of schemes for preventing a repetition of such occurrences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>The cause of the flooding was obviously a rainfall so abnormally heavy that the local drainage systems were for the time being unable to carry off the water.  The improvement of local drainage systems is primarily a matter for the consideration of Local Authorities.  Provision already exists in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Act, 1928, and the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1929, by which rated occupiers of lands which are liable to flooding or injury by water may petition the Local Authority to have drainage works executed.  The State may, in approved cases, render financial assistance.</P>
