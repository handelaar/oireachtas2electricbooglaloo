      <P>The annual allowance paid to Mr. Heverin, the late Secretary of the Roscommon County Council, is not a charge on the rates of the county, and no specific deduction is made from grants payable to the County Council in respect of the said allowance.  The amount available for grants to local authorities generally is, however, abated by the amount required to pay annual allowances to Mr. Heverin and others in accordance with the provisions of the Local Officers (Compensation) War Period Act, 1924.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that the Visiting Committee or doctor in Mountjoy Jail directed that the doors of the cell of two prisoners, namely, George Mooney and Seán McGuinness, should be left open during certain hours, and that the said doors have been kept closed during these hours by the prison authorities, and that the prisoners, in consequence, broke their windows for the purpose of ventilation and, further, is the Minister aware that the said prisoners were placed in straight jackets or muffs or other <Col N="162" /> prison device, and that Seán McGuinness has subsequently been spitting blood; and what he proposes to do in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the two prisoners mentioned were allowed, as a privilege, to have their cell doors open during the greater part of the day.  They abused that privilege by leaving their cells without permission and forcing their way into cells occupied by other prisoners.  The privilege was accordingly withdrawn.  I am aware that following the withdrawal of this privilege the prisoners broke the windows of their cells, but the suggestion that this was done by them for the purpose of ventilation is not correct: the ventilation with the cell door closed is quite adequate and is, in fact, the normal ventilation of the cell.  I am also aware that, following the breaking of the windows, the prisoners' hands were secured in muffs so as to make it impossible for them to do further damage.  I am not aware that the prisoner McGuinness has subsequently been spitting blood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to enter a protest against the unseemly haste in introducing this measure and the rapidity with which it is being passed through the House.  It is a very serious matter, if we are to regard it purely from the point of view of getting the best kind of trial, combining the benefits of a good judicial system with the democratic element which has been contained in the institution known as jury trial.  If we wanted to examine and see how that system could be improved, it should not have been done in this hasty way and the Bill should not be rushed through this House as an emergency measure when no emergency exists.  It interferes to some extent with the work which we may be doing in the autumn when we shall have before us, on the promise of the Minister for Justice, a Bill dealing with the whole operations of the Courts of Justice Act.  If the Minister was anxious to improve the system on a permanent basis and to arrive at some system which would remedy any defect that may exist even in a jury system, we could have had that matter brought before us as a Committee.  If the Minister had chosen to put that question before us he could have done so, and in any event, he could have dealt with it in the Bill and have given us an opportunity to deal with it in <Col N="164" /> an impartial and careful way, the only way to establish a proper juridical institution in the country.</P>
      <P>Instead of that we have this Bill foisted on us, rushed from one stage to another, and put through the House as rapidly as possible, while Bills like the Town Tenants Bill, which has been hanging fire for months, and others of equal importance, such as the Transport Bill, have not yet appeared above the horizon and are not being considered. We are, however, being rushed into legislating for nothing in particular.  There is among jurors a feeling that this Bill is an insult and degradation of their office.  Many of them feel that it would be better to revert to the old system and to leave them without this so-called protection. We have done all we can to protest against the introduction of this measure, but, in spite of that, it has been rapidly taken from one stage to another and now brought before the House for final consideration.  The original Act has not done what the Minister expected it would do.  It has not prevented the names of certain jurymen from getting to the knowledge of the ordinary public.  Nothing could prevent that, because the jurymen would have to live under a system of secret inquisition, would have to be accommodated in closely-covered vans, and appear in court in a condition of disguise so that no one would know who they are, before that object could be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the Minister could not reestablish that kind of inquisition in the country, but he did the next best thing, and so he has all the odium of injuring the jury system as a democratic institution without getting any of the benefits which he had hoped would come by the measure.  One would have imagined that in the course of the experience of the measure, commonsense would have asserted itself, and that now, at the time when it occurred to the Minister to reintroduce the Bill, he would at least have left it over until such time as we were considering the whole problem and then dealt with it in the proper spirit, in the spirit of tackling the legal problem of how to deal with the jury system from a democratic <Col N="165" /> point of view, at the same time securing an impartial administration of the law.</P>
    <P>We appear to be in the position now that the Minister wants this Bill for propaganda purposes.  It will not however serve his purpose from a Party point of view because the people have grown cold about all this shouting of &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rdquo;  I am making no reference to either of the Deputies of the House, by the way; I am referring to the story of the boy who had so often given warning of the coming of the wolves that in the end nobody paid any attention to him.  The Minister for Justice has been too often crying out about the breaking up of law and order, and so on, and while doing that with one voice, in another capacity he is trying to create trouble and disorder, so that in every way this Bill is to be condemned. It is to be condemned as ineffective because it does not achieve in any way what the Minister wants.  It is to be condemned because it is breaking in upon the proper system of law and order.  It is ill-considered, and conceived purely from the partisan point of view and not in a cold and impartial spirit.  It is also to be condemned because it is an outrage on a large section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Panicky legislation of this kind is generally produced from the pockets of Ministers in or around by-election or general election times. The attitude of the Minister, in bringing in this Bill at this particular period, is quite in keeping with the policy of the Government for the past seven or eight years.  I quite agree with Deputy Little that the original Act, or that portion of it which purported to make it impossible to have the names of jurymen made known, has not worked out in the way the Minister desired when he introduced the Act.  I do not think that a measure of this kind, apart altogether from the political propaganda which may be made out of it, is likely to create in the minds of citizens of the country who may be called upon to act on juries, the kind of spirit which would make them do their work in the right <Col N="166" /> way and in a courageous way.  Therefore, I do not propose to give a vote in favour of the Report Stage of this Bill.  We read of shootings at particular periods and we hear no more about them when a certain time has passed. We have read of a dump being found in County Dublin.  It was a mistake that it was not discovered in Kildare, but it is not very far away from the border.  This legislation brought in at this particular time is in my opinion brought in for the deliberate purpose of creating a &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; attitude on the part of electors in the constituency where the people are going to be told &ldquo;Vote for the Government or vote for those who&rdquo;&mdash;as they say&mdash;&ldquo;stand for disorder in the country.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another of the impolitic acts of political propaganda upon the part of the Government.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the Juries (Protection) Act, 1929, the ostensible purpose of which was to protect jurors.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to that fact, because I am quite certain that most of the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who are going to vote for this Bill are unaware of the provisions of the original Act.  I should like to remind the House of a few of those provisions and see if I cannot secure from the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party some indication as to the manner in which they are designed to protect jurors. Section 2 of the original Act gives power to transfer certain functions of under-sheriffs.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every county and county borough to which this section is applied by an order made under this section the powers and duties conferred or imposed on the under-sheriff of such county or county borough by Part V. of the Principal Act whether as empanelling officer, summoning officer or otherwise, shall as from the date of such order become and be transferred to and conferred <Col N="167" /> or imposed on the several and respective officers on whom such powers and duties would respectively be conferred or imposed by the said Part V. of the Principal Act if the office of such under-sheriff were vacant, and accordingly the said Part V. of the Principal Act and in particular the expression &ldquo;the empanelling officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;the summoning officer&rdquo; where they respectively occur therein shall as on and from the date of any such order be construed and have effect in respect of the county or county borough to which such order relates as if the office of under-sheriff in such county or county borough has first become vacant within the meaning of the said Part V. of the Principal Act on the date of such order.</P>
    <P>There is no reference there to jurors with the exception of the reference to the empanelling or summoning officer. There is nothing in that section designed to afford protection to any single juror in the City of Dublin or elsewhere.  I would like any member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to get up and on the basis of that section, defend this Bill, produce any single reason in justification of it, or show us how the continuance of that section is going to protect a single juror in the City of Dublin in the discharge of his duty.  Section 3 deals with the secrecy of the jury panel in criminal cases.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Section 50 of the Principal Act shall not apply to a panel of jurors prepared for a sittings of the Central Criminal Court, nor to a panel of jurors prepared for a sitting of a judge of the Circuit Court for the trial of criminal issues, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the empanelling officer and the summoning officer shall treat every such panel as a confidential official document.</P>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other enactment, no accused person shall be entitled as of right to a copy of <Col N="168" /> the panel of jurors from which it is intended that the jury for his trial is to be drawn.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here, and it is common knowledge, that the names of jurors who have been elected to serve upon juries have been published broadcast in certain newspapers, and whilst publication has been broadcast not one of these jurors has been influenced by that publication, not one of them has been ill-affected by that publication, and not one of them has been injured by that publication. Therefore, what protection does the secrecy of the jury panel as proposed by Section 3 of the Act afford to the juror in the discharge of his duty?</P>
    <P>Section 5, to which I would like to draw the attention of the House, is the section under which the principle of majority verdicts was introduced into our jury system.  That section states:</P>
    <P>In every trial before a judge and a jury of a person charged with any crime or offence, a majority vote to nine members of the jury shall be sufficient to determine the verdict, and the judge shall so inform the jury, and the verdict of such nine members or upwards shall be taken and recorded as the verdict of the jury without disclosure of the number (save as in hereafter mentioned) or identity of the dissentients if any.</P>
    <P>I would like that Deputies would bear in mind what the Title of the original Act was.  That Title reads:</P>
    <P>An Act to make further and better provision for the protection of jurors and witnesses concerned in the trial of criminal issues, and for that purpose to amend the Juries Act, 1927, and the law relating to the administration of criminal justice and to authorise majority verdicts in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>The ostensible purpose of the Act was to make further and better provision for the protection of jurors and witnesses concerned in the trial of criminal issues, and for that purpose to amend the Juries Act so as to <Col N="169" /> authorise majority verdicts in criminal cases.  In what way can the introduction of the principle of majority verdicts in the jury system of this country afford any protection to the members of the jury?  I would like the Minister for Justice or any Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches to deal with this measure on that basis, and I would like him to show to the House how the introduction of the principle of majority verdicts into the system of trial by jury can protect a single member of a jury.  There might be some case to be made for the secrecy of the jury panel, but I think that will not stand a moment's examination.  The introduction of the principle of majority verdicts does not afford any protection whatsoever to the members of a jury.  Possibly Deputy Jasper Wolfe may show me how it does.  If it does, I confess to being of a rather dense mentality, for I see no justification for introducing this principle on the plea that it is going to protect a juryman.</P>
    <P>The next section relates to standing mute or refusing to recognise the court.  It reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a person charged in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court with any crime or offence stands mute when called upon to plead to such charge, no jury shall be sworn for the trial of the issue, whether such person so stands mute of malice or by the visitation of God, but in lieu thereof the judge shall himself hear such evidence (if any) relevant to that issue as may then and there be adduced before him, and, if the judge is satisfied on such evidence that such person is mute by the visitation of God, all such consequences shall ensue as would have ensued if a jury sworn for the purpose had found that such person was so mute by the visitation of God, but if the judge is not satisfied as aforesaid, or if no such evidence is so adduced, the judge shall direct a plea of &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; to be entered for such person.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a person charged in the Central Criminal Court or in the <Col N="170" /> Circuit Court with any crime or offence fails or refuses in any way, other than standing mute, to plead to such charge when called upon so to do the judge shall (without prejudice to his powers under the next following sub-section of this section) direct a plea of &ldquo;Not Guilty&rdquo; to be entered for such person.</P>
    <P>Now that deals with a practice which has grown up in the courts of this country for a long period, grown up practically since 1916.  It is one which has been sanctified by the example of good and noble men who have been prepared rather than forswear their principles to suffer whatever penalty the laws of Great Britain or the laws of the Irish Free State might impose upon them.  The change which it has introduced is to my mind an unimportant one.  I think the judge is just as competent as a juror to determine the issue whether a person is mute of malice or by the visitation of God and, therefore, I do not think the issue raised is of very great importance, but I would like the Minister who has put this into the Bill and who is asking the House to continue this principle in operation, to show how the determination of this issue by a judge instead of by a jury is going to protect a juror in the discharge of his functions.  The jury when empanelled has to find a verdict.  It can only find a verdict in accordance with the facts placed before it, same as the judge.</P>
    <P>No matter how misled people may be towards the jury system or the present administration of justice in this country, no matter what their feelings may be, surely no person would dare to visit on the head of a juryman his anger or hatred for finding upon an issue as to whether a man is mute of malice or by visitation of God.  That is one thing, at any rate, upon which any juryman can render a verdict without advertence to any consequences&mdash; we deny that there would be any consequences&mdash;which even the Minister may contemplate in such a case.  In what way, therefore, does the change which was introduced as a temporary measure into the administration of justice in this country protect juries of <Col N="171" /> the future in the discharge of their duties?  In what way is the continuance of that system warranted?  I would like the Minister to address himself to the issue which I am putting straight and plain.  Will he show in what way the operation of Section 6 is going to afford better protection for jurymen who decide whether the prisoner at the bar is mute of malice or by the visitation of God?</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the clearing of the court during certain criminal trials.  It is designed to ensure that the court may be cleared during certain criminal trials.  Sub-section (1) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever at the trial of an accused person in the Central Criminal Court or in the Circuit Court, and after such accused person has pleaded &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; or a plea of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; has been entered for him and before any further proceedings are had, an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent states on oath to the judge presiding at such trial that in the opinion of such officer it is necessary for the protection of the witnesses and jurors concerned in such trial that the public should be excluded from the court during such trial, the judge may order the court to be cleared and in that case shall not proceed with such trial until the court has been cleared in accordance with this section.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will state that the clearing of the court in these circumstances is going to afford real protection to the jurors, because he may say the identity of the witnesses and the jurors will not be known to the general public.  The identity of the witnesses and the jurors will be known to the prisoner.  In fact, they may be known to any of the witnesses whom the prisoner may call in his defence, if he chooses.  They will be known to the several members of the Press.  I am not going to say that any members of the Press would wilfully divulge information which in the discharge of their professional duties may come <Col N="172" /> into their possession as to the identity of witnesses and jurors in a case such as may be contemplated here.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to emphasise, and it is that the identity of the witnesses and jurors will be known, not only to the prisoner, but to a considerable number of people. When the identity of the witnesses and jurors is known in that way it cannot long be concealed.  It will ultimately become known to the public, and in that way this section does not afford any real protection.  The prisoner, after conviction, is entitled to visits as a matter of right.  If the punishment is grave he is entitled as a matter of right to see his legal advisers and near relatives.  If nobody else should deliberately or inadvertently disclose the identity of those who participated in the trial in camera, the prisoner himself would be able to give that information if he were so minded or if he wished to launch any sort of vendetta&mdash;which I deny&mdash;against those who participated in the trial as jurors or witnesses.  So far as the ostensible purpose of the Act is concerned, Section 7 is valueless, and it will be as ineffective as the other sections I have cited to secure the protection of jurors.</P>
    <P>Section 9 prohibits the publication of the names of jurors.  It states:</P>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to print, publish, distribute, sell or offer or expose for sale or to post up or otherwise expose in any public place the statement in writing or to make by word of mouth the statement in regard to any other person (whether such statement is true or is false) that such other person was called, sworn or engaged as a juror in the trial of any particular criminal issue or any class of criminal issues or was empanelled or summoned or attended as a juror for any sittings of any court for the trial of criminal issues.</P>
    <P>That section has been in operation since the 1st August, 1929.  Notwithstanding that it has been in operation the names of jurors, as has been stated already in this House, have been published by word of mouth and in writing in several places, so that the section is <Col N="173" /> ineffective in the sense that it does not prohibit the publication of the names of jurors.  But it touches a much deeper issue than that, and that is whether in the interests of justice it should be made an offence to publish the name of a juror in a criminal issue or in any issue whatsoever.  After all, one of the safeguards that prisoners have in these matters is that their trial should be public; that the names of the judges should be known to the public; that the names of the jurors, who are the judges on questions of fact, should be known to the public and, all that being known to the public, public opinion may be brought to bear in any case in which juries render verdicts not in accordance with the evidence placed before them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has been responsible to a large extent for the perversion of justice in this country. I regard this as being one of those things for which, if he ever becomes known to history, posterity will undoubtedly condemn him.  This man has come here and, by interfering with the old-established jury system of the country, he has deprived the citizens of the one great safeguard in that system.  He has deprived prisoners at the bar of the protection to which they are entitled.  Under this code the names of the judges on the bench who deal with the questions of law, and the judges in the jury box who deal with questions of fact, are withheld from the public and, therefore, a jury can render any verdict they choose.  If they are so faithless to their oath, they can render a verdict not in accordance with the facts of the case.  It is not unknown that such verdicts have been rendered in this country.  If the Minister can carry his new criminal system far enough I have no doubt such verdicts will be rendered in the future.  I have no doubt that a Minister who can, as a matter of fact, manufacture dumps in the Dublin mountains&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That dump has been exploded at a fortuitous moment in the by-election in Kildare.  The Minister who has connived at and condoned the commission of illegalities by the police force of this country&mdash;he has shown himself capable of doing that&mdash;will, I have no doubt, ultimately come to the stage where, in order to advance the political interests of his Party, he will not scruple to pack a jury in order to secure a conviction in certain cases. Section 9 (1) is designed to enable the Minister to do that without any fear of the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing really objectionable in Section 10.  At least I do not see any objection to serving a juror's summons by post instead of serving it personally and by hand.  I am not prepared to say that, in view of the changes which have taken place in the system of communication by post in this country, that would not be, on the whole, desirable.  I would like the Minister to tell us how it is going to protect jurors.  It is going to make it a little more easy and economical for the Minister to summon the jury but how is the service of a summons by post going to protect the jurors?  That is the ostensible purpose of the Bill, not to make it easier or cheaper to serve summonses but to protect the jurors.  I would like the Minister to tell me how Section 10 is going to protect the jurors in this matter.  Jurors, like the great majority of people in this country, have more to do than serve on juries.  Many business men find that the time involved imposes undue hardship on them.  Industrial workers and others have to lose time and find it difficult to get away from their employment to serve on juries. Consequently, they are prone to evade that service when they can and to that extent the summoning of a jury by registered post might make it a little easier for the Minister to get his panel. <Col N="175" /> But how does it protect the jury?  It might be a good thing if introduced in a certain Bill.  It is not introduced to enable the Minister to protect jurors and it does not afford any real protection to jurors.  Section 12 reads:</P>
    <P>Penalties for loitering in vicinity of criminal courts.  Every person who, on a day on which the Central Criminal Court or a judge of the Circuit Court is sitting for the trial of criminal issues, loiters without lawful reason in any of the streets or roads leading to the building in which such court or judge is sitting or in any other of the approaches to such building or in any other public place in the neighbourhood of such building or in the district in which such building is situate shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.</P>
    <P>I believe it is already an offence to loiter without proper reason in a public place.  I have noticed on certain occasions here&mdash;on Armistice days and others&mdash;that the police are very anxious to keep people moving who appear to be loitering without any real reason or justification.  I believe it has always been an offence under the common law to loiter.  I am not sure. I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a layman.  I do not see what special powers the Minister requires in order to enforce the law as it stands at the moment against loitering.  The only question that occurs to me is this: After all, justice is supposed to be administered in public in this country. The theory, at any rate before the Minister came to the Department of Justice, was that the courts were open to the public, and that any person had a right to loiter around them or to walk into them if he wanted to.  A number of men, like labourers in the vineyard who had to wait for the eleventh hour, even barristers or solicitors, or people of that sort, may loiter around a law court.  One might say, from the amount <Col N="176" /> of practice some barristers get, that they might have no lawful reason for being there.  But after all there are people of a curious mentality who take an interest in law proceedings.  They may not be aware that there is any case on which has a particular interest for them.  Some person may come along and tell them that there is a great case in Judge So-and-So's court, and they may desire, having been informed of these proceedings which may be a source of amusement, interest or instruction to them, to go there.  They may not make up their minds to go there until they have spent half-an-hour or so around the courts.  Surely there is no justification, so far as the protection of juries is concerned, to prevent these people from taking an interest in law?</P>
    <P>There are curious people who take an interest in legal proceedings, even though they are not lawyers or servants of the law in any form. Surely they may be entitled as of old to enjoy whatever pleasure they may take from the law courts without the Minister, in the name of the protection of jurors, depriving them of it?  The common law is there for loiterers if they create a nuisance.  A man may loiter without any lawful reason whatsoever, but unless he constitutes himself a public nuisance surely he is entitled, if he wants to laze away the time, to loiter, around the law courts at Dublin Castle, as he may loiter around the Bank of Ireland or Grafton Street, on an afternoon, or loiter in any other public part of the city.  Surely there can be no justification in the name of the protection of jurors for preventing him from doing that?  There may be other reasons, but they certainly do not relate to the protection of jurors.</P>
    <P>I admit I have detained the House at some length on this Bill.  My justification for so doing is that I am quite well aware that many members of the House who are going to vote for the Minister on this matter, are not aware of what the Minister proposes to do.  I have tried to put the Bill before the House, and I have tried to show the implication of its provisions.  I defy any member <Col N="177" /> of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to show me where a single section of it is going to fulfil its ostensible purpose, and that is to protect the jurors.  They cannot keep their names secret.  Even the system of empanelling them by numbers has failed to do that.  There is no provision which the Minister can make that will prevent the names of the people acting as jurors from becoming known to the public.  We may as well face that fact.  If justice is to be done, it can only be done in public.  The moment it takes to hiding itself in a back room, and making its agents ciphers and numbers, there is created in the public mind a suspicion and disgust of the whole system which will defeat the ends of the Minister.  The ends for which the Minister has introduced his Bill are not to secure the protection of the jurors but to secure the easier conviction of the political opponents of the Government.  I appeal to the House not to be misled by the Minister any further.  Even when this Act was going through, the distaste which it created in large sections of the Government's normal supporters was so great that the Minister was compelled to make temporary what he had intended to be a permanent feature of the criminal system in this country.  I ask that the House should refuse assent to the passage of this Bill, because, by extending the terms of the Act further, they are tending to make it what the Minister intended it should be at the start, and what they refused to permit him to do&mdash; to make it a permanent measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J. Wolfe Mr. J. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to a feeling of some sympathy with what has come from the Opposition and from Deputy Davin.  Perhaps that arises from the fact that I have been close on forty years, subject to an interval of six years, a friend of the dock, and any Bill or any statute that would take away from an accused person the privileges which he has enjoyed would not have my sympathy or support. Deputy MacEntee has told you, not once, but at least a dozen times, that the sole object of this Bill was the protection of jurors.  So far as that is its <Col N="178" /> object it has my entire sympathy and support.  Jurors are entitled to protection, and they have, under this Bill at all events, got some measure of protection. I am glad to be able to say that the Bill has in practice proved a success, and not to continue it would be to take away from the jurors the protection which every honest man wishes to give them.  A juror is entitled to protection, and he must get protection so far as the law is able to do it.  What Deputy MacEntee has told us is that the law is unable to protect the jurors.  I hope that day will never come about.  Possibly Deputy MacEntee would like to bring it about.  It would be a very queer period in the history of this country if the law were not sufficiently strong to protect jurors.  The law is strong enough, and it is the duty of the Minister for Justice to see that the law is strong enough to protect jurors and that jurors will be protected.</P>
      <P>The Bill does a great deal more than that.  It takes away from the accused person a privilege which he had so long enjoyed, of being entitled to square with impunity the jurors by whom he was about to be tried.  It is taking away from the accused the system of potting at jurors and the privilege that he so long enjoyed of being entitled to see jurors beforehand. In the area in which I practised I was perhaps the chief friend of the dock, and when I left in the year 1916 I was able to say this, that over a period of sixteen years in my area there had been no conviction against any professionally defended criminal.  That was a very proud record.  You could not say that to-day, because the privileges which the accused then enjoyed of going around and seeing jurors in advance has gone, and gone never to come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give you an instance showing the extent to which that system had gone.  I remember a juror in my area stating that he had an objection to serve.  He was pressed to state his objection.  He was very slow in telling it, and the judge came to the conclusion that someone had been trying to square him, and that the honest man was objecting to serve on these <Col N="179" /> grounds.  At last the judge persuaded him to speak, and he recorded his objection in these words: &ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know nothing about either of these parties,&rdquo; the fact being that he had not been canvassed by either side, and it was none of his business.  That system has gone. Friends of the dock like myself look back with very great affection to the easier times which we enjoyed under the old system, when we had a jury there cut and dried.  The new system is not working well.  I was talking to a man in a case in which I was engaged from the defendant's point of view.  It was a civil action, but it applies more to the criminal side than to the civil side.  The jury had retired.  I was on the other side, but I said to the man &ldquo;How is this going, Mr. So-and-So?&rdquo;  knowing that he was interested.  &ldquo;Going badly,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;I had only time to speak to two jurors.  I hardly knew one of them.&rdquo;  He did not approve of this system.  He condemned the Minister for Justice in the most unmeasured language.  The people of this country who believe in law and order, and they are the vast majority of the people, the people who believe in a fair and equitable trial, are behind the Minister for Justice, and he may go on unflinchingly, secure in the fact that he has got the confidence of the vast majority of the people of this country behind him.  He has got their encouragement, and I would say to him very respectfully: Turn neither to the right nor to the left, but go ahead on the road to justice.  Give people a fair trial and that is all they really want.  I know that they are getting it at present.  I agree that there are more convictions than there were in the good old days.  That is bad for the felons.  It is bad for the guilty persons, but I do not know of any case in which a person got an unfair trial since the present Government came into existence.</P>

      <P>I feel it almost an insult to the intelligence of the House to follow Deputy MacEntee through the long, rambling and ill-informed speech with which he worried us a few moments ago.  Deputy MacEntee does not seem to know the very first thing of the matter which he discussed so vigorously and so loudly. For instance, he said the only thing that he could see in a certain section of the Bill was that it made it easier for the Minister to summon a jury.  The Minister does not summon juries.  He said it would be easier for the Minister to pack a jury.  The Minister for Justice has nothing in the world to do with juries.  The Minister for Justice does not conduct trials in this country, as Deputy MacEntee ought to know. Just in that fashion he goes along and pours out a string of the most inconsequent nonsense, more inconsequent nonsense, I think, than this Dáil has listened to for many a long day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just take up one or two of the things which he dealt with.  He said it would be absolutely absurd where the county registrar is now the sheriff to say that putting the powers in the county registrar's hands to summon <Col N="181" /> jurors would be a protection.  If you wished to have the names of jurymen kept back from persons who wished to injure these jurymen in their persons or in their property the smaller the number of hands through which that list passes the better.  He said that a verdict of nine or a verdict of twelve could be no protection to a jury.  Of course it is a protection, because even criminals do not like to shoot without cause and even the persons who think, as Deputy MacEntee must think, that there is a sacred right in a prisoner to assassinate a juryman who tries him would like to know that the individual whom they assassinated had actually found them guilty.</P>
    <P>If there is a majority verdict they cannot know.  There might be a disagreement and the very person whom they murdered might be one of the persons who was in favour of an acquittal. If it was necessary to have a unanimous verdict they would be perfectly sure.  So right on through the Bill.  He said that the provision in regard to mute of malice is not a protection.  Of course, it is a protection. He said that jurymen were never intimidated in cases where the issue was mute of malice, and that jurymen refused actually to find a verdict and men were put back when the issue was as to whether they were mute of malice or mute by the act of God.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Act has not been of any use.  I may say on the working of the Act that since it came into force only two men have refused to recognise the court, and one of these a very short time afterwards came forward and apologised for having done so.  I am told by Deputy MacEntee that the names of jurymen have been published.  The names of jurymen have been published, but they have not been published since the passing of this Act in any paper.  Let Deputy MacEntee produce any paper in which they have been published.  I will be very much obliged to him if he does; but no such paper exists, and the names of jurymen have never been published in any paper since.  I say that with absolute confidence, because I am sure it would come to our knowledge <Col N="182" /> if it had been done and prosecutions would have followed forthwith. I am told again that this Bill has been no protection, that it has not saved jurymen from being intimidated.  It has.  As I stated on the Second Reading, the only attempt which has been made to intimidate jurymen since the Act was passed was a complete failure. They could not get the names of the jurymen, because they could not get the panel.  They circularised jurymen at large, very few of whom were actually on the particular panel, and a great number of jurymen received no intimidatory notices.  So much of a success has the Bill been that the powers which we asked for and got from this House under Section 8 have never been put in force.  It has never been necessary since the passing of the Act to apply for the adjournment of a case because the jury had been intimidated, and intimidation and canvassing of jurymen were going on wholesale before that.  Yet I am told that this Act has been no good and should not be extended.</P>
    <P>We are told that this Bill is brought in because an election is coming and are asked why we should not wait until the autumn.  The Bill has been brought in because the Act will expire in a few months' time and this Bill must be passed during this Session and brought into law, otherwise there will be a period within which the jurymen will sit without the protection of the Act and that, as far as I am concerned, is a state of affairs that is so grossly unfair to jurymen that anything I can do to prohibit it will be done.  We heard two very disgraceful speeches, at least in my humble judgment, one from Deputy Davin and another from Deputy Buckley.  When the Guards have done one of the most useful services that they have performed, when this association, whose object is to upset existing conditions in this country by armed violence, received the greatest set-back that it has received, when the headquarters were found out and their most valuable documents and their most valuable armaments were discovered, what do we get?  Woe and grief from a smug hypocrite on the Labour Benches.</P>

      <P>Amendment 5 is one of a number of amendments in the name of Deputy Good, dealing with the same point.  I think the point raised in the amendment arises out of amendment 6, which proposes to insert a new section.  Our practice has been to leave over amendments to the definition section, and take main amendments where they occur in the Bill.  If amendment 6 is carried, a consequential amendment must be made in the definition section.  I propose to leave over amendment 5 and to take the discussion generally, and a decision on amendment 6.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6:</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of this Act shall only apply in respect of apprenticeship to any trade or branch of trade designated by the Minister after consultation with the Apprenticeship Committee appointed under this Act in any industry (hereinafter referred to as a Scheduled Industry) specified in the Second Schedule to this Act. Any such trade or branch of a trade is hereinafter referred to as a designated trade.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on the Second Reading a number of very difficult problems arise in connection with this Bill.  The amendment I have moved proposes to deal with one of them. Deputies are aware that the Bill differs from the recommendations made in the report of the Technical Education Commission.  On the Second Reading the Minister was somewhat doubtful about that.  I hope that since then he has looked into the matter.  The members of that Commission had no doubt in their minds as to what their intentions were.  Their intentions were that the Apprenticeship Bill should become a compulsory Act.  The Minister told us on the Second Reading that the basis of the Bill was a voluntary one.  My difficulty has been to try and alter its character and make it compulsory.  I am not so sure that the amendments I have put down will achieve the object <Col N="189" /> I have in view.  The amendment before the House has been taken from the South African Act, the Act that was recommended by the Commission in their Report.  The difference in the method adopted by the Commission and the method adopted by the Minister was to some extent pointed out on the Second Reading.  Attached to the South African Act is a schedule which sets out the different industries to which the Act applies.  That schedule helps to get rid of the difficulty of interpreting such words as &ldquo;business&rdquo; and &ldquo;craft&rdquo; that occur in Section 1.</P>
    <P>If my amendment is carried it will, I take it, amount to approval of the schedule in some form and that will have the effect of putting before the Minister the views of the House as to what particular trades should come within the operation of this measure when it becomes an Act.  The way my amendment, if accepted, will work is this: that the House, having approved of the application of this Act to these particular trades, it will then be left in the hands of the Minister to deal with what are known as designated trades in the manner set out in the Bill.  I suppose he will take a limited number of them to start with.  After that these trades will come under the operation of the Act in accordance with the terms of subsequent sections. As to the principle of compulsion, what I would like to point out to the Minister is this&mdash;that the voluntary system has had a fair and reasonable trial.  It is the system, so far as apprenticeship is concerned, that has been in existence for at least half a century.  The system, as we found from figures put before the Commission, did not achieve the object it set out to achieve.  In other words, it failed.  I should like to give again the figures that I put before the House on the Second Reading of the Bill in support of that statement.  It is set out in the Report of the Commission that there are 9,282 craftsmen engaged in the building industry, taking that as an example.  In a return furnished by the Minister's Department it is stated that there are 961 apprentices in that particular industry in the Saorstát.  I <Col N="190" /> pointed out that if we had the number of apprentices that we should have in that particular industry in order to keep it up to normal level that figure, instead of being 961, should be 3,304. These figures, I am sorry to say, were questioned by a number of Deputies, including members on the Labour Benches.  I hope that since the debate on the Second Reading took place the Deputies who questioned the figures I gave have looked into the matter and satisfied themselves as to their accuracy.  On that occasion I said that the number of apprentices to the number of craftsmen engaged in the industry in order to keep it up to normal level should be one apprentice to every three craftsmen.</P>
    <P>If they consulted anyone in close touch with the problem I think they would find that while it may be necessary to have a larger proportion in some trades&mdash;what we call the shortlife industries&mdash;on the average, that is the figure approved by those who have studied it.  I hope before we have any other further questions on that issue from those representatives that they will give us some details in support of their contention, if they still question that figure.  It is a figure that I have examined, not for the first time, and I am satisfied that it is an accurate one.  Taking that figure as the basis, we see at once that the voluntary system has not produced the goods.  In other words, where we should have 3,304 apprentices in an industry we have only 961.  That being so, I am quite satisfied that the voluntary system has had a fair trial, and that it is a failure, and for that reason, something much more drastic is necessary if we are to deal with this problem in the way it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am afraid in dealing with this question some Deputies did not realise the importance or the magnitude of it. Under the recommendation of the Commission, vocational schools were set up for dealing with the training of these young people, so as to make them more adaptable to industry.  I am afraid, even in connection with vocational training, that the House is not aware&mdash;and this is a point that bears on the Bill before us, and particularly <Col N="191" /> on the amendment&mdash;of the magnitude of the problem now before the various vocational committees in the Saorstát.  The Department of Education, under whose jurisdiction vocational committees work, has pointed out to them quite recently in a statement that there are 120,000 young persons in the Free State within the ages of fourteen and sixteen, and that 45,000 of these are in primary and secondary schools.  The task of dealing with the balance of 75,000 is the task of the vocational committees.  I mention that figure in order to give the House some idea of the magnitude of the problem we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious to anyone who has even looked into the question casually that if these Vocational Schools are to function, and to do useful work, avenues must be opened to give employment to many at present unemployed, and who cannot get into an industry.  If we do not succeed in opening up these avenues to industry, then the money that we are spending on vocational education is not going to do any good.  The success of the Vocational Education Act very largely depends upon this Bill.  If this Bill does not open up avenues to employment at present closed, then, a great deal of the money being voted, and that will be voted in the future for vocational education will be wasted.  Therefore, I say, that this particular Bill and this method of dealing with this difficult subject, is of vital importance to the State.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that in discussing a problem of this character, it should not be discussed in any sense as a political problem.  I would like to see the views of the different parties given freely in order to try to achieve in that way the object we have in view.  I would like to mention that it has been pointed out in a resolution passed by the Advisory Committee on Juvenile Employment in Cork&mdash;a very active Committee, which has done very good work in the past&mdash;that many of the boys and girls emigrated in the past, and in that way eased the problem, but they cannot <Col N="192" /> emigrate in the future, for reasons that I need not go into.  That adds to the difficulty.  We cannot throw these people who cannot emigrate on the scrap heap.  We must provide some opportunity whereby their services can be availed of, if not in this country, in some other country. From that point of view I would like to urge on the House that I am satisfied the only way we can deal successfully with this problem is in the way recommended by the Commission on Technical Education, and that is through the medium of a compulsory Apprenticeship Bill.  The underlying principle in this amendment is compulsion. Whether it will achieve its object is another question.  I would like the amendment to be discussed on that principle&mdash;that of compulsion as opposed to the voluntary system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good in his statement referred to the necessity of finding employment for our young people in industry.  I am entirely with him in that.  It is essential that we should do so.  The Deputy said that unless this Bill opens up avenues to industry it is of no use.  I suggest that it is not by means of this Bill we will open up these avenues to industry.  It does not seem to me to be a reasonable or a sensible method to put these boys into industry, and to find suitable means of livelihood for them, merely to secure by a compulsory measure that they will be apprenticed to a trade and learn a craft without having any guarantee that employment will be found for them in that trade when they reach the age for employment. Deputy Good talked of the proportion of apprentices to skilled men in a particular trade.  I suggested on the last occasion that any figure of the kind would be a purely arbitrary figure, and nothing else.  I do not care if the figure were one to three or one to four.  It is an arbitrary figure and no proof can be adduced to show that it is the right figure.  I suggest that the principle which should govern the matter cannot be fixed arbitrarily. These young people must depend upon the chance there is in a particular trade, having regard to the development <Col N="193" /> of business generally and the movement in industry.  All such considerations must depend on whether there is to be an opportunity for the employment of all these people afterwards at remunerative work.</P>

      <P>I do not purport to speak on this matter with the special knowledge which Deputy Good and others have of craft trades, but it appears to me that the figures he gave in regard to the proportion of apprentices to skilled men are absurd on the basis, as I reason it out, that if five years were the normal period of apprenticeship there would be a completely new staff every fifteen years. That would mean that the ordinary life of the average workman would be fifteen years and that he would have to clear out then and have his place filled by some of the apprentices that would be coming along.  That would appear to me, although I do not profess to have any intimate knowledge of these matters, to be absurd.  In any case I do not feel that it is possible at this stage to provide a workable scheme on the basis of compulsion unless we go very much further than, I imagine, Deputy Good would be prepared to go, because, as I mentioned on Second Reading, if you are going to control the entrance of people into industry you cannot leave them there. If you force them, through a system of apprenticeship, into industry you must do that which is anathema to Deputy Good, namely, you must have a considerable measure of State interference in industry to ensure that the people you have brought into a particular industry must compulsorily be <Col N="194" /> provided with employment.  Deputy Good, of course, will not go that far.</P>

      <P>There is more in the suggestion which Deputy Good puts forward.  He said that the voluntary system has had a fair trial.  I do not think that it has had anything in the nature of a trial such as is proposed under this Bill.  He refers to only one or two particular trades.  I think that the principle which is enshrined in this Bill ought to be given a fair trial and, if and when it proves to be a failure, let us try other and different methods, but let us then be prepared to proceed to go on with what will be the logical consequence of these things if they are carried out along the lines which Deputy Good suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy O'Connell's attitude to be this, namely, that he would be in favour of a compulsory system if a workable scheme could be devised, that his objection to the amendment is that it is not workable and would necessitate undue interference by the State in industry. I do not think that it is possible to devise a workable scheme, nor do I think that Deputy Good has found one.  Although I am in sympathy with the idea of compulsion which Deputy Good is advocating, I do not think that his amendment is one that could be passed.  Deputy Good's statement, which is based on the report of the Commission, that the present voluntary system of regulating apprenticeship is not suitable to modern needs can, I think, be controverted. Deputy O'Connell has asked that the principle of the Bill be given a fair trial.  It is practically impossible to say what the principle is.  The Minister has not shown his hand at all.  He has not indicated any policy in respect of apprenticeship.  He has merely devised a machine for regulating <Col N="195" /> the work of apprenticeship committees which may be established in connection with certain industries.  I saw it stated in an article in a weekly journal that this Bill is a typical product of a Civil Service department in so far as it exalts the machine into a matter of policy and makes the principle something in the nature of a secondary consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good's amendment, in so far as it desires to introduce the principle of compulsion into the Bill, is, in my opinion, worthy of support.  The particular method, however, which he has adopted, namely, of scheduling a number of industries and saying that the Bill shall apply to them at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is not, in my opinion, the best method.  I dislike the scheduling of industries in a Bill of this kind, in the first place, because one always has the idea that certain industries may be omitted, and I think that in Deputy Good's list certain industries are omitted.  The idea in the Bill is to have it apply to any industry which comes within the definition in Section 1, subject to certain steps being taken and, in my opinion, that is a better method.  Amendment 8, in my name, suggests that the Minister should be given power to apply the Bill in respect of an industry to which he thinks it should be applied but in respect of which no application has been received by him.  That would meet the principle which Deputy Good is advocating.  That amendment, in my opinion, does not carry any of the disadvantages which attach to his. The main point we must settle is whether or not apprenticeship is to be compulsorily regulated.  The present system, as Deputy Good says, has had a fair trial.  This Bill is based on that system.  We have conditions of apprenticeship in a number of industries regulated voluntarily.  The Bill is to standardise methods of regulation and to give uniform constitutions to the committees, if there are such, in relation to particular industries in connection with apprenticeship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Deputy Good, with <Col N="196" /> which I am in sympathy, is to provide that where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is necessary that the conditions of apprenticeship, as defined in Section 8, should be regulated, that he should have power to regulate them whether or not those engaged in the industry want such regulations.  We have given examples of industries in respect of which we think that it is unlikely that application for designation will be made either by employers or employees.  There may not be many such industries but it is in relation to any such as exist that the need for regulation is most urgent.  That is why we would like to see the Minister having power, no matter what method is adopted of giving it to him, to apply this Bill, where he thinks it should be applied and not to depend on actions taken by other persons in order to have it put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a further explanation both from Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connell.  If the case made by Deputy Good, that in a particular industry there are only 900 odd apprentices when there ought to be 3,000, is well-founded and if that is typical of industry in general, then a good case has been made for something even more drastic than that contained in the Bill.  That is where we are in difficulty.  Deputy Good has given us an obiter dictum of three to one but he has not put forward, so far as I know, any basis on which he forms that belief.  Deputy O'Connell, when challenged to examine that, said that it was simply absurd. As between the ipse dixit of Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Good I am not prepared to make a judgment.  Neither of them is entitled to ask the House to decide merely on his obiter.  Either of them has not put forward a case showing the basis upon which he makes his calculation.  Deputy O'Connell calculated that on Deputy Good's basis the life, the employable time of a workman is only fifteen years.  That is on the assumption that there would be no wastage in the apprenticeship, in the labour ranks or that there was no expansion in industry.  Neither of these <Col N="197" /> two propositions can be accepted. There is bound to be wastage and there must be expansion.  If there is not expansion then we are faced with the whole of our unemigratable population who will either have to starve or be a load on pre-existing production so that we cannot assume either of the propositions.  In regard to Deputy O'Connell's estimate of fifteen years, we have no evidence whatever apart from the statement made by Deputy Good in relation to the proportion of apprentices.  Merely as a student in the matter who wants to know on which side to vote, I would be glad if either one or the other of these Deputies would effectively show his hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good has told us that this amendment is intended to bring in the principle of compulsion. I think he realises himself that it does not achieve his object.  He says further that it is in line with the report of the Commission and he has said both on Second Reading and again to-day, that the report of the Commission was in favour of the compulsory system.  I think that is really one of the reasons why Deputy Good finds himself in a difficulty.  He has put down an amendment which he says will bring in the principle of the South African Act, but the South African Act principle is not one of compulsion. What did the Report which Deputy Good himself signed say?  The Report on page 72 refers to the South African Act in these terms:</P>
      <P>In the Union of South Africa under the provisions of the Apprenticeship Act, apprenticeship became compulsory in such trades as decide, under advisory powers vested in special apprenticeship Committees, to adopt the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is exactly the system we are trying to carry out.  We have omitted one part of it.  We did not schedule trades. The fact that Deputy Good's amendment does schedule trades, prevents not merely compulsion but prevents the voluntary system being ever applied to a trade if it is not included in his schedule.  The Report did not recommend a compulsory system.  It recommended <Col N="198" /> something like what we have here.  The amendment did not introduce a compulsory system but the aim of the Deputy is a compulsory system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;A trade designated by the Minister of Mines and Industries, on the advice of a Committee, becomes subject to the law.&rdquo; Certainly an apprenticeship Committee is set up just as Deputy Good has proposed.  Deputy Good proposes to establish apprenticeship Committees in certain designated trades, and then his amendment says that the Minister shall consult with those Committees, and after consultation the trade may be designated.  Supposing an apprenticeship Committee which is established for the purpose of deciding whether or not designation shall apply to a trade says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; that is exactly the difficulty, I have not got a Commitee either of representatives of the employers or employees unless they appeal to me.  Supposing a Committee which has been set up says after consultation with the Minister &ldquo;we do not want to become designated,&rdquo; what is the Minister to do?  Deputy Good's amendment leaves it to him either to leave it undesignated or to go on and designate it.  The South African Act certainly recognises that the consultation is to be more or less approved by the Committee before designation comes about.  I think the scheme of the South African Act is definitely the scheme we have here <Col N="199" /> with the single exception that we do not schedule trades.  Deputy Good's amendment schedules a trade in order to set up a Committee to advise the Minister whether or not the trade shall be designated, and so to have all the provisions of the Act applied. That is a limitation.  At the moment I have the whole field of industry open to me.  If I accept the amendment I am confined to those schedules, however wide and comprehensive the field may be.  At any rate nobody has faced up to the difficulties or the difficulties of the compulsory system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good asked for compulsion on the basis that there are certain numbers of people leaving school every year, that these people are not brought into industry, that they cannot emigrate, and that they are going to be a burden on the community, but he does not show, and nobody has attempted to show, in fact it is not possible to show, that this Bill is a Bill with the intention of extending industries. That has to be done by other methods than these.  The Bill is simply that when certain conditions arise we are going to see that apprenticeship of a particular type, better suited to present conditions, shall apply.  Training will be given, suitable to the conditions in modern industry.  The Bill does not attempt to extend industry. That is not part of its function. Deputy Flinn has remarked on Deputy Good's contribution to the debate that if there are less apprentices in a particular industry, and if it is typical of the industry, then something drastic must be done.  Deputy Lemass remarked that the Report was a typical Civil Service production.</P>

Deputy Lemass says: &ldquo;Accept my amendment and if after two years an appeal is not made for designation, <Col N="200" /> the Minister may designate and have the whole conditions of the Bill operate.&rdquo; What are the conditions of the Bill?  A Committee is set up which will in the first instance draw up regulations with regard to educational qualifications and so on.  Supposing after two years, if the amendment of Deputy Lemass were accepted, an appeal has not come either from the employers or the employees in a particular industry, I may not have been able to induce an appeal from the employers or employees after two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the Deputy's conclusions was that if there are less apprentices than there should be, and if that is typical of the industry, then something drastic ought to be done. We will leave that as a contribution to the necessity for compulsion.  Deputy Lemass thinks that this carries on the existing system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Deputy, it carries on the principle.  It will be seen that the old conditions in regard to apprenticeship, indenture, long period of service, etc., had no application to certain industries.  These industries are carried on by people who adopt different methods of training to the old apprenticeship conditions. This gets away from the old conditions as we knew them, conditions that were distinctly a question of a boy being apprenticed under rigid terms, it being left to his parents or guardian, or a trade union, or between those people and the employer, to see that the conditions were carried out. The conditions set out under this Bill gave us the best approach that can be got to something intermediate, something between the old lax and rather bad system of apprenticeship and the compulsory system that has been referred to.  We suggest here a committee and we get employers and employees, in equal numbers on that committee. Associated with them we have one or three representatives of the public.  The public representatives will try to get both parties to draw up suitable conditions.  Once the committee is set up, we make it compulsory that conditions should be drawn up with regard to four items and then we say that there are other things about which regulations may be drawn.  By the setting up of this committee we bring about a discussion in a friendly way as between representatives of the employers and the employees, always with an audience of impartial people composed of one or three representatives of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> I think that system ought to be given a fair trial before people put forward suggestions about something drastic being done or about the formation of a compulsory system.  It is open to me, under the Bill, to introduce representations where I think representations ought to be introduced. It may be that neither the employers nor the employees consider it desirable to have a particular trade designated.  In such a case compulsion is no good.  If both employers and employees are against a system, there is no advantage in going against their wishes.  Our aim is to get both parties on a committee and associate with them members of the public, selected impartially.  They can then try to get apprenticeship conditions drawn up.  I plead distinctly for the terms in the Bill as showing a better appreciation of the conditions under which modern industry is carried out, and as giving a better approach in a conciliatory way to both employers and employees.  As I have already indicated, members of the public will sit on the committee and endeavour to bring both parties together.  This is much better than a compulsory system, which would only break down. No case has been made for compulsion, and compulsion should only be resorted to, if it is considered necessary, when thorough investigation has been made by the committee of the situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that no case has been made for a change in the present principle.  We must admit that the present principle is a voluntary principle.  I have made a case to show that the voluntary principle has failed to achieve the results expected of it.  I do not think one can do anything more than produce the figures compiled by the Minister's Department. I have produced those figures and, on the face of them, I have submitted a definite case to the House.  I have given the figures exactly as they were given to the Commission by the Minister's Department. Those figures bear only one interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The main obstruction is the number of vacancies that exist in the training colleges for primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell is satisfied.  Let us take another profession. Let us take the medical profession. Any boy who wants to go into that profession and is not wanting in money, and has sufficient money to carry him through has no difficulty in his way.  He is not met by the limitation argument or by the statement that there are only vacancies for so and so and such and such a number.  If the boy wants to go into the medical profession that is entirely a matter for him and for his people.  He is put through the course anyway.  I want to see these young people put in a similar position to him.  If there is not employment subsequently for them when they reach the end of their apprenticeship that <Col N="205" /> is their look out, but I want to get the opportunity for them.  That opportunity is closed at the moment.</P>
      <P>Let us take the legal profession. What limitation is there against entering that profession?  None that I know of.  There is no limit whatever to a boy going into it.  As to the question of subsequent employment that is a matter entirely for the boy and his parents.  He may have to go abroad, but he is enabled to go into the profession.  He can learn the profession. That is all I ask for those boys coming from our primary schools and who want to go into a trade or industry.  If a boy wants to become a bricklayer, a plumber, a carpenter or anything else at the present moment those avenues of employment are closed to him.  I say that is not fair.  As far as that condition prevails I am quite satisfied that the money spent on our vocational schools will not achieve the results it ought.  The money spent on them will be very largely wasted because there will not be opportunities for those boys when they leave the schools.  That is the problem as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this other question of the number of apprentices to the number of tradesmen, let us assume for the moment that the apprentice is thoroughly skilled in his trade at 23 years of age and let us assume that the average life is 63 years.  That leaves 40 working years for the craftsman. It follows from that that in every ten years we lose 22 per cent. of the total or in every 8 years we lose 20 per cent. of the total.  Take it that we lose in every ten years 25 per cent. of the total.  Consequently, we must train 25 per cent of our craftsmen every ten years or 20 per cent. in eight years.  A boy starting at the age of 15 years would reach efficiency at the age of 23.  It is a well-known fact that many of those following a trade in the country parts come to the city to be trained and when their training is finished they return home. Others following other occupations will sometimes travel to distant places for information, and five per cent. under that head would not be excessive to meet these contingencies. <Col N="206" /> That brings the proportion up to one-fourth or 25 per cent.  Then we have further to provide for accidents, deaths and other causes which reduce the number to one in three.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking now of comparatively long-lived trades.  But we have short-lived trades, where these figures that I have just given will not be reached.  That shows how the figure of one in three is arrived at. That figure is not questioned by those who have studied the problem, as I know, in other places.  What I suggest to the Minister is this: That if we are satisfied that the voluntary principle has been given a fair trial, as I am satisfied it has, and that it has failed to achieve the object we have in view, then I think we ought to agree to give some other principle a trial and I now suggest the compulsory principle and that a Bill should be framed along those lines as we understood during the sitting of the Commission.  The South African model was mentioned.  There was no doubt at all in the minds of the members of the Commission that compulsion is necessary in view of the figures given to the Commission by the Minister's Department.  These figures show that the compulsory system is necessary.  The interpretation of the Commission was, and it is still their interpretation, that the South African Act is a compulsory Act.  They recommend that the principle of that Act should be followed.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is agreement on this point of compulsion and that this Bill might be re-drafted. I do not hesitate to point out the difficulty that one is in in trying to alter a purely voluntary Bill into a compulsory Bill.  I laid bare that fact when moving my first amendment.  I put forward that view.  If we are satisfied that in the interests of those represented and in the national interests something should be done more than has been done, then I would suggest to the Minister to withdraw this Bill and to bring in a new Bill on a different basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  One would think, on <Col N="207" /> listening to Deputy Good's speech, that an increase in the number of apprentices would increase industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is naturally the inference that anybody would draw from the Deputy's remarks.  Again, Deputy Good has suggested that some of those trades are closed boroughs. It might be a surprise to Deputy Good to find that I agree with him that there should be no closed boroughs either in the trades or professional crafts, but we must have regard to the whole position and not to take things piecemeal.  We have, as a matter of fact, the professions very largely protected by the economic circumstances of the people.  Whilst it may be said in theory that the professions are not closed to the ordinary people of this country, at the same time we do know that in order to enter any of these professions one must go through a university course, and take out a degree.  To do that course requires the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, and I need hardly say that the majority of those who serve their time to trades and crafts are, in the main, people who cannot afford to take up a profession. I agree that there ought to be no barrier put before any intelligent boy in this country entering any trade or craft.  I have always held that view, but I do not see how we are going to alter the whole economic position by suggesting that the more apprentices we have, the better it will be for the country.  It is quite the contrary in my experience.  I know that we have thousands of building trade operatives in the country unemployed.  Will the multiplying of apprentices in these crafts increase employment?  It will undoubtedly increase the number of skilled operatives, but when skilled operatives have no opening for displaying their skill what benefit will that be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest <Col N="208" /> to Deputy Good that he knows very well that all these matters are arranged amicably between the employers in any given industry and the employees.  They arrange for the proportion. They arrange that the proportion shall be one in five, or one in three as it is in some cases, and in practice it has been found that that number is quite sufficient.  There were some crafts in which it was found absolutely essential to close down apprenticeship for a time altogether, and Deputy Good knows that action of that kind is not taken without some very serious reason.</P>

      <P>We all want to see this Bill operative and become an Act. There are many features in it which will certainly help vocational education at the moment.  In my view as one who has had some experience of the apprenticeship system I feel that the voluntary character embodied in the Bill is one of the best features and nothing can be gained by the amended suggestion of Deputy Good which I may say, with other amendments put down on the paper by Deputy Good, seems to <Col N="209" /> be lifted entirely, without the change of a comma, from the South African Act.

      <P>I oppose Deputy Good's amendment.  I think it would be fatal to the objects intended in this Bill to introduce the element of compulsion. So far as the Bill itself is concerned I think it is a very good one, but I can see results flowing from this Bill far greater than the question of the apprentices.  In industries generally it is absolutely essential that the employers and employees should be brought in closer touch.  If this Bill had no other thing contained in it than to bring employer and employee together it has a good deal to recommend it.  I would like to see the time in this country when all industries and conditions of industries would be controlled by a joint labour board constituted out of employers and employees.  When we get to that stage, and this is the first step towards it, we will have industry organised on a much better basis than it is at present.  I have nothing more to say on the question.  I served one time on a joint labour board.  I saw employers and employees who had grievances one against the other. After a round table conference they composed their differences very rapidly.  I think we are now making the first advance towards the establishment of joint labour boards in all industries.  The Minister will have power to induce the employers and employees in certain industries to come in under this Apprenticeship Act without the suggestion of compulsion. I think step by step we will gather up the threads in the control of industry.  It is better for the country generally that industries should be organised by those engaged <Col N="210" /> in them than by any drastic measures the Minister may introduce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like for a moment to refer to an analogy which Deputy Good tried to make between professions and industry.  The difference is surely a simple one.  It is agreed by, I think, most of the people who have had touch with this matter that the proper training for industry can only be given in the workshops. You can supplement it in the technical school and the technical school will probably have come to play a greater and more important part as time goes on.  I think it has been agreed by the people concerned that workshop training is an essential.  If we are going to have apprentices trained for some part of their course in their employers' premises there immediately comes out from that a difference as between the training for industry and the training for a profession.  The man who wants to proceed to law or medicine goes through the ordinary course of education at his parents' expense practically all the time and goes to one of the recognised diploma conferring places.  No private employer is put out in order that he might secure his diploma.  He does not interrupt a private employer's business; he does not complicate the number of employees that a private employer has to take.  He does not introduce any element of discordancy into his wages sheet.  All these factors are summed up in the point made that you interfere to get your training through the private employer's place of business in the one case and you do not in the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to one thing which must have come within the terms of reference, because it is reported on.  On page 84 of the Report, where this famous table supplied by my Department is included, there is this statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The proportion of apprentices to skilled men which is specified in certain agreements between employers and trades unions indicates the maximum number permitted&rdquo;&mdash;I I draw attention to this&mdash;&ldquo;and represents a proportion barely reached in practice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words the agreement as between the trade unions and employers, which is supposed to set up this close borough system, is criticised by the Report as representing a proportion rarely reached in practice.  There may be other considerations that could not come before the Commission.  They might have adopted that part of the Report had it come before them, but we are faced with the position that these closed conditions exist in some parts of industry, and the better way to get after them is by getting employers and employees, under the chairmanship of an outsider with two other impartial observers, and have the whole thing ventilated.  It may be that two or three years' experience of this will show that there is this closed system prevailing in certain trades, and public opinion may be aroused against it by the reports that will issue from these committees or the attempts made by this Department to get the committee established and its failure. Then will be the time to think of some better approach to this position.  That position has not yet been demonstrated. No one yet has any proof. There is a certain amount of talk about it.  I think it is clear enough that something approaching that type of condition exists, and people attempt <Col N="212" /> to get that sort of thing right, but how far the attempts are successful and what is the vehemence behind that attempt I do not know.</P>
    <P>At any rate a time for a better approach will come when we have tried to bring these people together.  I should say if we do find that there are trades and businesses for which we cannot get apprenticeship committees set up because the trade will not allow themselves to be designated the approach may have to be different.</P>

The natural reaction of the employer then will be to say: &ldquo;You force these on us and you will have to pay strike wages to carry on the business, as our business is at a standstill owing to your actions.&rdquo;  The only other way of dealing with it will be we will have to look to see that technological establishments are to be brought to a particular point of perfection so that they can give training there instead of in the employer's business.  I hope there will be general agreement that, no matter what happens to the young person eventually, whether he is going to get employment here or elsewhere, that it is better to have him trained in one sort of skilled occupation than not to have him trained at all.  But if we are going to assist industry by trying to force people into private persons' establishments against their will or subject them to certain changes arising out of other employment we will have <Col N="213" /> to approach that difficulty but surely it is too early to shout about these difficulties until we have met them.</P>

The paragraphs which preceded the recommendations give me certain information with regard to skilled men and apprentices, and I get below that particular statement that these things are generally ruled by agreement, and we have the statement that the maximum is rarely reached. There must be something in the terms of reference which enables the Committee to deal with that.  At any rate it is there.  I may be taking a wrong deduction from it, but the Report of the Commission is there, and the evidence tendered to the Commission is the main thing.  Bringing the two sides together, under the observation and control of two or three impartial observers is, I think, the best system that we can devise at the moment.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any real reason for refusing to accept powers to deal with the situation which can be contemplated, even though it may never arise?  He talked about the dangers of compulsion.  He said you have to force a particular employer to take in more apprentices than he is willing to take.  That danger is in the Bill.  If the employers and employees agreed to have their trade designated, and if the Apprenticeship Committee is set up, and it fixes the number of apprentices in relation to each factory, and if the owners of the factory refuse to take in that standard number of apprentices, he commits an offence against this Bill, and is liable to a fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are appointed under the obligation to make four definite types of regulations and with power to make others.  A particular employer may have agreed to the designation of his trade on general principles without knowing the nature of the regulations that the Apprenticeship Committee for that trade are going to make, and when he comes up against these regulations he may find himself in very definite disagreement with them.  That danger is there in relation to individual employers in designated trades.  The Minister is refusing to accept compulsory powers because it may be there also in relation to individual trades.  You may have failure to make a request for designation in a particular trade for some other reason than that neither employers nor employees desire to apply for it.  It may be due to a lack of organisation on the part of employers or employees or to some other cause.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that he should take the limited compulsory powers that are conferred upon the South African Minister.  The South African Act is a voluntary Act in principle, but the Minister has certain compulsory powers.  He is obliged to act in consultation with the Apprenticeship Committee but he is under no statutory obligation to accept their advice, if, in exceptional circumstances, he thinks it inadvisable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> The amendment that I propose is that if within two years no application is made for designation the Minister may make a special order if he is satisfied that it is desirable that such special order should be made. He would do everything possible to induce an application from one or preferably from both sides, but if the exceptional circumstances continued and if he foresaw in that particular industry that because of short-sighted policy the supply of trained recruits was likely to fall short of the number required at some future date, then he should have the necessary machinery to impose the will of the community upon the persons concerned.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Labour Party.  Deputy O'Connell's objection appears to be largely based upon the grounds that if you adopt a compulsory system you will have an undue amount of State interference in industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first step. I suggest that the purpose of this Bill is being misunderstood.  Why have we passed the Vocational Education Act? Surely our purpose should be to provide a supply of skilled recruits for industry.  If the sole purpose of this Act is merely to regulate the age of entry, the period of apprenticeship, the rate of remuneration, and things of that kind, then this is only a Bill of secondary importance.  The main purpose of the Bill should be to provide the means by which we can be certain <Col N="216" /> of securing an adequate number of skilled recruits for industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. Deputy Anthony dealt with that.  He commenced by saying that he was not in favour of the close borough.  Then he proceeded to defend that position and to make the fantastic argument that because unemployment is prevalent now we should deny training in the skilled industries to the young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter surely for arrangement between the employers and employees.  The Minister has suggested that the close borough did not exist to the extent that the Deputy thinks.  As a matter of fact, in the building trade about which Deputy Good knows something, there is an arrangement by which boys are indentured to carpentry by way of fee, where they are not the sons of carpenters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that the close borough exists.  When we have the Report of the Commission which says in relation to that particular industry that the employers are not taking in the maximum number of apprentices allowed by the agreement, surely that should alter Deputy Anthony's attitude.  The adoption of the amendment would ensure that the maximum number agreed on by the trade unions would receive skilled instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to examine the reasons why this maximum was not reached.  The reasons, probably, would be that there was not sufficient employment for those already in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of employment for our people is a different matter.  Is it the contention that because employment is absent at the moment we should deny training to <Col N="217" /> our young people and bring them up as unskilled workers to fill casual jobs all their lives?  That is the effect of Deputy Anthony's contention.  Is there any reason why we should not have them trained?  The fact that unemployment is prevalent at the present time is no reason why the workers of the future should be in the main unskilled workers, that they should be denied an opportunity of acquiring trades at the time when they can best acquire them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed upon that.  I have said before that the particular method of providing compulsion which Deputy Good suggested does not appeal to me.  I do not think it is necessary to adopt that method.  I want to see the Minister have the power, which he may never be called upon to exercise, but nevertheless to have it, to impose an Apprenticeship Committee with power to make regulations upon any trade in which he thinks the circumstances are so serious that he should exercise that power, even though neither the employers' nor the employees' organisation makes application.  The South African Minister has that power and, as the Minister is framing his Bill upon the South African Act, he should not deprive himself of it.</P>

I am taking the circumstances I spoke of: an application has not been made.  I am convinced that it is desirable that a particular trade should be designated.  I am further convinced that one of the two parties likely to be involved is vehemently opposed to it.  I designate it nevertheless. I go looking for my committee. Am I likely to get representative members from the two parties in the circumstances I have outlined? Supposing I do get them, and I get the committee to establish certain regulations. Amongst the regulations they establish is one with regard to the number of apprentices in regard to a specific premises.  I go to a certain premises owned by Mr. X and say: &ldquo;Take in so many people.&rdquo;  Supposing he is recalcitrant and says &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  Supposing it is the employees who object to a certain number of apprentices and the employer says: &ldquo;Certainly, but I know what is going to happen,&rdquo; and the next day he meets me and says: &ldquo;This is what I foretold would happen; this place has been blacklisted and they are all going out.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unlikely. It is less likely to happen where one or the other party has asked for the application of the Act, and where I have made a special order.  Remember, the special order implies giving notice to all who are likely to be affected.  Where there has been no objection raised, or not sufficient objection to make me withhold the application for the designation, and where representative members have sat upon a committee and established a particular number, there is surely less likelihood of that occurring than where I do this on my own, in the circumstances outlined, in the teeth of clear opposition from one of the parties.</P>

      <P>No.  The application <Col N="220" /> need only be made on the part of one party.  Then there is the procedure of special order which gives notice to certain people.  I do not know what form the Bill may take, but suppose it is passed as it is.  They must make regulations upon certain things and they may make regulations about certain others.  The employer knows about these because he will have notice given to him.  There will be no objection to the making of the special order unless it is considered that it can be sustained.  In these circumstances I say it is very much less likely that there is going to be any trouble with even an individual employer than in the other circumstances.</P>

      <P>Instead of arguing on the minor point of possibility, I take the Deputy on the other point, which is the most likely to lead to trouble most certainly&mdash;the compulsory clause to be enforced in the teeth of opposition, or this other thing which is, I think, the root of this whole matter, that is the voluntary principle.  You are going to try and bring people together and to agree on certain things.  The whole lengthy procedure is to try and get their minds as one on a particular regulation.  That is a far better system than acting against a declared opposition. That only leads to trouble. The trouble may have to be faced in this also, but, again I say, why meet trouble too early?  Let us try this out.  We can see what is going to happen.  Deputy Lemass's amendment contemplates that within a period of two years no application is made. My policy is definitely going to try and introduce Apprenticeship Committees in as many industries and branches of industry as possible.  On the point of organisation, if my division of trade-board trades and non-trade-board trades is left, the trade-board trades are supposed to include all those where the people are not sufficiently organised to be able to resist an attack upon wages.  We get both the organised and the non-organised on the employees' side.  The employers are, in the main, sufficiently organised through the Advisory Committees which I have at present.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact the employers of that particular trade cannot take in any apprentices.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the trade will not allow them.  The result to that particular <Col N="223" /> industry is that the number of men employed in the city to-day is less than half the numbers that were employed twenty-five years ago and the shortage of employees at present in that trade is becoming a very serious difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment is so scarce because these men that have control of the trade have made it such a close borough that the output in that particular industry is exceedingly small. I happen to know, because in 1914 in Dublin we had four brick works employing over a thousand men.  To-day three of these works are closed down, and we can hardly keep one of them open because of the competition of cement.  If the bricklayers of Dublin gave a larger output we would not have cement houses built in Dublin to-day. In Belfast they would have none of these cement houses built because the bricklayers were determined to keep the cost of bricklaying down to such an extent that the cement could not compete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The bricklayers of Belfast succeeded in keeping out cement houses, but in Dublin not a house is built of bricks at the moment.  They are all built of cement, and in a few years, unless something is done to remedy this, bricklaying will be a thing of the past.  It is these restrictions of the trade union that are affecting this particular trade, because boys are kept out of the bricklaying trade unless they are the sons of tradesmen.  Why it should be I do not know, but it is restricting employment in the allied industries.  It is all very well dealing with a particular problem, but I want to have this question looked at from the point of view of the mother and of the father who have three or four sons and want to get them into industry.  You talk about all these difficulties created by other organisations, but let us look at the real difficulty&mdash;the <Col N="224" /> difficulty of the parent who wants to get employment for his boys. What is he to do?  What are we to advise him to do?  It is said: &ldquo;Send him to a vocational school,&rdquo; but when he gets through the vocational school how is he going to get into industry unless the avenues of industry are opened up to him and the barriers removed? Why should there be barriers in industry greater than in the professions? Unless these barriers are removed and there is more employment in industry we will not get over the difficulty by vocational schools.  I want something done to deal with this problem.  I have seen this problem as a member of the Juvenile Employment Committee in Dublin for many years. We are face to face with this problem, and it is becoming more serious from year to year.  In Dublin last year we had some 5,000 new applications from young people leaving our schools.  We could only find employment for less than 1,000.  What is to become of the rest?  Are they to be thrown on the scrap heap and given no opportunity? A lot of these will find employment in occupations that lead nowhere.  We want the avenues to industry opened up and the barriers removed.  We want this Bill to remove these barriers in the interests of the State, and I say it does not remove them.  If the Minister could call a conference of those interested in trying to get some agreement whereby these obstacles could be got over, we would make some progress. But I am satisfied that this Bill in its present form is not going to help the situation, and the problem will grow much more serious than it is.  I am anxious as the result of the work of the Commission and the assistance of the Department that something real and practical should be done.  It is a pressing problem and calls for something to be done.</P>

      <P>I feel, in view of the expression of opinion that amendment No. 6 has elicited, that the object I had in my mind to eliminate this particular sub-section could not be achieved.  At least what I had in mind was that the Minister should have power in the event of neither party applying for the setting up a committee that the Minister should have power to intervene in such a case, and in the interests of the State set up a committee, and take such steps as might be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> That is the principle that is embodied in it, and that I tried to outline in connection with amendment 6, but that particular proposal did not seem to meet with general acceptance. If the larger application of the principle did not meet with general acceptance I do not see that there is very much use in pressing this minor amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept amendment 7.  Amendment 6 has been rejected by the House, not so much for what was in it as for the principle behind it.  The amendment set out definitely to establish the compulsory principle, that a trade could be designated against the will of either employers or employees, or both.  Deputy Lemass, in amendment 8, provides that if there is no application made within two years, that then, if the Minister is satisfied it is desirable that a special order should be made, the Minister may make such special order.  Deputy Good's amendment, No. 7, makes the same approach to that, but in a better way, because he simply proposes to cut out the part of the section which says that no such special order can be made unless application is first received by the Minister in the case of a trade-board, and in the case of a non-trade-board that application is made by or on behalf of employers or employees.  If that is cut out it gives a little more laxity.</P>
      <P>I have stated my policy, that I would examine the circumstances beforehand. Unless I found there was likely to be no definite opposition to this I would not make a special order.  That leaves the position a little bit more lax, and means that the Minister could act, if he thought, for instance, that people were not making application because they had not the matter properly before them.  That is why I much prefer amendment 7 to amendment 8.  The latter postpones this particular thing for two years, and it also puts the matter in a rather contentious way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see what use it is to establish trade-boards under this Bill.  Possibly the Minister will give us some information.  The only advantage that I see the Minister derives from the existence of a trade-board is that he does not appoint an apprenticeship committee where a trade-board exists.  I do not think that is an advantage, because a trade-board is appointed with a different object <Col N="228" /> altogether.  It is appointed to discharge different duties.  I was anxious that the trade-board proposal should be eliminated from the Bill.  How far the Minister approves of that I do not know.  I do not think that any trade union in the country would want to have the same representatives dealing with apprenticeship questions and ordinary trade-board questions.  The mixing up of the two is not going to be any advantage to the apprenticeship committee or to the trade-board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The apprenticeship committees will have as part of their duty the regulation of entry and the conditions of entry.  My main point is that there is certain over-lapping of functions.  I must do either of two things.  I must abolish the trade-boards as they are at the moment and establish in their place these apprenticeship committees giving them the functions set out, or else I must take the trade-boards as they stand, and add to their present functions the duties laid down under the Bill.  I have very good committees at the moment under the Trade Board Acts. They have been working very efficiently, and they are the model on which this particular machinery was prepared.  I think it would be rather disastrous either to remove them or to reappoint them as apprenticeship committees.  I would prefer to leave them as they are, and add the work of the apprenticeship committees to their present duties.  If I thought that what Deputy Good said was true, I would be very much shaken in my belief, but the opinion that I hold in regard to them is exactly the reverse of the Deputy's.  Pretty nearly every organisation of employees would appoint the same people to these committees that they have previously appointed under the trade-boards.  I <Col N="229" /> think the best thing is to keep them. If, as Deputy Good said, speaking of employers, a distinctly different type of man would be put on, I would like to have an opportunity of discussing that later with some of the employers.</P>

      <P>There is certain over-lapping, but the fact that they are doing this other work already in no way detracts from their value in so far as serving on the apprenticeship committee is concerned.  There is going to be over-lapping, but I think the best thing to do is to allow the trade-boards to remain and give them these new duties.  If necessary, we can attend to the personnel afterwards, if that is found to be a difficulty.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 50, after the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;chosen by the Minister in consultation with the organisations of employees and employers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This refers to non-trade-board trades and includes craftsmen and skilled operatives, men with a long tradition of trade union activity behind them. They constitute, Deputy Good will agree, the better organised trades.  I think the attractive feature of the Bill is that so many of its provisions are voluntary.  The Technical Commission in its report recommended that representative members should be chosen in consultation with the organisations of workers and of employers.  We would like to see that recommendation enshrined in the Bill.  I think the Minister admitted that for the proper functioning of these committees it will be necessary to have manifestations of goodwill on both sides.  For that reason I think it is necessary that the words in the amendment be inserted in order to facilitate the general working of the measure.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the Bill that the members are to represent an equal proportion of employers and employees engaged in each trade.  The amendment proposes to impose a condition that they shall be chosen in consultation with organisations of employees and employers.  There may be districts in the country where there are no such organisations, and therefore I think it is better leave the Bill as it is.  The members will have to be representative. Under the trade-board system we have no difficulty in getting representative members.  The spirit of the amendment is acceptable to me, but I think that if the amendment were to be inserted it would make the Bill a bit rigid.</P>

      <P>I did not hear Deputy Anthony make his case for the amendment, but I think that that is the important point.  Much of the Minister's argument would seem to me <Col N="233" /> to be in favour of that, namely, that the one man appointed as chairman ought to be a person who would, as it were, hold the balance evenly, and be in the nature of a conciliator, as it were, between one side and the other. If the Minister does not get agreement under the scheme he will not get very far with it.  If he gets a decision by a majority, by the votes of the appointed persons throwing in their lot with one side or the other, according to his argument, he will not get very far.  It seems to us that if the whole idea behind this Bill is the principle of agreement, or the largest possible measure of agreement, it would be better to have one man who would, as it were, be in the position of a conciliator, a person who would bring the two parties together.</P>

      <P>I think that the Deputy is speaking a little more to the point in regard to the appointed member, or members, not voting.  If there were three appointed members and they had not power to vote it would not matter.  I object to both amendments, both to cutting down the number to a single person and to the one which would preclude that person, or persons, from voting.  I would ask the Deputy to consider the rather serious work to be done by these committees.  They have to make rules under the section establishing apprenticeships.  There will be conditions of employment, wages and maximum hours of work.  Then they may go on and, in relation to compulsory powers, deal with educational qualifications, age limits, training, and the regulations as to numbers of apprentices.  On foot of these regulations afterwards prosecutions will lie. That is a rather serious responsibility to put on one person in an important industry, which may not yet be properly organised, and may not be very stable.  I would prefer to have the weight of the three persons thrown in, mainly on the side of argument, because although the matter may come up on a clear division&mdash;employers on one side, employees on the other, appointed members being split&mdash;I would much prefer, having the final judgment, to see whether the three <Col N="234" /> appointed members were on one side or whether there was division between them.  There is, of course, always the power in the background to refuse approval.  The discussions can be better carried on by three persons appointed than by a single individual. The items of discussion and the details of voting are the important things. I think that the whole weight of argument is in favour of three and of these three voting.  It will not be a matter of majority decision, one way or another, but rather of weight of argument and reasons advanced. There is better opportunity of getting an expression as to what is happening from three rather than from one person.  I think that three persons would find themselves more comfortable on such a committee, dealing with important matters, than one individual, as the three would share the responsibility.  I would plead earnestly for the power, at least, to appoint three.  That power need not always be put into operation.</P>

      <P>I have no consultation with trade board members.  My point against this amendment is the same as that against the previous one. There may not be a local association of employers in a particular area and if I went and consulted a larger national group, put the names before them, and they were objected to, would the Deputy consider that I still should appoint them?  In that case the authority of the man would be very much weakened, and, having revealed that fact to the person, I doubt if he would act.  This is rather a difficult type of work to throw on people.  It has been done with good spirit under the Trade Boards Act by people who act in an honorary way.  Perhaps the Deputy would tell me privately, because I have not heard openly that there has been any objection to the people appointed.  I think that the same spirit will run through these committees, and I think it better to leave it run in the way indicated in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again you find that in many parts of the country these non-trade board trades are not organised in any trade union.  It is not always easy to <Col N="236" /> get an impartial chairman in such areas.  I suppose that nine times out of ten you would get a chairman who would not be impartial, who would lean on the side of the employers, and who would be against the employees. In order that the chairman should be above suspicion he should not have a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my plea that these people should be as numerous as three and should be allowed to vote.  This is not a case in which voting rules.  In the end, it is not a majority of votes that is going to decide but the circumstances about the whole discussion, the circumstances under which the votes were cast and the possibility, without serious difficulty, of carrying out the regulations. It is not a question of throwing either a group of employers or a group of employees into the hands of two or three outsiders.  They should be allowed to exercise some discretion on the committee and indicate their point of view, even to the extent of voting. I think it is proper that the responsibility of voting should be put on them as it will add to their importance considerably. If the appointed members are found out afterwards to be particularly biassed in one particular direction, they will not last for any considerable time because otherwise they would only throw the business into discord.  As we have allowed them to remain with regard to numbers, we should allow them a certain amount of discretion by allowing them to vote.  It is not decisive.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister recognise the danger?  If it is a question relating to apprenticeship, and if it cannot be decided except on the casting vote of the chairman, it still remains a question.  Assuming that they were divided in the proportions of three and three or four and four, and that the chairman gave his casting vote, it still remains a question between the representatives of the employers and the employees.  I want to obviate that and to facilitate the easy working of the Bill.  If I could be quite sure that what the Minister has in mind could be translated <Col N="237" /> into action, I would be prepared to withdraw it.  I want to point out the difficulties that will exist if there is a casting vote given by the chairman.</P>

      <P>I think too much importance is being attached to the word &ldquo;vote.&rdquo;  For instance, supposing the Bill was changed to meet this situation: that there would be a discussion, and that there would be sent to me a statement as to the vote between the representative members and a recommendation from the appointed members, that would meet my purpose equally well, but there is really nothing more than that in this voting.  It only means that persons selected as being impartial, people from outside, people who have no connection with the trade, can give their interpretation of disputed points of view to the Minister.  If Deputies would say on another stage that instead of voting these members should say what has been the result of the discussion amongst the representative members, and then would add their own recommendations concerning the matter, that would meet my point. There is nothing meant by their having a vote.  If the Deputy thinks that once there is a casting vote of the chairman the thing goes ruthlessly along, that is not the way at all.</P>

While it might be suggested that the 48 hours should operate, at the same time young persons might be worked for 48 hours in the space of five days. That is a tendency I would like to restrict.  I do not think it would be a good thing, even for the industry. Whilst it might not be so injurious for adults or grown-up people to work long hours for three or four days at a stretch, it would have a very injurious effect on young people of about eighteen years of age.  That is the reason I suggest this amendment should be adopted.  I feel that the working hours each day should be restricted to a maximum of eight for a young person.</P>

      <P>Amendment 19 has been accepted, and I intended that that amendment would meet the point <Col N="242" /> that has been raised.  It has been mentioned that this Bill might give the apprenticeship committee power to fix hours of working which would be far in excess of those allowed for young people under other Acts that are now in operation.  I provide a guarantee against that through the medium of amendment 19.  The members of the committee are forbidden to increase the number of working hours set out under any enactment now in operation. I promised to bring the terms of this Bill within the terms of existing legislation dealing with trade conditions and hours of working.  I never promised to impose, through this Bill, any special conditions with regard to the hours to be worked by apprentices. If and when an eight-hour day becomes statutory in this country, amendment 19 will bring this measure into conformity.

      <P>With regard to one fairly important trade in this country, Deputy O'Connell might be doing an apprentice a great injustice if he did not allow for irregular hours of work from day to day.  I refer to the garage business.  In a country garage there <Col N="243" /> is no such thing as regularity of work. A car may come in one day, and it will have to be repaired within a certain time.  There may not be another car for several days.  The apprentice is there all the time, and if he is not allowed to be at the repair job, he will be losing a great deal of the training he is seeking.  If his eight hours terminate at six o'clock, and if the car comes in at four or five o'clock to be repaired that evening, then, as he is compelled to go away at six o'clock, he obviously loses the very chance for which he is placed in the garage.  In that particular trade there would be a great injustice to the apprentice.</P>

    <P>This is the point that I raised on the Second Reading.  I think the first regulation that the committee should make should be on these lines.  The amendment makes it compulsory on the apprenticeship committee to make these regulations.  It is essential that they should make regulations setting forth the standard of education that young persons entering an industry ought to have reached.  Naturally, the standard will vary according to the various trades which young people will enter, but there should be some definite standard, and that is the object of my amendment&mdash;to make it compulsory on the committee to make regulations in regard to educational qualifications.

      <P>Why should you deprive the people who attain only that standard, and who cannot get beyond it from being trained in a trade in which they are suitable?  It seems to me that it would only be necessary to make rules indicating qualifications for a trade where the possession of such qualifications is likely to mean better work from the apprentices or is necessary in the proper carrying out of the business.  This should be an optional matter.  I do not think it should be made compulsory on the committee to adopt such regulations.</P>

      <P>I would add to what Deputy Lemass has said, that if we take the group of matters referred to in (a) (b) (c) (d) in sub-section (1) of Section 8 and sub-section (2), they would represent all that one would expect the apprenticeship committee to determine with regard to any group. We picked out the four that we thought were essential, and also the four that we thought would lead to less trouble in the calling together of the apprenticeship committee, and the least difficulty in having designation accepted by both employers and employees.  My opinion is that if one of the latter paragraphs is left out so much more difficult will it be in the way of getting apprenticeship committees together or the idea of any designated trade being accepted.  The more rules there are that have to be made compulsory by an apprenticeship committee the more difficulty there will be experienced by employers and employees looking forward to their trade becoming designated.  This is one that gives the least difficulty.  I am not so much against this as the others.  At the same time what Deputy Lemass has said must be borne out.</P>
      <P>Practically no education may be required to become a learner in some trades and manufactures at the moment; and then why insist on the apprenticeship committee prescribing a standard of education when, in fact, what the committee will do will be to prescribe a standard so low that anybody can pass it.  I do not know what the Deputy thinks he is going to achieve or what extra value he is going to get by insisting that the committee shall prescribe this particular thing. Surely that should be left to the judgment of the committee.  If they find that the training of apprentices is hampered because people are attempting to get into a trade without a certain standard of education, then it will be time to make a rule, but I think it would be a bad thing to insist on its being done now.  It would make it a little more difficult to get the whole apprenticeship system adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1), a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;rules (in this Act referred to as rules regulating the training of apprenticeship) requiring employers carrying on such trade in such district to train and instruct apprentices employed by them in a specified manner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I look upon this as a very important amendment.  In regard to the training of apprentices, it is the opinion of many trade unionists that that is one of the most essential things in the apprenticeship system.  It used to be the practice in Government dockyards to ask some of the skilled operatives in the various grades to train apprentices.  These skilled operatives were rewarded according to the efficiency shown by the apprentices.  These dockyards turned out some very excellent craftsmen as a result of this system.  The craftsman got a certain reward when he was able to show that his apprentices made some progress.  The apprentice was subject to examination at various periods during the apprenticeship. The result was that the apprentice very soon became a finished tradesman or mechanic.  We are also aware that in many of these trades the boys are apprenticed some with fees and some without fees and very frequently they derive no benefit at all from their apprenticeship.  The consequence is that a number of unskilled operatives and mechanics and so on were thrown on the market every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> I think there is an obligation on the employer to see, when he takes an apprentice into his shop, that that apprentice will be properly treated and will be an asset to his employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  It seems to me that the two most important of these provisions are (c) and (d) of sub-section (2), that is the sub-section requiring employers to train and instruct the apprentices.  I think that the whole purpose of our vocational education and apprenticeship system is to ensure that there will be an adequate number of properly trained workers in each industry, and the putting of these rules into the optional sub-section of this section will suggest that it is a minor part of the work of the committees instead of its being the chief part of the work.  I think we should have a discussion upon the advisability of keeping any one of these in the optional part of Deputy Good's amendment, but as that has been withdrawn now, I can not discuss paragraph (d) at all at this stage.  But (c) is just as important as (d).  It would, in my opinion, be almost essential in the making of this Bill an effective instrument that the apprenticeship committee should be required to make rules regulating the training of apprentices over whom they have control.  I think in the South African Act it is compulsory on the Minister, after consultation with the committees, to make regulations concerning the training of apprentices.  In any case whether it is or not it should be made compulsory here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little bit more difficulty on this than on the last one.  I think the effect of this might be to prevent the apprenticeship committee being established, because the employers and employees on the committee might find it entirely beyond their powers to draw up a code.  Remember the paragraph runs: &ldquo;Regulations requiring employers carrying on such trade in such district to train and instruct apprentices employed by them in a specified manner.&rdquo;  They have to put down the course, so to speak.  If there is a general sort of course easily <Col N="249" /> applicable to learners or apprentices, I should say it will be done, but again I ask people to think of the consequences of making it compulsory.  If you impose on them the obligation as part of their duties that they must lay down a code which employers have to follow if they have to train their employees in a specified manner, we may prevent the apprenticeship committee coming together at all.  I think if we had an intermediary word between &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may,&rdquo; I would accept something more than &ldquo;may&rdquo; and less than &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I would make it my business to ask committees in all cases practically to make rules on all the points, but I cannot force it.  That is no good to people who want it made part of their obligation.  What we decided to do departmentally was, we would pick out things which could easily be done, and leave other things, where simple plans could not be made, to the good-will and good sensei of the committee.  The Minister, in the background, may exercise a certain good influence on them by sending back a thing to be considered. I would make it my business to see that, where possible, regulations of this type would be brought forward, but I do not like to insist on this particular thing as a matter of obligation on the committee at this particular moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it cannot be mandatory, would the Minister devise any other method by means of inspection or other means to secure that these apprentices would get proper training?  The words &ldquo;in a specified manner&rdquo; will be interpreted in the ordinary acceptation of the term. You have many instances of where lads were apprenticed to various trades in this country, and were kept during the major portion of their time doing work not appropriate to that trade at all.  That should be put an end to, and if the Minister could see that by some method of inspection it could be got rid of it might meet the case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy proposing this wants to have it compulsory.  I am not sure, from the purport of the Deputy's last remark, whether he wants to cut out these words &ldquo;in a specified manner.&rdquo;  I think that would be difficult.  The importance of the words is that a prosecution will follow a breach of these regulations, if these regulations are made.  If an inspector goes into court against an employer on the vague charge that he is not training or instructing apprentices employed by him, it would be very difficult to get any satisfaction for that. The words &ldquo;in a specified manner&rdquo; are important and, at the same time, show the extreme difficulty of the case, because this has to be always viewed from the angle of coming to court afterwards, dealing with prosecutions for breach of regulations.  In easy cases the rules will be made as, for instance, where either party can convince the appointed members that the rules ought to be made.  I think that it ought to be left as a thing which the committee may do, provided the committee agree to it.  It is better to leave it that way than to have it made an obligation upon them and have the committee possibly fail.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  rules (in this Act referred to as rules regulating the number of apprentices) fixing in relation to any specified employer carrying on such trade in such district the number (in this Act referred to as the standard number) of apprentices whom such committee considers should be employed by such employer in such trade in such district, and such number <Col N="251" /> may, if such apprenticeship committee thinks fit, be expressed as a proportion of the number of persons of any class or classes employed from time to time in such trade in such district by such employer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Objection was raised to (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 8 as it stood, and particular objection was taken to the words &ldquo;`in any particular premises,&rdquo; because it was pointed out that there might be certain operations which would not be carried out in the premises of an employer at all, and it might be difficult to get a proper application of the law.  He might be employed by a person on outside work in other premises also.  Consequently, the amendment was drafted, and I think it not merely meets that point, but other points which arise.</P>
    <P>[<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>

The three go some what together.  I think the small point the Deputy raises can be understood even from this.  They will fix a <Col N="252" /> number.

With employers the number of employees varies because sometimes they are busy and other times they are not busy, but the number of apprentices they have to take on is calculated on the number of employees they had when they were busy.  Then when the work gets slack the local committee may say: &ldquo;You have too many apprentices.&rdquo; If we are to have it one way we will have to have it the other way.  If you are going to compel the employer to take so many apprentices if the emergency arises and the committee says he has too many apprentices, I want some way of dealing with the situation.

At any rate, the trade unionists cannot have it that there may be compulsion put upon employers with regard to an existing agreement, but where they themselves do not like it the existing agreement must stand.  There is very little in the way of compulsion in this Bill, but this would remove every vestige of anything approaching to compulsion. The whole approach to this matter must be rather in a conciliatory way, so that these things probably will be taken into consideration, but I think the Bill ought to be withdrawn if this is what is to rule.  If this is going to be the criterion there is no use having the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 30:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  If, owing to the death or insolvency of the employer or for any other reason which the Minister deems satisfactory, the terms of any contract of apprenticeship in a designated trade cannot be fulfilled, or if the parties to the contract mutually agree, the Minister, in consultation with the apprenticeship committee for such trade, may arrange for the transfer of the contract to another employer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a section taken from the South African Act, which appears to me to be necessary in order to protect the interests of apprentices whose employers might die, become bankrupt, or, for some other reason, be unable to fulfil the contract.  It seems to me to be necessary, although I am not convinced of it.  The Minister, no doubt, has looked into the matter, and can tell us whether it is or not.  There does not appear to be any provision to <Col N="258" /> deal with the particular case of an apprentice whose employer goes bankrupt, and who is consequently unable to fulfil his contract with that apprentice. The purpose of the amendment is in such a case to give the apprenticeship committee power to transfer that contract to another employer, so that the apprentice's training would continue.</P>

However, I suggest that if there is going to be an amendment it ought to be more generally phrased than on the basis of death or insolvency&mdash;for instance, adding to it, &ldquo;modify such agreement or substitute-another party to the agreement.&rdquo; That would probably meet it better.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister considered the question of whom the apprentice is to be bound to, because that is involved in the amendment we have just been considering?  The transfer of an apprentice would be very much easier if the apprentice is bound, as a great many are now, to a committee instead of an employer.  That is done with the object of giving the apprentice a better training.  Supposing that the trade of an employer with whom he is learning his trade for any reason falls off, then the apprentice does not get the opportunity for learning his trade that possibly may be desirable.  In that particular case, if there is any reason for the falling off of the trade, and if he is bound to a committee, the committee can transfer him to another employer who happens to be busy in that industry, thereby giving him a better training.  That is a point that ought to be considered if the Minister has not considered it.  It is one of the more modern ideas in connection with improving the training of apprentices and it is working most satisfactorily in several large areas in America.</P>

The employer is bound to train under this Bill, and the committee can regulate the way the boy can be trained, as to the hours he is to attend and other things like that. It does not alter the question of that training at all.  It certainly does alter and make much more easy the question of transference from an employer, who may be slack, to an employer who may be busy.</P>

If you impose these regulations upon employers, it may be that you will be defeating the very purpose that this Bill has in view.  I know employers at the present moment who are very loath to take in apprentices because their work is not continuous, and they cannot guarantee that the work will be continued long enough to cover the apprenticeship period of five years.  I think there is too much legislation at the moment.  I think that we should see that the work is there before we pass rules and regulations governing it, and if we did that the country would be much better off.  I am absolutely opposed to any more regulations being imposed upon the employers or upon the workmen.  Leave them alone, I say.

      <P>To insert before Section 15 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall be an offence under this Act for any person without the written consent of the Minister directly or indirectly to require or permit any person to pay or give or to receive from any person any consideration, premium or bonus in respect of the engagement or employment of an apprentice.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds and on such conviction the court may order the person receiving such consideration, premium or bonus, to repay the amount thereof to the person by whom it was paid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment raises a question we had under discussion during the Second Reading of the Bill.  That is whether there should be regulations prohibiting the giving or requiring of a fine or bonus as a condition of apprenticeship. A number of Deputies expressed strong views on this question, and urged that the Bill should be amended so as to make it illegal for any employer to require, or for any person to pay, a fine or bonus as a condition of apprenticeship.  That is also <Col N="265" /> one of the provisions of the South African Act upon which this Bill is founded.  The Minister in preparing his Bill must have had, for some reason or another, definitely decided to insert this particular section.  What his reasons were we are anxious to know. There is a practice in certain trades requiring that apprentices shall pay, in some cases, quite substantial sums before they are admitted to apprenticeship. That particular practice results in persons in poorer circumstances being debarred from these trades.  It also results in some cases in particularly dangerous abuses, in so far as apprentices may be taken on by incompetent employers who have no real need for them, who are not in a position to train them, and whose desire is to extract the fine from parents of the apprentices.  I have myself experience of one or two cases of poor people who scraped together a fairly substantial sum of money in order to get their sons trained in a particular business.  They paid these sums by way of bonuses to particular employers who were utterly incompetent to teach their sons, and who, in fact, in one case decamped altogether before the period of apprenticeship had concluded.  If we are going to set out now to regulate the conditions of apprenticeship in particular trades we should, I think, make it one of the rules that no payment of this kind be required from any person seeking entry to any trade, and that, so long as other conditions laid down in Section 8 of the Bill are complied with, admission to industry should be open to everybody.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of this amendment. The amendment in the name of Deputy Anthony is somewhat similar to mine.  Both are based on the South African Act and embody a principle which, I think, should recommend itself to the House, particularly to those Deputies who have had experience of incidents such as I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment moved by Deputy Lemass.  It is much on the lines of one that I have down.  In view of <Col N="266" /> all that Deputy Lemass has said on his amendment with regard to this system of taking fees for apprentices there is no need for me to say much.  Like Deputy Lemass, I am aware of some very sad cases where parents or guardians of boys paid substantial fees to have them trained to some trade.  Two cases occurred recently in Cork in the electrical trade.  Fees were taken for the training of apprentices.  The person who took the fees was not able to teach the boys any trade at all.  He took his departure to England a short time afterwards and has not since been heard of.  The practice is far more common than many people imagine. I understand it is quite common in Dublin City.  It is pretty common in Cork City, too, but I think that some of those who acted in that way in the past will not try it on again.</P>

There is no obligation on the committee to make a rule regulating the numbers.  If the committee does not make such a rule, then a premium may be demanded by an employer.

There may be something in the point that Deputy <Col N="268" /> Lemass urged a moment ago, that if there were a dozen people offering for apprenticeship and four of them say they will pay a premium, these four may be taken in preference to other people.  If we want to prohibit that it is a very serious matter, and should be debated on a proper amendment, and not on this amendment, which is far too wide in its scope.  The matter might be debated on a simple amendment prohibiting premiums in cases in which rules have been made regulating numbers.</P>

      <P>Because if the committee do not think it desirable to lay down rules with regard to numbers, there must be some reason operating in their minds to prevent their doing that, for instance, special considerations applying to the business.  Without knowing what those conditions are it seems to me that we should not casually do away with the rather common system of paying premiums or bonus for training to be given.  There are certain obligations imposed on employers, and I would rather have the question of premiums tied up with some of these conditions.  I picked out the rule relating to numbers, but the question might also be tied up with the rule relating to educational qualifications, although I think it would be rather ironic to tie it up with that.  I object entirely to the amendment, because it proposes to sweep away the premium system from every profession or trade, irrespective of whether it is a designated trade coming under this Bill or not.  I would object to the sweeping away of the premium system completely even in the case of a designated trade.  I would prefer to have the question considered in relation to some rule or regulation that the committee can make.  If Deputies express the desire to have premiums done away with generally in relation to apprentices in designated trades, then I can have considered, between now and the Report Stage, which of the paragraphs it should be attached to and what conditions should be attached to the non-enforcement of premiums.</P>

      <P>It is not the custom, as Deputy McDonogh stated, in the larger industries, as far as I know, to accept premiums.  In the industry with which I am connected there are no premiums. They have gone out of fashion.  As the Deputy pointed out, there are trades in which premiums still are paid for certain returns which the apprentices obtain.  I agree with the Minister that it would be inadvisable to sweep away the whole system without due enquiry.  If the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable to maintain premiums in particular departments I think he should have liberty to do so in the Bill.  I am quite satisfied that the question will not arise.</P>

      <P>I do not expect that that will be a very satisfactory conclusion&mdash; to prevent the giving of fees in a designated trade and to allow it to prevail in other trades.  That will obviously raise the fees in trades not designated.  Fees have been going up recently.  I heard an employer remarking the other day that he thought he could live entirely on the fees from apprentices if he were prepared to accept all that offered.  I think the Principal of the technical schools in Dublin could tell the Minister that it is becoming practically impossible to place boys who have been trained there because they are not able to meet the demands for fees made by employers.  It does not seem to me to be satisfactory to have one class of trades where fees are prohibited and to have perhaps much bigger classes where they are allowed.</P>

    <P>To submit a person to a fine of £20 for employing an apprentice who had not the educational qualifications laid down in the rules is, in my opinion, a preposterous proposal.  We must take into account the fact that very many employers will be unable to judge the educational qualifications of apprentices. If the Minister replies that such employers have the committee to appeal to, it must be remembered that very often there are ties of blood and family friendships that are urging them to employ particular persons.  It could not be regarded as a very serious offence in view of the vague term &ldquo;educational qualifications&rdquo; to employ apprentices who would not be up to standard.

The scheme throughout is that there are rules which may be made.  The penalty for contravention of the rules, I think, in every case is a fine of £20, but you come to certain things incidental to the rules, such as the keeping of records, where the penalty varies.  I would like to have an expression by way of an amendment before the Report Stage.  It might be held that the penalty for falsifying a record, for instance, is too small.

There is a good deal to be said for Deputy Moore's attitude, and I think he should bring in an amendment at a later period, but at the same time we must have regard to the commonsense of the committees to be appointed.  I take it that no committee will require an apprentice, say, to bootmaking, to have a university degree.  It simply demands a certain standard of education, that standard being something of an elementary character.  Any of us who have given any service on technical instruction committees knows that a number of boys came to the technical schools to avail of technical education, but were unable to go into the first technological class because they could not do simple multiplication.  What is the use of giving a boy a formula to work out certain results when he cannot do simple multiplication? How can you ask him to do sums in simple proportion when he cannot add five and five?</P>

      <P>According to Deputy Anthony, the sins of the employers are to be visited on the apprentices. Because the employers have not enabled the children to get a proper education they are not to be allowed to get training in a designated trade. I think it will be found that there will be so many different standards for different trades no committee will be able to fix an educational standard.  As the Minister pointed out, there are a great many trades in which the lowest standard that would be fixed would hardly be required by the apprentices. If you visualise an instance where a man has a relation, a cousin or a nephew, who desires to be an apprentice, are you going to say that that man has first to look up the educational standard fixed by the local committee, and if the boy is not up to that standard, he has to dismiss him under a penalty of £20?  Such a proposal is quite unreasonable.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where any rules regulating the number of apprentices made by an apprenticeship committee are for the time being in force and such rules fix a standard number in relation <Col N="275" /> to any specified employer, it shall not be lawful for such employer to take into his employment by way of apprenticeship in the district of such committee in the trade for which such committee is established any person unless&mdash;</P>

    <P>This and the next amendment are the amendments to which I directed Deputy Good's attention earlier.  This amendment aims at preventing the standard number of apprentices being exceeded by any employer taking in new apprentices.

    <P>(1)  Where any rules regulating the number of apprentices made by an apprenticeship committee are for the time being in force and such rules fix a standard number in relation to any specified employer, if and whenever such employer employs in the district of such committee in the trade for which such committee is established either no apprentice or a number of apprentices less than such standard number, such committee may make an order in the prescribed form requiring him to take into his employment by way of apprenticeship in such district in such trade such number of persons as will make the total number of apprentices employed <Col N="276" /> by him in such district in such trade equal to such standard number.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever an order is duly made under the foregoing sub-section in relation to an employer and such order is personally served on such employer, it shall be the duty of such employer to comply with such order within one month after such service, and if he fails so to do he shall, unless he satisfies the court that such failure was due to some unavoidable cause, be guilty of an offence under this section and be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers back to the point which Deputy Moore mentioned on Section 8, the number which the committee consider should be the maximum.

If it read, &ldquo;may, if suitable representations to the employer had been made without effect,&rdquo; I think that would make the amendment more useful.  As it stands, you have a committee and there may be an employer that none of them has any particular reason to be sympathetic with.  Such employer may be found not to be employing the requisite number of apprentices and the committee may make an order compelling him to take the necessary number into his business.

Deputy Coburn was not in for the discussion but on that very point there was a discussion.  As the Bill stands at the moment the committee may not establish any rule, that is, the duty is imposed upon them to establish a rule but if they do not do it there is no enforcement.

      <P>The committee may make an order requiring a man to take into his employment such a number as to make the total equal to the standard number. There is a sub-section which follows providing that when the order is made the employer must comply, and if he fails to do so he shall, unless he satisfies the Court that the failure was due to some unavoidable cause, be guilty of an offence.  I do not know what other buffer is required between the committee which, we will have to suppose, is likely to act in a reasonable way and this employer.  If the committee is so full of hostility to one employer&mdash;these were the circumstances the Deputy outlined, the committee being inimical to a certain employer, deciding to force it on him, subjecting him to very vindictive treatment, and going to force on him a certain number of employees&mdash;does the Deputy think that this hostility is going to be lessened in any way if you ask them to make representations to an employer before serving an order on him? I do not think it helps the would-be victimised employer to any great extent. I think there is sufficient difficulty in the matter already, and a sufficiently easy approach to the difficulty in the matter already.  The committee establishes what it thinks would be the proper number.  It gives notice of that.  If it finds that an employer is not complying it serves notice on him to take on the number, and then Court proceedings follow if he refuses. I do not know what the Deputy wants.</P>

      <P>The stages are then: the committee decides on a certain number of apprentices to each employer; it is reported that an employer in the district has not complied with that rule; the committee then immediately serve notice on him to employ that number, and if he has not done so <Col N="280" /> within a certain time, the next stage is that he is taken into Court.

      <P>Before the amendment is put finally there is one aspect of the question that should be considered. Supposing a committee says to an employer, &ldquo;You are to take so many apprentices,&rdquo; and that that employer takes on that number of apprentices, the members of the local trades union may say, &ldquo;We will go out on strike.&rdquo; Is any penalty to be imposed on the local trades union, or is all the penalty to be put on the employer?  We want the Bill to be fair.  I have not seen that any penalty attached to any trade union in this connection. They happen to do things which are illegal, like the rest of us at times. They would make it difficult for the man to take on the number of apprentices by saying, &ldquo;If you take them on we will go out on strike.&rdquo;  On the other hand, if he does not take them on, he is penalised by the committee. Whose advice is he to take?  The obvious thing is to put in a clause&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before Section 24 is passed, may I ask the Minister if he has considered making any provision against the giving by employers of certificates which are incorrect and misleading as regards the apprentices? This is one of the plagues of the day and it is doing a very great amount of <Col N="283" /> harm.  Apprentices who have merely knocked about in a business, and who have been attached to it in the vaguest possible way, are able to get splendid certificates from employers.  Very often these certificates are couched in the most elaborate language, testifying to the skill and industry these apprentices have shown and their genius for business&mdash;all of which is often entirely incorrect.  Very often too these youths are in trades where the employment bears on the safety of human life.  It is a very frequent complaint throughout the country that testimonials or certificates from employers in a good many trades cannot be trusted at the present time&mdash;that no reliance can be attached to them.  It looks to me, without having heard anything from the Minister on the matter, that to ignore that matter was a curious omission on his part.  It would have been a very useful reform if he had provided against the giving of certificates that would be incorrect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Moore has raised this point because it is a most important one.  The standard of craftsmanship has fallen very considerably in recent years and I am not sure it is not continuing to fall.  We would like to see the standard raised rather than to see it falling.  This is a point that has been worrying a number of employers for a considerable period.  A number of them are agreed that before the apprentice gets a certificate he should be called upon to pass an examination in the craft to which he is being apprenticed and that he should not be allowed, if he has not given any attention to his work or to his work in the schools while he has been passing through his term of apprenticeship, to get that certificate. Such a boy should be penalised. Furthermore, that is the only way that will raise the standard of craftsmanship.  I would like the Minister to consider that particular aspect of the question.  It is unfair that a boy who is of a very poor standard from the point of view of his craft and who has given no attention to the business <Col N="284" /> should be set free and treated after a certain time in exactly the same way as the boy who has given attention to his work and knows his craft.</P>

      <P>Whilst I agree in general with what Deputy Good has stated, still I think the boy is penalised enough if, as a result of his inefficiency, he will not get employment. Surely the employer is not such a fool as to keep an inefficient man in his employment.  It would be up to the apprentice himself to make himself efficient in his trade, otherwise when he is finished with the apprenticeship he will not get employment. I am sure Deputy Good would be the last man to keep in his employment a man who is inefficient. I do not know how the Minister could include in this Bill a section dealing with the point raised by Deputy Good and Deputy Moore.  Many a time, I am sure, Deputy Moore gave a character to a person in order to get employment and perhaps the new employer might not find the man at all efficient or up to the necessary standard. Of course Deputy Moore would give that character in good faith.  Any other employer might just do the same. It is hard to fix a general rule in these cases.  The whole thing would depend upon the employer.  He will soon find out whether the man he employs is capable or incapable, and if he is not a good man he will not keep him.</P>

      <P>I think the last speaker has given the answer to the points that have been raised.  The complaint is made that a man might go into a particular trade and he would get the same wages as really skilled persons although, because of his lack of skill, he would not deserve those wages.  I think that matter would be regulated by the employer, who would very soon find out if the man were worth retaining.  As to whether people will get into occupations under what amounts to false pretences, I would like to point out to Deputies that a register is to be kept under the provisions of this Bill, and that register will give a certain amount of information <Col N="285" /> in regard to workers.  There will have to be a register kept and particulars will have to be entered by employers. That register will be open to inspection.  If an employer wants to find out anything about a worker, he can go to the register and he will see the particulars laid down under the designated trade to which the worker is attached.  He will see there details about education, progress, etc.  Of course, there would be nothing like a certificate.  To advance to that point would bring us a very long distance.  It would necessitate the setting up of some examining body with power to issue what would correspond to a leaving certificate.  I doubt very much if that is required, but if it is pressed it would mean going a long way.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the discontent prevalent amongst the lower grades in the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should set up a Commission of Enquiry to investigate and report on the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus and its application to civil servants' salaries and wages.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned last night, I was discussing <Col N="288" /> the factors which determined the accuracy or otherwise of the cost-of-living index as an indicator of the relative variations in the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living.  I showed that the standard of living selected as a norm might be lessened quite arbitrarily, that it might have no relation whatsoever to the actual living conditions of any section of the people, that the value of the index depends upon the degree to which the price movement of each group correctly represents the price movements of the group covered by the index as a whole.  I also stated that the value of the index depends on the quantity of the articles actually consumed as well as on the prices of the articles, and that any change in the quality or quantity of the articles destroys the accuracy in the cost-of-living index as a reflex of actual living conditions.  In general, I pointed out that over a period a cost-of-living index is reliable only so far as the commodities and the quantities upon which the index is based remain truly representative of the actual consumption of the class of the community to which the index is to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical difficulty of maintaining the representative character of a cost-of-living index is very great, being due to the fact that the consumption relative to the aggregate consumption of the several commodities is not the same for all sections or classes within the community, and indeed is not the same for all individuals within a class. We find that exemplified in the report of the Cost of Living Committee itself. For instance, in a household where the income is under £3, we find that 61 per cent. of the total expenditure is upon food.  Where the income is £3 that percentage decreases to 60.4.  Where the income is £4 it falls to 56.3.  Where the income is £5 it falls to 48, and where the income is £6 and upwards it falls to 41.4, upon food.  In a household where the income is £6 and upwards 41 per cent. of the expenditure is represented by the purchase of food, whereas in households where the income is under £3, 61 per cent. of the expenditure is made upon commodities within that group.  I have shown that as the income increases within a household <Col N="289" /> the proportion which is spent upon food tends to decline.  The converse of this is true with regard to rent and certain other groups of commodities upon which our cost-of-living index is based. For instance, in a household where the income is £3 and under, 15 per cent. of the expenditure is upon clothing, but where the income is £6 a week and over, the proportion of the expenditure upon that item rises to 17.7 per cent. In the case of rent in households where the income is under £3, the proportion of the expenditure ascribed to rent is 5.3 per cent.  Where the income is £6 and upwards expenditure upon rent rises to 12.4 per cent.  According to our classification here sundries include soap, pipe tobacco, cigarettes and miscellaneous items.  That expenditure forms 9.2 per cent. of the total household expenditure where the income is £3 and under, and rises to 19.5 per cent. where the income is £6 and upwards.</P>
    <P>The very fact that there is this extreme variation between the expenditures, not only, as I have said, between the several classes of the community in regard to one particular group, but also even for individuals within the same class, makes it impossible to construct a cost-of-living index for the country as a whole which, at the moment, will indicate with reasonable accuracy the change in the cost of maintaining the standard of living in any other section of the community except that in which the primary data to calculate the index have been originally secured.  This fact receives attention in some countries.</P>
    <P>In Belgium five series of cost-of-living numbers are applied to corresponding classes in the community, and in Switzerland there are three.  In this country we have only one cost-of-living index.  Remember that index, moreover, is based upon an entirely inadequate number of returns, as I showed last night.  Our cost-of-living index is based upon 308 complete returns made between, I think, the 10th June, 1922, and 4th August, 1922. I submit that those returns are entirely inaccurate and entirely unreliable for the purpose of calculating what should be after all, so far as we can make <Col N="290" /> it, a precise and reliable indicator as to the variation in the cost of living. Those returns, moreover, have been procured mainly from one class. According to the Report itself, the budgets received were from a very varied class of households, which, as will be seen from the following lists, embrace the principal industrial occupations.  In that list there are unskilled labourers, fishermen, messengers, servants, pilots, barmen, carpenters, boatmen, dressmakers, bakers, embroidery workers, knitters, plumbers, road engine drivers, etc., but not a single civil servant.  Out of the 308 returns which were received, according to this list, so far as I can see, there is not one return, and certainly no significant number of returns, no such number as would affect the result of the calculation, were made by civil servants.  Notwithstanding that the index in this country at least is applied in the most general and most rigorous way to a large body of clerical workers, the privates and corporals in the cuff and collar brigade, whose mode of life is different, even if the real standard of living be lower, from that of the skilled industrial worker. The expenditure which the civil servant, particularly in the lower class grade, has to incur upon articles such as food, rent and furniture, I think it must be admitted, is very much higher than that which has to be met by a worker in an industrial occupation. He has got to maintain a decent appearance during all the hours of his work.  The fitter or boiler-maker or motor mechanic can work all day in his dungarees, and can go home and change at night.  In that way he can economise on the question of clothes, but a man who has to go into a Government office has to maintain at all times a dressy appearance, to put it that way.  He has to be clean and tidy, and have clothes which are not ragged, torn or tattered.  To me, looking at the rates of pay which some of the smaller civil servants have, it is a constant wonder how they are able to maintain the appearance they do.  I can only assume that they do it by spending upon clothes what might be much better <Col N="291" /> spent on food.  Again, while the industrial worker may not have to spend so much upon clothes, he has, on the other hand, because his labour is manual, to spend a greater portion of his weekly income upon more expensive kinds of foodstuffs.  For that reason it is quite clear to anyone who has examined this question that a cost-of-living index which has been constructed mainly upon household budgets which have been procured from industrial households cannot be properly applied as an indicator of the change in the cost of maintaining the standard of living which might be properly enjoyed by the lower grade civil servant or by any civil servant.  In saying that, I do not mean to be taken that the standard of living which the present wages and salaries afford to the lower grade civil servant is an adequate one.  I am merely discussing the cost-of-living index, to indicate the change in the standard of living, which, as I said, has no relation whatever to the actual standard on which the civil servants live.</P>
    <P>Again, as I think I pointed out last night, the difficulties in compiling an accurate cost-of-living index are created by reason of the fact that variations in the prices of the groups are not uniform throughout the whole territory, if that territory be widespread. That fact also receives recognition abroad in certain countries. Speaking off-hand, at the moment, I think in Austria and in Germany there are regional cost-of-living indices and it would seem to me that if the wages and salaries of the civil servants are to be made dependent in any way upon the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living so far as this country is concerned we would almost want to have recourse to regional indices because the cost of living in Dublin is very different from the cost of living in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and greatly different from the cost of living in some of the smaller towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Last night I referred to the statement with which the Ministry of Economic Affairs in August, 1922, prefaced its report in which they say <Col N="292" />&ldquo;The inquiry applied to the whole of Ireland, and its basis is therefore broad enough to be reasonably dependable for any practical purpose to which a calculation as to changes in cost of living can usefully be applied.&rdquo;  I deny that in toto.  I think it is a ridiculous statement.  I think it is generally recognised that you cannot get that sort of basis in this country which the Minister for Economic Affairs in the Provisional Government claims to have found in August, 1922.  Certainly a cost-of-living index compiled on returns secured from the whole of Ireland cannot be made to apply in any fair or just way to the variations in the standard of living of the civil servant. The great mass of civil servants are concentrated in our large cities. The overwhelming mass is concentrated in Dublin.  There are many factors which would make it reasonable to say that a cost-of-living index for the city of Dublin alone might be compiled, but to say that a cost-of-living index which has been compiled as a result of returns secured in the first place from an inadequate number of households and in the second place mainly from industrial workers, and in the third place from 308 families scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country, would be fair and just in its application to a section of the community which is largely concentrated in Dublin, I think, as I said before, is ridiculous and could not be defended in any way.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister addressing himself to that aspect.  There are circumstances here the mere recital of which ought to convince the Minister of that.  The cost of housing in Dublin is very much higher, and it tends to go higher.  I do not believe that there has been any significant fall in the cost of houses in Dublin during the past few years.  Houses which for many reasons may be available in the country&mdash; fairly large houses which have become vacant owing to the fact that sections of the people have left this country and which have helped to solve the problem of housing the middle classes&mdash;are not available here in Dublin except at rents which hear absolutely no relation to the figure for rent which was <Col N="293" /> selected and which was chosen by the Committee as the basis for its loading of that item in the cost-of-living index. I will give the House the exact figure and let them judge as to whether what I am saying is true or not.  In page 10 of the report, paragraph (c), the Committee prefaced this part of the report by an admission which is intended to disarm criticism: &ldquo;A point likely to give rise to criticism is the low percentage increase shown for rent.  This figure is, however, the result of comparing the actual returns sent us by the town clerks and rate collectors.&rdquo; According to this the average weekly rent in July, 1914, was 4/-; March, 1922, 5/2d.; June, 1922, 5/2d.  It is on that percentage, the variation of just a little over 25 per cent. for the cost-of-living index, which applies to the majority of civil servants living here in Dublin, where you would not even get a dog kennel let alone a house for 5/2d. a week, has been based.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to deal with, and that is the method of calculating the index figure. It is based on the old British cost-of-living index, which was calculated according to the system of arithmetical averages.  That system has fallen greatly into disfavour.  It is admitted on all hands that it gives rise to serious inaccuracies.  The method of calculating the index figure by the geometric average is coming into favour, and is practically accepted as being the only correct one.</P>
    <P>One other argument in favour of the motion is the fact that it is now universally recognised that the calculation of this cost-of-living index should be examined from time to time; that the commodities in the groups should be examined individually to see that they are actually representative of the purchases of the community as a whole; that the loadings according to the groups have to be checked periodically, and that in short there is an unanswerable case for a general periodic revision of the cost-of-living index.  This cost-of-living index of ours was originally compiled in March and June, 1922, when conditions in this country were very unsettled, compiled <Col N="294" /> at a time when the variations between prices in each locality were wide, when the variations from month to month were wide, and when there was really no representative figure that could be taken to form a basis of any cost-of-living index.  Even on this ground alone, revision is necessary, but in addition to that ten years have passed.</P>
    <P>I have shown that the index in its present form could only apply, if it applies at all, to certain sections of the industrial workers.  It certainly could not apply to the general body of civil servants, to whom the Government apply it in its full rigour.  There is undoubtedly a case, which I do not believe the Minister can answer, for investigation and examination as to the manner in which the cost-of-living index is computed.  If we are to continue to try to regulate wages by means of a cost-of-living index&mdash;and we do, either consciously or subconsciously; the general tendency is in wages disputes and in matters like that to appeal to the cost-of-living index as an arbiter, as setting a norm by which the issue in dispute may be decided&mdash;it is essential that it should be as accurate as human ingenuity and mathematical skill can make it.  We should have that cost-of-living index for more than one section of the community.  We should have it for the industrial worker, because the commodities which he consumes and the rent which he pays, and his expenses upon certain items, such as clothes, differ considerably from the expenditure, say, of clerical workers upon the same things. There should be an index for the industrial worker, there should be an index for the clerical worker, and, if we want to regulate remuneration higher than that by means of the standard of living, there ought to be an index for the middle-class worker.</P>

      <P>I was arguing that we should have a separate series of indices for the several classes in the community, but whether we should have a separate series or not, there is <Col N="295" /> one thing we ought to be sure of and that is, that the index which is to be applied to determine the remuneration of civil servants should be an accurate one and one in which they could have confidence.  The general body of civil servants is composed of men whose very training makes them interested in statistics, because they have a knowledge of statistics and because they know the weakness in the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that discontent is widespread through the Civil Service.  We have heard Deputy Anthony refer to it, and we see it in the journals of the Civil Service that come to us.  I am not surprised that such discontent should exist, particularly amongst the lower grades, because they see that an entirely unfair standard has been adopted to determine what is going to be their remuneration from quarter to quarter.  It would be a good thing if the Minister would bear in mind the facts which I have put before him, if he would remember that the general mass of the civil servants are capable of appreciating the factors which should be taken into consideration in compiling the cost-of-living index, and the factors which vitiate the cost-of-living index when it has been compiled, and the fact, above all things, that a cost-of-living index compiled from a working-class budget makes it impossible to apply that index to the budget of a clerical worker or a civil servant.  That fact is before the general body of civil servants and, I am sure, it rankles there and causes discontent.  If the Minister wants to have a satisfied Civil Service he ought to meet Deputy Anthony in the motion which he has before the House; he ought to set up this inquiry into the present method of computing the cost-of-living index, and its application particularly to the lower grades of civil servants.  He will be doing a service not only to his own administration, not only to the general mass of civil servants, but to the community as a whole.  It is an inquiry which can be carried out at comparatively little cost.  He has already a statistical Department.  He has a Department <Col N="296" /> which is accustomed to calculating the index.  The only thing now is, instead of continuing to calculate as heretofore on a wrong basis, they should calculate it upon a right basis, and compile an index which will give confidence to the general mass of the people to whom it is applied.</P>

      <P>I think a great deal, in fact, almost all of what Deputy MacEntee has said is without relevance to the case that we really have to consider.  Deputy MacEntee has proved, as anybody could prove, that it is impossible to have an index figure that would apply with equal fairness to everybody.  He has proved that, in fact, if we wanted to have something that would enable salaries to be adjusted absolutely to the cost of living of each individual, we would want to have that particular individual's family or personal budget before us and to fix a cost-of-living index figure for himself.  That is what Deputy MacEntee's argument amounts to if carried to its logical conclusion. But the thing to remember is that this particular method of dealing with the bonus represents a contract between civil servants and this Government.</P>
      <P>The British cost-of-living figure which is admittedly based on the budgets of industrial workers, was accepted in 1920 by the Civil Service, by the Whitley Council on which both the staffs and the official side were represented, and it was agreed upon as the figure by which Civil Service bonuses would be regulated.  The Saorstát civil servants, a majority of whom are transferred civil servants, were transferred to us with that as their right, to have the bonus variable by reference to the variation in the cost-of-living index figure, and the cost-of-living index figure which is a good and well-founded figure is constructed on the same lines as the British figure and is, in fact, more favourable to the civil servants.  In fact, civil servants here are receiving more in the way of bonus than they would be receiving to-day if there was no change of Government and the British index figure was being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Deputy Anthony, both in his original speech and in last night's variation or second edition of it, appealed for a cessation of cuts.  In fact, no cuts in any true sense of the word take place.  There are these adjustments according to the agreed principle.  There was a time when there were great additions to the bonus, sharp increases in the amount of the bonus, and there were no protests naturally then.  There are protests now and the protests are quite natural. It is quite natural that a civil servant who finds his salary being reduced should be discontented over it.  He would be super-human, or inhuman, if he was not discontented.  It is very difficult for any individual even when the value of money is rising, because the prices of commodities are falling, to adjust his expenditure, and any decrease in the amount of income that person receives always involves him in a certain amount of hardship and difficulty.  Even if we were to adopt Deputy Anthony's term of cuts there has not been this series of 10 per cent. and 5 per cent. cuts to which the Deputy referred.  One would think, listening to him that every month salaries were going down by large amounts.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts of the case. The total decrease in the remuneration of the civil servant, that is the civil servant who is getting the full bonus since it was at its highest figure in 1922, is just over 10 per cent.  That index figure, at its highest, since the setting up of the Saorstát, was 190. It is now 170, so that the total decrease has been 20 points, or 10.5 per cent. In nine years, therefore, the amount of the decrease has been roughly 10 per cent., yet Deputy Anthony talked about all these cuts, and about 10 per cent. and 5 per cent., as if there had been several decreases as high as the total decrease over the whole period.</P>
    <P>[<i>Deputy Fahy took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Now, the suggestion that this cost-of-living bonus should not apply, and that we should not follow the index figure in dealing with the cost-of-living bonus, is simply a suggestion that at this time, when prices are falling, when <Col N="298" /> there is some tendency to a decrease in the yield of taxation, we should, in effect, increase the real salaries of civil servants all round.  That is what it amounts to: That we should, perhaps, pay £70,000 or £140,000 more than we bargained to pay, and that civil servants, in spite of this arrangement about the bonus, which was accepted by representatives of the Civil Service, should, in fact, get an increase in their real remuneration at a time when people outside have in many cases to accept decreased remuneration; when the farming community, with the tendency in prices that exists, is faced with accepting decreased remuneration.</P>
    <P>Everybody who talks against the present arrangement suggests that this decrease in prices does not affect anyone. Apparently, no matter how prices go down, they do not affect the civil servant who has a bonus, but, as I admit, and as is apparent, while the adjustment will not fit every individual case precisely, and no figure can ever be got that will fit every individual case precisely, there is no doubt that the movements in the index figure do represent pretty closely the variation in prices as they affect any individual, except, perhaps, those who are relatively wealthy, and that they do affect, pretty closely, not merely skilled industrial workers, but the lower grades of the Civil Service also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony departed a good deal from the narrow ground of the cost-of-living figure and talked about the representative council and the need for hearing the point of view of civil servants.  Now we are quite willing, at any time, to discuss the whole matter of the bonus with representatives of the civil servants.  We are anxious that the representatives of the staffs should discuss with us anything they wish to put up in relation to the bonus. But the peculiar thing was that when the question of the cost-of-living bonus was put down by the Department of Finance for the representative council the staff representatives refused to attend and discuss it.  There is a representative council which is still in existence, though great bodies of civil servants are not represented on it.  If <Col N="299" /> they care to attend on that body they can have as good discussion as it is possible to have on the matter.  There will be present representatives of the Department of Finance and the heads of other Departments.  All the important classes of civil servants, if they wish, can be represented and can put forward their point of view.  They can not merely put forward their point of view and be listened to, but can have that discussed across the table.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony suggested that what we wanted in this matter was something in the nature of Whitleyism. Whitleyism will not carry us very far. Whitleyism is all right as long as prices are going up, as long as there is an increase in revenue, and as long as you have conditions bordering on something like those that prevail when there is inflation, when new concessions can be given every week, when bargains, if they must be adjusted, will be adjusted in the interests of the Civil Service. But it is quite a different thing in present conditions when prices are falling, when revenue yields are less, and when if any changes have to be made must, if possible, be in the nature of reducing or limiting expenditure.  The present bonus arrangement was adopted by the Whitley Council.  It was agreed to by both sides.  As long as there was an increase in the bonus, as long as it was steady, well and good, but now that the bonus has fallen we have a widespread demand for the setting aside of the arrangement.  If we had Whitleyism to-morrow there would be no more satisfaction with it than there was with the representative council.  The real objection to the sort of representative council that we had was not to its constitution, but to the fact that under conditions as they exist, with agriculture in its present state and the difficulties that agriculturists have to face, it is not possible to give general increases and improved concessions to civil servants.  No matter how the Council was constituted that would have to be so.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been put forward from time to time that any differences of opinion that might arise in relation <Col N="300" /> to the Civil Service bonus or salaries should be submitted to arbitration.  In my opinion, in spite of the fact that the arbitration system was established in Great Britain just as the Whitley Council was established there, the system is entirely unsuitable for this particular work and entirely unjustified. The claim for it has no regard to the real facts of the situation. When there was a dispute a year or two ago about the wages of the Dublin tramway employees and when an arbitrator was appointed, he was able to look at the two sides of the case; to examine not merely the claim put forward by the workers, but the facts submitted to him by the Tramway Company as to the state of its business.  If you were to have an arbitrator to deal with Civil Service salaries only one side of the thing would be looked at. The condition of affairs relating to the real employer of civil servants would not be looked at at all.  It is not a fact that the real employer of civil servants is the Executive Council, the Government of the Oireachtas, but rather the ordinary taxpayers of the country.  The Government is only a representative and the only proper arbitrator that you could have for dealing with civil servants' salaries and conditions of employment in the Civil Service is, I venture to assert, the Minister for Finance.  He is the person, who, by his position, must look to the two sides of the case.  He must try to recruit, and keep in existence, a Civil Service sufficiently satisfied to do its work satisfactorily, fixing salaries that will bring in the right type of material, material good enough to do the State's work.  On the other hand he is in the position to have regard to the burden on the ordinary taxpayer, and must have regard to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, unlike the ordinary employer, has no personal interest in keeping down civil servants' salaries or in trying to reduce them. He is actually in the position of an arbitrator trying to give fair play to civil servants on the one hand and to the ordinary taxpayer on the other.  I think the claim which some people have made for an arbitrator in connection with Civil Service salaries is en- <Col N="301" /> tirely and essentially unreasonable. That is because they have not examined the question.  No person can be put in a position to exercise the functions of an arbitrator in regard to this matter other than the Minister for Finance who must look to the two sides of the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the case of a civil servant who in a salary and bonus had, I think he said, £5 6s. Od. a week, and mentioned that he had suffered a loss of 35s. a week.  I would like to say this, that the major part of that reduction had taken place before the change of Government.  The Deputy did not inform the House that the particular individual he referred to, since coming over to the Free State service, had been reduced not more than 12s. or 13s. instead of 35s.  The agitation in regard to this matter has got a great deal of its fuel from the mere fact that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, who is a Labour Chancellor, at one stage refrained, or at any rate agreed, that the bonus should not fall in accordance with the cost-of-living figures.  But since then he has been obliged by the general economic conditions in Great Britain to declare that hereafter the cost-of-living figure will be rigidly adhered to. I think if that concession had not been temporarily made in Great Britain we would not have half the agitation here.</P>
    <P>People who talk about the contentment that would be caused by agreeing to examine this matter, thereby holding out hopes that we were going to let any variation in the bonus cease, cannot have followed events on the other side of the Irish Sea because the operation in regard to the bonus there certainly did not lessen discontent.</P>
    <P>They multiplied discontent enormously, and I am positive if we were to suggest that by passing this motion we were prepared to put the civil servants who were transferred in a better position than they would be if they had remained in Great Britain, that we were prepared to vary the contract against the ordinary taxpayer, and found at the end of the investigation that nothing happened, instead of stopping discontent we would have <Col N="302" /> fanned it into a flame.  The position of the Government is this, that the civil servants who were transferred&mdash; and they are the bulk of the Service&mdash; are getting what they are entitled to. They are getting more than they would have had if the British Government were still here and if they were servants of the British Government.  In view of the economic condition of the country we do not see that we would be justified in varying conditions so as to improve their financial position.</P>
    <P>I have defended civil servants here when attacks were made on the bonus. I have defended civil servants here when the main bulk of them were charged with negligence and incompetence, and I have the highest respect for the whole mass of the civil servants for their capacity and their zeal generally.  But there are more people in the country than civil servants, and there are other people who are just as important as civil servants. I think the ordinary farmer who is faced with falling prices, or the trader who is carrying on under the difficulties of falling prices, is entitled to just as much consideration as the civil servant who, in most cases, has probably suffered a fall in his real remuneration. There is no reason why we should adopt measures to increase the real remuneration of civil servants.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go at great detail into the arguments of Deputy MacEntee.  With some of them the Minister for Industry and Commerce wishes to deal.  As I have shown, they simply indicate, if you carry them to a logical conclusion, that nothing should be done by reference to the cost-of-living index figure at all, that no cost-of-living index figure will be fair when you come down to the individual. As he pointed out, the cost-of-living figure here is compiled on a method based on the method adopted in the British index.  The only thing we did was this: we varied the weighting, and we varied it in favour of the Civil Service.  If we had done in 1922 what we were perfectly entitled to do, adopted the British weighting, the cost-of-living index figure would be constantly five points lower here right <Col N="303" /> through.  By the variation which we made we have thrown on the taxpayers since 1922 a burden of some £70,000 a year.</P>
    <P>What we did then was, we took the 1922 standard of living back to 1914. We got the 1914 prices from the various records, and we calculated our basic figure in that way.  I do not understand what Deputy MacEntee meant when he said that there were no representative figures in 1922, and when he tried to argue, I think, that everything was vitiated since, because we began in 1922 when there were disturbed conditions.  As I pointed out, the fact is that we got the budgets for 1922, and we got the prices of commodities from traders' records as they were in 1914, and calculated the basic figure in that way.  The various figures issued at intervals indicate the variations that have taken place since that time.  They certainly represent pretty closely, even for the lower-paid civil servants, changes in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the fact that the reduction in the bonus did not affect the higher-paid civil servants as much as the lower-paid.  You cannot have it both ways.  The higher civil servants never got the full bonus, and at one stage they suffered what was called a super-cut.  If you take the bonus off, it does not remain to be taken off at a later stage, when the cost-of-living index figure falls, so that there is nothing to complain of in that respect.  Most of the civil servants are transferred civil servants.  If we were to change the method of calculating the cost-of-living bonus in some way, it must be all take and no give so far as the Civil Service is concerned, or all give and no take as far as the Government is concerned.  We cannot reduce the bonus by adopting some new system for those to whose advantage the new system would prove to be.  It would simply mean that we would actually have increased the bonus in some way beyond what civil servants are entitled to.  We could not adopt a new system which would mean that the higher civil servants were going to lose all the bonus, because they would be entitled to retire under the terms of the Treaty. <Col N="304" /> There is no argument for making any change, and there is no argument, therefore, for going into an investigation.</P>
    <P>The only argument I can see for going into an investigation would be that if the Government desired to retrace the step it took in 1922 that investigation might give it an opportunity of doing so.  If it wanted to go back to the British weighting an investigation would certainly provide the occasion on which it might go back. We do not want to do that and, therefore, we say the matter is closed, and so far as we are concerned remains closed.  It is easy to exaggerate this question of discontent in the Civil Service.  You could never have a contented Civil Service.  You could never have a contented group of employees in any industry, unless they are able to compare their conditions as being tremendously better than those engaged in similar work outside.  Everyone who has a particular rate of remuneration feels that he could do comfortably with a bit more, and no one should blame him for that.  Consequently I would think that if there was not a fair measure of discontent in the Civil Service something had gone wrong.  So far as the soreness that follows a reduction in actual remuneration is concerned, that is what in times of falling prices, such as we have at present, everybody has got to suffer, and there is absolutely no ground for exempting the Civil Service. A great many of the civil servants, it should be borne in mind, are actually on incremental scales which are going up.  A great many, of course, are at the top of their scale and actually do suffer a complete net loss of the amount of the cut on each occasion, but others do not, and are in that way favourably situated as compared with many people engaged in somewhat similar work outside.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether that is an excuse or not, but the Minister did not seem to deal at all with the motion or to attempt to defend the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus.  After all, that is what the motion asks, an inquiry into the present method of computing the cost-of-living bonus. The Minister, in my opinion, did not address himself to that question at all. He said that that was the method that was adopted in 1920.  That was practically the only thing he said about it.  It was agreed by the Whitley Council and accepted by the civil servants at the time.  It was a kind of rough-and-ready method of fixing salaries, but I do not think that there was any civil servant or any member either of the Whitley Council or of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, when that arrangement was fixed in 1920, who believed that it would be operative in 1931.  I do not think that it received that measure of consideration which any scheme that would be expected to be in operation for a period of ten or eleven years should get.  The Minister made great play with Deputy Anthony's statement in regard to cuts. I think that the Minister displayed a considerable amount of courage when he said that there were no cuts.  I think that he would take some time to convince civil servants that that is the position, but he did make some play with the statement, and it seemed to impress the House, that there was only a 10 per cent. cut in civil servants' salaries.  He, however, managed to slip in the qualification quietly, the significance of which I am sure many Deputies did not quite catch, &ldquo;that is, those qualified for the full bonus.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know the proportion as to the whole number, <Col N="306" /> but there are quite a number of people in this country who regard civil servants as a bloated class of people, enjoying very comfortable salaries. They do not, however, always advert to the fact, for instance, that the ordinary postmen in the country, even auxiliary postmen, are subject to these reductions and variations that take place in regard to the cost-of-living bonus.  The ordinary man working in a clerical grade, who has nothing like big wages, is also affected.  To come back to the point which I was making, I would stress the fact that it is only those who have a salary of 35/- a week and under who get the full bonus. There is quite a common belief in the mind of the public that if the cost of living is 70 points higher than it was in 1914 the civil servant first gets his salary and then an increase of 70 per cent. above the cost-of-living figure of 1914.  The Minister knows quite well, and could tell the House, that that is not so.  It is only on the first 35/- that the full bonus is paid, and any bonus which is paid above that is paid on a gradually reducing scale, so that, when the Minister said that the reduction was approximately 10 per cent., he did not intend it to apply to the whole of the Civil Service.  I felt when he was making that statement that many Deputies here took it for granted that it did.  I could not follow him in his statement in regard to Deputy Anthony's illustration about the man who was reduced from £5 to £3 6s.  The Minister said that most of the reductions took place before this Government took office, but I understand that no reduction or cut took place until August, 1922.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister would be right in saying that the greater portion of the cut took place then.  According to my memory the greater portion took place after the Provisional Government <Col N="307" /> came into office.  I was concerned with the matter then, because I was a member of the Post Office Commission which arose out of that proposal: it was probably the second drop in March, 1922.  I think that the Minister will find that he is entirely wrong in saying that the great bulk of that reduction took place before this Government came into office.  He will find that that was not the case. The only helpful suggestion, or the only suggested solution which came from the Minister was, that there was a Representative Council at which the civil servants could discuss this question of bonus.  There are more than civil servants interested in the method of computing the cost-of-living figure because, as the Minister pointed out. practically every body of employers and employees will, consciously or sub-consciously, take that into account when wages are being determined. I do not think that it would meet the case merely to suggest that the question of bonus, as applied to civil servants, might be discussed at a Representative Council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion suggests that there ought to be an enquiry which will enable not only the civil servants, but the public generally, to see whether or not this method, which was, as I say, in my view, merely a rough and ready method adopted in 1920, is applicable to the conditions prevailing in 1931. That is all the motion asks.  There have been long statements here as to other matters entirely outside the motion, but I suggest that the Minister in his statement made the case entirely for what he thought should not occur, namely, an increase in the remuneration of civil servants.  We are concerned with the method of computing the cost-of-living bonus.  It has undoubtedly been shown that there have been anomalies in regard to this method, and its application especially to the Civil Service.  I think it would be well if there were an inquiry into the whole method of computation, and of its application also.  The reductions which have taken place under this cost-of-living figure seem to be out of proportion to those which have taken place in industrial occupations.  A <Col N="308" /> case could be quoted in respect to the lower grades of the Civil Service to show that proportionately the reductions which took place in the Civil Service lower grades were greater than those which took place in industrial occupations.</P>
    <P>If that is so, and I feel it is, I believe it is a question worthy of examination and I think from the public point of view and from the general point of view an inquiry would serve a very useful purpose.  I quite recognise what the Minister says, that the general taxpayer is in effect the employer of the civil servant but I think that the general taxpayer is not anxious to do other than what is fair by the civil servant.  The general taxpayer is and ought to be anxious that the work which is done by civil servants in the interests of the State should not be interfered with or should not be made less effective by a feeling that the civil servant is not being treated fairly.  If an inquiry served no other purpose than to demonstrate to the civil servant that he is being treated fairly in all the circumstances, it might have a very good effect and it might be well worth while granting it&mdash;that is, into the method of computing the cost-of-living bonus, as required by the motion.  I think that the Minister is making a mistake in so strenuously opposing the resolution. I think in every sense it would be better if he agreed to accept it and to have this inquiry into the method of computing the cost-of-living bonus which, as I say, was hastily arrived at, at a time when conditions were in a very unsettled state and when it was quite impossible to give to the question the consideration which a question of this importance deserves.</P>

      <P>I would like at this stage to give the index figures of the cost-of-living bonus which Deputy O'Connell referred to.  The cost-of-living index figure in March, 1921, was 165, in September, 1921, it was 130, in March, 1922, it was 105, and then when the Provisional Government took over in September, 1922, the figure was 90. The man to whom Deputy Anthony referred would be at his peak in March, 1921.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider favourably this motion.  As I conceive the position, the complaint made here on behalf of the lower grades of the Civil Service is that the present method of computation of the cost-of-living figure does not really show the true bearing of that figure on the expenses which these men in the lower grades of the Civil Service have to bear.  The men in these grades of the Civil Service, who have to support themselves and their families, find that when these reductions take place, so far as they can ascertain, the amounts which they are called upon to pay for the various necessaries of life, do not show the reduction to the extent to which the present method of computing the cost-of-living figure, correspondingly reduces their bonus.  The Minister for Finance has agreed that there is a certain amount of discontent in the Civil Service owing to this matter.  He said that he really would be rather disappointed if there was not a certain amount of discontent in the Civil Service, that he would really feel that something was wrong.  It would appear to me that if this was the only matter upon which discontent existed amongst the lower grades and if it were possible to remove that discontent, then it would be undoubtedly in the interests not alone of the Civil Service but of the taxpayers in the country as a whole to have such discontent removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly is the point at issue here?  The civil servants claim that this method of computing the cost-of-living bonus does not really represent the figures which it is sought to say it does represent.  The answer of the Minister, on the other hand, to us is that this method of computing the cost-of-living bonus is a very fair and a very accurate method.  If that be his case, I think, and I would suggest to him, that he should not object in any way to setting up this inquiry which, if his case be correct, would certainly find that the present method of computing the cost-of-living figure is a proper one.  Accordingly, civil servants would have no complaint to make.  I quite accept the contention <Col N="310" /> of the Minister for Finance that in fixing these salaries and in allotting work to the civil servants of the country, he is really acting in the capacity of an arbitrator.  He has fixed salaries and those salaries, as a matter of right, carry a cost-of-living bonus for civil servants.  The sole question at issue now is what the amount of the cost-of-living bonus should be, and in deciding what the cost-of-living bonus should be I do not think that the Minister for Finance, strictly speaking, if he were to determine it, would still be acting in the capacity of an arbitrator.  His duty as an arbitrator, between the taxpayers and the civil servants, is to decide on the scale of salary that would attract suitable people to the Civil Service and to decide the work that should be done by civil servants for the benefit of the people.  He has decided what the scale of salaries should be, and the only question is whether a particular part of the salaries which he has decided to give really represents the cost-of-living figure of to-day.  The civil servants say it does not, and the Minister says it does.  I suggest to him that the proper method to deal with the matter is not to act as an arbitrator upon it himself but to set up an inquiry. If the Minister be correct in his contention the inquiry will find in his favour, but if he be not correct the inquiry, I presume, will find against him.  In doing that, they will be according nothing more to the lower grades of the Civil Service than what is just and in accordance with the scale already fixed by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to divide the discussion upon this matter into the two parts set out in the Resolution.  The Resolution reads: &ldquo;That in view of the discontent prevalent amongst the lower grades in the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should set up a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and report on the present method of computation on the cost-of-living bonus and its application to civil servants' salaries and wages.&rdquo;  I have really to deal only with the first part <Col N="311" /> of the motion which has been called into dispute, that is to say, the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus.  Its application to civil servants' salaries and wages is not a matter for my Department.  As Deputy Finlay explained, it is not a matter of establishing some criterion by which the cost of living which civil servants have to bear has to be determined. That is not the matter that is in question.  The civil servants accepted a particular contract.  If they seek to vary the terms of that contract they have got to make a case for doing so, and the question as to the precise way in which the cost-of-living bonus is to be calculated has nothing to do with the rest of the question.</P>
      <P>A great deal of argument has been wasted on this question of the present method of computing the cost-of-living bonus.  Deputy MacEntee has referred to the conditions under which this figure was established, and we heard Deputy O'Connell making the same references to the matter.  Deputy MacEntee yesterday referred to one single fact with regard to this figure; he referred people to the report on the cost of living in Ireland published in June, 1922, singled out this particular part of one paragraph, and said that only 308 forms of the 5,000 forms sent out were returned so completed that they could be used by the Committee who were drawing up this report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might have been honest when he was about it and read further from the paragraph.  The Deputy could have read when presenting an extract from this report that 5,000 forms were sent out, but, as far as the 308 returns that were sent in he might have read this paragraph:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties of the time when these budgets were called for, and the fact that a number of forms were held up and perhaps lost in the post, we were able to use 308 completed budgets of wage-earning households received from 112 towns;</P>
      <P>and then the report continues:</P>
      <P>This number was quite sufficient for our purposes.  These budgets were excellently filled in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to impose anything on the Deputy's judgment, but I am saying that the Deputy was not honest in his quotation from that report.  The report stated: &ldquo;We were able to use 308 completed budgets of wage-earning households.&rdquo;  Not that only 308 forms were returned. They go on to state: &ldquo;This number was quite sufficient for our purposes,&rdquo; and they continue to state &ldquo;These budgets were excellently filled in, and, apart from the fact that such a number is in itself a fair guarantee of the statistical results obtained, we are satisfied for reasons given below of the substantial accuracy of the budgets.&rdquo; That was surely an item that the Deputy might have brought into the discussion.  Here again the Deputy has made a mistake or else not expressed himself effectively in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell and the Deputy have spoken as if that reference was to prices, as if prices were established in 1922, and as if it had any relation to the particular prices established at that time.  That is in the section which deals with a collection of household budgets.  There was a previous section in the report which dealt with the collection of retail prices.  They had a number of retail prices in the collection, and they give a number of retail prices in 1914. They sent out forms, and these forms were filled in to the number of 308 household budgets that have been referred to.  These 308 budgets merely mean that if one takes a figure of 100 representing the expenditure of a particular type of household from a town living and depending on wages and makes a division of that into separate items as between clothing, fuel, light, rent and sundries, it will be found that all that emerges from the 308 forms was the allocation of the expenditure of these families as between the different items.  In other words, it was the weighting and not the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who casts a doubt upon the accuracy of that report by saying that the forms were sent out in disturbed times and that accordingly the prices <Col N="313" /> ascertained on the basis of these forms can be of no relevance at this moment, has not read the report correctly, even on the matter of wages and on the matter of how a budget was made up and how the money of a particular household was spent.  They do say that the number was quite sufficient for their purpose.  &ldquo;The budgets were excellently filled in, and, apart from the fact that such a number is in itself a fair guarantee of the statistical results obtained, we are satisfied for the reasons given below of the substantial accuracy of the budgets.&rdquo; There are many reasons why the Committee came to the conclusion that the allocation of a given expenditure as between the different items may be taken as correct.  They gave different reasons why they came to the conclusion that the figures showed that the allocation was a sound allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister what I actually did say last night?  I said that of these 5,000 forms only 308 were returned so completed that the Committee was able to use them.  I did not say that only 308 forms had been returned.  I made it quite clear that only 308 forms were capable of being used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say whether he was speaking in the context of prices or budgets?  Prices, I think.  The Deputy will find nowhere in his speech the quotation I have given from the report: &ldquo;This number was quite sufficient for our purpose. These budgets were excellently filled in, and apart from the fact that such a number is in itself a fair guarantee of the statistical results obtained, we are satisfied for reasons given below of the substantial accuracy of the budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy pulled out this single item that only 308 returns were so completed that they could be used out of 5,000 sent out, but he did not refer to the fact that the Committee based its own judgment on that number. The Committee said that the number was enough to give them a complete test, and they added that they &ldquo;satisfied us of the substantial accuracy of the budgets.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> There have been other comments made upon this cost-of-living figure computation, apart from the time at which it was compiled.  The Committee itself deals with that.  Apart from the matter of prices, the 1922 prices have a very small relevance to the whole matter under discussion because they are joined up with the 1914 prices previously obtained, and they are tested by the prices obtained at this time.</P>
    <P>This further fact has to be taken into consideration in connection with these figures&mdash;the British cost-of-living figure with which ours is constantly compared is based upon an examination made in 1905 and brought up-to-date in 1914.  But ours was taken in 1922, and we very definitely did take in that year the &ldquo;weighting&rdquo; for the 1922 period.  We know how each household was spending its money in 1922.  We took, in fact, the increased standard of living by reason of the big war prices paid for produce here.  We took the allocation of that money for certain matters and we carried that back to 1914 prices and brought it forward again to the 1922 period.  Our figure consequently represents in the method of weighting not merely a judgment as to the increased cost of living in this country but it also indicates an increased standard of living, and that is where the difference of five points arises. It amounts sometimes to more than five points, but at no time to less than five points.  This has to be attributed entirely to this increased standard of living as represented by our figure as compared with the British figures.</P>
    <P>The figures have been queried on another basis&mdash;that the number of items brought into consideration is not adequate; that not sufficient tests are applied, and that the figure is not on the whole properly compiled. At one time I put that to an investigation from the point of view of the number of items taken into consideration in something like twenty-four countries.  We examined the figures in 1924 and found that there is only one country, the U.S.A., which examined a greater number of items than we did ourselves.  There was one other country, Denmark, that came near to <Col N="315" /> us.  We examined these 68 items and added rent as well.  Denmark examined 68 items alone, but we have included rent and that makes 69.  The U.S.A. examined something like 150 to 165 items.  No other country comes anyway near to our number of 69 except Denmark.  Generally they range about 24 to 25 items.  It varies from time to time, but on the whole it can be said that the towns and localities from which we took our figures are round about the number of 100.  They never fell below that number.  Two other countries did make an examination extending over a greater number of towns.  That would be quite natural in bigger and more industrialised countries. Great Britain, so far as food is concerned, examined in 600 places.  In regard to other things, clothing in particular, Great Britain examined in less than 100 localities.  One of the central European countries, Czecho-Slovakia, examined in about 400 localities.  Very few countries had anything like an examination of over 100 localities, and nothing like the same examination as we had here.</P>

      <P>I can say, without fear of contradiction, leaving out America with its tremendous territory and Great Britain with the necessity of investigating so many industrial centres, that, on the combination of items and localities, we would have the best returns.  As to the accuracy of the returns, certain comments have been made.  There are two checks imposed. This report was published in 1922, and it contains certain references to tests that were made at that time. These were afterwards carried out in practice.  The returns are got through the employment exchanges, and also through the medium of postmasters. In no case are these people allowed to give their impressions of what the prices are.  In each case they must quote the particular shops from which the prices are obtained.  They must sign everything they put up, and a comparison is made, as each return comes in, with the previous return.  If there is any big discrepancy the return is immediately sent back for verification.  One return is used as a check against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we are going to complicate this whole system to an extent that will not represent the trouble and expenditure involved, I do not see that any fairer system can be got for establishing a cost-of-living index figure.  I may point out that the cost-of-living index figure was never intended for civil servants; no one pretends that it was ever so intended. It was purely to regulate or reflect the cost of living that the civil servant has to submit to.  In the case of the civil servant, it is purely a matter of contract. I am now coming to the question of whether any case has been made that the cost-of-living figure is not properly arrived at.  There has <Col N="317" /> not been any case made.  Deputy MacEntee attempted to make a case on the single point of the time in which the returns were sent out, and he mentioned that there were then disturbed conditions in the country. The Deputy founded the main portion of his argument on that.</P>

      <P>I have read what the Deputy said.  If the Deputy will refer me to any portion of his speech beyond the reference here, I will be satisfied.  Deputy O'Connell had much the same point of view.  The other point was that the number of items might not be sufficient.  I think that might be covered by the Deputy's term &ldquo;inadequate.&rdquo; I want a scheme suggested with regard to a larger number of localities.  Let us take the simple issue, is the cost-of-living figure properly built up?  Let us not look at it from the point of view, is it properly applied to civil servants?  That is another part of the resolution altogether. There has been no case made for an enquiry into this.  I would like to advert to one point made by Deputy O'Connell.  He said that one test he applied convinced him that the civil servants were in the right in this matter.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that if one made a comparison between the decline in wages in certain industrial occupations, and the decline in wages in the Civil Service, it would be found that the civil servants had suffered more than others.  Quite probably they have suffered more than others.  If there were an enquiry, and if the enquiry brought out that the Civil Service decline was a proper one, would the Deputy accept the logical conclusion that the others ought to suffer more in the way of a decline than is imposed upon them at the moment?  I personally think that <Col N="318" /> the cost-of-living index figure does this State considerable harm in one respect. There hardly ever has been a dispute about the one important aspect of industrial conditions&mdash;wages&mdash;in which there has not been a comparison with the conditions across the water.  If there is any discrepancy shown as between the wages paid here and across the water, the answer is that it is attributable to the excess in the cost of living that we have to bear here.  That is founded on the fallacious comparison between our cost-of-living figure and the British figure.  Our cost-of-living figure differs from the British, and cannot be compared with it for two reasons, one on account of the weighting, and the other on account of the increase in prices.  The prices here bore no comparison, in a great many cases, to the prices as they were in England in 1914.  We get a comparison here as to the increase now in Ireland, as compared with 1914 and the increase now in Britain as compared with the prices ruling in 1914.  And the easy conclusion is drawn that the actual cost of living imposed upon people in this country is so much greater here than across the water.  I do not think it even requires an examination. I think a short paper could be submitted easily which would reveal that that is an unfair comparison, which is generally brought in when any wage dispute crops up. Personally, I would like to see a second cost-of-living figure.  Even though it would not be a proper one it would serve a better purpose than the present one.</P>
    <P>Leaving out of consideration the question of whether or not prices were equal in 1914, take Irish prices and weight them according to the English method; that will at any rate give a price somewhat nearer the true comparison than the figures we have at the moment.  On the average, it would never represent a less difference than five points as between the figures at the moment.  So if there is a difference of ten points, weighting according to English weighting would represent a difference of five points.  I, personally, would like to see that particular thing <Col N="319" /> examined.  I would like to see it, in fact, explained.  I have made attempts to get it explained here on two or three occasions.  I think it could very easily be put in a document, and it requires no committee to examine the thing.</P>
    <P>The second point in this motion deals with the application of this figure, however arrived at, to civil servants' salaries and wages.  On that we have always had one point of view that the civil servant is a person who, by reason of the occupation in life he has chosen, never enjoys any great boom when there is any prosperity in the country.  That being the case, it is only equitable that he should be saved from the severity of the slump when the slump comes.  For that reason this particular cost-of-living figure addition to salary was arrived at when these civil servants were under the control of an English Government. That was accepted as a proper addition at that particular time.  We took over civil servants on those conditions. What is now sought here, and it really should not be camouflaged by any attempt to criticise the computation of the cost-of-living bonus, is an alteration in the terms of employment.  It is quite possible that such alteration may have to be made.  We have always resisted an attack upon the bonus system because we hold that it is the only fair way to put these people into any sort of decent position. They do not enjoy the good time when the good times come.  They should be saved the worst features of the slump when the severity of the slump is being felt, but I feel that a motion from that angle is ill-advised at this moment.</P>
    <P>This country has so far survived, without very much bad effect, the worst part of the economic depression that prevails throughout the world.  We have done that simply because this country has had a particular type of agricultural economy.  That has saved it from all the worst effects of the present economic depression.  It has been noted in international documents recently that the only countries that stood the strain of the present <Col N="320" /> bad times are those countries which have specialised in animal products and not gone in for cereals.  This country has survived by reason of a particularly good type of agricultural economy, but if that particular type of agricultural economy comes in for a set-back it is no time to start making changes in the conditions of a big number of State employees.  A committee might easily be set up at a somewhat later date to consider the question of stabilising, if we find we are near the time when prices have fixed themselves for good or bad at a particular point, when the present cost of living is not going to move back any further towards what is regarded as the normal, towards the 100 set for the index in 1914.  But while economic depression is still prevalent not merely in Europe but in all the countries of the world, and while there is a danger of our still being drawn into it, this is no time to have an inquiry established with a view to raising certain conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it has been alleged&mdash;it can scarcely have been alleged&mdash;that there was any breach of the conditions under which these people were taken over.  So far as that being right, the allegation can lie the other way, that the conditions of employment only entitled civil servants to a bonus addition based upon the English cost-of-living figure.  At the best, take the equities of the situation and the changed conditions of Government which might entitle them to an addition by way of bonus to a salary based upon Irish prices, weighted according to the old English figure.  In other words, the cost of living addition would be regulated simply by an increase in prices and not by an increase in the standard of living.  I heard the Minister for Finance say that if there was to be any committee set up and any investigation made on this point it would have to be with every alternative open.  In other words, if the investigation revealed that the conditions of service entitle civil servants only to a bonus based on the English figure they should be prepared to accept that.  But I think this is no time to change the conditions of ser- <Col N="321" /> vice of a very loyal body at a time when tremendous attacks are being made upon it.  I would resist it on that ground as from the other angle of having an increase made at this time.  The bonus system is simply, for the purpose of party politics, being made the object of an attack.  The word &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; is very unfortunate in that connection, but it has been made the object of an attack by political parties, by local authorities that resented it, by all sorts and conditions of people in the country, and it will undoubtedly excite a still greater attack if there is any investigation ordered at this moment which has for its aim a bettering of the bonus conditions of the Civil Service and that we should do that at a time when no case is being made either on the matter of contract or the matter of the system under which the bonus is compiled, would be madness.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to-day a question in reference to two prisoners who are at present on hunger strike in Mountjoy Jail.  At the end of the question I asked him what he proposed to do with reference to their future condition.  The question I asked was this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whether he is aware that the Visiting Committee or doctor in Mountjoy Jail directed that the doors of the cell of two prisoners, namely, George Mooney and Seán McGuinness, should be left open during certain hours, and that the said doors have been kept closed during these hours by the prison authorities, and that the prisoners in consequence broke their windows for the purpose of ventilation; and further, is the Minister aware that the said prisoners were placed in strait-jackets or muffs or other prison device and that Seán McGuinness has subsequently been spitting blood; and what he proposes to do in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> I am aware that the two prisoners mentioned were allowed, as a privilege, to have their cell doors open during the greater part of the day. They abused that privilege by leaving their cells without permission, and forcing their way into cells occupied by other prisoners.  The privilege was accordingly withdrawn.  I am aware that following the withdrawal of this privilege the prisoners broke the windows of their cells, but the suggestion that this was done by them for the purpose of ventilation is not correct: the ventilation with the cell door closed is quite adequate and is, in fact, the normal ventilation of the cell.  I am also aware that following the breaking of the windows the prisoners' hands were secured in muffs so as to make it impossible for them to do further damage. I am not aware that the prisoner McGuinness has subsequently been spitting blood.</P>
    <P>In that answer there are some very remarkable omissions.  The Minister has entirely omitted any reference to the Visiting Committee or the doctor. He has not suggested that it is not true that the doctor or the committee directed that the cells should be left open.  The direction to leave the cells open was for the purpose of airing them.  It was not the normal ventilation but special ventilation to deal with prisoners who never left their cells. Such airing was absolutely necessary for at least a few hours every day and it was because of that that it became necessary when that direction was not carried out for the prisoners to break the cell windows.  We are not prepared to accept the Minister's statement, which appears very fantastic, that these men went out of their cells and forced their way into other prisoners' cells.  If they should happen to go out of their cells there were plenty other ways to prevent them doing that besides depriving them of what was a real necessity for their lives.  Their condition of health is extremely bad.  The condition of one man who was imprisoned under similar conditions was so bad for a long time afterwards that people were very uneasy about that particular individual. <Col N="323" /> For a long time his condition of health was very serious.  These two men are in a serious condition of health and this extra airing of their cells is an absolute necessity for them.  Then again, they were put into muffs, which is another form of strait-jacket. The use of muffs in a case like that seems to be altogether out of proportion to the action of the prisoners under the conditions.</P>
    <P>This is the position at present: these men are both in delicate health. According to one report, one of the prisoners, Seán McGuinness, was spitting blood subsequently, and it is necessary for me to read an affidavit which we have obtained and upon which we have based our question. This affidavit was made by Patrick Norton.  He was a prisoner for a short period and was released at the end of his sentence.  He had direct experience of the incidents that occurred in the jail.  Patrick Norton says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was brought to Mountjoy Prison, 25th May, with Hugh Connolly. We were sentenced in connection with selling Easter Lilies.</P>
    <P>We were kept in basement cells Saturday and Sunday till Monday morning, when we were taken to the reception.  We demanded to be put in the same wing with the political prisoners, in B. 1 Wing, and we were taken there.  We demanded that our doors should be left open, like the doors of Mooney and McGuinness are, for a certain number of hours each day.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday Hugh Connolly was induced to come out of his cell by a warder, who told him the Governor wanted to speak to him (this Connolly told me when we were released). When outside his cell he was seized by two warders and forcibly dragged to D. 1, where the juvenile criminals are kept.</P>
    <P>On this day my door was not open, so I rang the bell.  Mooney and McGuinness's doors were also left closed, and they also rang.  No warders came, and after some time waiting we decided, on account of the stuffiness of the cells and as a protest <Col N="324" /> against being kept in solitary confinement, to smash the windows of the cells.</P>
    <P>Presently I heard a noise in the corridor as of warders rushing along. Then I heard sounds of shouting and struggling in McGuinness's cell, then it was quiet till the noise of struggling came in Mooney's cell, and Mooney shouted: `They are putting me in the strait-jacket.' Then the noise ceased and the warders rushed to my cell.  When the door was opened I saw a big crowd of warders, perhaps twenty, the Governor and Chief Warder Sugrue leading them. One of the warders carried what I take to be a strait-jacket.  It was leather with straps.  I was seized and dragged to A. 1 Wing, and put into a cell, from which the bed, stool and table were removed.  These were returned some hours later.</P>
    <P>Mooney is looking very ill.  He has got no exercise since November, 1929. Even the chapel is used in the attempt to degrade political prisoners.  On Sunday I saw Mooney being dragged about by warders in the chapel. Hugh Connolly was dragged from his seat in chapel by two warders and carried to the front, in order to place him among the criminals.</P>
    <P>On Corpus Christi day, when the warders came to fetch me to Mass, I asked the chief warder was it his intention to prevent me sitting with the political prisoners in the chapel.  He said I would have to sit with my class &mdash;the men who were in the wing with me.  I said: `If that is the case I will refuse to go to the chapel,' and I went back to my cell.  When I was in Mountjoy before, the political prisoners were allowed to sit in the same bench.  The priest came to my cell after Mass.  I explained why I did not attend the Mass that morning. I said that in the attempt now being made to force political prisoners to associate with criminals, the warders did not hesitate to push us about and create disturbance, which I considered disrespectful in chapel, and as I did not wish a recurrence of this I preferred attending Mass spiritually in my cell.  He said he could see my point.  He was sorry, and he feared <Col N="325" /> the chapel was to be used in the dispute between both parties.  He also said that he had always found the political prisoners behaved themselves properly in the chapel.</P>
    <P>I was released on Friday.  McGuinness and Mooney are very indignant at the way they are being treated in Mountjoy Prison.  A terrible injustice is being done to political prisoners, whose health is being ruined, and who may be forced in the end by desperation to hunger strike as the only means to end it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we have the position mentioned in the end of that affidavit, that these prisoners have gone on hunger strike, and I suggest to the Minister that it is sheer madness for him to continue this line of conduct.  The whole matter could be cleared up by treating these prisoners as honourable men and not as ordinary criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what regulations have been issued with regard to the health, control, restraint and so forth of prisoners, whether the regulations issued in 1902, as amended by the rules issued in 1908, are the regulations that still continue in regard to the conduct and control of prisoners; if these rules are not now in force, when were they rescinded and what regulations were issued instead; when these regulations were issued; when they were sent to the governors of the various prisons.  I ask the Minister to give the House some idea of the punishment that might be inflicted in respect of any new regulations that were issued.  I find, according to the regulation I have: &ldquo;No punishment or privation of any kind shall be awarded to a prisoner by any officer of the prison except the governor, or, in his absence, the officer appointed to act for him.&rdquo;  In the category of offences is one which I believe the Minister refers to in this case: &ldquo;in any way disfigures or damages any part of the prison or any articles to which he may have access.&rdquo; The punishment to be inflicted for that is &ldquo;close confinement for any period not exceeding three days; No. 1 diet: reduction from a higher stage to a lower stage or postponement of promotion to a higher stage for a <Col N="326" /> period not exceeding fourteen days; deprivation of mattress for any period not exceeding three days.&rdquo;  The next rule, 82, says:</P>
      <P>If any prisoner is charged with any serious or repeated offence for which the punishment the governor is authorised to inflict is deemed insufficient, or is charged with any offences with the aggravations mentioned in this rule, the governor shall, without loss of time, report the same to the visiting committee, or one of them, who is empowered, after inquiry into the same on oath, to determine concerning any matter so reported to him, and to order the offender to be punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offence referred to there is &ldquo;wilfully or wantonly breaking the prison windows or otherwise destroying the prison property.&rdquo;  I want to know from the Minister, if that regulation is in force, whether such a report was or was not made to the Visiting Committee. With regard to the use of mechanical restraint, the regulations provide: &ldquo;No prisoner shall be put in irons or under mechanical restraint by the governor of any prison except in case of urgent necessity, and when necessary for the purposes of restraint, and the particulars of every such case shall be forthwith entered in the governor's journal and notice forthwith given thereof to one of the Visiting Committee.&rdquo;  If this regulation is in force&mdash;if it has not been rescinded or amended&mdash;was notice given forthwith to the Visiting Committee?  The Minister's answer to the question put by Deputy Little to-day is more conspicuous because of its omissions than because of a desire to give information to the House.  He states that one of these prisoners was allowed as a privilege to have the doors of his cell open. Why was the privilege extended to this prisoner?  The Minister has repeatedly stated here that he is not prepared to admit that certain prisoners are entitled to political treatment.  Does the Minister suggest to any reasonably-minded person that the cell doors were left open for these prisoners as a privilege? Was it not because the cells were insufficiently aired and the ventilation <Col N="327" /> bad?  Was it not on account of the health of the prisoners that this was done?  I am sure that the Minister does not seriously suggest to the House that those cell doors were left open for any other reason than that it was absolutely necessary to leave them open.  We know from his attitude to those prisoners&mdash;the attitude he has taken up in this House when any question about those prisoners was brought up here&mdash;that it was not as a generous concession on his part that this was done.  He refers to the prisoners breaking windows.  Did the breaking of the windows he refers to take place when the doors were shut on their cells and they were prevented from getting the ventilation which was thought necessary?  He says that these prisoners forced their way into other cells.  He does not say into whose cells they forced their way.  He gives us no particulars.  We have to take the Minister's word for that.  Can he not inform the House into whose cells they forced their way?  He seems to make a distinction between muffs and strait-jackets.  There is very little difference between them, as far as I understand.  The strait-jacket enables the hands to be tied down to the side, while the other article comes under the arm and is a leather jacket with straps.  There is one matter which I consider is serious, and which the Minister should take some steps to have cleared up, at any rate.  That is the complaint made in this affidavit as to interference with these prisoners in chapel when they go to Mass.  That statement has been made in an affidavit sworn before a Commissioner, and it is for the Minister to say whether or not that statement is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my protest to the protest already made here. The facts which have been given by Deputy Little and Deputy Ruttledge make the position clear.  A state of affairs emerges from this discussion such as is supposed to exist, according to reports in the Irish press, in certain alleged prison camps in Russia. We hear a lot of denunciations of that <Col N="328" /> position, both from ecclesiastical sources and otherwise in this State. I hope that the Press, when they give the report of this debate in the morning, if they report it at all, will take note of the fact that, despite any information the Minister may give or may not give, despite any questions he may ask or may not ask, there is one fact paramount&mdash;that here in Mountjoy Prison at the present moment there is a hunger strike.  That is the main point to remember.  This hunger strike is not indulged in by criminals, but by two men who believe in the independence of this nation, who believe that they have the right to assert the political status which was asserted against a stronger power than the Minister can ever hope to represent, and fought for and won in jails throughout this country in the fifteen years from 1916 on.  The Minister is surprised that there is bitterness in this country.  The Minister wonders why it is that old hatreds die hard, and his Government probably wonder at the same thing.  Before he replies, I want to put it to him straight that the reason for the bitterness, hatred and animosity that exists in the hearts of many people of this country, is the vendetta that is being carried on deliberately and cold-bloodedly by his Department.  I suggest to him that his first action, if he has any of that sense of Christian humanity, which the Catholic Truth Society, of which he is a member, preaches so much, should be to ensure that the hunger strike will not last a night longer.  I had experience of it in 1923 in the same rotten hole, which should have been destroyed like the Bastille long ago.  The Minister, if he had any conception of what it is, would not tolerate for a moment, even if it meant releasing those men, the infliction of further hardship in this manner.  I suggest that he is piling up a heritage of animosity, hate and bitterness not alone for himself but for the Government for which he stands.  I feel very keenly on this point.  I read in the papers yesterday morning that such a hunger strike was in progress.  I suggest that it need not be wondered at that actions are taken by certain young men in <Col N="329" /> this country, actions which undoubtedly tend to create disorder and chaos, actions which were engendered by the policy of hate and bitterness pursued by the Minister, which are being engendered and will continue to be engendered if he pursues that policy.  I ask the Government to see that the hunger strike is called off at once, by conceding the demands that are made, and not allow petty considerations of spite to interfere with the cause of justice.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is much use in appealing to the Government Benches on this matter. We appealed frequently before, when similar cases were reported to us, for political treatment for political prisoners.  If that treatment had been given in this case, this trouble would not have arisen.  The principal men referred to here&mdash;McGuinness and Mooney&mdash;who are reported as on hunger strike for some days, cannot be classed as other than men who are in prison for their political convictions. I am informed on what I believe to be reliable authority that Mooney is in prison because of the action of an agent provocateur&mdash;a person in the pay of the Department of Justice.  A person who was admitted by an authority in the Minister's Department to be in the pay of the Government induced this man to do a certain act which landed him in jail for a considerable period.  He is a political prisoner, and I am appealing to the Minister for political treatment for this man.  So far as I know anything about his politics in the past, the Minister himself has no reason as an individual or as Minister for Justice to have this bitter personal animosity toward Republicans that the majority of his colleagues have.  I take it he <Col N="330" /> will stand by his colleagues, naturally, in any decisions they take, but he is one who, I believe, has no reason to have this bitter personal animosity towards Republicans, because he has not been associated with that movement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is an absolutely untrue statement and devoid of the slightest foundation.  We know the particular game the Deputies opposite play.  We know the attitude they take up.  We know how men who walk around this city for the purpose of committing crime, men who walk around with bomb and revolver, are held up by them as being honourable men.  Deputies opposite consider that it is the right and honourable thing to upset by force of arms the Government established by the Irish people in this State.  That is the view which <Col N="331" /> they put forward.  They try to make out these unfortunate young men to be heroes, when as a matter of fact they are nothing but poor, misguided fools in the attitude they take up, both inside and outside the prisons.  I have been challenged on the facts of this case.  I have been challenged with regard to the reason for the opening and closing of their cell doors.  Some other prisoners some time ago started this business of refusing to leave their prison cells.  It was started by certain prisoners who called themselves Society of War Prisoners, or some name of that kind.  It was joined in by two men who subsequently served their time and were released.  Mooney was placed in prison and Mooney has remained there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by Carroll.  Mooney was given the privilege of having his door open.  I shall tell you why he was given that privilege. He was not given that privilege by the doctor or by the visiting committee, because neither the doctor nor the visiting committee had power to grant him any such privilege.  As a matter of fact, I granted him that privilege.  I saw perfectly well that these men were being made catspaws of, that they were making life in the prison much harder for themselves than it need be; that they were being encouraged in that foolish attitude by Deputies opposite, obviously for political purposes, and that they were being encouraged in that foolish attitude by certain persons outside this House who use them as a theme on which they can make street-corner speeches on Sunday mornings.  I did pity these unfortunate catspaws, and I considered that it would give a certain easing of their situation if their doors were left open&mdash;especially if their doors were left open in the hot weather.  They abused that privilege. Mooney had enjoyed it for a very considerable time.  But then they abused the privilege.  Mooney and McGuinness endeavoured, on the 1st June, when their doors were unlocked, to get into the cells of two other prisoners. <Col N="332" /> They did actually get into the cells of two other prisoners.  They got into the cells of prisoners who were there for a short time&mdash;Norton and Connolly. They were told that since they had been given a privilege&mdash;since they were allowed, as none of the other prisoners in Mountjoy was allowed, to have their cell doors open&mdash;and had abused the privilege, they would have to lose that privilege.  They then proceeded to break up their cells.  They broke their cell windows.  We are attacked because restraint was put upon them when they broke their cell windows. Are they to be allowed to break up all their cell furniture if they choose?</P>

      <P>It is for these young men to continue or cease this hunger strike themselves.  If they choose to injure themselves, it is their look out.  They are free agents.  They are free to exercise as other prisoners are.  They are free to go off hunger strike any moment they like.  If they do not, the responsibility is theirs. They are not going to shorten the term of their imprisonment by any hunger strike in which they may indulge.  Let it be clearly and distinctly understood that they are not going to abridge by <Col N="334" /> one hour the term of their imprisonment by going on hunger strike.</P>

      <P>That must be clearly, definitely, and distinctly understood.  Deputy Ruttledge went into the question of prison regulations and asked if the present regulations had been observed.  He said that he did not consider that there was any power in the Governor to put any restraint on these men to prevent their doing any further damage to the prison furniture.</P>

      <P>When I say &ldquo;prison furniture,&rdquo; I mean not merely the actual things in their cells but the windows of their cells and the doors of their cells.  It would have been utterly and entirely wrong on the part of the Governor if, finding that these prisoners were damaging their cells, as they were damaging them, he had not taken steps to prevent that damage being carried on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
