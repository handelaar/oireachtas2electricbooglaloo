    <Title>Finance Bill&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, feel that we cannot permit this Bill to pass from the Dáil without emphasising the fact that it is a measure which has probably received more opposition from all parts of the House than any Finance Bill introduced by the Minister.  There are four provisions in the Bill which, in particular, have aroused the strongest opposition.  The first of these is section 2, which proposes to give retrospective effect to an amendment of the law&mdash; an amendment of the law which is designed to make an offence of what, according to a decision of a judge of one of our courts, was not an offence and has not been an offence up to this. We have had many expressions of opinion from the Government Benches concerning the manufacture of crime in this country, but the Dáil has now turned itself into a manufactory of crime.  This may be, in the eyes of the Minister, not a felony.  It may be merely an infringement of the law, but deliberately and of set purpose, by inserting the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had effect&rdquo; in section 2 of this Bill, the Dáil does definitely make what was previously in accordance with the law, now an infringement of the law and not only an infringement of the law at the present moment, but an infringement of the law in times past.  It is proposed to roll back, as it were, the time machine <Col N="1902" /> and to make offenders people who acted in a perfectly legal and constitutional way and in accordance with their legal rights prior to the introduction of the Bill by the Minister.  I feel that none of the assurances which the Minister has given to this House is a sufficient justification for the step which he is asking the House to take. Speaking on my own behalf, I think it is time that the House took a serious view of the laws of the State and that it was itself prepared to pay to them that respect which the Minister for Justice states should be given to the laws of the State by all its citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to enforce such respect, the Minister for Justice is prepared even to permit his own licensed bravadoes to commit illegalities.  What respect can those who differ politically from the Minister for Justice and the members of the Executive Council have for the law when they see the very fount and origin of the law itself so disregardless of the dignity of the law, so disregardless of its permanence that they propose now, after the courts of the land have found that the law is such and such in a certain case, to amend it in order to make it not what it was but what the Revenue Commissioners and the officials of the Department of Finance thought it was.  From that point of view, this section of the Act is entirely unjustifiable.  Not only do we on the Fianna Fáil benches take that view, but the Independent members of this House have taken that view.  The members of the Labour Party have taken that view and, more significant still, the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have taken that view.  Notwithstanding the fact that this proposal has met with opposition from all sections of the House, the Minister still continues to flout the opinion of the united representatives of the people and, by means of his party machine, to drive this objectionable enactment through the House.  It is not often that I expect saving grace from the Seanad, but I hope that when the Bill goes to another place the party machine there will not be as effective as it has been here, and that the members, on this matter, will <Col N="1903" /> vote in accordance with their conscience and in accordance with their own opinion.  If they do, I venture to say that this Finance Bill will not become law until the full suspensory period of twenty-one days has elapsed, and that it will not become law with the good-will of any independent representative of the people.</P>
    <P>The second most objectionable feature of this measure is the proposal, under Section 5, to increase the tax upon petrol.  I should like to make quite clear the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to a tax upon petrol.  In so far as petrol is used for luxury purposes&mdash;for motoring for pleasure&mdash;we regard a tax upon petrol as a legitimate resource of a Minister for Finance.  In so far, however, as it becomes not only a tax upon petrol but a tax upon transport and, therefore, a tax upon business and upon the necessities of the community, we regard it as undesirable.  If moneys had to be found for any purpose which would meet with the approval of this House, we should prefer that even before resort was had to that source of revenue, every possible means by which economies could be made should be investigated and examined.</P>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera made quite clear when introducing his motion to provide £1,000,000 for relief of rates upon agricultural land, the opinion of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil is that that £1,000,000 could be provided, not out of taxation but out of economies.  We indicated then, and outlined, a number of Departments in which these economies could be made. There is the Army.  According to a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, Major-General Seán McKeon, who held very high rank in the Army, during the last eight or nine years, no less a sum than £14,000,000 has been wasted upon the Army.  According to the investigations which have been made by the Committee of Public Accounts from time to time, large sums of money have been expended upon equipment&mdash;not always, I might say, in justice, under the régime of the present Minister for Defence&mdash;<Col N="1904" /> which was found on delivery to be useless.  There were those aeroplane engines, purchased in 1925, when the machines for which they were purchased were already obsolete and have never gone into the air since.  These aeroplane engines are still lying in store.  Ten thousand rifle barrels were ordered which, on delivery, were found not to be true or accurate and which would be a greater source of danger to the men employing them than to the enemy against whom they might be directed.  There are a considerable number of heads, particularly in regard to the purchase of military equipment in the Department of the Minister for Defence, in which we believe economies could be made which would go a long way to provide the £750,000 which the Minister proposes to vote for the purpose of agricultural relief.  There are other Departments of the Government in which economies could be made.  There is the whole administration of the Gárda Síochána and particularly of that branch of it which is concerned with the repression and investigation of political offences.  We have, from time to time, and quite recently, pointed out the anomalous and ambiguous policy which the Minister for Justice has pursued in relation to that Department.  We have him, on the one hand, subsidising men to stir up unrest in the country, to keep a certain section of public opinion in ferment, to urge them on and drive them on to commit what he calls illegalities and, at the same time, with the other hand he is spending £1,500,000 or £1,600,000 on a police force to repress what he calls these lawless and irregular organisations. You have a man, first of all, out of the taxpayers' money, fomenting crime and then, again, out of the taxpayers' money suppressing crime. Surely instead of acting in that ambiguous and inconsistent way, the Minister for Justice and the members of the Executive Council ought to cease to suborn men to commit crime, should cease to employ agents provocateur and content themselves with the preservation of the ordinary peace of the country by the ordinary police in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> There are many other ways in which economy could be made.  There could be economies if, for instance, the Minister for Finance had at last the moral courage to admit, what I have no doubt he believes in his heart to be true, the fact that the Ultimate Financial Settlement that he made with Great Britain was a settlement which was extremely disadvantageous to this country, a settlement which should not have been made, a settlement which should be reopened and investigated.  I hope that on such a reopening and reinvestigation the settlement will be so amended as to enable us to retain in this country at least the land annuities, the moneys paid to Great Britain in respect of the pensions of the ex-R.I.C. and the moneys paid in respect of the local loans.  If these sums of money, instead of being exported from this country under the agreement made by the Minister for Finance, were retained in the country we should have for the use and benefit not only of the farming community but of all the citizens of the State a sum approximately of £5,000,000.  That is almost seven times the amount which the Minister proposes to devote for the relief of rates upon agricultural land in the current year.</P>
    <P>We say that before he imposes the tax even upon petrol&mdash;and we are prepared to contemplate a tax upon petrol but only as a last resort&mdash;instead of attempting to tax the people, even to the extent of this tax upon petrol, the Minister ought endeavour to make economies in the administration of the Army and Gárda Síochána, which are necessary, to provide us with an effective defence force, and a police force in which the citizens of the State will have every confidence.  If the Minister had at first endeavoured to secure these economies, it would lead to efficiency; and secondly, if he would reopen the whole question of the Financial Settlement, he would not be driven&mdash;in order to provide part of this three-quarter of a million pounds which he proposes to provide for the relief of rates on agricultural land&mdash;to tax either petrol, which is a tax to a large extent upon the trade and industry of <Col N="1906" /> this country; and thirdly, he would not have been compelled to put a tax upon sugar, which is one of the necessities of the people's life.  For that reason we object not only to Section 5, but also to Section 6, which deals with the tax on sugar.  We see no justification whatever for this tax.</P>
    <P>I will now go on to consider the new section which the Minister introduced into the Bill.  That is a section altering the rates of the entertainments tax. Whatever the real effect of that section is ultimately going to be, the point I want to make on the Fifth Reading Stage of the Finance Bill before it leaves this House for good and all, is that the ostensible purpose of this section that was put before the House on the Committee Stage of this Bill by Deputy Shaw, was to enable the film renters, the film producers and the film exhibitors to pass the new tax on to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy MacEntee and his Party accepted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee did not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not call for a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee pointed out to the Minister what the Minister was doing, and he left it at that.  He is not going to let the Minister escape from the consequences of his action.  If the Minister had refused to accept that amendment, the amendment would not be in the Bill. The tax on films would remain where the Minister intended to place it in the first instance, on the foreign films, on the producers and renters of the foreign films, and on the exhibitors, who are to a large extent, as far as Dublin is concerned, affiliated with British and American concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister out of the kindness of his heart and out of the regard which he cherishes for Deputy Shaw accepted it.  Deputy Shaw seems I must say to be a very powerful member of the Government Party because he has compelled the Minister not only to transfer the tax on films from the film exhibitors and other associated interests on to the Irish public, but he <Col N="1907" /> has also, according to his own statement, and so far as we can judge from the proceedings here in the House and in the country, compelled the Minister to remit the tax upon racecourse betting, and the tax on greyhound coursing meetings, so that he is a powerful and influential member of the Government Party.  The extraordinary thing about it is that Deputy Shaw's influence, as far as this amendment was concerned, was exerted not on behalf of the Irish public to insure that this tax upon films should always remain upon foreign interests operating in this country, but was exerted in order to transfer the burden of that tax to the Irish public.  His influence was exerted against the Irish public, against even his own constituents at Mullingar, in order to transfer the burden of that tax from the foreign interests.  The Minister in deference to Deputy Shaw and bowing before the might and power of Deputy Shaw within the councils of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party accepted that amendment from Deputy Shaw and permitted this to be done.</P>
    <P>There are some other provisions in this Bill to which exception might be made.  I have already both on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage pointed out that under Section 30 the Minister proposes to continue for a further term of years exemption from the corporation profits tax which is enjoyed by certain monopolies in the city and country.  The purpose of that exemption is to enable the Tramway Undertakings and the Gas Company to escape from the corporation profits tax.  I think that that proposal is unjustifiable.  I have challenged the Minister to justify it in the House, but so far he has not been able to do so.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out to him that the nominal limitation upon dividends, which is imposed by the Acts under which these companies operate, is not in practice effective.  The only way in which it operates is that instead of the dividends being distributed immediately they are put to reserve, and when <Col N="1908" /> the reserve is of a sufficient size there is a bonus distribution of capital and the dividends are then distributed in the form of shares in the company. There is, therefore, no effective limitation of the dividends.  The effect is that the statutory dividend is paid over a certain term of years and the payment of the excess dividends over and above that statutory limit is merely deferred for a period of years.  Because that is the practice, there is no reason why these concerns should be exempted from corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempted to make the point with regard to the Gas Company that it was Irish and was registered here.  In point of fact, the control of the Gas Company does not reside in the country at all.  The great majority of the directors of the Gas Company are nominees of British interests and they are placed there as nominees of British interests.  The same applies in respect to some of the other companies which are benefited under this Act.  These are the main features in the Act.  We regard every one of them as objectionable, and for that reason we are going to vote against the Fifth Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>All these points were fully discussed on the Committee Stage, and after being fully discussed, they were accepted unanimously by the House.  I explained that £30,000 had to be found by somebody in connection with the tax on films.  It could not be passed on to the renters.  Deputy MacEntee was invited to suggest in what way it might be passed on to the renters, but, as usual, there was no reply.  I once heard a phrase that I think is very appropriate to this particular occasion.  It is: &ldquo;He talks to me about subjects of which he knows nothing, and talks me down.&rdquo;  I showed the verbatim report to the managers of all the large picture-houses in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. Shaw Mr. Shaw">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>And I showed them also to the managers of the small picture-houses in the country, and they all endorsed that phrase.  They came to the conclusion that the Deputy knew nothing whatever about the subject.  I might suggest to the Party opposite <Col N="1909" /> that, if they want to put up somebody who does know something about it, they should put up Deputy Flinn.  He explained the position very fully.  I will not on this occasion reply to Deputy MacEntee, because of the fact that he has put forward a lot of arguments about which he knows nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise what Deputy MacEntee said about the need for economy.  The Dáil will adjourn next week for several months, and we will have no other opportunity of stressing the need for economy.  The fact is that the people have come to the end of their tether in paying what the Minister is asking them to pay.  There is evidence of that in the fact that during the first quarter of this year revenue dropped by almost a million pounds.  The people cannot continue to support the extravagance of the Government.  Those who have to pay 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the revenue in one way or another, the farming community, are breaking down under the strain.  Everyone can see that farm prices are falling.  The Government are doing nothing to protect the home market, and the farmers are forced into the foreign market.  That policy has resulted in still smaller prices for the farmer.  If it continues much longer the people will not be able to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country has no confidence in the Government, and if the Government had any decency they would resign after the decision given by the people in the recent by-election.  One of the Ministers was on the platform when the Government's election agent promised that if their candidate was turned down the Government would resign.  The people rose to the occasion, and by a two to one majority they told the Government to get out.  The Government is still hanging on, and for some time further, at any rate, they are going to rob the people.  The fact is that the people cannot afford to pay taxes.  The Government should fulfil their promise to resign.  Of course, we are accustomed to such behaviour on the part of the Government. Soon, even for their own sakes, the <Col N="1910" /> Government will have to take action is they wish to remain in office.  They will have to economise, because otherwise they will not be able to get their salaries.  The whole thing is a disgrace. The people are overburdened, and yet you have Ministers going ahead in the old extravagant way.</P>
    <P>I hope that some opportunity will be given to the people to tell the Government what they think of them.  I am sure, just as in the case of Kildare, that the people all over the Free State will tell the Government they want no more of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register my protest against this tax on sugar.  I know that the working-class people in the rural parts have very inadequate wages and, in consequence of this extra halfpenny tax on sugar, they will be compelled to pay 16/- or 18/- a year more.  That is not alone unfair, but it is also unjust, to people who can badly afford to meet that extra payment. Amongst the working classes sugar is largely regarded as a necessary.  It is unfair to impose any tax upon it that will have reactions upon the poorer people.  It is characteristic of the Minister that on every occasion when he introduces a Finance Bill he makes it his business to take from those who can ill afford to pay and give to those who are already well provided for.  The Minister has to find £750,000 in order to give a free grant to the ranchers in Meath and to people similarly placed all over the country, most of whom are spending their money in foreign countries. I will vote against the Fifth Reading of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never much impressed by calls for economy from the Opposition Benches.  The previous policy of that Party is responsible for a fair proportion of the charges that rest on the people, and, so far as the Dáil is concerned, we find them in the forefront in demanding additional expenditure and additional burdens by way of taxation.  We hear occasional calls for reductions in the Army and reduction in the police force, calls which, I think, are based more upon political spite than upon anything else. I do not think I need say anything <Col N="1911" /> further with regard to the remarks we have heard.  The only thing that Deputy MacEntee omitted from the usual litany was the demand for the abolition of the Seanad, and I will take that as said.  With reference to the first point Deputy MacEntee made, that Section 2 of the Bill was designed to make an offence that was not, <Col N="1912" /> according to a judge of the courts, an offence before, there is absolutely no foundation for it.  I cannot believe that the Deputy is so stupid, after all the debate which has gone on, as not to know that that absolutely misrepresents the facts and is without a shadow or a shade of foundation.</P>

      <P>We do not propose to offer any objection to the passage of this Estimate, but in connection with it there is a matter which was adverted to by the Commission on De-rating, and that is that the valuation of the country is based on Griffith's survey and valuation made almost 100 years ago.  I put it to the Minister two or three years ago that a good deal of the unfairness, and a good deal of the complaint which the agricultural community in general have in regard to local rates arose from the fact that these rates were based upon that valuation.  I have a feeling for a long time that a revaluation of the country is over-due. The agricultural conditions have changed altogether from what they were in Griffith's time.  The whole basis of the value of agricultural land has changed likewise. Nevertheless we continue to proceed upon an old, out-of-date, obsolete, basis, and there cannot be any fair distribution of the burden between the urban and agricultural community, and between various sections of the agricultural community unless a revaluation is made.  If we had a sound basic foundation to go upon, I feel certain that a good many of the difficulties which the agricultural community experience at the present time would resolve themselves without any adventitious aid from the national exchequer, because these men would be rated for local purposes according to the real and actual value of the land to them, and not according to the value which it was to their forefathers almost 100 years ago.  I should like if the Minister would give some indication as to the view of the Government in the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that, while a revaluation of agricultural land might be beneficial in certain areas that were wheat-growing areas when the land was valued, I believe it would not be beneficial so far as many of the areas in the poorer districts are concerned.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy O'Connell that one of the factors taken into consideration by Griffith in making the valuation was proximity to the seaboard, and that was held to increase the value of the land, and it is the poorer districts, the congested districts, which have been unfairly treated on that account.  On account of proximity to the seaboard they are supposed to have special advantages so far as natural fertilisers and manures are concerned. Under modern conditions the comparative value of these has considerably depreciated, and I believe that one of the effects of revaluation would be to put those poorer districts upon a fairer basis and relieve the burden upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case theoretically for revaluation, because naturally conditions have changed substantially since the time the Griffith valuation was made, and naturally the question has come up for consideration since the change of Government.  But it is a very big and a costly job, and would occupy a very considerable period in carrying out.  The argument that influenced the Government very much against seriously considering putting it in hands has been this, that agricultural conditions were very much disturbed during the war, and in fact economic conditions generally are in a rather abnormal condition. It is felt that general re-valuation should only be undertaken after there has been some years of as great <Col N="1916" /> a degree of agricultural normality as possible.</P>
      <P>It would have been, for instance, obviously absurd to have carried out revaluation, say, in 1920 or 1921. Everything that would have been done then would soon have been very much more out of date than the Griffith valuation is even at the present time. And while, of course, things are not so very abnormal as they were, say, in 1920, nevertheless it is felt that some time should be allowed to elapse after reaching normal conditions before we would undertake this enormous task.  I am speaking from memory now, but I think the Estimate made, after some little consideration by the Government, was that revaluation would cost three-quarters of a million, and would occupy eight or nine years or some period like that. The undertaking of a task like that is very big and should only be entered upon when it is felt with reasonable certainty that the result would be something that would have validity for a good period after the work is carried out.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for anyone to say how revaluation would affect the various areas.  There are areas where one can say with reasonable certainty the valuation would be reduced.  It is possible that some of the areas that Deputy O'Connell has in mind would have their valuation increased.  On the other hand I think there are areas on the seaboard, where possibly what Deputy MacEntee said is right, that the allowance for having seaweed was greater than would be made now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking personally when I say I met cases where the valuation is rather high on the sea coast as compared with land one mile or half a mile inland. I do not think that whatever revaluation would do it would go any distance towards solving the difficulties of the agricultural community. I think most probably what you would find as a result of revaluation would be that one patch had its valuation reduced by 25 per cent. and another patch had its valuation increased by 25 per cent.  I am speaking relatively. Probably the whole nominal valuation would be substantially increased.  But <Col N="1917" /> coming to relative figures, you would only have perhaps a decrease of 25 per cent., or it may be that on some of the wheat lands which were very highly valued the decrease would be a little larger and would give some relief to individuals, but it would not have a great effect on the whole agricultural position.  Rates are important, but they are not so all-important as to cause a relatively minor change in the rating burden to be a solution of the difficulties of the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two things that Deputy O'Connell and the Minister left out of consideration entirely.  The readjustment between the urban and agricultural areas would be in favour of the agricultural areas as a whole in consequence of the revaluation. That is a very important factor, particularly for seaport towns, towns which are the ports of entry for a considerable portion of foreign produce. The valuations on premises in those towns, occupied by a number of importers, would be considerably increased, and under that head alone there would be a readjustment in favour of the agricultural population. With regard to the cost of the undertaking, the Minister has put the figure at three-quarters of a million.  The House has to remember that that sum would be almost entirely expended in paying wages to young engineers, in particular to civil engineers, who have no opening in this country at present and are compelled to go abroad, as well as in paying wages to assistants, skilled and unskilled.  A large part of the labour in this connection would be unskilled labour which can be trained with comparative ease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we have a large section of our population unemployed, but here is work which, I believe, could be usefully undertaken at a cost, as the Minister says, of three-quarters of a million.  Virtually the whole of it <Col N="1918" /> would be spent in salaries and wages, in salaries to engineers who cannot find work here at present, and in wages to the more luckless element of the community, unskilled labourers who cannot get abroad and are compelled to starve at home.  That is one important feature in connection with this matter. The Minister advanced another reason for not going forward with this, that the Government were waiting until stable conditions had been created.  In the twenty-six counties agriculture has been reduced to one dull level of depression. I do not think the Minister is going, in the next five or six years, or possibly in twenty years, if his policy is pursued, to find that there is going to be any great improvement.  There is, as I have said, the one dull level of depression in agriculture in every part of the State.  That is going to continue as long as the Minister remains in office, and as he is probably, according to himself, looking forward to a continuance of the term of a Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say on this Vote.  I wish to draw attention to the fact that recently considerable difficulty was experienced in securing from the Department through its recognised agents in the city certain copies of Ordnance sheets. When inquiries were made it was found that this was due to the fact that the van which the Department employs for delivering maps to its agents for distribution had broken down and remained out of repair for four or five days.  Some of the Ordnance sheets were urgently required. I mention the matter in the hope that should a similar breakdown occur in the future the Department will take steps to meet the convenience of the public and have orders of this sort delivered by hand.  They should not be allowed to remain over for three or four days as they were on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's notice a matter that I raised in the House before, concerning some officials of this Department&mdash; temporary surveyors&mdash;who are on loan to the Land Commission.  These people were dismissed in 1916 for refusing to join the British Army, and after a lot of agitation they were reinstated in 1924.  I understand that most of them have been put on the pension list since. There are about six who have not been put on the pension list, the reason being that they have attained the age of 50 or 51.  But for what happened in 1916 one of these men would automatically have gone on the pension list in 1918.  I do not think the Minister should stand strictly to the rule about not putting people on the pension list simply because they have attained the age of 50 years, particularly when it is remembered that they had about 30 years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really a small matter for the Department, but a serious one for the people involved.  I understand they are efficient men.  They are working <Col N="1920" /> alongside people in the Land Commission who have much bigger salries.  I see no reason why, simply because they have attained the age of 50 years, they should not be put on the pension list. I ask the Minister to reconsider their cases.  I understand that there are other people over 50 years of age who have been established.  There is a clear case, I think, for treating these men in the way that others have been treated.  All the others who were dismissed at the time and who were not 50 years of age were put on the pension list.  I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to the cases of these men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear about the mishap to the van to which Deputy MacEntee referred, so that I do not know anything about the circumstances of the case.  With regard to Deputy Boland's question, I am personally not aware of what happened in these cases, but I will make inquiries.  I do know that the men who were dismissed in 1916 were given a gratuity for the period in respect of any rights to pensionable positions that they might have then acquired.  When they were taken on afterwards they could not be given credit for former service, because that would have meant, from the point of view of pension, that they would be getting credit for it twice.  I think that at most there were eight or nine.  I think about nine were put on the pension list, and that there are four or five cases actually under consideration at the present time.  Whether these four or five include the cases that the Deputy has mentioned I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unusual to give establishment to men who are over 50, and for this reason: that the normal retiring age is 60.  If a person is not established until he is over 50 it means that, although he has been established, he cannot have the service to entitle him to a pension.  On the other hand, there may be positions in which there would be no difficulty in allowing an officer to continue to serve up to 65.  In such a case you might be able to give the period of service that would entitle him to pension.  While it is almost the universal rule not to <Col N="1921" /> give establishment to persons over 50, I am aware of one or two cases in which there has been some relaxation of that rule.  I will look into these cases because I do not know personally about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item&mdash;Defence of Public Officials&mdash;in the Law Charges which I cannot allow to pass without severely criticising.  The first thing to note about it is that it is a token figure amounting to the round sum of £800 this year.  Last year it also amounted to the round figure of £800. A token figure is a phrase that was invented during the war when the British authorities did not want to give information to the enemy.  They put down a round sum and left it at that. We have exactly the same figure appearing from year to year while it is known that law costs work out in pounds, shillings and pence.  The most objectionable thing about the Vote is that it includes the payment of costs to the Gárda Síochána for carrying out duties that were imposed on them. Otherwise I do not suppose these costs would be paid.  These duties are of the most odious nature and are contrary to public policy.  No one would object to the general principle that there should be an item for Law Charges to protect certain public officials in carrying out their duties, but when the duties are of such a nature as to place them in the category of persons carrying out third degree methods, I think we are bound to vote against such an item and register our thorough disapproval of the methods which led to these actions.  We have one example of a case which could not be regarded as political where, owing to the training of these men, the way in which they have been taught to use the third degree methods actions were taken against several of them in Co. Waterford.  These actions were won and damages were awarded against officers of the Government.  When the cases were over, the Government did not stand over their own training and instruction, and more or less repudiated the conduct of these men.  They have not done so in other cases.  I have a list where similar conduct was indulged in and where none of these <Col N="1923" /> men, on the admission of the Minister for Justice, has been dismissed, while the expenses incurred have been imposed on the public through this Vote. These are some of the cases: O'Neill v. Kinsella and others; MacKeon v. Sherlock; Sugrue v. Kinsella; O'Donoghue v. Donegan; Dempsey v. Lane; Vaughan v. Lane; Hanlon v. Corry; O'Brien v. Monaghan; Thackaberry v. Moore; Hamilton v. Monaghan; Holden v. Corry; Farrell v. Corry.</P>
      <P>In all these cases the costs of actions which were lost by the officials must ultimately be taken from our pocket. There was a case in Co. Clare, Fennell v. English, and in Co. Waterford the case of Corbett v. McNamara.  The following were also successfully used: Detective Sergeant Byrne, Detective Sergeant Gill, Detective Officer Hussy, Detective Officer Rodgers, Detective Officer Cornelius Coughlan.  All those men have been carrying out the orders of the Government, and those orders were of such a nature as to render brutal conduct on their part necessary in carrying out their duties, with the result that actions were taken against them.  For that reason it is necessary to vote against this Estimate as a protest and as the only remedy that we have to stop these methods from being indulged in in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that brutal conduct of any sort on the part of the police has neither been encouraged nor condoned.  There have been cases where perhaps policemen may have lost their tempers a little bit under extreme provocation.  We do not&mdash;and I do not think it would be right&mdash;insist that in such cases policemen should necessarily be dismissed. But if any such cases happened the policemen have been warned that it must not happen again.  Generally there has been no misconduct on the part of the police.  I do not think any country could be found where the police have tasks as difficult as they have here, and where there was so much restraint used, or where the Government were so strict to take action of the sort we took.  I would venture to say that it has never happened <Col N="1924" /> that policemen have been so controlled, having regard to the circumstances and to recent history, as they have been in this country.  I think nothing has happened that we have any cause to be in the least ashamed about.  Human nature is human nature, and sometimes a policeman may strike a man under extreme provocation, just as would happen in any country, and as happens occasionally in every country.  The only thing for the Government to do in such a case is to take whatever may be suitable action in the circumstances and to prevent any bad habits arising. With reference to the cases in which damages were awarded against policemen in Dublin, these policemen arrested certain persons in Dublin under orders.  When the cases came before the courts it was quite clear that there was no option for the jury but to find that there had been a technical offence on the part of the police, and they awarded a sum as damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, I think the jury showed a judicial attitude and awarded damages which were not unreasonable in all the circumstances.  But that does not mean that the police were wrong.  All it means is that we could not expose witnesses to the danger of being shot, and it was not possible to put the information which was before the Government before the Court. Everybody knows that any person who gives information about these illegal murder organisations is liable to suffer for doing what is his public duty.  Because of that, although we had information quite sufficient to justify the police action, it was not possible for us to bring that evidence before the court. Consequently, the court had no option but to find that a technical illegality had been committed.  We think it is necessary that police costs should be paid in these cases and in all cases where the policeman acts in a bona fide manner, without malice and without brutality, in the execution of his duty, as he sees it.  It would be impossible&mdash; especially when we have illegal organisations&mdash;to carry on if a policeman felt that when he committed a technical breach of the law he was going to be mulcted in costs and damages which <Col N="1925" /> would make it impossible for him to remain in the force.  With regard to another case in which damages were awarded against the police, and in which there was no connection with any political action, the court was of opinion that something illegal had been done by the police.  We were not disposed in any way to dispute that finding, but one thing, I think, has come as a result of that trial&mdash;that juries, in future, are not going to give absolutely inflated and ridiculous damages.  The idea seemed to have got about then that in a case in which £1 would be reasonable damages a jury ought to give hundreds of pounds, as the State would pay.  We are not going to pay, and juries have to understand that, if they show malice against the police, they are going to ruin the policeman individually, and that it is not merely a question of placing heavy damages on a broad back.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked about the sum.  You can never be sure that in any single sub-head the amount will exactly tally with the expenditure.  What is done is to put down a round sum that ought, in view of all the circumstances as they can be foreseen, to meet the expenditure. If, over some years, the expenditure is higher than the amount of the estimate, and no circumstances can be seen that would lead one to believe that it would be less in the next year, the amount can be raised.  But you cannot come down to pounds, shillings and pence in an estimate.  You must take a round figure.</P>

Very heavy damages were awarded against the <Col N="1926" /> police in that action.  We believe that the size of the damages, which was ridiculous, was determined by the belief that the Government would pay and that no injustice was being done to any policeman by awarding these enormous damages.  I want to make clear that, in circumstances of that sort, we are not going to place a burden of that nature on the shoulders of the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I, for one, absolutely dissent from the attitude which the Minister proposes to take up.  It seems to me that it is going to work out like this: if heavy damages are awarded against an individual, he will have to pay them.  The man is going to be ruined.  If there is to be a principle that where an officer carries out his duties according to his instructions, acts within the law and acts properly, whatever damages may be given against him for a technical breach of the law shall be met by the State, then why should the State shirk its duty when heavy damages are awarded?  Is it not due to the orders that the man receives?  I think that that is an extraordinary principle.</P>

If a Gárda received orders from a Superintendent <Col N="1927" /> which were illegal, that there was some technical illegality, if he carried out that order without any personal misconduct, carried it out properly, but that there was some breach of the law, and that he was mulcted in damages for that, we would certainly meet his immediate expenses.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it that the Minister is laying down the principle that the jury cannot give damages against the State for the reputation and character of a person who has suffered an indignity?  The character and the reputation of the individual concerned is very often a matter upon which damages are allowed.  If there is a wrongful arrest and that the jury consider that the plaintiff has suffered an indignity, the Minister is not laying down the principle that the jury are not entitled to award any damages?</P>

      <P>Since the universities are autonomous, and properly so, we did not have a discussion on them under the Vote for the office of the Minister for Education.  I think it was Deputy Thrift who recently said here that the universities did not and should not advertise. I agree with him in that, so that this is our opportunity perhaps of finding out what progress is being made in respect of this Vote.  Every Deputy in the House will agree that <Col N="1931" /> it is well to encourage agricultural science in our universities and to try to divert our youth from the so-called learned professions into industry and agriculture.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what has been done in this direction and I am certain we would all foster any progress in this direction.  We had from the Minister for Agriculture some explanation of what was being done in the matter of dairy science in Cork under this Vote.  Part of this Vote deals with the Gaelicisation of Galway University College.  I am sure other Deputies would join with me in asking what exactly is being done in the universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway in respect of agriculture and dairy science and especially what progress is being made in the Gaelicisation of the University College of Galway.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any information.  These university colleges are autonomous bodies.  They are not bound to report to the Government. I have no doubt that information on any particular point would always be available to Deputies.  I am sure the universities would always be glad to give it, but the Government has no right to look for information from these universities.  They were deliberately made autonomous institutions, not responsible to the Government for any of their acts.</P>

At any rate, there is an opportunity of discussing it more effectively there than on this Vote. With regard to the Gaelicisation of the University College, Galway, I am satisfied that very good progress is being made and that a very good spirit is growing up in the college, but for <Col N="1932" /> the details the Deputy would do better to apply to the authorities of the college and I am sure he will be furnished with the details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; I want to ask Deputies to refuse to agree to the payment of the sum now demanded by the Minister, unless and until the directors of the factory, who are to benefit by this payment, recognise the Beet Growers' Association as a body entitled to bargain with the factory on behalf of the growers.  I ask the Dáil to refuse to pay any further sums to the Belgian directors of the factory until these directors agree to pay an economic price for the raw material.  Members of this party who were in the House when the Bill of 1925 was being discussed, definitely committed themselves <Col N="1935" /> to the payment of a subsidy for the purpose of helping to develop this new industry.  They did so on the very definite condition that as long as the subsidy was being paid to the factory at the expense of the taxpayer the growers should get a guaranteed price. They suggested in an amendment supported, strange to say, by the Farmers' Party, that at the end of the subsidy period the Government should share half the ownership of the factory and its assets.</P>
      <P>Apart from these considerations, the Government has already committed itself&mdash;some of the Ministers, when they were in the country, committed the Government to it&mdash;to the establishment of a farmers' organisation for industrial purposes.  Strange as it may appear, we of the Labour Party are supporting, and will continue to support, the organisation of farmers for industrial purposes.  We look upon the present dispute as a challenge by the Belgian directors to the right of collective bargaining and to the right of the farmers to organise themselves for industrial purposes.  For that reason we think no Government that believes in the setting up of an organisation for such a purpose should pay the people's money while the dispute exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt in the mind of anyone who has studied the situation which has led to this dispute that the real issue is the refusal of the directors to recognise the Beet Growers' Association.  Towards the end of last year the Association made representations to the factory manager to arrange for an early meeting to discuss the question of price in the present year and during the remainder of the subsidy period.  The object was to arrive at an agreement on the question of price, if that were possible. The directors of the factory persistently refused to make any arrangement for such a meeting.  They agreed to meet the representatives of the beet growers only when they were aware that the growers had the land ready for the crop.  It was therefore at the last moment, as these people thought that they agreed to enter into negotiations with the growers.  They offered <Col N="1936" /> 38/- per ton&mdash;a reduction of 8/- on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The negotiations broke down completely, and the directors actually ordered officials of the organisation to get out of the offices provided for them on the factory premises.  My information is that they gave them 24 hours' notice to clear out.  That is a definite challenge to the existence of the Association. They also refused to pay to the Association money due to it, on the pretext that the money might be used in the Association's campaign against beet-growing.  The officials in formed a prominent Carlow citizen who inquired about future negotiations that they would have no more dealings with the Association.  They have taken certain action against the Executive of the Association in the courts of this country.  The beet growers believe that the object is to exhaust their funds.</P>
    <P>These things prove quite clearly that there is a definite challenge.  I am sure the President will admit that.  I and members of this Party believe that that challenge should, in the ordinary course, come within the meaning of the Trades Disputes Act.  It is a dispute between the directors as employers and the growers as employees.  I understand some prominent legal gentlemen have been consulted as to whether the dispute could be brought within the meaning of the Trades Disputes Act. There appears to be some doubt on that question.  The commonsense interpretation is that it could be brought within the terms of that Act.  That is the belief of anyone who countenances the existence of organisations for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>I will not enter into the history of the factory, the conditions under which the Belgian directors were brought into this country, or any other matters relating thereto.  All those things are well known to Deputies.  It was originally intended to erect a 10,000 tons factory, but subsequent to the passing of the Act an agreement was made for the erection of a factory with a far larger capacity.  That involved far greater financial advantages to those who entered into the agreement.  It appears, however, to many of us to be <Col N="1937" /> in conflict with the spirit and even the letter of the Act of 1925.  The directors admit in their balance sheets that they have been paying interest to the shareholders at the rate of 15 per cent.  Anybody who makes a careful study of the balance sheets will, if he considers the amount set aside for depreciation, for special reserves and other items of that kind, plainly see that the directors, during the past year, were paying a dividend actually at the rate of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was informed about two years ago by a gentleman who was in a position to know that the beet growers, especially those who employed agricultural labourers and who were paying the existing rate of wages in the district, could not produce beet at less than £2 2s. per ton.  The figure may have been slightly reduced during the intervening period.  The fact is that the demand which the factory is making upon the grower that he should supply the raw material at 38/- per ton is a demand which means that they are asking the growers to supply it below the cost of production.  Taking into consideration the fact that the State and the taxpayers are supplying the raw material to the factory for nothing, and giving a fairly large sum in addition, I fail to see why we, as representatives of the people, should vote a sum of £162,500, which is £54,000 greater than was given to the factory last year, as long as the directors continue to refuse to recognise the Beet Growers' Association, and as long as they insist&mdash;and I hope they will not be able to do it, and I do not think they will&mdash;upon the growers supplying the factory with beet below the cost of production.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations which took place in the early part of this year, and which broke down, the Directors put forward certain figures to the Beet Growers' Association as a justification for the demand for a reduction of 8/- per ton in the price of beet.  They claimed that a sum of £45,000 should be set aside for depreciation; £3,400 for Directors fees; £21,800 for taxes; £40,000 for dividend and £4,800 to be carried forward.  They produced these figures, totalling £115,000, as figures <Col N="1938" /> which the Beet Growers' Association should admit the directors and shareholders were entitled to receive.  We are asked to pay over to this factory £162,500, out of which £115,000 on the figures produced by the Directors will go in the main for depreciation and the payment of dividend&mdash;a very hefty dividend at that figure.  I fail to see why we should admit that the factory is entitled to receive a thirty per cent. return upon the invested capital and, at the same time, insist upon the growers producing the beet below the cost of production.  The thing is too silly for words.  I hope Deputies, regardless of Party, will agree not to vote this sum unless and until the issues in dispute are settled through the agency of the Government that is asking for the money.</P>
    <P>With sixteen or twenty other Deputies, I attended several conferences with the executive of the Beet Growers' Association when the issues involved were discussed at considerable length, and at the last meeting it was agreed that a deputation representing all parties in the House should be appointed to wait upon the Minister for Agriculture to put before him certain proposals which were unanimously agreed to.  The first proposal was that the Government should be asked to use their influence to force the Directors to recognise the Beet Growers' Association.  The second proposal was that they should take steps, whether by amending the existing Beet Subsidy Act, or otherwise, to provide for compulsory arbitration on the question of price.  So far as I am concerned, as some Deputies listening to me know, I am not by any means enthusiastic in regard to proposal No. 2.  It is possible that the Government could, by amending the Act or in other ways, persuade the directors to agree to compulsory arbitration.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good is trying to anticipate the argument I was going to use against it.  It is quite possible that the President and the Ministers could persuade the directors to agree <Col N="1939" /> to compulsory arbitration on the question of price.  The directors might agree to that, but while an arbitrator or arbitrators could decide what was the economic price to be paid for beet in a particular area, the arbitrators or the Government or the directors could not compel the beet growers to grow beet at a particular price.  Therefore, I do not by any means lend my support to proposal No. 2, and I made that quite clear at the meeting.  Proposal No. 3 was that the Government, through the Minister for Agriculture or the President, should approach the directors of the factory, who refused to work the factory, because that is what it amounts to at present, and put forward on behalf of the Beet Growers' Association a proposal for the purchase of the factory at the figure now shown in the balance sheet as supplied by the directors.  The value placed upon the factory when erected was £400,000.  Whether that figure was accurate or not I am not in a position to say, but I do know, and any Deputy who has studied the latest balance sheet of the factory knows, that the capital has been written down, or, in other words, that there has been written off for depreciation a sum of £220,000, leaving it, to the ordinary man who is not a financial expert like Deputy Good, to conclude that the present value of the factory is £180,000. If the Belgian directors of the factory refuse to pay an economic price to the Irish beet growers to supply raw material, and allow the factory to be closed down, as undoubtedly it will be, partially if not wholly, for the present year, then I say it ought to be a good business proposal for these people to get an offer representing their own value of the factory as shown in the balance sheet, and therefore other Deputies and I are enthusiastically supporting this proposal.  We hope that if the directors do not alter their present attitude on the question of price, they will accept this very generous offer on behalf of the Beet Growers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Minister for Agriculture or the President has <Col N="1940" /> conveyed that proposal to the directors, but I would be glad to hear whether that has been done and, if so, what attitude the directors have adopted towards what I consider to be a very generous proposal in all the circumstances.  The people's money is invested in this factory, and it is the duty of their representatives in this House to see that it is not closed down and the industry thereby destroyed. Deputy Good of course does not agree with me.  I would be very suspicious of my own judgment in matters of this kind if the Deputy agreed with me.</P>

      <P>There are some members of this party who do not admire all the leaders of the Beet Growers' Association. We would not be inclined to pander to some of the people who occupy the seats of the mighty on the Executive of the Beet Growers' Association, because we believe that the big beet growers, who are controlling the executive, have used their position to a certain extent to prevent the small beet growers getting acreage in certain parts of the Midland counties. We believe that the beet growers are entitled to an organisation and to establish an association for their own protection.  I am one of those who believes that labour can never hope to get much from the agricultural community in the shape of better conditions for agricultural labourers unless the Labour Party or those who represent the agricultural labourers, help, and do their part, in putting the farming community on a firm financial foundation.  That is why we are giving our enthusiastic support to the beet growers in their fight against this tyrannical imported combination from Belgium and Czecho Slovakia and other countries.  Some of those people are used to ruling uncivilised races in the Congo and other places like that. But I hope the result of this dispute will be to prove to them that the Irish farmers are not quite the slaves that they have handled in other countries.</P>

On that aspect of the case I would be delighted to hear what he has to say.  If he believes that this is not a fair price I suggest that the only way to bring it to a conclusion and a head is to refuse to vote the money asked for by the Government and thereby persuade the Government, through the President, or the Minister for Agriculture, to enter into negotiations with the factory without further delay and to persuade or compel them to recognise the Beet Growers' Association.</P>

      <P>They have the legislative powers of the Dáil to compel the factory, or anybody else, to do what the Dáil wants it to do.  Deputy Davin has stated the case very moderately indeed, and has put it on the level of a trade dispute.  Even if this were a trade dispute between private concerns, in which the State had no financial responsibility whatever, I think it is of such magnitude that some steps ought to have been taken by the Government to bring the dispute to a satisfactory conclusion.  If the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister takes up the attitude which was apparently reflected in a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; that this matter was going to be settled by a process of haggling or fair or market bargaining, in which eventually the factory, if it were strong enough to sustain the struggle, and if it were to be a question of the survival of the fittest, would ultimately force the price of beet down to the price of other cereals, then all I say is that such negotiations are only a farce.  To be of any value, negotiation must be such that both parties are having fair play.  It was because I felt that the beet growers were not having fair play in these negotiations that I demanded that compulsory arbitration should be introduced by the Minister.  I did not believe that compulsory arbitration was the best method unless it was going to definitely settle the question for the remainder of the subsidy period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin has referred to the very important question of the small beet growers.  We have been at a complete loss to understand what the attitude of mind of the Executive Council has been in the whole matter.  First and foremost, as Deputy Davin pointed out, they made a three years' contract for the protection of the growers and a ten years' contract for the factory. The Minister for Agriculture will say that it was quite impossible to get a longer contract than three years for the protection of the growers.  The fact that the contract was made for the first three years must have clearly indicated to the Ministry that after the three years' period the factory was <Col N="1943" /> going to take advantage of the new circumstances to force down the prices gradually.  I think the Minister for Agriculture himself was not adverse to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of explaining what his attitude actually was, and if I am incorrect in stating what his attitude was I hope he will point out the deficiency, but I think the attitude of the Minister was that the ultimate end in view was to make this a commercial proposition and that at the end of the subsidy period, if possible, we should get as near as we could to running this factory without subsidy or with the minimum possible subsidy.  Therefore I take it as a hypothesis, at any rate, that the Minister for Agriculture, if beet growers were willing and if the circumstances generally seemed to favour that course, was not against a reduction in the price of beet.  The Beet Growers' Association was not against a reduction in the price of beet, nor against a fair return to the factory, so long as it could be shown that any reduction made was necessary and reasonable, and that all sides were making their sacrifice.  But, as I said before, it seemed that the beet growers were called upon to make all the sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I say that the Minister for Agriculture, in assuming that this question could be settled by negotiations, and in allowing the beet growers with their small organisation to be put in the position of making a stand-up fight, so to speak, against the factory, was not doing the right thing by the beet growers.  He may say he had no power, but he always had the Dáil to come to for any power he wanted. What was the alternative to the Minister seeking powers from the Dáil to deal with this situation?  The alternative was to let the industry collapse during the present year and to prejudice it very seriously for the remainder of its existence, if not to close it down altogether.  When we regard the present condition of agriculture and when we take into account the widespread depression is it not a serious thing <Col N="1944" /> indeed that £360,000 should be taken out of circulation in an area of an hour's run of the Carlow factory?  It is a very serious thing indeed.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, where these syndicates and combines were able to protect themselves and were able to drive a very hard bargain as they have driven here, they were ultimately compelled to face the facts.  When the Minister says that he could not interfere, that he had no power to interfere, I say that he could have come to the Dáil and told the House what steps he was taking.  If the Dáil were satisfied that these steps were the best that could have been taken in the circumstances then it would be in a position to pass a favourable judgment on the Minister. If, on the other hand, the Dáil was satisfied that the Minister was not taking sufficient steps and was not asking for the powers that he should have asked for, the Dáil could have expressed an opinion on that.  In the long run it would have been far better for the country if the whole question had been discussed early in the year in the Dáil as it was in the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>So far back as the 12th February the British Prime Minister made a statement in the British Parliament, and announced the terms of settlement with the beet growers in that country. It was only on 2nd March, when the spring season was well on, that the factory proprietors here even designed to approach the beet growers on this question.  It was quite obvious from the beginning that the factory owners were prepared to close down the factory and dislocate the industry, leaving the surrounding districts to suffer loss of all the money involved. It was quite obvious that they were prepared to do that if, at the end of this season, they found the beet growers in the position that their organisation had disappeared and that the small growers, many of whom no doubt would be growing beet in the interval, would increase in numbers and that the other growers, seeing that the Association was broken up, would be forced, since they have no other alternative in the present <Col N="1945" /> position of agriculture, to grow beet at whatever price the factory was pleased to pay.</P>
    <P>The British interfered in the matter. It may be that there were particular circumstances over there.  There was a change in the subsidy.  At the present time the factories in England are only getting 6/6 per cwt. as subsidy. That price is to operate for the next three years, whereas formerly they were getting 13/-.  There was a dispute about the price of beet. Therefore, the British interfered.  The first thing they did was to examine the books of those factories.  I am satisfied from the case that the beet growers have made, and from the failure of the factory to meet that case, that the growers have a good case.  I would like to know whether the Minister for Agriculture has, in fact, gone into this very matter.  If he saw that negotiations were fruitless and if he, as he later admitted when electioneering needs demanded it, saw that the right was on the side of the growers and the factory was in the wrong, and that the factory could pay a bigger price, why did he not take steps to place that information at the disposal of the Dáil?</P>
    <P>There was the greatest possible difficulty in raising this question in the Dáil at all.  It was suggested that because there were negotiations going on, or that they might take place, in some way it might prejudice the question if there was a discussion here. I take it that it is the duty of members of the House who are interested in this matter, when they were made aware of the losses that were accruing to their constituents, to press home the matter on every possible occasion.  The British Ministry examined the question. They went into the books and satisfied themselves that the British factories were not making a great profit on the 38/-.  On the other hand, they said that they were not going to compel the growers to accept a price that would be unremunerative until they had gone further into the question. They asked the factories what about the reserves they had, what about the profits they were building up, and what about the large sums they <Col N="1946" /> had set aside for depreciation.  The British Ministry compelled the factories, at least the most important group, I think, the Anglo-Dutch group, to forgo all profits during the coming year.  I think that probably the factories themselves had been accommodating in the matter.  The British Ministry found it an easier task to deal with them than the Minister for Agriculture here would have; at least, that is his contention, in dealing with the Carlow factory.  But if he found that it was necessary to take steps to do here what has been done in England, and that the factory proprietors in Carlow were not prepared to meet him, then I think he should have come to the Dáil for power to enable him to deal with the situation.  Dr. Addison, speaking in the British Parliament on 16th March last, said: &ldquo;My information is that the combine of the Anglo-Dutch Group of British factories are prepared to operate their factories for the manufacture of white sugar from homegrown beet, until January, 1931, not for the purpose of making profits or increasing their reserves, but in order to utilise the whole of the net proceeds of such manufacture for payment for beet.&rdquo;  That has been carried a step further recently.  A special additional grant of 1/3 per cwt. has been given. The additional grant is merely to cover the present exigency, and is to be repaid as soon as the price of sugar increases. It is also a condition in England that all the acreage offered to the factory should be taken up.</P>
    <P>I submit that instead of pretending that this matter could have been settled by negotiation when in fact it could not have been, when the owners apparently were determined that they were not going to settle it, but rather were prepared to be at a loss for the present year if they could break up the Association and drive down the price to the growers to the lowest level for the remaining period, it was up to the Government to take some steps, such as the introduction of compulsory arbitration, or some other step to deal with the situation.  I would like to know if the Minister is in favour of the position that has been put up in County Carlow.  The small <Col N="1947" /> farmers in a large number of cases have been deprived of the benefits of the subsidy because they were only able to grow a very small acreage, but the amounts that they would have got even on a few acres would have meant a great deal to them, particularly at the present time.  Is the Minister now prepared to subscribe to the doctrine that the growers who have made the factory a success up to the present, who have built up this Association, whatever its faults may have been, and who have proved themselves to be efficient, and who, as I think everyone will admit, have made such a very good case, should be wiped out of existence by the factory&mdash;simply to put them aside and to build up some form of new organisation where the basis of agreement will not be the price of labour and which, as Deputy Davin has brought out, will not affect the large numbers of labourers who are employed? You may have the small farmers, or even the cottagers, who place hardly any value on their own labour and do not take that into consideration in a commercial way, prepared to take a much smaller price. We have come to the parting of the ways.  If I had thought that the Minister was in favour of that, that it was his idea that the big growers who having served their purpose, should be turned aside after the factory had been built up, if only the factory had been able to get the acreage from another type, and if he were satisfied that the country generally was going to benefit by a change in the type of growers, by giving people who hitherto have been excluded certain advantages over the remaining period, I would say that he had a case, but he has not a case.  He has not stated whether he is in favour of that or whether he is open to the suggestion.  There is at any rate the feeling in my mind that the Minister all along, seeing that a reduction in these prices was inevitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>My own feeling is that I want to see the largest possible number <Col N="1948" /> of persons growing beet.  I want to see the small growers getting benefit out of it as well as the big growers, but I am not prepared to say that the small growers should come in now at the expense of breaking up the Association. If the Association is not representative of the small as well as of the large growers, it should be made representative of every small grower.  Every small grower should go into it, and should abide by the policy laid down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the figures the point is that negotiations were carried out before.  That is the reason why I am so strongly against the idea of negotiations.  Negotiations were carried out before.  The Minister sent down his experts.  Unless the experts had some special knowledge, unless they had got the accountants' and the auditors' reports to go into the position themselves, and were in a position to come to a decision themselves, apart from the information they got when they sat down at the table to conduct negotiations I do not think their presence there would have been of great value.  If you simply go there as a party holding a watching brief it is a question in the long run of which of the two parties can beat the other down.  I think that the English Minister summed up the situation very well when he said he could not stand for negotiation.  Negotiation in the long run seemed to mean that the gamble was altogether on the growers' side.  The other people could afford to wait.  I think there is a weakness about negotiations, particularly when, as I say, the negotiations were never seriously entered into by the factory. I do not think that the Minister will contradict me on this, that there is nothing to show that the factory ever seriously considered the question of negotiations, or that they were really serious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point that is quite clear. It has been made by the growers and I have not seen any reply to it.  It is this, that during the last five years the factory hoped to get an advantage from the increase in the subsidy, that <Col N="1949" /> it was their policy at the end of the first five year period, having got the maximum acreage, the maximum tonnage and the maximum number of people interested, to force down prices for the remaining period, although they were getting an additional £54,000 per year.  Their intention apparently was to put that sum of money into their pockets.  The fall in the price of sugar altered the situation but did the factory suggest that the £54,000 extra money which they got should go against the fall in the price of sugar? No, the factory suggested that more than £54,000&mdash;£80,000 in fact&mdash;should be borne by the growers.  That is to say and the statement is not contradicted, that something like £80,000 would have been the decrease in the value of sugar as against what you have, namely, the extra subsidy of £54,000.  The Beet Growers' Association put that £54,000 extra subsidy against the £80,000 deficit and pointed out that £26,000 was the sum left.  Are the factories at the loss of that £26,000?  No, because they calculate that something like £24,000 is accounted for by the sale of sugar pulp so that the factory are only about £2,000 out of pocket, which works out at about 3d. per cwt.</P>
    <P>The statement of the growers seems to be supported by the fact that when negotiations were on previously, the factory said that they could not possibly pay more than 44/-.  They paid 46/-, and at the end of the year they paid a 15 per cent. dividend. They had a net profit of £127,000, and they put £40,000 to reserve.  That 15 per cent. profit amounted to 3/- per cwt. on beet.  Therefore if they had been satisfied to do without their 15 per cent. profit, leaving out the question of depreciation, they could have paid 49/-.  It is well known amongst the beet growers in Carlow, who have studied the question that the beet growers did make a mistake when they did not stick out for a higher price on that occasion.  I myself was greatly disappointed when they did not.  I think it was practically admitted by some of the factory people that they could have paid 49/-. Under these circumstances is it to be thought reasonable that the beet <Col N="1950" /> growers should accept negotiations, when the only advance to be made by the factory was that they were to give a potential shilling, which depended on an advance in the price of sugar, and that the growers were to be called upon to make a further sacrifice of 8/-, while later on the factory would come along again with large profits, possibly large reserves, large sums for depreciation and for various other things?</P>
    <P>I think the situation early in the year clearly showed that Government intervention in this matter was necessary. The taxpayer has a very substantial interest in this.  Between the direct and indirect subsidy we have paid out almost £2,000,000 up to the present and there are still five years to go.  We have given these people a monopoly. We have given them a remission of excise duty which does not exist in Great Britain.  I am not now going to go into the basis of the transaction but I think there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion that these people, when starting the factory here, were incurring enormous risks, as the Minister suggests.  He suggested, on a former occasion, that the smell of petrol was in the air, and that the smoke of burning houses, etc., could be smelt on the breeze when these people arrived in Carlow.  My answer to that is that these people had the credit of the State at their backs. They knew that any government that came into power would be bound to honour the obligation.  They had also carried out practical experiments, and we may be quite sure that these gentlemen who had spent their lifetime in conducting similar concerns on the continent, and who had probably been in England as well, were quite satisfied that this was a mine and a treasure for them&mdash;once they got in.</P>
    <P>Even if it be assumed that they put up the whole of the £380,000&mdash;and in doing that they were backed by foreign banks and syndicates&mdash;even if they built the factory, the total capital involved in doing that was practically paid off out of the profits of the first three years.  At the end of five years they find themselves in the position that they have accumulated enormous <Col N="1951" /> profits, greatly in excess of their original capital and that they have now got the factory free.  Originally these people said that they could not possibly pay 46/-.  Yet they were able to accumulate substantial profits at the end of the season.</P>
    <P>Surely the whole circumstances surrounding this situation should have shown the Government that these people were adopting a policy of grab, and that they were only interested to get everything they could out of the country.  No one objects to their getting reasonable profits, but Deputies should bear in mind that the original purpose of the subsidy was to give the tillage farmer a stand-by which he so urgently needs in his present position, which would help him to increase tillage, which would give him a fair working price and enable him to pay a fair wage for labour.  Recent events should have taught the Government that the beet growers are not satisfied that these foreign combines should be allowed to take up such a high and mighty attitude, that even if the Minister for Agriculture desires to meet them they should reply that they have not time to do so to discuss the question with him.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, not to take up the attitude that this question cannot be settled.  Like the question that was discussed in the House yesterday it is a big national problem.  It has got to be settled, and the country demands that it ought to be settled.  If the Minister is not now prepared to indicate to the House what steps he is going to take to settle the question, and what legislation he proposes to introduce, then I say that he is a failure, that his beet sugar subsidy is a failure, and that he has shown himself incapable of dealing, at a critical point in its career, with a problem affecting the very existence of what the Government, in their electioneering pamphlets, described as a &ldquo;flourishing industry.&rdquo; The industry is practically falling through at the present time.  If the Minister is not able to take steps to put it on its feet again then I suggest that the sooner he makes room for somebody else who will do it, the better.</P>

      <P>I think it is not very difficult to anticipate the general lines on which the Minister for Agriculture will go in his reply.  I have no doubt he will tell us that, on general principles, he is altogether opposed to interfering in matters of this kind, that the law of supply and demand should be allowed to operate, that the ordinary bargaining should be allowed to take place and that he should not interfere, at all events, until the very last moment.  When he is driven from that, when we point out that he is bound to interfere seeing that there is a large sum of public money going to this factory, he will tell us that he is precluded from interfering, that his hands are tied.  He will tell us that he made a bargain; he will even admit that it was a bad bargain but he will try to throw the onus of that bargain on us.

He will say, &ldquo;We have made this bargain.  We are bound honourably by it.  The credit of the country is involved in our keeping strictly to it.&rdquo;  As far as that point is concerned, I am prepared to agree with him.  I approached this question by putting myself, as far as I could, in the position of a member of the Ministry who had made this bad bargain.  I asked myself what would be my duty if I were in a position like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister looked across a moment ago and challenged Deputy Derrig as to what he would do in these circumstances. There is one thing he should <Col N="1953" /> do anyhow&mdash;that is, to see that there was fair play.  He should not stand aside and see his own people suffer when unfair action was taken by the other party.  I take it that that would be his duty&mdash;to see that there was fair play.  Is it acting unfairly towards this foreign company to see that your own people get fair play?  I say it is not.  The Minister can act in such a way that his own people will get fair play without in any way dishonouring any pact, bargain or contract he has entered into.  What has been the conduct of the Ministry with respect to these foreign capitalists?  Have they been unfair to them?  They made a very generous bargain with them at the start.  The Minister admits that when he says that it was a bad bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What then was the point about petrol being in the air? What was the Minister's point then in saying he would have done things differently if these particular circumstances had not been present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have it at last that the Minister does not think that he made a bad bargain.  He thinks he made a good bargain&mdash;a bargain which, at the present time, is driving the beet growers from the growing of beet into the growing of corn, and that, after they had prepared for the beet crop.  In these circumstances, they are going into the growing of cereals which is bound to be unprofitable. That is the &ldquo;good bargain&rdquo; he has made.  Under these circumstances, he is not prepared to go to the assistance of his own people.  I thought that his case was that it was a bad bargain, and that the responsibility for his having to make that bargain was being placed upon us.  Now, it appears that he has not made a bad bargain and, therefore, two of his previous arguments go immediately overboard. One of these was that we were responsible <Col N="1954" /> for this bad bargain, and secondly, that there was no necessity to go to the assistance of his own people at all.  The bargain was a good one for the country, and a good one for everybody!</P>
      <P>The Government has been more than generous with the foreign capitalists involved.  They kept their contract with them in giving a subsidy up to 10,000 tons.  After two years, they went beyond that and gave them a remission of duty over 10,000 tons, which involved a sum of something like £11 13s. 4d. a ton.  Their generosity in the matter has been such that whereas the sum of £922,745 was paid in cash by way of subsidy, in remission of duty there was a total of £1,018,582.  The total sum given either directly by cash subsidy or by remission of duty has altogether amounted to £1,945,000, working out at an average of about £400,000 a year.  Their generosity was such that if the price of 38/- were accepted by the beet growers for this year and if the quantity of beet and the sugar content remained the same as last year, the subsidy would give them all the beet for nothing and £90,000 as well.  Their generosity has been such that, as Deputies have pointed out, they have been enabled to pay off the capital invested in the enterprise to the extent of over £200,000. Deputy Davin said it was £220,000.  It is certainly over £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the figure in the balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At that rate, they would eventually have the capital paid off at the end of the period of the contract.  They have put £65,000 to reserve and they have paid something like £12,000 in directors' fees, not counting undisclosed fees for special services.  They paid 10 per cent. dividend for the first year and 15 per cent. for succeeding years.  If that is not generosity on the part of the Government towards these foreign capitalists I do not know what generosity is.  The Government does not even say to these people: &ldquo;We have been generous with you.  We have kept our contract with you.  You are trying unfairly, on account of having this particular grip, to <Col N="1955" /> take advantage of our people, but we are not going to let you do it.  We are going to stand by our people and see that they get fair play.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Though the Minister denies it, I believe that he could have arranged machinery for the settling of prices on the basis of costs at the very beginning. He could have made an arrangement then that would have safeguarded the farmers in the years subsequent to the first three.  That has not been done.  At least, he could say now to the company: &ldquo;We have been generous with you.  You are asking our people to grow beet at a price that is uneconomic.  That price gives you an unfair profit, and, because the circumstances are such, we are going to help our own people in their fight against you and support any organisation that they set up to defend their interests against you.  Any subsidies that we were going to give you or remissions to encourage beet growing, we will use, and more money as well, in order to see that those who have had to devote their lands to other crops will be put in a position to fight you and, if necessary, to see that you get no subsidy.&rdquo;  That is what I would imagine would be the attitude of a Government that was generous and who found that generosity was met on the part of these capitalists with unfair treatment of the Government's own nationals.  That is what the people expect&mdash;the people of the country as a whole.  Public money is going into this enterprise for a certain purpose&mdash;to bring about a situation in which beet would be grown for the manufacture of sugar hitherto imported into the country and enable us to be self-supporting to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They gave that money willingly, although they thought it was a very substantial sum indeed, in the hope that at the end of the period there would be established here a flourishing sugar manufacturing industry supplying, or going very nearly to supplying, all our needs in sugar.  The Minister is going to put all that on one side. He is going to have all his efforts in that direction set at naught.  I believe the Minister is not doing what the <Col N="1956" /> Minister should do to defend his own people in these particular circumstances. During the recent election campaign I was down in Kildare and neighbourhood and I met a number of people who put very definitely to me the point of view that the Government was not giving the assistance that they expected to get and that they were entitled to get, that they were being unfairly treated by a company that was generously treated by the Government.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister for Agriculture appealed to members of the House to refrain from discussing this matter, because, as he said, it was likely to prejudice the negotiations then going on?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, there is no point in the President's remark.  It is altogether beside the point, just as was the President's remark in discussing the question of relief of rates on agricultural land when he talked about prosperous farmers on these benches, the conclusion being that there was no necessity for any relief at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to this particular matter, we want to see the powers that are here to defend our own people exercised.  If there is a portion of the subsidy not paid as a result of the beet not being supplied, <Col N="1957" /> we think it is only fair that the farmers who have been compelled to sow other crops in place of beet should not suffer a loss by that, and portion of that subsidy should be devoted to seeing that they do not suffer a loss.  In that way the Minister will be standing by his own people, and putting them in a position to fight this company, which has taken an unfair advantage of them. The figures show that the Government has been generous, and there is no need whatever to have any compunction at all; no member need have any compunction in standing up for our own people under the circumstances, or have any fear whatever that he is acting somehow unfairly or dishonourably in regard to the bargain made.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with the point which I said I would leave over earlier, namely, the conditions under which the bargain was made.  The Minister for Agriculture has frequently excused himself on the ground that it was made at a time when there was great risk in investing capital in the Free State.  This is actually what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>They had to go to countries where factories were already in operation and induce foreigners to invest £400,000 in a factory in this country at a time when the Civil War was barely over and when the houses and buildings that had been destroyed then were not yet rebuilt.  Now, in the year, 1931, we are blamed on several counts by political opponents for failing to do this, that and the other. What were they doing in 1924 and 1925?  It was announced in that year that they would refuse to pay the first National Loan.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with it in a moment.  As a matter of fact, the agreement with Messrs. Lippens was signed on October 1st, 1925, two and a half years after the termination of the civil war, the civil war which the Minister himself said he began, the civil war which was begun by the attack on the Four Courts and the breaking of a political pact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Free State Government had already, at that time, raised £10,000,000 in the First National Loan at 5 per cent. nominal. In the same year it had raised £926,000 in Savings Certificates.  In 1924-25 it raised approximately a quarter of a million in Savings Certificates, and in 1925-26 another £600,000.  In view of these facts it is obvious that the Minister for Agriculture would have no difficulty if he wanted to plead that the credit of the State was sound, in finding arguments to present to Mr. Lippens or anybody else in support of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, what I want to point out is that the Minister, if he tries to excuse himself on the basis of a bad bargain&mdash;now he has gone away from that&mdash;the bad bargain was his own making.  He need not have made a bad bargain.  If he were anxious to look ahead and to safeguard the interests of the Irish farmer he could have done it.  He has gone away from that, but at any rate, whether the bargain was a good one or was a bad one, he has one duty at the present time, and that is to see that his people do not suffer as a result of any bargain made when it is in his power to protect them by supporting them in the direction we have indicated&mdash;supporting them against unfair treatment by foreign capitalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only suggestion which Deputy de Valera has made is <Col N="1959" /> that the Minister should stand by his own people, and the one weapon he suggested the Minister should use is the weapon of the subsidy, that the subsidy should be retained.  Is that not what he suggested?  Is there any other suggestion?  In his speech, I did not hear of any other.  I was hoping that he could suggest some other machinery whereby this matter could be dealt with.  No Deputy in the House is more closely concerned with this question than I am.  I was the chairman of the meeting at which the Beet Growers' Association was launched.  It was called together through our instrumentality.  I presided at that meeting, and the Association was launched.  Therefore, nobody has a closer or more personal concern in the success of the Beet Growers' Association, from the growers' point of view, than I have.  In this case, one has to make a choice between one's friends and national credit and national honour.  I want at the outset to say that, in my opinion, the directors of the factory, the owners of the factory, Messrs, Lippens, have deliberately set out to smash the Growers' Association.  I remember at the opening of that factory having a conversation with Mr. Maurice Lippens, and I remember his saying to me that any dispute or any misunderstanding between the growers and themselves would be a matter for amicable arrangement.  He left no doubt in my mind about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dare say at the time that was their frame of mind, but they have gone a long way away from that now.  He was at that time either deliberately trying to mislead me, who happened to be connected with the growers, or he has since changed his mind and gone away from the understanding he had with the growers.  The Company at that time gave every encouragement to the Beet Growers' Association to come to their assistance.  At that time I got the impression that there was no doubt about it that this agreement would have the very sympathetic support and co-operation of the Company. I believe that up to two years ago that was their attitude.  But two years ago, <Col N="1960" /> when this 46/- a ton arrangement was arrived at with the growers, they had it in their minds to break that arrangement. That was so two years ago. They wanted to break that arrangement with the growers.  The fact of delaying negotiations up to the time when it was dangerous to risk disagreement would lead me to believe that even at that time their minds were running in a certain direction.  The negotiations were delayed in 1929 to a very late date indeed, almost until the time when the crops should be sown.</P>
    <P>The fact that a company of their experience did deliberately delay negotiations about a crop that was vital to the life of the factory would lead me to believe that they were sparring for position and that they wanted to get the growers into a certain position where their backs would be to the wall. The agreement was come to that year, but they went a step further this year and they deliberately stood out to break the Beet Growers' Association. The matter was not so much a question of sugar beet economics as a deliberate and sweeping attempt to break the Association.  I have not examined the figures, but the figures have been examined by a competent independent authority who had no bias in the matter and I think the Minister will admit it, that the proper price they could economically pay for the beet would be about 41/- a ton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>On their own figures they could have paid the price of 41/- per ton.  Therefore, it was not from the point of view of economics that they decided to fight the growers on the 38/- per ton basis.  That fight was from the <Col N="1961" /> point of view of the company to break the Association.  I will instance some arguments in support of that.  At the time the company were concentrating on the small grower wherever they could get him.  They were making advances with regard to seeds, they were making advances with regard to manures and, in fact, they were advancing cash to them.  They wanted at the time to get at a certain section of the small growers of this country whose economic position was such that they wanted to catch hold of them as slaves to the factory.  They hoped that they would get a certain number of small growers so driven by the economic position and the economic pressure in which they were that they would have them as slaves to the factory.  I believe that was the intention.</P>

      <P>I am not going to go into the figures mentioned by Deputy Davin and Deputy Derrig.  These figures have been pretty well stated by the Association.  I will go so far as this, that while I am not in a position to criticise the figures, I do say that the policy of the Company was deliberately framed to smash the Association, and that it was a vindictive policy.  I will leave the criticism of the figures to other people.  That was the word to use about the Company's attitude, &ldquo;vindictive,&rdquo; and their attitude has been like that for over twelve months.  Certain indications were given as to that.  They wanted to get rid of the independent grower, who was in a position to buy his own seeds and to buy his own manures, and do without any cash advances from them.  They wanted to break the arrangement altogether with the Growers' Association, and to get on to what Deputy Davin has described as the Congo system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, one has to ask <Col N="1962" /> what is the suggestion towards a solution.  The only means that Deputy de Valera suggests is that we should break a national bargain where the credit of this State is at stake, to break that bargain, and to use that even though we hamper this State for all future development, and drag it to its knees.  The suggestion is to do that&mdash;to put it in the position that no man in this country or outside this country would ever after invest 10d. on the strength of a bargain made with this State.  That is the only alternative Deputy de Valera suggests.  I do not mind the other suggestions, but I do mind the suggestion of the leader of the Opposition. That is the only suggestion he has to offer, that we should break the credit of this State for all time.</P>

In this connection I have no regard for political or family relations.  I do not grow beet and I never did grow beet.  I am at the moment in the position of making a choice between my friends, on the one side, and national honour on the other. In making that choice I have no doubt that some people will find me disappointing. I have decided, at any rate, that I will take my stand on the side of national honour and national credit.</P>

      <P>There is one thing to which I have to refer.  It is, perhaps, a rather delicate thing to mention. The fact is that the real damage is done by people who profess to have the interests of the growers at heart, and who, at times, indulge in ill-considered interference, nominally on behalf of the growers.  It is, perhaps, a delicate matter to mention, but I refer to it deliberately.  That interference has done more to prolong the dispute between the growers and the factory than has anything else.  Had that interference not taken place, I am quite certain the beet would have been grown this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies must not be following the matter very closely when they ask that question.  Possibly, politics was the only thing that troubled them at the time.  What I mean is that the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin wrote a certain letter to the paper and then there were certain people in the country, Father Killian and others, great personal friends of mine, who interfered both privately and in the public Press.  That interference, the coming into the arena of these people, did more to prevent a settlement than anything I could imagine.  It strengthened the backs of the directors.  It set their feet more firmly on the road they intended to travel.  In my opinion they would never have travelled on that road were it not that they got an indication of support. I am glad that support was not subsequently forthcoming.  Deputies were anxious for me to mention names.  They really knew the facts all along, but they wanted someone with the courage to come into the open.  It is a delicate matter to refer to, but I refer to it because I believe it is true.  No matter how well meaning these people may have been, it might be better if they had not intervened.  In my opinion their best judgment was not exercised when they decided to come into this business.  I will not say whether they came into it on behalf of the beet growers or on behalf of the factory, but certainly the best interests were not served by their coming in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directors deliberately and vindictively embarked on a certain road. They were anxious to travel in a certain direction and the support they got from those who then intervened did more to put them definitely on that road than anything else I could imagine. The interference indicated that there would be a split within the ranks of the growers.  I do not know what the attitude of the Association, the big and the small growers, has been.  It has been said they were selfish and wanted to keep all the acreage among their members and they did not want to let in anybody from outside.  There <Col N="1966" /> may be some truth in that, but whether or not it is true, it is no credit to the farmers of the country that some, at least, were influenced to go outside the Association, to break away from it, and grow beet.  That is no credit to them and my only regret is that the law protects them.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the point of view from these benches.  Amongst the Deputies on these benches there is no sympathy with the factory or with the directors&mdash;none in the world.  It is a matter of deciding whether one should be influenced by personal friendships and personal interests&mdash;by the chance of a vote at the coming elections&mdash;or whether one should do one's duty by the State and be influenced by what is due to national honour and self-respect. I will be guided by my duty to the State and by my feeling of what is due to national honour and self-respect.</P>

I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that that statement has been made by the Deputy, not only in relation to this bargain, but in relation to every bargain that has ever been made by this Government, or by any other Government acting for this country.  He tells the Government that we should stand by our own; he said we are on trial.  It is perfectly clear to me that his attitude on this matter is not intended either to help the factory or the growers or any of the people concerned, <Col N="1967" /> but rather to wreck the agreement. The Deputy made a purely wrecking speech.  That is nothing new to him.</P>

His consistent attitude with regard to any enterprise established in this country, either for the benefit of the farmers or any other class in the community, has been to wreck it purely for political purposes.  His speech this evening was a speech delivered deliberately, not in the interests of the farmers or the growers, or in the interests of anybody else making money out of the factory, but definitely for the purpose he has always had in mind, and that is to wreck it, in order to gain whatever political advantage he might gain through destruction and chaos.</P>

      <P>Deputies must remember that I have often told them that if they attempt to hit they are going to get hit back.  It is a bad sign on the part of Deputies to squeal on the first indication of any opposition. We have as much right here as Deputies on the Opposition Benches I am speaking here as a member of the Government of this country, and I <Col N="1968" /> am perfectly certain that whatever I have to say I will say it despite any interruptions over there.  The sooner Deputies on the opposite side drop this alleged technique of trying to prevent by silly interruption another point of view being expressed the better for them.  We are told it is a bad bargain.  It has been said here that I stated it was a bad bargain. I never said at any time that it was a bad bargain.  I have always stated, and I state now, that we made an excellent bargain, and I want any evidence from any member of the House who declares that we have made a bad bargain.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>We are in the position that we can compare the bargain we made with the bargain made in other countries.  That gives us a line.  In 1924 we made a bargain with foreigners.  It is admitted that we had to make a bargain with foreigners.  It is admitted that nobody in England or this country knew anything about the production of sugar from beet.  The beet sugar industry was in the hands of Continental people. We arranged for the establishment of a factory here with the aid of a subsidy. All the factories in England have the help of a subsidy.  How does our subsidy compare with the English one? Will anyone deny that our subsidy for the ten years' period is smaller than the English subsidy?  The fact is that for the ten years' period the subsidy which the taxpayers of this country are asked to pay is something like £400,000 less than the subsidy to a factory of the same size producing the same amount of sugar in England.</P>

A customs duty is exactly as much protection to home grown sugar as a direct subsidy.  Deputies know that very well.  The Deputy knows well that the basis of the English subsidy and the basis of the Irish subsidy are different. Does he deny my statement that, taking the total subsidy which the English factories get and which our Irish factory gets, our subsidy is actually smaller over the ten years' period?</P>

I want to put this to Deputies.  Every possible weakness that could be found in the bargain which we made has been pursued by the Party opposite, and every possible advantage that they could get politically out of it they have taken, quite irresponsibly.  Do Deputies consider that they would not take this advantage if it were there?  I gave these figures weeks ago in the House, and they have never been contradicted. Deputies opposite, in the publications which they have been quoting from, have these figures, and they have never given them to the House.  The fact of the matter is that they cannot be contradicted. In 1924, one year after the <Col N="1970" /> Civil War, we did make a bargain with this Company which was a better bargain from the point of view of the taxpayer, whose interests we were concerned with, than the English bargain.

He said that that was my excuse for the bad bargain.  I never excused the bargain.  I say we made a first-class bargain, and I stand over every line of it.  I say that we made a good bargain, in spite of the fact that when we were entering into negotiations the Civil War was barely over, and all the marks of the Civil War were all over the country, and in the very year that we entered into the negotiations the Party opposite officially declared, and got it into all their papers, that they would repudiate the First National Loan.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Flooding in County Cavan.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the House do now adjourn.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question on the Order Paper yesterday as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he has received memorials from farmers in County Cavan giving particulars <Col N="1974" /> of losses they have sustained through the destruction of their crops by floods along the River Erne and its tributaries, and requesting that an inspector be sent to see and value the damage done, with a view to the Government rendering assistance; if it is the intention of the Government to accede to the memorialists' requests; and, if so, will prompt action be taken to relieve immediately the prevailing distress, and also secure the afflicted farmers against the consequences of a barren harvest.</P>
    <P>The reply given to that was: &ldquo;The Commissioners are preparing a detailed drainage scheme for the River Erne and its tributaries, including the Annalee River up as far as Ballanacargy Bridge.  In connection with the proposed drainage of the Dromore River the Commissioners intend to make a detailed survey of that river and they also propose to examine the Annalee River from Tullyvin to Ballanacargy Bridge.  The Commissioners have received the memorial referred to in the question but no petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, has been presented to them in respect of the length of river concerned, and, if a drainage scheme is desired, steps should be taken to have such a petition presented to the Cavan County Council without delay.  I may add that it would not be possible to start actual drainage works in the area for a long time.  The Land Commission is being asked for a report on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I think it is perfectly obvious to anyone hearing that reply that my question was not answered.  In fact it would appear as if it were never read. The question, I should explain, was addressed to the President not as the head of a department but as the head of the State.  The President passed it on.  I presume it went through the circumlocution office and, as far as I can see, it anchored in the wrong pigeon-hole, because it was eventually replied to by the Public Works Department. It has nothing to do with <Col N="1975" /> public works.  It was a question of the relief of farmers in the County Cavan from distress in consequence of the damage done by spring and early summer floods, but mainly due to the fact that in Northern Ireland there is an obstruction on the River Erne, the result of which is to leave farmers in the winter time along the River Erne and in the area of the River Annalee in a terribly anxious condition as to the saving of their crops.  But in this particular year during the summer the heavy floods have completely washed away the crops of the farmers in Belturbet area, Ballinacurry area, and beyond that.</P>
    <P>Relief grants have been voted by this House in winter periods for one thing or another.  I have no belief in these grants or in the manner in which they are administered.  But there is no question that in December or October next it will be perfectly obvious to the farmers of the County Cavan and the County Fermanagh that there are no crops and that distress will exist in the most acute form.  And there is no use waiting until October to find out what damage is done while to-day it is perfectly obvious to anyone that there is not going to be any harvest in this area.  May I say I highly approve of the methods adopted by the memorialists. They went through their farms to ascertain what the damage was.  They scheduled the damage done and they asked the Government to send down an inspector there and then.  They did not ask them to send down an inspector in December, when they would be in a position to say &ldquo;we had so many acres of potatoes, oats and meadow destroyed, but the evidence is not there.&rdquo;  The evidence is there to-day, and it is to-day that these memorialists ask the Government to send down an inspector to verify the figures that they have put before the Government.  As to the facts, it is for the Government to verify them.  As to how this matter originated, I would point out that so far as I am personally concerned I do not trouble the House much with questions. When I put down a question it is not to advertise myself but to try <Col N="1976" /> and have information gathered or action taken in a particular matter. This question that I put down, and which has been treated in this rather cavalier manner, was the result of two meetings.  Perhaps I might read part of the memorial sent up.  At a meeting held in Drung, Co. Cavan, the following resolution was passed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That we call upon the Government to take immediate action to relieve the farmers, who are in a deplorable condition by reason of the crops being ruined by the unprecedented rainfalls and floods, the like of which have never occurred before in living memory&mdash;oats, potatoes, mangolds, meadows, turf and grasslands&mdash;all useless in most places, after all the expense and labour that has been entailed. Heavy land that escaped flooding is sodden to such an extent that the crops are also ruined, and this dreadful deluge, following a succession of bad seasons, is bound to give the farmers a clean knock-out.  Accompanying the falls of rain has come the drop in produce prices&mdash; flax, pigs, butter and eggs, are almost not worth having.  Under these adverse circumstances people who are already overburdened cannot meet their present responsibilities. It is said that he who gives quickly gives twice, and never was immediate action more required, so we again call upon the Government to show good, sound diplomacy by extending the time limit of the payments of the annuities so that the people may tide over the present calamity.</P>
    <P>What I want to point out at this stage is that I do not blame the present Government to any great extent for the lack of proper drainage.  Unfortunately we are up against the situation in County Cavan that we are dealing with an area where the trouble is really created in Northern Ireland.  Some engineers hold that the obstruction is caused by the sluice gates at Belleek, and others hold that it is due to the narrow neck between Upper and Lower Lough Erne, and that a scheme to relieve the flooding would cost £800,000.  Whatever it would cost, £800 or £800,000, the fact <Col N="1977" /> remains that citizens of this State are suffering in consequence of the inattention of the Northern Government, or possibly because the Free State and the Northern Governments will not come together to relieve the nationals of both Governments from flooding in Lough Erne.  I do not want this question to be dealt with as a Departmental question.  It must be dealt with by the two Governments, and must not be used as a precedent for saying that otherwise everyone would be looking for compensation.  I quite admit that the whole responsibility is not on our Government.  They have some responsibility. Why do the Governments not come together and say: &ldquo;We are prepared to relieve the flooding and to spend a share in removing whatever obstruction there is in the River Erne in Northern Ireland so that our nationals would be relieved.&rdquo;  The question then would be what proportion should be borne by Northern Ireland and what proportion by the Free State?  It should be dealt with similarly to the way that the Free State Government deals with minor drainage schemes.  Whatever economic value there is in the drainage in the Free State and whatever relative economic value there is in Northern Ireland, in that proportion the two Governments should contribute.  Something must be done.</P>
    <P>The people in Belturbet area are subject to flooding every winter, and they are living in a constant state of despair, hoping against hope that the floods will not come in summer before they can save their crops.  They are up against that situation every year, but this year they cannot save the harvest because they have no crops to save. They are sailing in boats over the oat and potato fields.  The Government should have the district inspected, and not consider the question of giving relief work on roads.  Roads are not wanted.  The thing is to relieve the farmers now, and the Government has sufficient evidence if they send inspectors down to see the place.  I am not in the habit of putting down questions for the sake of talking, but I will read a letter that I received indicating the general temper of the people:</P>
    <P>(3)  Pledging themselves not to pay rent or rates until their demands <Col N="1979" /> were granted, and to stand by one another to defeat the attempt to seize their cattle.</P>
    <P>These men have signed a bond amongst themselves to stand by one another, so that it is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>(4)  Pledging themselves with the men of Fermanagh as a last resource, if their requests were not granted, to have the flood-gates at Belleek blown up, even though precious lives may be lost in the attempt.  We might as well die there as die of starvation at home.</P>
    <P>These men are not Bolshevists.  I know for thirty years the man who wrote the letter.  He is an honest and honourable man.  These are the type of men who are going to take the bit between their teeth.  These men are determined, if the farmers in County Fermanagh are content to lie down and allow the sluice gates at Belleek to be an obstruction between the Upper and Lower Lakes, because their Government will not take action, that they are not going to do so, and to let their land be flooded because a few yachtsmen in Enniskillen want the high-water level maintained for their amusement in the summer.  Every Government has attempted a solution of this flooding question on the Erne. It was attempted long before the Free State was set up.  Engineers differ about it.  Why?  In my opinion they have different opinions because they approach the subject in the way that two farmers would approach a drainage question.  One employs an engineer to say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and another employs an engineer to say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and the result is that the water is kept at the present level for the amusement of the yachtsmen of Enniskillen.  The thing to do is to go to the Northern Government and to insist on the water being let off, so that the people will not have to take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I do not want this question to be dealt with in a departmental way.  The memorial was addressed to the President of the State, and I do not want it brushed aside by a statement that it does not belong to a certain department.  I <Col N="1980" /> want the Minister for Finance, who is here as the head of the Board of Works, and as Vice-President of the State, speaking on behalf of the Government, to say what is going to be done in view of the terrible condition of affairs that exists in County Cavan.  I want the Vice-President to say what action this Government will take in co-operation with the Northern Government, so that there may be a permanent cure for this flooding.</P>
    <P>In order to show that my statement has not been exaggerated and to give some idea of the sufferings of the people in the Lough Erne area, I will read a statement from Mr. Michael Fitzpatrick, of Derravona, giving instances of tragedies and losses arising out of the floods:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In one case a man's potato crop was under water; he could do nothing to save it, and his body was found in the river next morning.</P>
    <P>Whether that was an accident, a matter of despair or suicide, I do not know.  Several cases of suicide occurred in the district.</P>
    <P>In harvest floods he saw two boys working hard but unavailingly to save their hay.  Subsequently one of them had to be taken to the mental hospital.  The other followed, and later died from shock.  When the next flood came, the first brother had to be taken away again.  In a third case, across the border, a fine young woman and her son had become confirmed invalids as a result of their terrible experiences while trying to save their crops from the floods.</P>
    <P>The House should bear in mind that these are what might be called annual floods.  I am asking the House now to deal with the exceptional summer flooding.  I do not want the House to take my word, but to have inspectors sent down to see the damage so that immediate action may be taken.  I do not care what source the funds are taken from.  It is a matter for the Government.  The trouble is due to the fact that the Northern Government is not doing its duty.  The people of the Free State are being flooded out, and it is the duty of the Free State <Col N="1981" /> Government to see that their people are not at a loss, and that the present state of affairs should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a similar question on the Order Paper last week and I got a reply from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance stating:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been informed of the Cavan County Council's agreement to the River Erne and Annalee proposed drainage district, and have instructed their engineer to prepare a detailed drainage scheme for submission to the votes of the occupiers of affected lands.  The preparation of this scheme will take some time, and it must then be exhibited locally for a month, to afford each rated occupier of affected land an opportunity to vote upon it.  Until the result of the voting on the scheme has been ascertained, it will not be known whether or not a public inquiry will be held because, if more than 50 per cent. of the occupiers dissent from the scheme, the Commissioners will take no further action in regard to it.  Accordingly it cannot be stated at present when, if at all, an inquiry will be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not want to press this question at the time, but I think it was a reasonable request on behalf of the farmers that the Government should send some one down to inspect the district.  I do not favour relief schemes in the winter because they are of no value.  They are of no value in a case like this.  What is wanted is some relief from the flooding.  The winter flooding is not as serious as flooding in the summer, which washes away the crops.  I was in this district last Tuesday evening and I saw acres of meadow there that could not be let owing to the floods.  If the district is flooded now, what will be the position in the winter?  If the Cavan County Council passes this drainage scheme we will be washed out altogether.  I got a letter to-day stating that Monaghan has agreed with Dromore on a drainage scheme. <Col N="1982" /> If Monaghan is going to let down the floods County Cavan will not be there at all.  Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the loss of crops, but I would refer to the plight of the residents.  I know residents who will not be able to leave their houses if something is not done. The water is washing up to their doors. In some cases they could sail from their kitchen doors to Bundoran. These people are paying drainage rates, and are entitled to some relief. Deputy O'Hanlon stated that the people have combined in order not to allow their cattle to be seized.  I can tell the Minister that there will be no cattle and no crops to be seized, and that there will be no necessity to bother about looking for annuities, unless the flooding is relieved.  I feel in duty bound to support these people in their demand that something should be done for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that this question should not have been answered merely as a drainage question and that there was some mistake made.  I have seen the memorial that was sent to the President but I do not know whether there was an attachment to it that did not reach me.  The memorial contained only the extracts that the Deputy read out. There were no great details in the memorial itself.  Roughly the position of the Government is that we do not and cannot accept responsibility for losses through floods.  The only responsibility we can take in connection with flooding is that if an economic drainage scheme can be carried out it ought to be carried out, and if there is a drainage scheme that is not even economic but that will give some return for the money put into it, it should be done.  In many cases we have given large grants towards drainage schemes that were far from economic but we carried them out having regard to the effect on the people and the employment they gave. That has been the policy.  We are very anxious that the drainage scheme of the Erne should be dealt with.  It is a matter for agreement and so far as we are concerned everything will be done to get agreement so that the scheme may be carried out if on examination <Col N="1983" /> it is a scheme that would justify carrying out.  There are many cases where people desire flooding to be eliminated where the improvement on the land would not, perhaps, represent two per cent of the work. There are cases where we must say flooding must continue, but I do not assume that that is the case in the Erne, because I believe it would be possible to have a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a scheme already drafted by Cavan County Council to deal with the Erne involving an expenditure of £66,000?  Is the Minister satisfied that that £66,000 when spent is going to bring any relief to the County Cavan?  There will still be the difficulty with County Fermanagh</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are not satisfied that there would be an improvement we ought certainly not carry it out.  I presume there is complete satisfaction that there will be an improvement. Otherwise the scheme will not be proceeded with at all.  It must be borne in mind, and Deputy Cole referred to it, that if one drainage scheme is carried out damage is liable to be done elsewhere.  That is the reason why great care should be taken.  Certainly we cannot carry out any drainage schemes that involve work in Northern Ireland except with the consent of the Northern Government.  I know that in respect to this drainage scheme negotiations have been carried on.  If any scheme cannot be carried out that would be a proper scheme it will not be our fault.  We accept no responsibility for losses through flooding.  Our only responsibility is to carry out a drainage scheme, if it can be carried out, and if there is an appreciable return for the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have another responsibility.  If there is very grave distress in an area, <Col N="1984" /> and if it is widespread, the Government has to consider whether it is necessary to come to the relief of the people or not.  What the losses are is not very vital to the issue.  We cannot take responsibility for the act of God. The Government cannot compensate people in respect to losses from flooding. It would be really a question of the extent and degree of distress, and what could be done if it proved necessary to put some money into the people's pockets.  I do not think we can ever take the line that we are going to pay people for crops lost through an act of God.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that drastic action might be taken&mdash; although I hope not&mdash;and that there might be very considerable loss of life between Belleek and Ballyshannon if the sluice gates were blown up.  That is not an empty threat.  There are two sets of farmers ready to do it, both with grievances against their Governments. The responsibility is there, as Belleek and Ballyshannon are in the Free State.</P>
