      <NameTxt>The President (for the Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the establishment of a separate Customs régime between this country and Great Britain, the company mentioned have prepared, at Holyhead, the Customs entries for goods not liable to duty in this country imported by their steamers. The entries for dutiable goods to be delivered out of Customs control on arrival have been prepared at the place of importation in this country. This practice still obtains.  There is no power under existing law to compel the company to prepare all entries at the Saorstát place of importation, and I am of opinion that it would not be in the interests of the importers to seek powers to so compel the company.</P>

      <P>The President has not given any indication as to when he proposes to allow Private Members' Business to be taken.  The session is running through, and there are a number of motions and Private Members' Bills on the Order Paper that we want dealt with.  No Private Members' Business has been taken this session. There is one Bill here in particular in the name of Deputy Briscoe.  If it does <Col N="2232" /> not go through this session it will mean that it will be impossible to get poor relief distributed in the City of Dublin during the holiday period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained early in the session that during the period when the Estimates and the Finance Bill would be under consideration I proposed to take Private Members' time.  With regard to the question that Deputy Aiken has raised about Deputy Briscoe's Bill, I am in consultation with the Minister for Local Government on that point.  I am not yet in a position to make an announcement about it, but I hope to be able to do so within a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the reason given by the President is good enough to warrant him refusing to allow Private Members' time.  I doubt if he has the right to refuse to give Deputy Briscoe leave to introduce this Bill. There is a fairly general idea in the minds of Deputies as to what the Bill is likely to contain.  Surely it is unprecedented on the part of the Government to refuse to allow the Bill to be printed and let Deputies see what is contained in it.  I would encourage Deputy Briscoe to press for his right in this matter.  As regards the President taking Private Members' time, I also want to enter a protest.  At least time should be allowed for the motion by Deputy Anthony.</P>
      <P>I believe that if Deputy Briscoe inquired from the legal members of his Party he would find good reasons for pressing for the introduction of the Bill, so that Deputies might know what is contained in it.</P>

      <P>The President, if he is in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, must know that the Bill does not contain anything of a contentious nature.  It only proposes to increase the number of members on the Dublin Union Committee. In view of the President's promise to give it consideration, and his not <Col N="2233" /> giving time for it, I must ask for a division as to whether it shall be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing up two things, and so is Deputy Davin.  Deputy Davin, I presume has not counted the number of estimates to be considered yet.  It is a pretty formidable list&mdash;34 estimates. As to the point mentioned by Deputy Briscoe, it does not follow that the presentation of his Bill will solve the question that requires to be solved. The question really is the best method of solving it.  I presume it is a solution of the question he requires, and not so much his Bill.</P>

      <P>Apart from the question of Deputy Briscoe's right to introduce <Col N="2234" /> the Bill, which has been denied to him by the action of the Government, there is also the question whether Private Members are entitled to their time or not.  From the beginning of this session the Government have taken Private Members' time on every Parliamentary day on which time is supposed to be allocated to Private Members, and taken it, I believe, without any valid reason.  The Estimates were considered last year and the year before and Private Members' time was made available for Deputies. The Government have taken up a rather extraordinary attitude during this session.  Not one day have they given to Private Members since the session opened.  I certainly think that the issue ought to be definitely fought out as to whether Private Members are entitled to this time or not and whether the Government are entitled to take it without offering any valid reason for so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that the President has already given facilities for the introduction of a Private Member's Bill dealing with the licensing of auctioneers.  Does he consider that that is more important than making proper provision for the payment of poor relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to debate this particular point much longer, but possibly as the debate on this amendment progresses and as the various points at issue have had time to be digested over the week-end there may be some room for compromise as between the two distinct views held. I was wondering if the Minister and Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly would consider some way out of the deadlock by allowing some margin of discretion to the Committee of Reference. It is agreed that 50 per cent. be given to the charitable hospitals. It is desirable to give the other 50 per cent., if necessary, to the county hospitals, but as it has been suggested that this may be too much, why not compromise by giving 50 per cent. to the voluntary hospitals, 25 per cent. to the county hospitals and leave the other 25 per cent. to the discretion of the Committee of Reference? If they find the county hospitals can absorb more than 25 per cent. without any danger to themselves or the ratepayers, the Committee of Reference would have discretion.  Another reason why I would like to see 25 per cent. kept from the voluntary hospitals is that it might be found possible to introduce into this country a radium institution.  We have no place where radium treatment can be given, and it might be possible to establish a centre where radium treatment could be availed of by all hospitals.  I am informed that the total amount of emanation of radium in the country is only valued at £5,000, and that it is held by the R.D.S.  Members will know that where a person is sent for radium treatment to London, he has to undergo an expenditure of at least £20 per week.  I am only suggesting this so that the country will get the best out of the money accruing to it out of the sweepstakes.  It has been <Col N="2241" /> suggested to me that if we did start radium treatment, we might be able to benefit from the Rockefeller foundation.</P>
      <P>Another thing I want to introduce is the advisability of giving this Committee of Reference some power over this 25 per cent. in dispute.  It has been suggested that mental hospitals should get certain help from the money.  Perhaps they would consider installing a state pathologist to develop research work in mental cases.</P>
      <P>Last Friday I mentioned that Connacht was badly served in the way of hospitals.  The nearest large hospital would be Limerick or Waterford. Since Friday I made inquiries and found that Connacht is badly in need of a fever hospital.  I am told that typhus is rampant and that people find it hard to get nurses or doctors in view of the tremendous number of deaths of nurses and doctors in that area.  People here from Connacht will know the situation.  If that is the case it is one of the strongest arguments in favour of granting a full 50 per cent. to the county hospitals, because they would require tremendous expenditure to bring hospitals up to the requirements. I am only putting forward these suggestions in the hope that there will be some means found to make the best use of the money obtained from the sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the voluntary hospitals to argue that they must get a full 75 per cent. and leave it at that. I would suggest that Deputy Sir James Craig would be satisfied, as he is the moving spirit in this matter, with 50 per cent. for the voluntary hospitals and that 25 per cent. should go to the county hospitals.  The Committee of Reference should have discretion for the spending of the other 25 per cent.  All hospitals, including the county hospitals, would be very pleased to see the setting up of a radium centre in the Free State.  I understand it is of urgent necessity. I hope the views that are held here will meet the difficulties and that we will develop something which will be of absolute benefit to the whole community and not to one place.  There is a good deal to be said in favour of <Col N="2242" /> giving a great deal to the voluntary hospitals, but there is an equal amount to be said in favour of the other argument. Possibly if the two sides give the Committee of Reference some powers, which they would not have otherwise, we might find that benefits will come.</P>

      <P>Before the House decides this matter I think it would be well to realise what the proposal means.  If this amendment is accepted it will not mean that the voluntary Dublin hospitals at present in the sweepstakes will receive 50 per cent. of the entire sum allotted for hospitals. On the basis of division in the Derby Sweep the Dublin hospitals received 69 per cent., and the county hospitals 31 per cent.  If the amendment is carried, the voluntary hospitals in Dublin, that all the agitation is about, will receive 68 or 69 per cent. of fifty per cent., or, roughly, 34 or 35 per cent., and the county hospitals 31 per cent. or about 15 per cent. of the money available for distribution.  I am as keen as any Deputy on the counties receiving their due proportion of any benefit that will accrue from the sweepstakes, but I think that we have to be just in the matter.  Everyone will admit that the hospitals in the three great centres, Dublin, Cork and Limerick, serve very large areas in the country.  I should say that the Dublin hospitals especially serve patients from a hundred miles area, as a large number of country patients are treated there.  In like manner, the Cork hospitals serve a large area in the Southern province, while Limerick serves Limerick.  Tipperary and Clare.  The case of the counties is to a very large extent met by what I call the proprietary hospitals in these large centres.  Assuming that the next sweep is as big as the sweep on the Derby&mdash;and I certainly think it will be&mdash;proceeding on the present distribution, the counties would have an average income of about £21,000, and probably more.  To anyone looking back twelve or fifteen months that would seem impossible.  A very large sum, £20,000 annually, will go for a number of years to the counties in aid of the hospitals.  The sweepstakes have been such a huge and phenomenal <Col N="2243" /> success that we should not quarrel amongest ourselves about the division of the spoils.  As one Deputy stated, it would be very unwise to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, the needs of the county hospitals in the way of equipment and if you like in building the necessary adjuncts will be fully met from the proceeds of the Sweep dealt with in this amending Bill.  Except the proposal is to come to the relief of the rates&mdash;and I think every Deputy is agreed that we should not do that&mdash;by sweepstakes, we have quite enough money to provide for all the needs of the county hospitals.  Deputies should remember the position if the fifty per cent. proposed in the amendment is carried.  It will mean definitely that the Dublin hospitals will not receive fifty per cent. of the proceeds but 68 per cent. or 69 per cent. of fifty per cent. which on a calculation is about 34 per cent.  It has been stated in the course of the debate that as a result of the Sweepstake voluntary contributions will fall off or will not be renewed to the extent that they were given in the past. I am imbued with that fear.  I think there is grave danger that subscriptions which were hitherto forthcoming for voluntary hospitals will not be forthcoming, at least to such an extent.  It will be incumbent on all the great hospitals to build up such reserves as will supply the loss of income owing to the loss of these subscriptions.  That is a point that should not be forgotten.  The county hospitals will not be in that position. If we get the hospitals fully equipped we will be safe in future as an income will be provided for them. Until we definitely make up our minds that the State through sweepstakes should come to the aid of the hospitals I think the 25 per cent. limit proposed by the Minister would meet all the needs of county hospitals.  I may make one suggestion&mdash;I do not know how it will be received&mdash;that as the voluntary hospitals in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford have already received very large sums through these sweeps, it might be possible to provide some amendment whereby those boroughs would be excluded from any <Col N="2244" /> further participation in the sweeps. Something like that might be put into the Bill.  I do not think these places want any more than they got for the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Something like that might be put in. I do not know how the suggestion will be received, but a little concession might be afforded by the Minister.  There is only one part of the country for which a real case could be made.  That is Connemara.  It is not proper, I suppose, for any Deputy to say that his own province has been well treated, but I must say that my province has been well treated both by voluntary contributions and the amount at the command of the Minister to help the hospitals.  Connacht is not so well situated as the other provinces.  It is mostly at a great distance from any of the big centres where there are large hospitals.  There may be some way by which a little help could be given to that province, perhaps in the way of setting up a big central hospital in Galway.  I have not heard that suggestion made by any of our western Deputies and it is merely a suggestion of my own.  I think that the twenty-five per cent. offered by the Minister should be accepted.  For myself, I thought that at the beginning he was rather generous but, so far as I can prophesy, I think that the amount will meet the needs of all the hospitals in the south if the sweeps last for the next four years, as I confidently hope they will with increasing measure of success.</P>

      <P>The original intention in the first Bill was to help hospitals which rendered service to the poor. When Deputy Bennett speaks of Dublin hospitals as serving a radius of 100 miles he gets away from the Bill.  A Dublin hospital does serve a radius of 100 miles but it serves the patient who can pay three, four or seven guineas a week and also a fee for an operation. It does not, however, serve the poor. It serves the poor of Dublin all right, but the poor within a hundred miles radius are dealt with by the county hospitals, and if they cannot deal with such cases they are sent to Dublin and the boards of health have to pay from <Col N="2245" /> two to three guineas a week per case. Any of the poor who come to Dublin hospitals are paid for.  Perhaps there may be special treatment, but they are paid for and they are not treated in free beds.  The Bill applies to hospitals which have a certain number of free beds.  Anyone conversant with the state of things in the counties knows that in the county hospitals there is overcrowding and that every week patients have to be turned away.  I have spoken to the local surgeon in Mullingar, to the surgeon in the infirmary, and I know that patients week after week have to be turned away owing to lack of accommodation.</P>
      <P>A statement was made here last Friday to the effect that £5,000 would meet the needs of the county hospitals. A maternity ward is needed in the county hospital at Mullingar, for which the estimate is £10,000.  An up-to-date sewerage system is needed, and the estimate is £3,000.  A sanatorium is needed, the estimate for which is £15,000.  There is also needed a new operating theatre.  We could find means of expending from £30,000 to £40,000 at present.  We are undertaking a sewerage scheme and the building of a new operating theatre, and we have installed a modern x-ray plant. We have, however, to go slowly.  We cannot undertake the building of a new maternity ward nor the building of a new wing to the hospital, because our borrowings at present for hospital needs are more than the county can afford.  Taking what we need, we could absorb £20,000 or £30,000 immediately from the sweep.  Consequently the statement that £5,000 would meet the needs of all the county hospitals is absurd.</P>

      <P>In the matter of hospitals I think that the policy of the Local Government Ministry has been one of decentralisation.  I quite agree with that.  I would like to see in every county hospital a resident surgeon, and I do not see why there should not be one.  If that is the policy, there should be more money provided in the amending Bill for county hospitals.  There should be money provided to bring these hospitals up to date and up to the standard of the Dublin institutions. The case of Connacht has been cited, but the same case can be cited for every county.  As I have indicated, the basis of this Bill and also of the previous <Col N="2247" /> one was the provision of money for hospitals which are giving accommodation to the poor.  The poor are primarily treated in the county hospitals. Consequently the amendment that fifty per cent. be made available for county hospitals should be accepted by the House.  County Deputies especially should vote for it.  I do not think it is a Party measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that when two Private Bills were introduced by Deputy O'Dowd and myself, the only questions at issue were, firstly, if a sum would be allocated to the county hospitals; and secondly, if a sum would be allocated, what would be the amount?  Arising out of these two Bills, the Government undertook to make the matter the subject of a Government measure and we agreed to withdraw our Bills on the proposition that the county hospitals would get 25 per cent.  A good deal has been said about the Dublin hospitals and their functions.  I would remind the House that the Dublin hospitals are not only Dublin hospitals, but are national hospitals.  The clinical work of these hospitals is very important if the future members of the medical profession are to get a decent education. The county hospital is a very excellent institution in its way, but we must bear in mind that it is a one-man hospital.  While that man does very important work, he cannot specialise in ten or twelve different departments of treatment.  I do not see how you can ever develop a county hospital on the basis on which you could develop a city hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some hospitals specially mentioned in the Bill, such as Peamount and Cappagh.  We know they undertake the treatment of tuberculosis, but they have, so far as accommodation goes, only touched the fringe of it and they do it on a national basis.  They receive patients from all parts of the country.  These hospitals, for their full development, would easily take between them one-quarter million of money.  I think it would be a very much better national proposition to develop these two hospitals <Col N="2248" /> and develop them on the big basis, with which, I am sure, Deputies are familiar, in so far as their initial attempts have gone, than to establish sanatoria in the different counties throughout Ireland.  It must also be borne in mind that a good deal of the sweep money under the past arrangement and under this arrangement will go to the provinces.  It will go to Cork, it will go to Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  I think it would be much better to try out as much provincial development as we can instead of frittering away our efforts on a county basis.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Dublin hospitals do not treat the poor.  Latterly, of course, the Dublin hospitals were in a state of bankruptcy and they had to cut down the number of free beds.  They now charge £2 2s. 0d. per week to the county boards of health for the treatment of each patient in Dublin, for very special operations, and sometimes also for special treatment. That only meets a very small fraction of the cost to the hospitals. The boards of health get it for the nominal sum of £2 per week, and I think it should not be charged against the Dublin hospitals that that is in any sense profiteering.  The Minister spoke of the different sums that went to the provinces.  I would ask Deputies on all sides of the House to treat this more on a national and provincial basis than on a county basis.  I know it will appeal to some county Deputies to carry home as big a slice of the spoils as they can.  That, however, is not for the good of the country or for the good of the poor of the country, because, as I had said, you must develop the system on big lines, and you will not develop it in that way on county lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this has been left to an open vote of the House.  I intend to make an appeal to country Deputies to support, by their votes, the amendment of Deputy O'Kelly that 50 per cent. should be allotted to the county hospitals. Deputy Dr. Hennessy made an appeal that the question should be looked upon in a larger way, that we should consider the Dublin hospitals <Col N="2249" /> as the national hospitals and forget the county hospitals and our duties to our constituents in these counties.  I would like to say a word as to the position of the county hospitals, especially that in my own constituency, which has developed considerably in the last few years.  The hospital we have in Galway is no longer a county hospital in the ordinary sense of that term.  It is a provincial hospital.  We have patients coming there from Clare, Mayo and Roscommon, and it has now taken the place that the hospitals in Dublin formerly occupied, as far as these patients are concerned.  Apart from the fact that we have patients from other counties, we are now in the position that practically all cases are treated in the county hospital.  I remember when I started to practise in 1919 and 1920, the most serious cases had to be sent to Dublin.  Nothing except acute abdominal work or urgent operations were performed in Galway at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a list within the last few days showing the number of operations carried out there in the past year.  I find that the number of major operations done in the Central Hospital was 1.100.  The position now is that the Central Hospital in Galway is doing the work formerly done for the country patients by the Dublin hospitals. We have a general surgical and medical hospital, a fever hospital and a maternity hospital combined.  It is the largest hospital, of course, in Connacht. It is also the clinical centre for Galway University Medical School. The point was made by Deputy Dr. Hennessy that the hospitals in Dublin are utilised for the training of the future medical practitioners of the country.  The Galway hospital now does that work for the Galway Medical School.  The staff includes three surgeons, two physicians, a pathologist, a gynaecologist and obstetrician, an eye and ear surgeon, and a house physician. An immense amount of money has been spent on perfecting this hospital. I have here also a list of the voluntary contributions made to the hospital for the last few years.  Picking out some at random&mdash;in 1925 the amount was £1,096, in 1924 it was £808, and in 1930, £33.  They utilised <Col N="2250" /> these contributions in installing x-ray plant, a pathological department, and other necessaries for a modern hospital.</P>
    <P>This hospital of which I am speaking applied to the Hospitals Committee to be admitted amongst the voluntary hospitals which will be getting three-fourths and which up to this were getting the total amount of the money available.  As far as I can hear, they have been refused admission into the scheme.  To-day a sheet of paper was handed to me, signed by the Treasurer of the Associated Hospitals Committee. It contains a number of arguments as to why the money should not be devoted in any other ratio than 25 per cent. for the country hospitals, and the remainder for Dublin hospitals.  The first reason they give is that the city hospitals are national institutions, that they cater for the sick poor from every county and district in the Saorstát. That is no use as far as Connacht is concerned.  We in Connacht are very badly treated under this scheme.  Cork, Limerick and Waterford have got their share, but the Cinderella province, Connacht, as usual, has been completely left out.  The first statement, &ldquo;that the hospitals we represent are national institutions which cater for the sick poor of every county in the Saorstát,&rdquo; is not true as far as Connacht is concerned.  The next statement is &ldquo;that these national hospitals, not having the security of the rates behind them, require to be endowed, in whole or in part, owing to inevitable loss of public subscriptions.&rdquo;  With that also I cannot agree.  Any patients who are now sent to Dublin from country districts are paid for at the rate of £2 per week, the same rate at which they are paid for in the Central Hospital at Galway or any other hospital. I cannot agree that the Dublin hospitals are doing anything for the country people for nothing.  Anybody who is aware of the conditions in the hospitals here knows that if a poor person in the West of Ireland requires treatment he must be paid for by the board of health; he will not be accepted free of charge in a city hospital. The city hospitals get a big number of paying patients.  I have even heard it said that they know how to charge fairly well.  The third reason <Col N="2251" /> given is &ldquo;that the moneys received and to be received from the sweepstakes will not be more than sufficient to carry out our proposals.&rdquo;  I believe that the hospitals in Dublin are now in a position&mdash;and they certainly will be in a better position by the time the last of the sweepstakes is over&mdash;to carry out any proposals that they may have had in mind.  When this sweepstake was originated, as Deputy Sir James Craig knows, it was never thought or dreamt of by any of these hospitals that they would get as much money as they have now got.  To say that the money they will receive from nine sweepstakes will not be sufficient to carry out their proposals is simply stating something that is not correct. They have more money than ever they thought they would get, and whatever proposals they originally had when they started with the sweepstakes, I am sure, have already been carried out, or they have already sufficient money on hands to carry them through. The fourth reason given against our proposal is &ldquo;that the reduction of the percentage to be received by the national voluntary hospitals to fifty per cent. will not be at all adequate to provide any reasonable endowments for these hospitals, whereas the sum represented by 50 per cent. of the Hospitals Fund will be largely in excess of what the county hospitals can possibly require.&rdquo; The people who presented this document evidently have very little knowledge of the country districts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>They know absolutely nothing about conditions in the ordinary county hospitals, and they know very little of the expense that has already been incurred in Galway to make their hospital a fit and modern institution.  I entirely disagree with every statement made by the Associated Hospitals Committee in this circular which was issued to me to-day.  Their final statement in favour of the Dublin hospitals is: &ldquo;It must be borne in mind that most of our large hospitals are teaching institutions which educate the entire medical and nursing professions of the Saorstát. No such claim can be made for county hospitals.&rdquo;  That is not correct.  In the <Col N="2252" /> West of Ireland we have a medical school and university and a hospital that is doing the work that those people claim they are doing for all Ireland. It is not correct to say that they are not doing it as well as the Dublin hospitals are doing it for their own students.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hennessy said that the county hospital is a one-man hospital. That should not be so.  That is one of the reasons why we ask that fifty per cent. be allocated for the county hospitals, to enable them to cater for the sick poor and for people who are not wealthy enough to come to Dublin.  It is not correct to say that one man can attend to all these people.  It shows a very bad state of affairs in the different counties if that is the position.  I know that in the county adjoining ours there is only one man acting as physician and surgeon to the whole county in the hospital.  I do not see how that man could do eye and ear work, the work of a gynaecologist, and all the other work that has to be done in a modern hospital.</P>
    <P>The only Deputy who spoke against this proposal so far was Deputy Sir James Craig.  I must say that I disagree with every word of what Deputy Sir James Craig said.  Deputy Sir James Craig's statement would lead one to believe that he is out of touch with the conditions prevailing in county hospitals and with what county hospitals have to do.  The Deputy said that he would like to see the provision of a small operating theatre.  Of what use would a small operating theatre be in a county where there have been 1,100 major operations in one year? Even if there were only 300 operations to be performed a small operating theatre would not be sufficient.  At present we have two and they are not sufficient.  £5,000 would not go a long way towards the provision of these, because £40,000 has not already done very much.  How could it be expected that £5,000 would do for a country hospital what £50,000 is required for for a city hospital?  It is not that the numbers of patients are not the same.  Why should the people in the West of Ireland have to depend on a grant of £5,000 when other people who can <Col N="2253" /> afford to pay their way are not satisfied with £50,000?  &ldquo;A man must be trained specially in the use of the x-ray instruments.&rdquo;  We have an x-ray specialist, but in that connection, even with our modern equipment, in hospitals in Galway there have been three or four cases recently of superficial cancer where patients died for want of treatment.  These were people who refused to come to Dublin for one reason or another.  We want as up-to-date apparatus as any hospital in the city. After all there is a lot of duplication in the Dublin hospitals.  You may have in one hospital, say, a certain x-ray plant which may be a very expensive one.  It may be for diagnostic purposes alone or for deep therapy.  You may have similar plant in other hospitals, when perhaps two would be sufficient. I believe that when this money comes into the different hospitals every one of the hospitals will equip themselves and you will have duplication. The money can be applied to the purchasing of ten, fifteen or twenty very expensive x-ray and therapeutical plants in the city, while the hospitals in the West of Ireland will be without these facilities.  If it requires £10,000 or £15,000 to instal a perfectly modern x-ray plant, and, if it can be done here in four or five hospitals, I claim and I hope the country Deputies will support me, that in each county or two or three counties combined, the same plant should be installed.</P>
    <P>So far, Deputy Sir James Craig appears to have been the only Deputy to have spoken against this amendment. I imagine from his speech that he does not understand the conditions that we have to put up with in the country, or that he does not understand the difficulty there is, at times, in sending patients to Dublin for treatment, a thing that should not, now, be necessary in the case of what is very often a very commonplace thing.  It should not be necessary to send those people up to Dublin at very great expense, when the work might be equally well done in the different county hospitals.  I know that Deputy Hogan has referred to the metropolitan mind, and I would like to disabuse, if I possibly could, a number of the Dublin Deputies of <Col N="2254" /> the idea that nothing can be done outside of Dublin.  This metropolitan outlook is very well developed in the mind of Deputy Sir James Craig.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister in case this money is increased from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. to see that the different counties benefit in proportion to the amount of work they are prepared to do themselves.  The Minister for Local Government will have the distribution of this grant, and in certain counties where nothing has been done, the case can now be made that they are entitled to a bigger share of the money than those counties who have, at great expense, erected hospitals, and gone to great expense in providing a staff, and in maintaining them.  I think it would be very advisable for the Minister to see that each county gets its share of the grant in proportion to the amount of work already done, and the amount of money already expended in that county.</P>

      <P>I think I could make the same sympathetic appeal on behalf of the county hospitals as has been made by any ordinary member of the House. I agree with everything that Deputy Tubridy has said, especially in so far as he is anxious to make it possible for the Minister to make better provision for county hospitals and thereby make it possible to have a larger number of major operations <Col N="2255" /> carried out in these hospitals and so to prevent, what I would like to prevent, the necessity for people to come here to the hospitals in the City of Dublin from distant parts of the country.  I would like to save people from the necessity of such journeys unless where it was absolutely unavoidable.  I served on the original Committee that was set up by the House to deal with the original Bill, with Deputies O'Kelly, O'Dowd, Moore, and other members of this House.  I would not like to say how amazed everyone of us was at the success of the sweepstakes.  They have succeeded in providing revenue to an extent never anticipated by the most optimistic members of that Committee.  I do not think that Deputy Sir James Craig would have dreamed that a sum of £786,000 would have been realised by any sweepstake, much less that we should have received, as we have received, £2,786,000 in the last sweepstake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was the desire of all of us who served on that Committee and of every member of the House who supported the original Bill, that this thing should be looked at rather from the national point of view than from the city or local point of view.  I do not like the suggestion made by Deputy Kennedy, though he has made a very moving appeal on behalf of the county hospitals.  He said he would be willing to go back to the 25 per cent. allocation after the county hospitals had received a 50 per cent. share, as is suggested in this amendment, out of the next two sweeps.  I would prefer to receive a certain stipulated revenue from the sweep until the necessary work was done rather than change from one sweep to another.  I seriously suggest to Deputy O'Kelly to agree to this thing rather than have a division.  The figure might be altered, if the Minister would agree, from three-fourths to two-thirds and thereby allow a better margin than is at present provided or than is in the present Bill for hospitals outside Dublin.  I hope Deputy O'Kelly will look at that suggestion in a favourable and sympathetic light rather than risk putting it to a division <Col N="2256" /> and losing what he is anxious to get.  It might be possible, by agreement, to get one-third rather than 25 per cent. that is now provided for. I would also like if Deputy Sir James Craig would see my point of view and adopt that suggestion.  After all, Deputy Sir James Craig has been mainly responsible for this matter, for it was he who took the original responsibility in introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, as Deputy Dr. Tubridy knows, it is necessary, by reason of local circumstances, to send patients from the country to Dublin hospitals.  That is because they cannot be properly treated in the county hospitals.  If the county hospitals get better and more favourable treatment under this Bill, or under this amendment, I am hoping that it will be possible to prevent a large number of country patients who have been coming to the city hospitals up to the present, and a good many of whom have been paid for out of the local rates, from being forced in the future to come up to those hospitals.  That is the only purpose I have in suggesting to Deputy O'Kelly that he might, provided the Minister is agreeable, leave the figure at two-thirds instead of at three-fourths, as in the Bill.  If the Deputy agrees to that, the result will be that in future sweepstakes the county hospitals will benefit to this extent.</P>

      <P>I think every one on all sides of the House sympathises with the position of the hospitals, whether situated in the city of Dublin or in the country, when they find themselves in financial difficulties and hard up for finance to carry on.  Hospitals are not anxious so much for the money as to be placed in a position that will enable them to do the best for their patients. I do not think, however, that the future of any hospital, either in the city or in the country is being well served by trying to make this matter <Col N="2257" /> an issue as between the city and the country.  Hospitals and hospitalisation in all countries are viewed from a national angle as national institutions. An appeal repeated here several times to country members to vote for a certain thing on account of geographic conditions is certainly not viewing the thing in the spirit that Deputies should view it in, and more particularly medical Deputies.</P>
      <P>In this debate, as far as I have followed it, the main distinction between the county hospitals and the city hospitals, seems to be the fact that one set of hospitals, namely, the city hospitals, are supported by voluntary contributions, freely given by the charitable public, and that the other hospitals, the county hospitals, are really semi-State institutions in so far as they are supported and assisted by the rates; also the fact that the whole position with regard to sweepstakes was brought about by the case made for the voluntary hospitals.  At that time there was no case made for, or no mention or suggestion made of county hospitals in the matter.  In fact, some people who most deplored the initiation of sweepstakes are most anxious to share in the sweepstakes now, when the donkey work has been done by the city hospitals. The particular case made at that time was that these were hospitals supported entirely by voluntary contributions, and on that basis the sweepstakes were initiated.  Later on, a case was advanced for the county hospitals.  I want to urge the point that this was a dish really prepared in order to nurse the voluntary hospitals back to convalescence, and now the county hospitals are anxious to eat out of that dish.  In a broad-spirited way, the people interested in them said they would give one-quarter to the county hospitals.  At the time that appeared to be agreed upon.  Now there is a demand coming in for the quarter to be made one-half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tubridy gave us a picture of Galway county hospital and told us that there were something like 1,100 major operations per annum performed there.  That is a very big number of operations, and I take it <Col N="2258" /> that it is a fair average for a year's work in Galway county hospital.  If that is the average number of major operations per year in Galway county hospital, then that hospital should get some very special consideration.  But that is not the average for the county hospitals.  There is no hospital in any other county that would do 1,100 major operations in six years, and the case for the county hospitals generally should not be confused by the Deputy's presentation of the case for Galway hospital.  That hospital stands out distinct and separate from any or all of the other county hospitals.  It is a bigger institution and it carries a much bigger staff.  The Deputy told us that it has four operating theatres and the volume of work handled, as deduced from the number of major operations, seems to be considerably more than that of any of the City of Dublin hospitals.  In that way it must be taken not as a sample of the Dublin hospitals, but rather as a peculiar situation to be dealt with specially and to be set aside from the others.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice pointed out that in the course of the next nine sweepstakes there should be, in the ordinary course of events, £1,000,000 available for distribution amongst the county hospitals.  Deputy Kennedy appeared to disagree with that.  He wanted all his share at once.  I could not exactly see his point.  He disagreed with the figure given by the Minister and he said that they would require £30,000 in his county.  The Minister pointed out that in the ordinary course of events they would get that £30,000 and considerably more. The Deputy's attitude was that we had passed the high-water mark with regard to sweepstakes.  It is extremely difficult to argue with a prophet.  The only way you can argue with a prophet is to take the ordinary signs, figures and facts as they appear to everybody. I think it will be generally admitted that the indicator with regard to sweepstakes is set in an upward direction. That has been our experience so far.  The reports with regard to the next sweepstakes would indicate a yet bigger sum than has been realised by any sweepstake so far.  If signs and <Col N="2259" /> figures mean anything, in the next nine sweepstakes the figure mentioned by the Minister should be considerably exceeded. The very minute that we get a contribution for any county hospital that exceeds the amount necessary for extra medical equipment or extra scientific equipment we are on very thin ice; we have reached the point where we utilise sweepstakes in aid of rates.  If Deputy Kennedy or somebody else brings along a Bill when this period of sweepstakes is over to use them openly and honestly for the relief of rates I will not say that I will not find myself in the same Division Lobby.  But let us call a spade a spade.  At present we are more or less shy of bringing sweepstakes to the assistance either of rates or of taxes. As long as that is the position, we should not endeavour to do it under another label, under the label of hospitals. If a certain county gets £30,000 or £40,000 out of these sweepstakes I venture to predict that there will be a considerable reduction of the rates in that particular county; in other words, that the £30,000 or £40,000 would not go towards the benefit of patients to the same extent as it would go in the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration.  The cities of Dublin, Cork, etc., are paying rates.  They are running the poor law hospitals just the same as any county. In addition to that, out of their charity they are supporting so many voluntary hospitals.  The people in most of our counties, through the rates, are supporting the county hospitals, but they are not supporting any voluntary hospitals. The claim put forward by them is that they should get exactly the same out of this machine for the aid of county hospitals as those who do in fact support voluntary hospitals.  I do not think that case can be genuinely upheld.  We are told that there should ordinarily be £1,000,000 available for the county hospitals out of the next nine sweepstakes.  If that figure is realised I think that every county hospital would be very well and very adequately put on its feet.  If more money was available you probably could use it in a very beneficial manner, but we <Col N="2260" /> must not forget that these sweepstakes were instituted to go to the assistance of the voluntary hospitals when they were on the verge of bankruptcy, when they were nearing the point that they would have to close their doors, and that the position so far is that the voluntary hospitals have merely been pulled out of debt.  There is a little bit of money left, but there is a danger of the voluntary contributions falling considerably as a result of the sweepstakes. The voluntary hospitals have to be put more or less firmly on their feet before there is any surplus to be divided generally over the country. The offer of 25 per cent. is a very good offer, and it is an offer which I believe would be welcomed in nine out of every ten counties.  It has provided an opportunity that twelve months ago nobody ever thought would arise.  The sum of something like £30,000 or £40,000 going to the ordinary county hospitals is equivalent to a sum certainly eight times as great going to the city hospital.</P>
    <P>The city hospital has a multitude of departments dealing with a great variety of specialist cases.  Only, at most, one-sixth of an hospital can be regarded as a general hospital.  The expenses are far higher and the cost for staff and equipment is far heavier. I would like more or less to refute the suggestion that our city hospitals are not catering for country cases.  Deputy Kennedy started off by telling us that the Dublin hospitals were not catering for the country or for the poor of the country, and in the next breath he proceeded to demonstrate the fact that they were dealing with the poor of the country.  The question is not a financial, it is a medical question whether the poor of the country are or are not being treated in the Dublin hospitals. The Deputy, having first said that they were not so treated, proceeded then to tell us that they were so treated at the cost of £2 per week.  It was not a question of figures, but a question of facts.  It was a question of what class the City of Dublin hospitals were catering for, what class of patients they were treating, and what class of patients were getting into them. Deputy Sir James Craig said that they <Col N="2261" /> were treating the poor within 100 miles radius of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made by the Deputy was that the boards of health paid £2 a week for the patients treated in the Dublin hospitals.  If Deputy Kennedy knows anything about the cost in the Dublin hospitals he knows that nothing is made out of £2 a week.  Every case that comes from the country is a very special case, requiring such treatment that our highly efficient county hospitals are unable to deal with them, equipped as they are with special surgical appliances.  They are very difficult cases and very serious cases and very expensive cases.  I have seen cases in wards in Dublin hospitals where three guineas a week would not cover the cost of injections and dressings alone.</P>
      <P>It is up to everyone of us to stand by what we have got.  The hospitals, particularly in Dublin City, are doing an immense amount of public work and doing it at a loss.  Let us at least recognise that&mdash;and not suggest commercial motives to them.  They have been compelled in recent years to look to boards of health for contributions towards the cost of treatment of cases sent to them, not with the view to making money but with the view to endeavouring to keep their doors open and to do greater benefit to the people of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>In dealing with another amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kelly, the President said that the hospitals should not be too grasping. I think that rather illustrates the situation at the moment with regard to this amendment.  We must not forget that we are dealing with this question at a stage when the City of Dublin hospitals and the Cork and Limerick hospitals have already received £1,200,000 out of the sweepstakes fund.  At this stage the hospitals in the country come forward and ask for a fair share of the spoils of the future.  And the future is a rather doubtful thing.  I think it is not unreasonable for the county hospitals in <Col N="2262" /> Ireland to ask for 50 per cent. of the surplus from the sweep to be distributed amongst them, for several reasons.  In the first place, notwithstanding what Deputy O'Higgins has said, the ratepayers are bound to pay, and bound to maintain whatever equivalent or improvement is going to be made in the county hospitals, and they are bound to pay that out of the rates.</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion in this Bill, and it has not been suggested by any Deputy who has spoken, that any sum which is going to be allocated to the county hospitals can by any stretch be given in relief of rates.  Deputy O'Higgins seems to be under the impression that there is some underhand method by which whatever is given to the county hospitals can be brought to aid in the relief of rates.  It is clearly laid down no such thing can happen.  There is another reason why the 25 per cent. should be increased to 50 per cent.  If you look at amendment 15 you will find that it is a completely new Section 7.  Under the condition of the Bill as it stands, it means that whatever amount is going to the county hospitals is going to the existing institutions.  Under this new section, which we will have to deal with later, I think both should be read together; it gives the Minister very much wider power.  Section 7, as it stands in the Bill, deals with the existing hospitals which may put in a claim for a portion of this money.  I do not think I am out of order in reading the new Section 7.  It says: &ldquo;Can be applied by him in such manner as he shall think fit in or towards the provision, improvement, or equipment of institutions for the prevention, treatment, or cure of physical or mental diseases or injuries of human beings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That enlarges the scope very considerably. It brings in the mental hospitals, and those would absorb far more money than it is possible to allocate to them; but having regard to this section which may be passed at a later stage, if it is passed it would mean that even the half share suggested would not be sufficient to deal with the requirements of the county hospitals in the future in the matter of equipment. <Col N="2263" /> It certainly would be quite necessary to give 50 per cent. in order to provide any new institution which may be suggested.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that if there are such things as new buildings &mdash;such as sanatoria and new hospitals for other purposes&mdash;they must be maintained by the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I think an unanswerable case has been made out for the change of giving at least half the proceeds to the county hospitals.  I do not appeal to country or city Deputies in asking them to vote on this matter.  This is, as Deputy O'Higgins said, not a city or a county question, it is a national question, and it should be treated as a national question; and, after all, this question of hospital treatment should be regarded as national and not thought of as if the whole thing was concentrated in Dublin.  We should try to understand the amount of work done in the county hospitals already established.  I can speak of the amount and of the variety of the work done in my own county.  I would like to correct a few of the statements in Deputy O'Higgins's speech.  Deputy Tubridy referred to the number of major operations in Galway, and gave the figure as something like 1,100.  Deputy O'Higgins said if there were 1,100 major operations in Galway it was not a case to be dealt with under the County Hospitals Scheme but that it should get special treatment.  In other words, that it should come in with the Dublin hospitals. Deputy O'Higgins said that in six years there would not be 1,100 operations in any other county institution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That there would not be 1,100 major operations in any county outside Galway.  I happen to have the figures for the county hospital in Cavan for the twelve months ending 1st May, 1931, and they show that 690 major operations were performed in that county hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the same period there were <Col N="2264" /> 3,000 extern cases treated, 20 per cent. of these minor operations, such as tonsils, adenoids and other things, bringing it up to 600 more.  Furthermore, the ratepayers of Cavan provided a new wing with something like 35 or 40 extra beds and now the number of major operations is going to increase greatly, as evidenced by the last month.  Last month in Cavan Hospital 100 major operations were performed by what Deputy Dr. Hennessy called this one-man show.  That is what I call good national work done in an institution pretty well equipped by the ratepayers but which requires greater assistance. Possibly there may be some jealousy in Dublin, but when the ratepayers of the counties have assisted so far out of the rates to provide equipment to enable such work to be done I think the county hospitals should get at least 50 per cent. of the available surplus out of the sweeps.</P>
    <P>I might say, in passing, that one of the best acts by the Local Government Department since this Government came into office has been in insisting upon proper hospital accommodation for the counties.  Greater relief to the poor and greater saving to the ratepayers have been effected through properly equipped county hospitals than by any other means.  I would appeal to members of the House without distinction to give the county hospitals a fair crack of the whip.  they are entitled to fifty per cent. of the future proceeds.  Let them remember that the one and a quarter million that has already been given to the hospitals was as much a surprise to the Dublin hospitals as it was to everybody else. They never expected to get it, and having got it I think it is not an unreasonable demand to ask one half the proceeds in the future when they have already one and a quarter million in their possession.</P>

      <P>Some time ago in the course of the debate Deputy Davin made a suggestion that the figure of thirty-three and one-third per cent, should be substituted for fifty per cent. as an agreed figure.  I think <Col N="2265" /> it is very unfortunate that this debate has developed precisely in the way it has developed and in a way in which there has been a certain amount of attack, counter-attack and defence.  I take the view that both voluntary hospitals and county hospitals do good work and it is recognised, and I think it is a pity that there should be any attacks.  To end that I would suggest that if Deputy O'Kelly would withdraw his present amendment, at the next stage I would introduce an amendment substituting thirty-three and one-third per cent. for twenty-five per cent.  I think that would be to the advantage of all parties, because, as I say, if it is taken as a compromise it will assuage any differences that might arise.</P>

Some other of my colleagues who were with me hearing this said that they would not accept that and they wanted the full fifty per cent. That is the position I am in.  If I agreed to withdraw the amendment they would not accept that.  They were behind this amendment just the same as I was.  Personally I said I would be prepared to accept the Minister's suggestion and the suggestion of Deputy Davin.

      <P>I think that would be rather impossible.  I take a very conservative figure which would be that each county hospital would get at least £40,000.  That would be, I think, on a conservative basis.  It would probably get on twenty-five per cent. very much more.  I think £40,000 would be ample.  Some counties will receive considerably more, some less, because some have already benefited to a large extent.  I think that would be ample for each one of the counties.  If you increase that to one-third instead of one-fourth you will have added to that sum very largely, and the counties should have every possible need satisfied and more than satisfied.</P>

      <P>It was suggested that I was against the county hospitals getting a fair share of the money.  I considered that twenty-five per cent. was a fair share, and I was supporting that proposal.  According to my reading of the amount that we are to get from the sweepstakes, there will be almost <Col N="2267" /> £7,000 out of each sweep.  If that is multiplied by nine, one gets at least £60,000.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody can get away from the fact that there is going to be £50,000 or £60,000 on the twenty five per cent. basis for each county. You might say how do I know.  What I was going to say is that I am in favour of following the Minister in suggesting that a compromise must be made. If that is not accepted then I am going back to the original proposition.

      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig has made a point.  Does Deputy Sir James Craig realise what the amount would be to the voluntary hospitals? It will mean that they will get six and a quarter millions.  Are the voluntary hospitals to be in a position to spend six and a quarter million pounds while the county hospitals are spending £60,000?  I think it is a ridiculous thing to ask us to compromise on this because the counties are not getting at all what they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten or twelve years ago when the President as Minister for Local Government started this question of amalgamation our whole argument was that we would get people in the counties such good county hospitals and homes that it would be in their interests to agree to the amalgamation scheme, that it was ridiculous to have four district hospitals and that they should have one county hospital. They were to obtain a surgeon who would be capable of doing all operations and it would not be necessary to come up to Dublin for an operation. The President sent us out like apostles all over the country to try and get the amalgamation scheme through.  We are told now that those county hospitals are a one-man show, that the county hospitals only should have an x-ray and that it would be unnecessary in any other portion of the county to have an x-ray.  Every argument is put up to try and give <Col N="2268" /> the impression that proper treatment cannot be given in the counties so that a person who had anything seriously wrong with him must go to Dublin to be treated.</P>

      <P>I may have mistaken what Deputy Sir James Craig said, and I withdraw.  At any rate the Deputy said that there was no necessity for more than one x-ray apparatus in each county, that it required an expert to look after it, and that otherwise it would be useless.  I do not believe that that is a fact.  I think in certain cases of fracture, even students in the Dublin hospitals are able to diagnose without any particular training.  Even for cases of that sort in the counties the x-ray would be necessary.  I want every Deputy to realise that if the case Deputy Sir James Craig made is correct, that sweeps are going to be successful, that every county will be getting £60,000 under the next nine sweeps the other three-quarters, amounting to five millions, goes to the voluntary hospitals that have already got one and a quarter millions.  Surely a county can make provision to spend more than £60,000. What are the voluntary hospitals going to spend 6¼ millions on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposition was made a few years ago, to the voluntary hospitals, whereby they could benefit to the extent of £1,000,000 if they did certain things.  People in medical circles in Dublin could hardly believe that it would be possible to get £1,000,000 for the hospitals.  We thought at that time that all our difficulties were solved if we could get £1,000,000, and that we would never again be in trouble about raising subscriptions. Now, according to the Minister's calculations, <Col N="2269" /> the voluntary hospitals are going to get 6¼ millions, and we are told that they are not prepared to give away half of it to the county hospitals.  We were told by Deputy O'Higgins, that the voluntary hospitals were very generous when they agreed to give 25 per cent.  Who asked these hospitals to be generous?  What have they to do with it?  The Deputy talked of these hospitals doing the donkey work, and of the ratepayers' hospital now wanting to come in and reap the benefit.  What did the Dublin hospitals do to get the money?</P>

      <P>We were told that people are sent to the city from the country and that they have to pay only £2 a week, which is only a nominal charge, according to Deputy Hennessy.  Deputy O'Higgins said that the amount went nowhere towards supporting a patient when everything was taken into account.  Contrast the position of the county hospitals with that of the city hospitals.  In the city hospital, you have free medical treatment, free nursing treatment practically, while in the county hospitals medical and nursing services are paid for out of the rates.  As far as the cost of food and maintenance goes it is about the same in each place.  Deputy O'Higgins told us that Dublin had this disadvantage, that the voluntary hospitals have to be maintained by subscriptions, and that the Union had also to be supported out of the rates. Is Dublin keeping the Dublin hospitals? It is not.  People all over the country subscribe to the Dublin hospitals, and I am quite sure that they are subscribing more than their due proportion for the services they receive from these hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to look at this in a national way.  That is exactly how we are looking at it.  We want to see the hospitals all over the country <Col N="2270" /> brought to a state of perfection.  If you go into some of the county hospitals you will see that they were built in the style of architecture suitable to a prison.  They have still small prison windows, with practically no light in the wards, and are unfit for the work. Better buildings are wanted.  Look at the beds, the clothes, and the furniture in the wards.  They are not at all what they should be in hospitals. Then look at the position in regard to instruments and operating theatres.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion, when I was acting as locum tenens for two days in a hospital just before the amalgamation scheme, a case came in which necessitated craniotomy, and there was no possibility of getting instruments to deal with it.  The case had to be kept while a telephone message was sent to Dublin to send on instruments. I believe it is the case in many county hospitals that instruments required to do certain very urgent operations are not available.  I think we could very well spend at least 50 per cent. of this money on the equipment of county hospitals.  If we got the 50 per cent. it would mean, according to the figures supplied by Deputy Sir James Craig and by other Deputies who are in favour of the Dublin hospitals that there would be something like £4,000,000 left for the voluntary hospitals.  If they are not satisfied with £4,000,000, and if they can make a good case, when the next nine sweeps are over, the Dáil would then be in a position to get up more sweeps for them.</P>

      <P>I have not heard the whole of the debate or whether any statistics were brought forward to show the proportion of hospitals in Dublin and in the rest of the country, but by listening to the speeches I would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that Dublin is the metropolis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the hospitals in Dublin were merely to cater for the residents of Dublin there would not, in my humble opinion, be any necessity for a quarter of the hospitals that already exist here. Undoubtedly these hospitals are great national institutions, catering for and <Col N="2271" /> serving people from all parts of the country.  As Deputy Dr. Ryan has quite rightly said, they are supported also from sources other than the City of Dublin.  That, to my mind, shows that in no sense can they properly be described as Dublin hospitals.  That being so, I think that the compromise that has been proposed is a very just one.  In fact, I think it errs on the side of generosity towards those hospitals that happen to be outside Dublin. These great institutions in Dublin render services to citizens of the State in all quarters of the State, and, Dublin being the capital city of the State, it is only right and fitting that the great bulk of the money raised should go to these hospitals, which, in my view, are in no sense of the word accurately described as Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">

      <P>The question as it strikes me seems to be this: The intention is, I suppose, to convey medical science to the poorest people of the country in the best and easiest possible way.  I take it that heretofore medical science was not at the service of the poorest of the population.  Undoubtedly, through voluntary efforts in Dublin, the very poor in this city were to a large extent looked after; but what about the country districts? Amalgamation was proposed and carried out, and it had some very good results.  When it was carried out I think that most of the county hospitals found that through the shortage of money they were not able to become as efficient as they expected.  I do not think that there should be any great difference of opinion over a question like this, because, undoubtedly, the intention of every Deputy here is to make medical service available, convenient, and suitable to the very poor of the country.  I think that the only way in which that could be done is by giving the county hospitals an opportunity of becoming up-to-date.  We know that people in the country very often refuse, even at this stage of the world's history, to leave their homes to go to hospital.  When they do leave them they usually go to a county hospital.</P>

      <P>The Meath county hospital is not a voluntary institution.  I think that the attitude of these people to whom I refer should appeal to Deputies, because there is a good deal of sentiment in it.  These people do not go to Dublin hospitals as their relatives could not find the money to bring them to Dublin or to visit them there. Another reason why the amendment should be adopted is that we have efficient medical men who are condemned, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said, to practise their profession under unfavourable conditions.  They have not got the requisite training and practice, with the result that they must pass the majority of their patients on to Dublin hospitals. I do not think that any question should arise as to what should be done with the money.  A good many of these county buildings are unsuitable for their purpose.  The accommodation is by no means perfect.  We have a good county hospital in Meath, and, although I know nothing about medical science, I occasionally visit it, and as an ordinary layman I notice things to which I could take some exception.  When I asked for an explanation I was told that there was not sufficient money to give facilities for segregation and other necessary accommodation.  I do not think that we would be over-generous in giving the full 50 per cent. to the county hospitals.  It is not a matter of raising any question as between Dublin and county hospitals.  It is to give an opportunity to county hospitals to treat the poor and give medical practitioners an opportunity of developing their abilities.  I do not think that there should be any difference of opinion upon the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great difficulty in making up my own mind on this matter.  I have been listening to the debate, and the information which I <Col N="2273" /> wanted most I have not got, namely, what are the needs of the Dublin hospitals and what are the needs of the county hospitals expressed, somehow or other, in figures?  I was not here when the original Act was passed, but I think I am right in saying that the sum of money now available from the sweepstakes is altogether beyond that expected when this scheme was promoted in the first instance.  I take it that those who promoted the scheme had in mind certain definite needs which they wanted to satisfy.  I would like to know whether these needs have, in fact, in the case of the first hospitals which participated, been satisfied. If they have, it should be remembered that other hospitals are coming in now, and I am wondering whether this large sum is going to be spent in the best possible way.  I take it that the fundamental idea is to provide medical treatment for those who need it, through these hospitals, for the community as a whole.  I feel that there is need for some controlling committee that will examine this question of hospital needs in general, that the services and requirements of these hospitals will be taken into account, and that it will not simply be a matter that by getting in first, or by getting a majority of votes on the committee, certain hospitals will get certain grants.  I feel that although opportunities for getting money are being created by this House, we have no real knowledge as to the uses to which this money will be put&mdash;whether it will be used in the best possible way, or whether it will be spent in an extravagant manner and with unnecessary duplication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is to be a committee, and that is one of the difficulties I have about it&mdash;as to the extent to which this committee will have real power.  It seems to me that the Minister was inclined, in the speech which he made on the introduction of this Bill, to leave it to the Hospitals' Committee to decide pretty <Col N="2274" /> largely how the money was to be spent, and the proportion, as far as I could understand, to be given to each hospital. I know there are reserved powers for this Committee not to sanction a scheme if a fair amount did not appear to be given to one particular hospital.  I believe that these powers are reserved here for a special Committee which the Minister proposes to set up under the Bill.  I do not think there is any provision in the Bill to give this Committee sufficiently wide powers to examine the whole question and to make certain that the money is being allocated in accordance with the needs and the services of the hospitals in general.  If that were so, and if it were possible for the Committee to consider the needs of the country at large, I think it would be very much better than having a scheme like this, where we fix a certain amount in the dark and say: &ldquo;We will divide it into two parts and give a certain amount to hospitals in the city and a certain amount to hospitals in the country.&rdquo; We think that the question should not be settled in that haphazard way in the dark.  The Committee would be in a position to examine the needs of the different hospitals and to allocate the money in accordance with these needs, whether the hospitals were in town or country.  If I had anything to do with the farming of the Bill, that is the way I would like to see the system arranged. Taking the arguments put up by the Minister, and by Deputy Sir James Craig against Deputy O'Kelly, it seems to me that Deputy Dr. Ryan's point against Deputy Sir James Craig cannot be put aside, namely, that if under the terms of this Bill £63,000 is allowed to each of the county hospitals, and if such a sum would be available for the Dublin hospitals together with the sum already given them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 43 voluntary hospitals.  Deputy Sir J. Craig's point in regard to the county hospitals having more than their needs comes <Col N="2275" /> back on himself.  I think we should have some idea, before we allocate one percentage or another, what are the needs of these hospitals, both the county hospitals and the city hospitals, and express somehow or other, by means of figures or money, what should be given to these hospitals.  I find it very difficult to decide, and the fact that we have a compromise of 33? per cent. suggested instead of 25 per cent. only shows that we are simply bargaining and do not know what we are bargaining about.  We do not know whether we are bargaining justly or not.  Taking the matter as it has been left at this particular stage, I will be compelled to vote for the 50 per cent. for the county hospitals.  I would like to see some attempt being made to have the needs of the hospitals examined and to have some manner of allocating this money to the county hospitals in accordance with their needs and the services which they render to the community, without having it done in this haphazard way, by compromising between the various percentages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My position on this matter is a choice of two evils.  I object on one ground to the extension of the sweeps so as to include hospitals which should be supported by public funds, because I foresee in that way that the promoters of the sweepstakes are going to elicit in support of the sweepstakes a considerable volume of public opinion which otherwise might not be at their command.  On the other hand, I hear those who are associated with these projects talking in terms which seem to indicate that they anticipate that the amount of money which ultimately will come for disposal as the result of the sweepstakes will be in the neighbourhood of £8,000,000. Then I find that in the Bill and in Deputy O'Kelly's amendment there is introduced a principle which I will put this way: that under the Bill the expenditure of 25 per cent. of the money is to be subject to some regulation, some control, some attempt at coordinating the purposes upon which the money will be expended, and that the remaining 75 per cent., say £6,000,000, is to be left at the disposal <Col N="2276" /> of the hospitals themselves, a number of voluntary hospitals, to a certain extent responsible, I suppose, to public opinion but very largely autonomous bodies.  That money will be expended by them without the amount of control or without the co-ordination which I think it requires.  To my mind, the great merit in Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is that it definitely regulates to a larger extent the expenditure of that £8,000,000 than the Minister's Bill does.  For that reason I am strongly in favour of the amendment, even though it is open to the objection that it will elicit the support of a body of public opinion which otherwise might not be at the command of those who are undertaking the sweeps.</P>
      <P>In regard to the necessities of the case I am speaking, naturally, as a layman, but I have been in a considerable number of county hospitals, rate-supported institutions, in the country, and I have never yet been in one of them that fulfilled my idea or conception of what a hospital should be.  I have never been in one of them that was at all comparable from the point of view of equipment and the comfort of the patients to any of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin which are to receive a proportion of the proceeds of the sweepstakes.  In a great many cases these buildings are converted workhouses.  The patients are housed in buildings in which the primary conception seemed to have been a place of detention rather than a place of public charity or a place where healing processes had to be undergone.  They are ill-lit, they are built in a very poor way with a considerable amount of timber, narrow passages, narrow doors, no attempt at comfort or internal decoration whatsoever. If I were asked for an opinion as to the probable needs or the probable capital amount that would be required in order to provide hospitals with proper equipment and accommodation, I would put the sum at £110,000 per county at least, or £3,000,000 for the country as a whole. That only relates to the ordinary county hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take into consideration the mental hospitals which, under one of <Col N="2277" /> the amendments to come before the House, will now be included in the Bill. There are about eight of these mental hospitals in the country, and with the one possible exception of Portrane none of them is modern.  Carlow, to take one that I know, was built over 100 years ago.  Mullingar Mental Hospital was built about 1854.  Not one of them was laid out in accordance with modern ideas of the treatment of mental diseases.  None of them can be adapted to modern ideas or to give treatment on modern lines in regard to these diseases.</P>
    <P>Practically every one of them will have to be rebuilt from the ground up and I am certain that as far as the treatment of mental disease in this country is concerned another million or a million and a half would have to be expended by public bodies in order to provide it.  That I think brings me back to the idea as to what would be a fair proportion.  According to what Deputy Sir James Craig said in relation to the sharing of the money that would be made available for county hospitals, I notice that he anticipates that these sweepstakes will secure something like £8,000,000. Of this he proposes that about 6¼ millions should be spent amongst the 43 voluntary hospitals and 1½ millions amongst the 83 country hospitals.  He proposes to allocate about £20,000 to each of the 25 county hospitals.  That million and a half pounds would go to rebuild and re-equip the 25 county, and 58 district hospitals.  There would be available for each of these, something like £20,000 to rebuild and re-equip them, and there would be 6¼ millions to be allocated amongst the 43 voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Surely the discrepancy in the figures must appeal to every Deputy in the House.  If there is a case at all, so far as arithmetical examination of the matter is concerned, the case is for nothing less than an equal distribution as between the county hospitals and the voluntary hospitals.  Then surely the argument is in favour of the county hospitals as against the voluntary hospitals, and instead of the county hospitals receiving only 25 per cent., I think a very good case <Col N="2278" /> could be made out for their receiving 75 per cent.  It is on that basis that Deputy Ryan and myself feel that a fair compromise was the compromise suggested in Deputy O'Kelly's amendment. The more you examine into the matter the more every fair-minded Deputy will be satisfied that the amendment is a fair one and a just one.  I believe it is not wholly just to the county hospitals, but it is not unfair to the voluntary hospitals. It is not for that reason that we are not prepared to accept the compromise of 33? per cent. which has been accepted by the Minister for Justice and by those who spoke rather for the voluntary than for the county hospitals.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable number of matters raised here on the debate into which I do not want to go. I do find this in regard to those county hospitals, that I have never been in one that has not been fairly well filled.  I am not going to say that I found every bed occupied, but I have found a considerable number of patients in every one of them.  That satisfies me that the need for these hospitals exists, and if it does exist, there is to my mind a case, and a case that cannot be met or overcome, for providing them with the best equipment and the best staff that can be secured.</P>
    <P>I feel perfectly satisfied that if the public authorities were once able to deal with the question of capital expenditure with regard to building and equipment they would not be slow in providing the necessary funds to pay an adequate staff.  From my experience of them I am aware that the one thing that deters them from modernising these hospitals is the fact that they are faced with a huge capital expenditure. Such expenditure would put a huge burden on the rates for a considerable number of years.  The local bodies could not face that, because they feel that after that expenditure had been undertaken they would have to make the necessary provision for a staff.  They cannot see any possibility out of their present limited resources of being able to meet the <Col N="2279" /> capital charges upon the new expenditure and at the same time provide adequate remuneration for the staff.  If the problem of capital expenditure were to be solved I feel that the adequate staff would be immediately forthcoming, and that the public bodies would make every effort to provide the necessary and adequate remuneration for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee said that the voluntary hospitals were at the present moment to some extent dependent upon public opinion.  I just asked one of my friends what the definition of a voluntary hospital is, but I have not been able to get that definition. I understand that a voluntary hospital is an hospital which is supported by voluntary subscriptions.  As soon as a voluntary hospital no longer depends upon voluntary subscriptions it will cease to be a voluntary hospital. All that internal management, self-control and autonomy and everything that went to show that they were voluntary hospitals and depending on voluntary subscriptions given ad hoc to them by people interested in these hospitals&mdash; all that position will be imperilled.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the State should provide machinery by which something like £6,000,000 is going to be collected in this country and other countries and handed over to voluntary hospitals, and that those voluntary hospitals shall, after they have received that money, remain in the same position of self-control and self-dependence in which they are now, seems to me to be an impossible proposition.  The more money that State machinery of this kind provides for voluntary hospitals the less claim they have to autonomy, self-control and independence and that individuality which they have had up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard no case up to the moment showing why voluntary hospitals as at present defined and which will cease to come under that definition should be regarded as places to which the vast preponderance of the money which is supplied could usefully go.  If that argument has been put forward I have not heard it, and if it <Col N="2280" /> has not been put forward I would like to hear it.  We have no better reason to believe that voluntary hospitals as they have been constituted in the past will usefully use a huge amount of money as compared with other hospitals. That is my first difficulty.  I warn every voluntary hospital that gets from the State a huge amount of money, and an amount of money which is going to be, on these calculations, altogether more than they have been getting from voluntary sources, as to what is going to happen under the new conditions. When they take that money they are imperilling that position and the claims they have previously made will not necessarily be recognised.</P>
    <P>I am very much of the same opinion as Deputy de Valera.  I find great difficulty in putting any argument of a definite character behind any of the figures, whether 25, 33, 37½ or 50.  These seem to me to be empiric figures.  I have heard no suggestion which would make any of these figures sacrosanct. My feeling is that in the absence of a definite argument showing that a huge proportion should go to the voluntary hospitals, the proportion that should go to those not now so designated should be increased.  I would like to see the whole of this money&mdash;assuming that we are going to get this money&mdash; paid into a central fund and distributed not upon this empiric basis at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the State, through this House, sets up any machinery for the selection of the people who will control that fund, to that extent it will be a State fund.  The less interference there is by the State, in the way the State ordinarily interferes with things of this kind, the better. I would like to see the State setting <Col N="2281" /> up an impartial body of competent people who knew what use to make of it, and not interfering with them once they were satisfied that they had set up that competent body.  We are in agreement to that extent, that it must be a State fund in so far as it is set up under the authority of the State, and the regulations for its carrying out would have to be settled in this Dáil or through some State source.</P>

If we are fooling ourselves that this is not a State lottery we would fool ourselves about anything.  I would like to see that money put into a central fund of that kind, under competent, scientific and medical control, and I would like to see every penny paid out of that fund on a case stated, not some empiric figure to voluntary hospitals, not some empiric figure to county hospitals, but just in the same way as a county council deals with a road scheme, a sanitation scheme, or something else.  Anyone who wanted money out of that fund would have to show a case in relation to the work they were doing, the inadequacy of their equipment, and so on.  A second case would be founded on the developed work which they could and ought to do if they had an adequate fund; and a third point the financial position of that concern and their difficulty in facing up to the work which they had to do in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Show me such a case, and I will vote for fifty per cent. seventy per cent. or ninety per cent. unless some one is prepared to give me a case which shows that the seventy-five per cent. should go the other way.  If a case is shown that the voluntary hospitals are in some peculiar way able to make better use of this money than anybody else, then I will vote entirely with them in this matter, but unless and until that case is stated, it seems to me that the general burden of evidence is in favour of a wider <Col N="2282" /> proportion to the hospitals which now are not called voluntary.</P>

He also said that he would not be prepared to agree to a measure of this kind whereby such large sums of money can be expended unless they were expended without being subject to the supervision that State expenditure requires.  Did he mean by that that he is in favour of a State lottery, or a system of raising money under the auspices of the State, and thereby having that money allocated by the State through some particular channel?  Deputy MacEntee can assure himself, if he is not already aware of it, that when I was making the suggestion of a compromise I did so without considering the position of the voluntary hospitals.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that we are discussing this matter in the dark in so far as we are not aware of the needs of the voluntary hospitals, or of the county hospitals, or as to the proportionate needs of the institutions that are likely to benefit under the terms of this Bill</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only concerned in any vote which I may be asked to give as to whether it is possible to get fifty per cent.  If it is possible to get fifty per cent.  I am prepared to vote for it, but if there is a possibility of losing the fifty per cent.  I want to see agreement, if agreement is possible, on some lower <Col N="2283" /> figure.  I do not want to risk the chance of getting for the country hospitals thirty-three and one-third per cent. instead of twenty-five per cent. which is provided for in the Bill. Therefore, I want to know, first of all, from the Minister what attitude he is likely to adopt on the Report Stage if Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is defeated on a division.  I also want to know from the Chair the form in which it is proposed to put the amendment. Is it that the words proposed to be deleted stand?</P>

      <P>Would it not be better to put the figures of fifty per cent., thirty-seven and a half per cent., or thirty-three and one-third per cent.?  I can see Deputy Davin's difficulty.  He does not want to fall between two stools. We are not trying to score over one another or to catch anybody out at all.  It is a question of finding out what the House wants done in the matter.  The Chair could put an amendment that fifty be the figure, or thirty-three or twenty-five, and we would find out what the House intends.</P>

      <P>Of course Deputies understand that the suggestion of thirty-three and one-third per cent. was an effort to reach a compromise. That, I am afraid, has been rather scorned.  I would urge upon the House, rather than have this matter go <Col N="2284" /> to a division, that it would be wiser to accept that compromise.  I have a completely open mind in the matter.  I came to the conclusion that twenty-five per cent. would amply meet the needs of the county hospitals.  I am willing, however, to abandon that attitude and accept thirty-three and one-third per cent.  There was no tendency to move in the other direction.  You cannot have a compromise in which one person stands firm and expects all the &ldquo;give&rdquo; on one side and all the &ldquo;take&rdquo; on the other.</P>

      <P>The best method of getting the views of Deputies on this matter is by putting the amendment as an amendment usually is put, independently to the House.

If the amendment is lost, it will still be possible for the Minister, if he really thinks 33? per cent. is fair, to introduce an amendment to that effect afterwards.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is not a question upon which you can completely make up your mind as to whether the thing is fair or is not fair, because we have not, and we cannot possibly have, sufficient data before us upon which we could decide the matter with any degree of certainty.  We can only approximate.  I personally think 25 per cent. is fair for the county hospitals, from such evidence as I have got&mdash;not complete evidence.  I think that would be better and fairer between the two than 33? per cent.  But I think that in a compromise both sides must give way to a certain extent, and this is not a question in which you have any absolute certainty.</P>

      <P>That makes the matter very much easier.  I should like to refer to some remarks made by Deputy Davin.  I think Deputy Davin ought to go to an auralist and have his hearing tested, because I certainly did not say that I was prepared to vote for Deputy O'Kelly's amendment because certain <Col N="2286" /> large sums which would thereby be allocated to the county hospitals were going to be spent without supervision. One of the reasons why I shall vote for Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is because there will be supervision over a large proportion of the money that is to be provided through the sweepstakes, otherwise than there would be under the proposals made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>There is no attempt at co-ordinating the manner in which this money will be spent by the several hospitals.  The Minister also said that he had an open mind with regard to the matter, and later on he said that so far as he had made an examination of it he thought that twenty-five per cent. was a fair allocation.  If he has made any examination of the problem at all he cannot have an open mind&mdash; he must have come to some conclusion. If now, with an open mind in the matter, he thinks thirty-three and one-one-third per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps if Deputy O'Kelly withdrew his amendment, on the assurance of the Minister that he would move to insert thirty-three and one-third per cent. on the Report Stage, it would meet the point.  The reason I suggest that is this: I pointed out, when speaking on the amendment, that the next section, Section 7, is proposed to be amplified by the Minister and that he is bringing in under this heading the provision of buildings, which was not brought in before, and the provision of new institutions.  So <Col N="2287" /> far, as we have only got down to Section 6, we are only dealing with existing institutions.  The case put up is that they are entitled to fifty per cent. as against 25 per cent.  But, if the Minister is going to enlarge the scope and make provision for mental hospitals, and, possibly, new institutions, it may be necessary to revise that figure again after we deal with Section 7.  Therefore, I think that the whole matter should be left over for the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the necessities of the hospitals 12 or 18 months ago you were dealing with them in the light of what you expected as a result of the sweepstakes.  The result has created a new position which you did not contemplate at all at the time.  The necessities of most of the voluntary hospitals, certainly those in Dublin, do not include equipment. They are already provided with equipment. They are already provided with buildings and accommodation.  When you come to deal with the hospitals in the country you will find that they have not most of these things at all. As a matter of fact, it has been said that prisons would be a more fitting description for them.  The necessities in their case are infinitely more than was ever contemplated, if you want to have a county service at all.  I think the opportunity has come now for giving to the county hospitals something approaching what is necessary.  I want the Minister to view it from a different angle altogether from 12 months ago.  There are only the overheads in connection with the voluntary hospitals here&mdash;the other items of expenditure, whatever they are.  Certainly they have their equipment and their buildings, and these are up-to-date. That is not the case at all with the county hospitals.  You will need a much bigger sum if you are to have proper hospitals in the country.  You will want to contemplate more than you contemplated before.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, several Deputies who have spoken here, and particularly Deputy Sir James Craig, have very little knowledge of the condition of the county hospitals.  They would seem to have absolutely none.  Now up to the present the Dublin hospitals have got £852,000.  That would take fifty years to collect voluntarily in Dublin or in the country.  They have got far more than three times what they expected to get.  They have got £852,000 in Dublin, compared with £364,000 to the rest of the country, that is, the other twenty-five counties.  I know the conditions of the hospitals in Cork County.  I am sure it would rather surprise Deputy Sir James Craig to know that in the best county hospital in Cork patients for operations have to be taken up two flights of stairs in blankets.  That might surprise Deputy Sir James Craig, but it is the actual position in the Cork County Hospital at the present moment.  Does Deputy Sir James Craig think there is any money wanted there?</P>

      <P>I know you will not.  In Midleton, for the last 5 years the sum of £15,000 is wanted and it has not yet been found; nor can that money be found.  I quite realise the position of <Col N="2289" /> Deputy Sir James Craig and those other Deputies here who see nothing outside Dublin and never want to see anything outside Dublin.  Their whole idea is that patients who want to be operated on must be brought up to Dublin.  Deputies in this House should be concerned for those unfortunate people who cannot afford to come to Dublin to pay for operations.  They should be the concern of this House and they should be catered for by the sweepstakes.  We have had too much of the other talk at the present time. I think that some of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin have got enough already and should be out of the sweeps for the future.  That would be far nearer the mark.  I am well aware of the situation in the country, where those representing the poor would not or could not, in justice, put a burden upon the ratepayers to provide proper hospital facilities or proper hospital accommodation.  I am well aware of the situation.  It exists for a number of years, but now there is an opportunity of remedying the situation and I think it should be remedied.  If any amendment were brought in here it should be to cut out the City of Dublin hospitals from the sweeps.  They have got more than their share as compared with the rest of the country, and that is what I am in favour of.  I am in favour of this amendment, and I hope it will be carried and that those who represent country constituencies will support it.  We have had too much talk that everything must come to Dublin.  There is too much of that in the country at the present time.  The unfortunate poor who cannot afford funds to get them to Dublin for operation are deserving at least of some facilities.</P>

That Cork County Hospital is supposed to be the best county hospital <Col N="2290" /> in the Twenty-Six Counties, and if that is so, considering its condition, the condition of the others must be very bad entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can clear the ground in one direction.  The original Bill had its conception in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, the walls of which were falling in.  It had no money to build, and a statement was made to me that the hospital would have to close.  The Holles Street people saw they could not promote the Bill themselves.  They applied to other hospitals, also in great need, and the result was they brought together a small committee of the representatives of at least half a dozen hospitals and they promoted the Sweepstakes Bill.  That Bill was brought to me, and I was asked if I would sponsor it.  I sponsored it to some extent with the help of all sections in the House, and it went to the Seanad.  I want to say this, that as far as the Act is concerned, after it passed the Seanad I had no hand or part in anything done under the Act.  I refused to act as trustee, and I refused to go on the Hospitals' Committee.</P>
      <P>The original Hospitals' Committee was enlarged by the inclusion of two representatives from each hospital that came into the sweep, and these were the people who had before them the needs and requirements of the hospitals that were brought in after it.  I began by speaking about Holles Street, and I want to say this, it is an example of the state of affairs in a good many of the others and would be some answer to Deputy de Valera's remarks.  Holles Street Hospital has received, I think, something like £80,000&mdash;I am not sure of the exact figures, but I think they received out of the three sweeps something like that figure.  Am I correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhere in the neighbourhood of £80,000.  At all events the point I make is that that hospital consisted of old tenement houses and was falling in.  They could do nothing else, if they were to do any good work in the future, than pull down the entire structure.  The result was they sent out proposals for <Col N="2291" /> rebuilding the hospital themselves.  I am not sure of the figure, but I understand it came to something like £130,000.  That means they still require a certain amount of money to erect their building.  Are they going to set up a white elephant that they can never support after?  It will require the capitalisation of at least £110,000 to secure an income of £4,500. The amount of money which came to Holles Street in voluntary subscriptions varied from £400 to £600. That was all they received from the public.  Therefore, they are bound to make provision for the future.  Their entire outlay was something like £6,000 or a little over it in a year. If in rebuilding their hospital they make more accommodation it will cost more and therefore they will have to look for the investment of a large sum of money.  The least amount I would put that sum down at would be £110,000.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that they are likely to get in the future £10,000 out of each of the nine sweeps, that is to say that they are going to get £90,000 on the basis of the figures I have been using here.  From that they will have to deduct what will equip the hospital after they build it, and then they will have to look for their income for the future.  I could give figures with regard to other hospitals that would bring out the same idea namely, that it is no use for these hospitals to erect buildings and then make no provision for income in the future.  With regard to the one hospital I have something to say to, although I am not on the Board, the first effect of getting the money was that they were able to raise their nurses' salaries to something like what you would pay your cook, to a decent wage, something that many of the Deputies here would not think a very large sum for a cook.  The next was to pay the servants, who were getting only £18 a year or something like it, decent wages.  The third was to provide the laundresses with wages they were never able to give before and <Col N="2292" /> about which they had been pestered. Increased pay to nurses, servants and laundresses means capital expenditure of £12,500 a year; that has to be earmarked at once.  If we go on the assumption of what the Minister said, that at least half the voluntary subscriptions would disappear, that means that another £10,000 would have to be provided for which would take twenty-two and a half thousand pounds.  The hospital was being run each year at a loss of £1,000 a year.  The expenditure was £1,000 over the income.  That means that provision would have to be made for that.  There you have £40,000 with the £12,000 before anything has been done in the way of equipment.  I have been listening to Deputies saying that the hospitals have been all equipped.  Not a single thing has been done except putting aside money to meet the future expenditure of the hospitals.  That shows that there is another side to the case I give than what is shown here that the hospitals were getting hold of money and throwing it about without any control.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the suggestion made here that there should be some committee which would have control over the expenditure of the hospitals. I remember making a speech here five years ago in which I stated that it was a great mistake that any one, on his own, should be able to start a hospital for his own sake or aggrandisement or anything else without any supervision from the Government.  They started a little hospital in a small way and got the committee to come and begin to collect funds that should be going to the regular hospitals.  After that they got grants for the hospital.  There was no proper board.  There was no control over the financing of the hospital which was only run by one person.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the county hospitals provided with every convenience that would bring them up to date. There was no suggestion in my mind that the county hospital surgeons are not capable of doing excellent work. I would be very sorry that anything to the contrary went forth from this <Col N="2293" /> House, but when I hear people like Deputy Corry suggesting that the Dublin hospitals should be thrown out of this, why does not Deputy Corry bring in a Bill and get the whole of the money for the county hospitals when this Bill is passed?  Any one of us would support that.  He says that what was provided for the county hospitals should be divided with the others in equal shares.  My opinion was that 25 per cent. was a very large amount, because if we are able to foresee things it is quite obvious that there is not going to be a falling away but an increase.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies wanted to know what is meant by a voluntary hospital.  A voluntary hospital means that physicians or surgeons connected with it give their work for nothing.  I say that for over forty years I have given my services to the poor of Dublin without any fee or reward, and as far as the sweepstake is concerned I have not benefited by one sixpence.  Voluntary hospitals are manned by people like myself who have given their time for years and years without getting a single fee, attending poor suffering patients.  I think those hospitals should be considered.</P>
    <P>As far as the voluntary part is concerned, reference was made about voluntary subscriptions.  Fortunately some of the hospitals are well provided with voluntary subscriptions; others are not nearly so well provided.  Some of the hospitals getting £5,000 or £6,000 a year can only count on getting half that at present.  There were three or four in the last, and what is regarded as voluntary hospitals were those who were receiving a certain amount of voluntary subscriptions.  I reiterate that there were 34 hospitals, of which 19 are included in the City and County of Dublin.  As against that there were only 6 in Cork, 4 in Limerick, 3 in Waterford, in Louth 1, in Donegal 1, in Kildare 1, and in Wicklow 1.  Therefore, it is quite absurd to be thrown in my teeth that I am only metropolitan and only take a metropolitan view.  I am sorry that Deputy Tubridy went out, because some years ago I was sent to Galway to examine a hospital to see whether students should <Col N="2294" /> be allowed to go there to be taught their clinical surgery and medicine, so that I know something about conditions there.  What surprises me is that Galway did not come in.  Why Galway, which deserved it most undoubtedly, has not come in I do not understand.</P>

      <P>Does it get no voluntary subscription at all?  That excludes it from under the original Act.  The original Act says that the hospitals must be getting some voluntary subscriptions and must be attending 25 per cent. of their patients free. As far as I am concerned, I would like to see Galway hospital, where there is any teaching done, equipped in the most up-to-date manner possible, and I would like to see every county hospital equipped and fitted throughout the country.  I think the amount that is to come from this is quite sufficient to do all that.  I may be wrong.  I do not know.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested on Friday that as I had pressed the Government to appoint county medical officers of health I should see that their salaries were provided for in this way.  It is all nonsense to talk in that particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got a letter from a very excellent doctor in Mayo.  He says that there should be a research hospital set up to inquire into the causes of the defective mental conditions of children down in Connemara.  That is a most excellent thing.  It is so good that I would like to have it extended to some adults. That is only in passing.  The other suggestion that was made to me is that something should be done for the district nurses.  I do not think there is any better work done in the country than the work done by the district nurses, and if it were possible to bring them back into this Bill I would be very glad to do it.  I am sorry that Deputy O'Kelly did not accept the offer of the compromise made.  I do not consider it is any compromise.  He is going to vote as to whether he is to <Col N="2295" /> get 50 per cent., and then, if defeated on that, to vote as to whether he would get 33? per cent.  I understood that the compromise was to have 33? per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty.  We have started one Bill.  We have got a second one.  The issues which we are driven to discuss in making any attempt to get to grips with the question are getting so big that we should be either prepared adequately to discuss them or to say simply that we will not discuss them.  I have listened with great interest to what Deputy Sir James Craig said.  I think Deputy Sir James Craig, like everyone else, is acting in good faith.  That is the spirit.  The first thing I suggest to Deputy Sir James Craig is that we should get rid of the word &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; altogether.  That is not what we are here for.  We are not here to make bargains.  We are here to pursue what is the opinion of the House on this question.  It is not a question of finding a compromise between two different people in relation to a figure. It is a question of finding out what proportion this House on a free vote&mdash; each person independently exercising his judgment&mdash;desires should be made in the matter.  Such a question as compromise is not what we are here for, and I do not think it is what Deputy Sir James Craig intends.  If you once use the word &ldquo;compromise,&rdquo; you suggest interests.  You suggest that there are two interests which have to compose their differences.  That is not a suggestion I am prepared to make, and if it is to be made it must be made <Col N="2296" /> in set terms by someone.  Therefore we cannot use the word &ldquo;compromise.&rdquo; What we are here to find out is, what the figure should be.  Like everyone else, I think the Minister was acting entirely in good faith, and when he formed the opinion that 25 per cent. was a fair figure for the county hospitals, as far as I understand it, that means that he must have formed the opinion that 75 per cent. was the figure required by a voluntary hospital.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to explain upon what basis he came to that opinion. A point was made&mdash;and I do not think it was intended to be a political point&mdash;that Deputy Corry, in relation to what he was saying about Dublin, was neglecting the City of Cork.  I am a Cork representative, and I would not be expected, I suppose, to say something which is unpopular in Cork. I adopt quite freely the attitude of Deputy Corry, and I say that if it can be shown that any voluntary hospital in Cork would receive money from this proposal which it could not properly use then it ought to go out, and some other institution which has not sufficient money ought to come in.  In exactly the same way we are faced by the fact that £850,000 has gone to the City of Dublin.  A sum of £110,000 went to one place and £80,000 to another.  Has the Minister satisfied himself that that is not adequate for the present and the immediately prospective needs of these hospitals in relation to other hospitals?  If he is satisfied by making the basis 25 per cent., I take it that some attempt has been made to do that.  If there is an hospital which, due to the fact that it got in on the ground floor when this thing was started, has already received an amount which relative to its necessities and the necessities of other hospitals seems fair, then it might drop out.  Are we to take the line that those who got in on the ground floor have a vested interest to remain in, and simply that they have an obligation to use the money which is automatically going to flow in from this fairy fountain of gold?  Is that line taken?  Is the line taken that the hospitals which originally came in have a vested interest?  Are they to get the money all the time this is going on?</P>

      <P>That is clear.  We are talking of 25 per cent. and 75 per cent. being fair.  On what basis are they claiming part of the 75 per cent.?  Is it on the ground of vested interests because they got in on the ground floor?  You have to face that issue. Or are you going to say that whoever came in and whatever the amount of money they are going to get for their hospital is to be in proportion to the needs of that hospital and the work it is doing?  I want to know from the Minister&mdash;and I am not putting this question in any controversial sense&mdash; on what basis he has calculated that six millions is required for these nominal voluntary hospitals as distinct from one and a half millions for the hospitals that are said to be non-voluntary. Deputy Sir James Craig told us that one hospital received £80,000.  He also said that the subscriptions were from £400 to £600.  If he cannot see the danger in that to the whole principle of voluntary hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would ask the Minister to tell the House why he has come to the opinion that six millions, or we will take the figure of 75 per cent., are required by the voluntary hospitals relative to the one and a half millions required by non-voluntary hospitals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment I think there is a great risk of the county hospitals suffering, from the very fact, as Deputy Davin put it, that we have 25 per cent. in the Bill, 50 per cent. in the amendment and, at the same time, 33? per cent. offered as a compromise.  If, as An Leas-Cheann Comhairle declared in reply to Deputy Davin, the question be put that the 25 per cent.. stand part of the Bill, and if we pass it, it will embarrass the position of county hospitals very much because it would deprive them of accepting the offer of 33?.  Every Deputy who spoke to-day represented a county hospital, a county home and the poor, sick, and infirm.  It is his business and his interest to see that the best possible provision is made for the sick, poor and infirm in county hospitals. He has no personal greed or avarice regarding the money to be contributed and his only desire is to see that the greatest possible amount of luxury is provided for patients in the county hospitals in the county in which he lives.  I am sure that every Deputy would regret very much if he sacrificed any benefits that would be coming to such hospitals provided for in the Bill.  Deputy Sir James Craig has made a strong case for the city hospitals, and rightly so, and he deserves the greatest possible credit for making such a fight for them.  It is questionable whether any doubt can be cast on the validity of his statement.  He is trying to make provision for them in the future, and no one can find fault with that.  He initiated this scheme and carried it through successfully, despite much opposition and heckling.  I quite see his point of view, and I can see that he is right in looking to the future when the hospitals may again be embarrassed, but I think that the county hospitals, which are in a dilapidated condition, <Col N="2299" /> and whose equipment is of a very primitive character should also be assisted.</P>
      <P>I am sure that if Deputy Sir James Craig had an opportunity of visiting the county hospitals in the midlands and the west he would be prepared to ask the Minister to grant the greatest possible share of this money for the equipment of those hospitals.  I do not think that it is a matter of 25, 50 or 33? per cent.  It should be a question of what the House can agree to give, the largest amount possible to relieve the position of such hospitals. It is a matter that will pass from the control of this House and we will not have to consider it again, but that is all the more reason why it is highly desirable, when we are dealing with it now, that we should decide it in the way that would be most beneficial to all concerned.  I think that we should agree to accept the compromise.  It can, after all, hardly be said that this is going to be a free vote.  There is no such thing as freedom in this matter for the simple reason that you have a barrier, clear and distinct, as between 25 and 50 per cent.  A Deputy representing a constituency in which there is a county or district hospital, would be required by the people he represents to vote for the 50 per cent.  On the other hand if he voted for the 25 per cent. he would not have freedom either.  I suggest that a compromise is essential.  We should be unanimous. If each Deputy expresses his opinion I am quite certain that we would all agree to compromise on the matter.</P>

      <P>There might be because there are, I believe, a considerable number of Deputies, a majority of Deputies, who, even if they are not going to support the 50 per cent. proposal, are prepared to support 37½ per cent., or some other amendment less than 50 per cent. but certainly much more than 25 per cent.  If this amendment is defeated there will be another amendment fixing something more than 25 and less than 50 per cent., so that those in favour of this amendment should not allow themselves to be misled by believing that they are going to dispose of this question as to what is a fair allocation to the hospitals.  I should like to go back to the speech of Deputy Sir James Craig, as he has referred to the circumstances under which the original Bill was introduced. When the Bill was introduced it met with considerable opposition from influential personages in this House.  It would have met with considerably more opposition from this Party and, speaking for myself, from me certainly, were it not impressed upon us that the Bill was designed to relieve the pressing necessities of a few hospitals in Dublin which were faced with a situation that they would have either to close their doors or secure relief from sources other than public subscriptions.  We felt that the Government were not prepared, at the time, to undertake the investigation which a considerable number of us felt was required into the whole position of the hospitals in Dublin.  We were prepared to support the Bill as a temporary measure designed to deal with a very circumscribed situation.  In allowing that Bill to go through those of us who spoke on Second Reading made it clear that we hoped when opportunity offered that this, or some succeeding Government, would institute an inves- <Col N="2301" /> tigation into the whole position of the Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>A number of us had been informed, by those competent to speak on the matter, that the whole situation was unsatisfactory, that there was a number of redundant, inefficient hospitals which ought to be in the public interest closed down, and that there should be some amalgamation of certain of the hospitals.  In the case of the original Bill we qualified our support of the measure by stating that at some future date some investigation should be set on foot as a result of which these hospitals would be put on a satisfactory basis.  What were the speeches made here to-day?  Deputy Sir James Craig heard the views which were then expressed, and I think he assented to them.  In the speech to which we have just listened from him, there was a plea for permanently endowing the present unsatisfactory position of the hospitals in Dublin.  He said that there were nineteen or twenty hospitals, a considerable number of which were in debt.  A considerable number were going to have that debt cleared off, and, he said, when all that has been done, he hoped that they would set aside a proportion of the proceeds of the sweepstake in order to create an endowment which would perpetuate the present unsatisfactory condition of these hospitals. That is precisely what we do not want to see.  We want to limit the endowment of the inefficiency of the Dublin hospitals.  That is one of the reasons why I am in favour of the amendment rather than the proposals contained in the Bill, because I believe the more money that is allocated to the hospitals, the greater the difficulty any authority is going to have in dealing with the hospitals' problem and in reorganising the Dublin hospitals, if they have to be reorganised as a result of examination and investigation later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig, in the course of his speech, said he was against one-man hospitals instituted for the aggrandisement of single individuals. I do not know whether any county hospitals have been instituted for the aggrandisement of a single individual, <Col N="2302" /> but it seems to me that amongst the hospitals which it is proposed to benefit by this money in Dublin there are hospitals which are one-man shows instituted by single individuals, which grow up in that way and which do the same work as the other hospitals.  It would seem to me that Deputy Sir James Craig's speech in this respect was in favour of the amendment and against the permanent endowment on the present lines of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The main point which I would like to stress again was that the original Sweepstakes Bill was introduced to deal with a certain limited number of hospitals which were in a position of dire necessity.  Now the proposition is brought forward here, and seriously advanced, that the proceeds in the sweepstakes are to become the perquisites of the voluntary hospitals alone.  That was never contemplated when the Bill was originally before the House.  That is the introduction of a new principle to the Bill.  For that reason again, in order to preserve the right of public authorities and of the local authorities in the matter of a fair proportion of the proceeds of the sweepstakes, which though they are now run in the guise of being private sweepstakes are really, as Deputy Flinn stated, public lotteries, in order to be clear that the proceeds of the public lotteries will be under the control of a central authority, as they will be in the case of the county hospitals, where the expenditure will be under the supervision of the Minister for Local Government and the competent officials of his Department and where there will be no waste or unnecessary expenditure, the amendment ought to be supported rather than the proposals in the Minister's Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrVincentJWhite" hpid="Dr. White Dr. White">
      <NameTxt>Dr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1923 I reintroduced into Ireland after a great number of years a Hospital Sweepstakes Bill.  The gods then were not propitious, and my Bill did not become law.  I am glad to see that, as time rolled on, some of the members of the old Dáil who then bitterly opposed my little Bill became, in the years 1930 and 1931, enthusiastic supporters of sweepstakes <Col N="2303" /> for hospitals.  I was informed when introducing the Bill, by my friends here in Dublin, that the metropolitan hospitals from a financial point of view were in a very bad way, and it was also intended under that Bill that the money obtained from sweepstakes would be allocated, not only to metropolitan hospitals, but to provincial hospitals.  As the original introducer of the hospitals sweepstakes in 1923, I am more than delighted to see the extraordinary success with which sweepstakes in the Saorstát have met in the last year or two.  I hope their success will go on growing until, perhaps, the present amount subscribed will be doubled.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that some of the county hospitals do require money.  I am not prepared to say what percentage of the money from the sweeps should be allocated to the county hospitals, but I think that if an agreement could be arrived at 33? per cent., it would be a reasonable amount for the present.  I do not subscribe to the doctrine that the Dublin hospitals should be cut out of the sweepstakes at all. We all know what the metropolitan hospitals have done and are doing, and what very important institutions they are in the life of the nation.  If they have got £852,000, and if the provincial and county hospitals and county infirmaries have only so far obtained £364,000, I say good luck to Dublin, and I hope Dublin will get in the near future another £852,000.  No doubt the county hospitals do require equipment. I must say that in the case of the county hospital to which I am attached, whenever I require any equipment, I have only to inform the Local Government Department or the county board of health, and I have no trouble in getting any equipment we require.  Structural alterations are undoubtedly required in the Waterford county hospital.  The scheme is on the tapis, and they are urgently required. I would ask the Opposition seriously to consider the question of 33? per cent., and perhaps we might have agreement on it.</P>

      <P>I feel that it is most regrettable that so much time has been taken up discussing the difference between 50 per cent. and the lesser percentage suggested by the Minister.  So far I have heard no substantial grounds of objection raised to the 50 per cent.  I think the whole discussion was most unseemly.  The matter could easily have been referred to a Committee of the House at which it could be discussed possibly to the greater advantage of the hospitals and to a greater advantage of the country. Whilst I intend to vote in favour of Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, I would like to give some explanation, or at least to offer a reason or reasons why I intend voting that way.  So far I have not heard any speaker opposed to the amendment suggest that the county hospitals are not doing good work.  It is admitted on all hands that they are very useful adjuncts to the city and metropolitan hospitals.  But there is a point which should get some consideration and which should weigh very considerably with the Minister and with anybody who has any doubt whatsoever with regard to the utility of these county institutions: Remember if these county hospitals will get 50 per cent. from the results of the forthcoming sweepstakes, that will largely relieve congestion in the metropolitan and city hospitals.  As a city representative I feel that if I were to take an insular view of the matter, I would be all out in favour of the suggestion or compromise offered by the Minister.  But I do feel that there are numbers of those county hospitals which, as I have already said, are doing very useful work and performing work which might otherwise have to be performed by the city hospitals and infirmaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Sir James Craig, Deputy White, and other medical Deputies will agree with me that there are occasions when it is absolutely essential that patients in the country <Col N="2305" /> districts should have at their command the best medical and surgical aid. When I say the best medical and surgical aid I want to include in those terms the best that can be done by way of operating theatres and so on.  Those of us who have any connection with county hospitals are aware that in the majority of cases they are not provided with up-to-date apparatus.  The consequence is that many of these patients who require the kind of treatment I have indicated have to be removed at considerable expense either to Dublin or Cork.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a consideration that should commend itself to the Minister. It should also commend itself to Deputy Sir James Craig who, I feel, has taken a wonderful interest in the promotion of these sweepstakes.  He has taken a very great interest indeed in seeing that all these hospitals are properly equipped.  We all give him credit for his humane feelings in that matter.  I cannot see where the objection to giving 50 per cent., as suggested in Deputy O'Kelly's amendment, can come in.  But this is an aspect of the question which I think should be discussed in a Committee of the House. Some Deputies to-day have spoken as if these sweepstakes are to go on for ever.  I hope that the attitude adopted by some of us on the sweepstakes is not going to be misconstrued in that direction.</P>
    <P>I hope that this country will never be turned into a second Holland, and that we are not going to have only one reputation in the world as being the country which stands out pre-eminently for the promotion of sweepstakes.  In saying that I do not want to throw any cold water on the forthcoming sweepstake or on the ones that may follow it. I would, however, like to correct the impression that might be in the minds of some Deputies, and to point out that we are not all in favour of continuing these sweepstakes <i>ad infinitum.</i>  There must be an end to them some time, and I suggest that that end is very near.  It has been stated by some Deputies that a very large amount of money has already been subscribed to the Dublin and Cork hospitals.  All these institutions <Col N="2306" /> were in dire need of financial help at the time when the Act was introduced into the House.  I can now see and appreciate the long-headedness of the President who, whilst he did not oppose the sweepstake, was not very active in support of the promotion of the original Bill.  I felt then, and I feel now, that many of those institutions would have to close their doors were it not for the fact that these sweepstakes were promoted.  Many of us felt that we had to choose the lesser of two evils.  The money that had accrued as a result of the sweepstake was a God-send to these hospitals.  I hope that as a result of these sweepstakes these hospitals will be so well financed that they will be able to invest the money which will accrue to them so that they will never have to ask for assistance in this way again.</P>
    <P>I want to make this suggestion to those who are opposing the 50 per cent. division for the county hospitals.  Let them bear in mind that by the granting of this 50 per cent. they will not alone be helping these county hospitals but they will in addition be helping the very hospitals they have already helped.  I say that because giving the money to the county hospitals will relieve congestion in the city hospitals and relieve it in a way that will be reflected in the balance sheets of the metropolitan and city hospitals in the future.  For that reason I support Deputy O'Kelly's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present during the whole of the debate and am therefore speaking now at a slight disadvantage. I understand that the question is as to whether 50 per cent. or 25 per cent. is to be allocated to the county hospitals.  Naturally I am very largely interested in the county hospitals and being a member of a board of health there are few who are more conversant with the record of the great and good work done in these hospitals, and also conversant with the very many things required in order to place these hospitals in a position to be able to give the most modern treatment for the innumerable diseases that they have to treat.  I understand that the Minister has made a suggestion to compromise <Col N="2307" /> the matter by giving 33? per cent.  What I would like to know is this: if Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is defeated will the Minister at a later stage be able to bring in an amendment to allow 33? to be given?  Another thing which is most important is, what is the probable amount that will be received on the basis of an allocation of 33? to the county hospitals?  If the sweepstakes develop as they are developing they will bring in three times as much as the enormously successful Derby Sweep.  I assume that the county hospitals will get at least £20,000 a year during the next three years&mdash; that is £60,000 before the end of 1934. They will get this sum assuming that it is not going to increase beyond the limits of the Derby Sweep.  Undoubtedly this would be a tremendous benefit to the county hospitals and naturally I am very strongly in favour of it.  At the same time we could overdo it.  One important note I would like to strike is that this matter here to-day should not really be made a controversial one.  There should be no tinge of politics in it; that is a matter I would very much like to avoid.  These sweeps have been such a gigantic success it would look very bad before the world if the Parliament of the nation were to be divided on any issues connected with them.  Deputy Anthony suggested also that this matter should be referred to a Committee. I strongly object to any tinge of politics being brought into this.  As one who is deeply interested in the county hospitals I realise the tremendously great work that the Dublin hospitals are doing, but at the same time the county hospitals are to receive a huge sum on the 33? per cent. basis.</P>

That would be allocated amongst, I think, 25 county hospitals and 58 district hospitals. That 1½ million will be divided amongst these 83 hospitals, leaving out of consideration the mental and fever hospitals.  As against 1½ million to 83 <Col N="2308" /> hospitals there will be 6¼ millions available for division amongst the 45 voluntary hospitals.  That is the position. We ask that that money should be split on a 50-50 basis.</P>

      <P>I do not want to continue the debate any further, but I would ask the Minister to go even a little further in the way of compromise. I repeat that it would look bad before the world, in view of the enormous success of the sweepstakes, to have the Parliament of the nation divided on a matter that we are all interested in, and not with a view of anyone wanting to score off the other person.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Shaw is right in suggesting that anyone wants to make this a political matter.  Several Deputies on Deputy Shaw's side of the House have supported this amendment.  There is no question of politics.  I think the figure given by Deputy MacEntee should be conclusive, that under the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kelly the county hospitals and the Dublin hospitals will get a fair share of the proceeds of the sweep.  There is no doubt about that. The voluntary hospitals have got one and a quarter million, and if they are to get a further six and a half millions it will be unfair.  There are well over a hundred country hospitals and sanatoria, and the sum would not amount to very much per hospital if they were only to get one and a quarter million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> I think the House is of the opinion that the country hospitals are entitled to more than twenty-five per cent.  I am sure the Minister will see the logic of the arguments that have been put up, and that he will agree to this amendment.  I would like to ask the Ceann Comhairle whether if this amendment were defeated another amendment can be brought in on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to add anything further. I have already spoken twice upon this matter.  I will just say that I think Deputy MacEntee's figures are very fantastic.  The figures that I will put before the House will probably prove to be correct.  The voluntary hospitals in getting three-quarters would probably get about three millions and the rate-aided hospitals would probably get one million.  It should be borne in mind that in addition to the hospitals that have already participated and that still have needs, six new hospitals have been brought in and there are a great number of county infirmaries on a voluntary basis.  In consequence you are not giving to what I call, strictly speaking, voluntary hospitals, hospitals whose main source of support is voluntary subscription, anything like half of the amount, because the hospitals which are entirely rate-aided will get one-half and the hospitals that are partly rate-aided will get one-third of <Col N="2310" /> the remainder, with the result that the voluntary hospitals will get a comparatively small proportion.  By the voluntary hospitals I mean the hospitals that do charitable work and are maintained almost entirely, if not entirely, by voluntary subscriptions.  It was because these voluntary subscriptions fell off that this hospital scheme was started at all and I think we should keep as close to that as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be utterly impossible.  There are hospitals like the North Infirmary, Cork; the South Infirmary, Cork; the Louth County Infirmary, and infirmaries of that kind which are receiving substantial proportions of this money already and their proportion will not come out of the rate-aided hospitals fifty per cent.; it will come out of the voluntary hospitals' fifty per cent.  What percentage that would be it would be impossible for me to tell.  The Committee of Reference will have to go into that and decide.  It seems to me to be more than one-third and the purely voluntary hospitals that it was the intention of the House to benefit when this scheme was first brought in will get really about two-thirds of the half. I personally quite agree with what Deputy Shaw said.  I think it a pity that there should be a division of the House and I ask Deputies to consider again the substitution of one-third.</P>

      <P>I hope the House understands my position.  I have tried to make it clear that I would personally favour accepting the amendment offered but that I was joined in this amendment by at least half-a-dozen of my colleagues.  It was agreed that the amendment should go down in my name.  They repudiated my acceptance and they insist on a division.  I tried to get them to accept the further suggestion I made of thirty-seven-and-one-half per cent. and even that they are not willing to accept.  Perhaps if the Minister would see his way to accept that we might get agreement of the <Col N="2311" /> House upon it.  I would rather that there was agreement in the House.</P>

Sub-section (2) (a), for instance, says &ldquo;such application may be made conditional upon the fulfilment by such local authority of such conditions as the Minister shall think proper to impose.&rdquo;  There is no suggestion at all there of consultation with the local authority.  I think the Minister will agree that it will be necessary the local authority should be consulted or asked to put up a scheme, or have some say as to how the money should be spent. It should not, as the wording here would suggest, be in the power merely of the Minister to send down an order to the local authority and say this is my belief as to how the money could best be spent, and to impose certain conditions upon them without reference in any way to them as to what their wishes were.</P>

      <P>With regard to clause (b) in the amendment, is it intended that this money will be used entirely for capital purposes?  I think, as worded at present, that it is linked up with money for maintenance.  &ldquo;The money so applied shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the moneys expended by such local authority for or towards the ordinary maintenance of such institution.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is not clear at all.  I think as it stands it can be read to mean extraordinary maintenance. It is to be in addition to such moneys expended by such local authority for ordinary maintenance. Therefore it can be used for extraordinary maintenance.  Then a further question arises.  Is there not room for tremendous friction as to what is maintenance and what is improvement? The local body may very well contend that certain expenditure which the Minister would judge to be maintenance, would not be incurred in the ordinary course.  They might say that what the Minister is demanding is improvements, new furniture, for instance, new beds, the addition of a porch, the addition of anything you like.</P>

      <P>Under the amendment there is, I think, grave danger that ratepayers in a county who have hitherto done their duty by providing hospital accommodation will not get the same consideration as ratepayers in counties where absolutely nothing in that respect has been done.  Considerable sums have been spent in County Cavan in the equipment and enlargement of a surgical hospital. They are so well equipped that unless there are safeguards possibly in the way of power given to the Minister where he has no guide that counties that have not done so well will make application, while counties like Cavan will get nothing.  No hospital is so well equipped that it could not be improved.  Some steps should be taken to ensure that counties that have <Col N="2321" /> done well will get a fair proportion of the money.</P>

There will be applications from counties to provide new hospitals where there are none at present and where the representatives of the ratepayers have been negligent.  The consequence is that the money will be absorbed to make good what the ratepayers should have provided for the relief of the poor.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has raised a point which it was difficult to decide in connection with the original measure.  Certain hospitals got a great deal of money to put them into a proper condition. They had to get that money.  Other hospitals were so well off that they did not need to come under the Act at all.  As far as Deputy O'Hanlon is concerned I am afraid he is not making a good case when he suggests that because a county has done well it should get as much money as counties that have not done well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2322" /> Unfortunately that is the situation and it arose in connection with the other Acts.  I think it should be left to the discretion of the Minister to decide what the requirements are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Hanlon is wrong when he says that there are some counties without hospitals.  Every county has one hospital and some have several hospitals.  If the Deputy stated that some counties had not x-ray apparatus and had not proper operating theatres or sanatoria he would be nearer the point.  I think it is only the poorer counties that have not hospitals.  Most of the counties are fairly up to date in that respect. As regards the fear that any county would pay the salary of the assistant medical officer of health from this money I think the counties would be very glad to get the money and devote it to capital expenditure.  No board would be so foolish as to pay £400 or £500 out of what they got to an assistant medical officer.  No one need fear that any very fine distinction will be drawn between maintenance and expenditure of a capital nature.  The boards of health and the county councils are composed of practical people and they know as well as anyone the difference between these items.  The sums available from the sweeps between the present time and 1934 will not, to my mind, be nearly sufficient to meet the requirements of the various counties.  There is no fear of a reduction of a penny in the pound on the rates as a consequence of any money the hospitals get from the sweeps.  When that occurs Deputies can make provision to meet it.  I hope it will arise, but I cannot see the possibility of it doing so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The net total of the Vote proposed is £64,588, being a net increase as compared with the Vote for 1930-'31 <Col N="2326" /> of £4,619.  The printed Estimate to a large extent explains itself.  The principal increases are £3,000 in the money set aside for the acquisition of land, and £2,300 in the money to be spent on the employment of labour.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, wages and allowances, £9,598.  &mdash;This head provides for the administrative, inspectorial and clerical staffs which remain the same as last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B&mdash;Travelling expenses, £1,000.  &mdash;This item provides for travelling and subsistence expenses of inspectorial and technical staffs and shows a reduction of £200 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C 1&mdash;Acquisition of land (Grant-in-Aid), £13,000.  &mdash;The provision under this head is by way of grant-in-aid in order that unexpended balances may be carried forward. This arrangement has been found to be necessary owing to the difficulty of forecasting the length of time which may be required in any particular case for negotiation and conveyance.  During the year 1930-31, 1,810¼ acres were acquired by purchase and 220¼ acres were leased, making a total of 46,285 acres acquired for State afforestation up to the 31st March last.  Negotiations are in progress in regard to approximately 12,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C 2&mdash;Cultural operations, maintenance, etc., £45,800.  &mdash;(1) Foresters' and caretakers' wages, £4,500.  &mdash;Additions to the number of forest centres necessarily entails a more or less progressive increase in this item.  Foresters are classified into three grades, varying with the experience and seniority of the individual concerned and the importance of the centre under his charge.</P>
    <P>The grades are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Forester Grade I.  &mdash;Wages, inclusive £180&mdash;£7 10s.&mdash;£230.  Forester Grade II.  &mdash; £130 &mdash; £5 &mdash; £180.  Foremen &mdash; £120. These men are, in addition, entitled to free housing accommodation or a small allowance in lieu where houses are not available.  At present there are employed 6 Grade I foresters, 16 Grade II foresters and 7 foremen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> All these men have been trained for their work by the Department.</P>
    <P>Caretakers are usually employed at outlying portions of forest properties, and are given small allowances, varying with the importance of their charges.  The number at present employed is 24.</P>
    <P>(2)  Maintenance, £10,800.  &mdash;This item includes a sum of £6,300 for payment of labour required for cleaning and after care of areas already planted. The sum of £4,500 will be expended mainly on fencing materials (wire netting, stakes, staples, etc.) and tools. These stores are obtained through the agencies of the central purchasing departments.</P>
    <P>(3)  Cultural Operations, £29,000; Labour, £26,000.  &mdash;This item covers the wages of workmen required for nursery work, the preparation of ground for planting, and for the actual planting operations.  Labour is employed as required, reaching peak figures in the winter months.  The total number of labourers at present engaged is 520, and this complement will probably rise to 700 men in the coming planting season.  Labourers are engaged through the local labour exchanges at wages corresponding to the local rates for agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Purchase of Seeds, Seedlings and Transplants, £2,000.  &mdash;Seeds are purchased principally from abroad.  The quantity sown in 1930 was 725 lb., which, it is estimated, will produce approximately 11 million seedlings for lining-out in nurseries.</P>
    <P>There are 106 acres of land in use as nursery ground.  The total area of forest land planted or replanted in the season 1930-31 was 3,290 acres.  The programme for the current financial year contemplates the planting of from three to four thousand acres.</P>
    <P>Miscellaneous, £1,000.  &mdash;This item includes various charges such as manures, cartage and nursery ploughing.</P>
    <P>(4)  Timber Conversion, £1,500.  &mdash;One sawmill only is at present in operation, viz., at Dundrum, County Tipperary, but steps are being taken to commence operations with a small mill on the Department's forest centre at Coolbanagher, near Portarlington.  There <Col N="2328" /> is a steadily maintained sale of manufactured and partly manufactured timber from the mill at Dundrum.  During the year ended 31st March last approximately 21,160 cubic feet of timber were sold at Dundrum, and in addition a large amount of sawing was done for local timber owners.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C 3 deals with experiments in planting of peat land, and the amount is £500.  These experiments are to be carried out over a period of ten years or so on peat soils of the type occurring in the West of Ireland, in order to ascertain the possibility of land of this sort being planted economically.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D refers to advances for afforestation purposes, £350.  It provides for assistance by way of grants to local bodies and private persons undertaking forestry operations.  A scheme of grants for planting was put into operation during the past season under which assistance to the extent of £4 an acre may be given towards the cost of establishing plantations.  The grant is payable in three instalments, and is limited to plantations of 5 statute acres and upwards, planted either by one holder or by two or more occupiers jointly.  During the past season 26 applications were received covering a total proposed area of 280 acres.  Tree nursery schemes, having for their object the supply of good plants for planting by private persons, are being worked by the councils of Counties Cork and Kildare.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-head E. &mdash; Forestry Education&mdash;a sum of £250 is estimated.  This item provides for (a) the training of apprentices with a view to supplying the need for skilled forest foremen and foresters, and (b) special intensive courses of lectures, etc., for junior foresters and foremen in the Department's service.  There are at present in training five apprentices in their first year, six in their second year, and four in their third year of training.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F.  &mdash;Agency and advisory services and special services.  &mdash;£10&mdash;is a token vote merely.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G covers incidental expenses. &mdash;£130.</P>
    <P>The total area of land acquired by the Department for forestry purposes <Col N="2329" /> up to the end of March last is 46,285 acres.  Of this total 33,087 acres were purchased, 9,384 acres were leased, and 3,814 acres were transferred free of charge from the Department of Defence. The total area planted or replanted to date is 26,649 acres, of which 3,290 acres were planted in the past season.  Of the leased lands 1,606 acres have not yet been taken over. For the purposes of administration the forest lands are divided into 37 forest units, each of which is in charge of a local officer.</P>
    <P>A few words may be useful regarding the working of the Forestry Act, 1928, which came into operation on April 1st, 1930.  As is fairly well known, general permits are issued to owners of woodlands who are prepared to maintain them in a satisfactory condition. The Department make no attempt to interfere with the owners' views on the subject, but recipients of permits are expected to do what is necessary to preserve the general wooded features of their estates, and although planting or replanting is desirable, no hard and fast rules are laid down in this connection.  From time to time cases arise in which it is obviously necessary to take existing conditions into account, and no attempt is made to administer the Act in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.</P>
    <P>As regards the notification of tree fellings on holdings to which general permits could not apply, the principle adopted is to prohibit, in the first instance, cases in which the felling appears to be relatively excessive.  This is necessary in order that inspections may be made later than the specified statutory period of twenty-one days. Licences to fell are usually granted as a result of these inspections, which take into consideration the condition of the individual holdings.  As is well known, the limitation of prohibition provided by the Act is fairly wide, and covers all the more urgent cases in which tree felling is necessary. Offences against the Act are dealt with after a careful review of the facts supplied by the Civic Guard, and if offenders have clearly acted in ignorance of the Act, or satisfactory reasons can be given for the absence of notification, the cases are usually settled <Col N="2330" /> by the issue of warning notices.  On the other hand, deliberate attempts to evade the Act must be dealt with in accordance with the law.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In case there should be any doubt as to the motives behind my amendment, I wish to say that it is moved because nothing like ample provision has been made for the development of forestry schemes in the manner in which they should be developed.  I think that I ought to say that it will possibly be a revelation to many citizens to find this House discussing this Vote.  It is probably the only information that they will get of the fact that this Department exists.  When one remembers other times in this country, when the people were anticipating the opportunities that self-government would give them, and when one remembers many of the pictures that were painted of the possibilities of doing much for the country, including schemes of afforestation, it would not be unfair to suggest that the whole administration of this Department has been a ghastly failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the administration of this Department for the last eight years calls for urgent review.  I may say without fear of contradiction that the results as a whole are sadly disappointing.  I want, however, to do the Minister the credit of saying that the administration of this particular branch is very unlike that of many other branches of his Department where one sees signs of progress and of a desire to do many useful things very expeditiously and very successfully. The condemnation of the administration of this branch of the Department is fully conveyed in the Minister's statement in moving this Vote that only 4,000 acres were planted during the past twelve months.  In no other Department than this could more useful and more expeditious work be done from the point of view of enhancing the wealth of the country, of beautifying the countryside, and of making a substantial contribution towards wiping out the unhappy position disclosed <Col N="2331" /> some weeks ago when we ascertained that 84,000 people were receiving home assistance.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that 25,000 of them&mdash; that would probably be an underestimate&mdash;are able-bodied people who are workless, and we can then see that the initiation of a national forestry policy would provide ample opportunity of absorbing a large proportion of that number on useful work.  Time and again it has been stated that it is bad for the country as a whole, financially, physically and morally, that people should be compelled to exist on charity derived from any source.  One fails to find a reason why the whole policy of the Forestry Department seems to be one of going slowly.  It seems to me that it is the duty of the Dáil to insist that the whole policy of this Department should be looked into and overhauled and the only method, within the limits of Parliamentary procedure, by which the Dáil can insist on doing it is by referring the Vote back for re-consideration with the wish of the House expressed to the Minister that the amount allocated to this particular service should be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I want to say that my own experience of this Department and of the officials concerned is anything but happy.  I was optimistic enough some years ago to take the trouble of inducing a considerable number of landholders in my constituency to make offers of land which they considered suitable for afforestation to the Department.  I went to the trouble of collecting a large number of signatures and of having the petitions duly deposited with the officials of the Department in the proper way.  From that day to this, however, except through a couple of parliamentary questions, the result of which was nil, I never heard a word about the schemes which were submitted. It may be that there were some difficulties in the way of doing something with them, but it appears to me that no trouble was taken whatever to examine into the merits of the scheme and the constituents of mine, who were optimists like myself, are still waiting for the visit of the forestry inspector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2332" /> I notice in the Estimate that some provision, at least, substantial in comparison with what has been done elsewhere, has been made in some counties. I regard that not as complimentary but as condemnatory to this Department. There is something wrong with a Department which concentrates on a few areas while there are opportunities of doing much in a national way all over the country.  Take my own constituency.  There are, perhaps, few constituencies where schemes of afforestation would be more successful, or where they would be carried out with more local co-operation. There is not a single farmer, small or large, in West Cork who knows anything whatever about the Forestry Department, or who ever hears anything about it, so far as we know, except, perhaps, what he hears about this discussion on this Vote annually.  I urge the Minister to withdraw the Estimate and to look into the whole policy of the Department.  It may be no harm for him to take the necessary steps to overhaul the whole machinery, to find out what dry-rot has set in there and why nothing of consequence has been done.  As I have said, I regard the Vote as providing one of the finest opportunities of relieving unemployment and doing other good that are afforded to any Minister or any Department.</P>
    <P>I see much cause for delay in many of the restrictions that surround the initiation of schemes of this kind, for instance, the restrictions in regard to obtaining an area of 200 acres.  I am quite satisfied that in certain areas, even in my own constituency, there would be no difficulty in obtaining plots of land to that extent, but I do complain of the policy which asks for applications of that kind to be made by the local people.  I suggest that the policy of the Department should be to send inspectors wherever there would be a reasonable chance of getting plots of that kind and not to put the onus on the local landholders to take the initiative in the matter.  I noticed a reference in the Minister's statement to grants of £4 per acre for forestry work being obtained by local landholders.  The success of <Col N="2333" /> that Department is evidenced very clearly by the fact that 26 applications were received from all over the State.  Nothing could be a clearer indication of how futile it is to proceed along that line or how hopeless it is to expect that anything can be done in that direction.  The need is for a forestry department that will embrace the Twenty-Six Counties and will have ample funds to do a substantial amount of work in each county of the State.  I put it to the Minister that it is his duty to investigate the possibilities of carrying into effect a policy of that kind and that it is not right to ask the House to endorse the inaction of the officials who man the forestry department by passing this Vote considering what poor results have been disclosed.</P>
    <P>There is very little more I need say in support of the amendment.  I have taken a broad line in dealing with it and I think it is unnecessary to refer to what has been done in one particular place or another.  I take the constituency again from which I come, a constituency 120 miles long, where not one shilling has been spent by the Department and not one scheme has been examined.  That, in my opinion, is a state of affairs that exists in a great many counties in the State. From what I know of the Minister, he does not stand for inaction of this kind in his Department.  Whether we agree with his policy in other branches of his Department in one way or another, at least we always give him the credit of taking speedy action when he sees his way to do it.  I think his way in this matter should be perfectly clear and until the Minister initiates a policy of that kind, I think the House ought to withhold its support from a Vote of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration.  One of my reasons for doing so is that sufficient attention has not been paid to congested areas such as Donegal, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  Another reason why I wish that the Vote should be referred back is in the hope that the Department <Col N="2334" /> will reconsider their policy and adopt more scientific forestry methods. Although this Department has been in existence since 1922, we find that up to approximately two years ago, no forestry operations had been carried out outside twelve counties.  It was only in the beginning of the year 1929 that the number was brought up to thirteen counties and some little forestry work was done in Donegal.  Deputy Murphy, in moving his amendment, stated that there was a considerable number of people in the country who were under the impression that no money was being expended as far as forestry was concerned.  It might come as an eye-opener to these people and probably to many people in this House, when it is considered that since 1922 this Department has expended a sum of £376,256, and that out of that sum £86,296 has been eaten up by salaries, wages, allowances and administration expenses.  Between the years 1922 and 1928, according to the Appropriation Accounts for these years, a sum of £198,563 was expended. One of the reasons why I desire to support the amendment that the Vote be referred back for re-consideration, is that out of that £198,563 not one penny was expended in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago the Minister for Agriculture spoke at a Cumann na nGaedheal reorganising meeting in Donegal.  He had on the platform along with him Senator MacLoughlin, of County Donegal.  I observe that while Senator MacLoughlin and the Minister spoke in regard to many things, one of the things in regard to which they did not speak was the question of forestry.  In fact, Senator MacLoughlin and the Minister remained as silent as a painted ship upon a painted ocean in regard to that question. One reason for that silence might be that the Minister knew that not a single halfpenny had been spent in that particular county on forestry work during the six years I have mentioned. That is the reason why I desire to support the amendment that the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister a few weeks ago a question as to the amount of <Col N="2335" /> money which had been expended in County Donegal.  He said he was unable to give me the figures, that it would require a big lot of statistical investigation.  He was able to tell me that while there were 6,986 acres of land planted in Wicklow; 4,177 in Tipperary; 3,714 in Cork; and 1,552 in Waterford, in a county such as Donegal there were only 310 acres of land planted.  He was unable to give me the expenditure, but according to the answer the Minister gave me up to the 31st March, there were 22,456 acres of land planted.  He came along to-day and told the House that there are over 26,000 acres of land planted.  I would like to know how the difference in the figures comes in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you verify these figures from the Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have a copy of the Report in my hand.  There is some discrepancy in regard to these figures. The total expenditure less the cost of administration, according to the figures which the Minister gave us, was £289,960.  In Donegal out of all that expenditure we find that there is only approximately £4,000 expended. I would refer the Minister and his Department to the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission. Recommendation 63 was: &ldquo;That a comprehensive Afforestation Scheme for the Gaeltacht be undertaken.&rdquo; In the White Paper issued by the Government outlining their policy in regard to this it is stated: &ldquo;Afforestation in the areas included in the Gaeltacht is proceeding under the general forestry programme for the whole country...&rdquo;  In so far as proceeding in the Gaeltacht is concerned we find that in counties outside the Gaeltacht it is proceeding at a much faster rate.  I believe that systematic afforestation is one of the requirements of County Donegal as a means of making now barren areas productive, at least to some extent.  It is a good method of giving employment in congested areas, preparing the land, planting trees, and fencing the acquired land.  I would <Col N="2336" /> like to know if the Department have any policy at all in the matter.  A number of years ago the Minister speaking on this Vote said that it was the intention to plant 200,000 acres of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In forty years.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that if he keeps up the progress he is making at the present time he will not come near that programme.  I believe that there is no proper forestry policy in operation.  It is true that land has been acquired.  It is true that trees have been planted, but I would like to point out to the Minister that that has only been done in a haphazard way when it should have been done on a scientific basis.  On the 29th March, 1928, I raised this question, and the Minister told me that as far as Donegal was concerned it would be dealt with in exactly the same way as other counties. I want to ask the Minister if Donegal has been dealt with in the same way as Wicklow, Cork or Tipperary.  I venture to say it has not.  The policy of the Department appears to be a ca-canny, go slow policy.  In a supplementary question on the same day I asked the Minister if his Department had made any effort to acquire land in Donegal. I pointed out that there are thousands of acres of land suitable for tree planting. The Minister replied that the procedure adopted by his Department was to examine propositions put up by owners, that they did not go looking for land.  In other words, they have no scientific way of acquiring land or no scientific policy or outlook.  They are prepared, if land is put up to them in Co. Wicklow or some other county, to acquire it, while they are leaving out counties such as Donegal, Sligo and Mayo.  The Minister appears to think that good land is essential for forestry purposes.  Speaking on the 26th June, 1929, the Minister told us that there are lots of poor land which for special reasons are not suitable for agriculture, but are very suitable for the growing of trees.  It is believed by forestry experts that if there was more afforestation on the hillsides there would be less flooding on the lowlands.  In support of that contention I will quote Mr. E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2337" /> P. Stebbing, Professor of Forestry at Edinburgh University.  In his book on Forestry, he states: &ldquo;There appears to be little doubt that afforestation in the country once it has reached a certain point in its development will prove of immense benefit to the farmer, especially in those regions where areas of poor soil, situated about the more valuable agricultural land, are placed under tree growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Murphy, it is not my intention to vote against this Estimate, but it is my intention to vote that it be referred back for re-consideration, in the hope that the Minister will reconsider his forestry policy, and that he will see that more forestry work is given to the congested areas; that he will see that all this money is not spent in Wicklow or the Midlands, and the Gaeltacht left out.  I would appeal to Deputies of all Parties to support the motion that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration in view of the fact that it is not a political question.  It is an economic question pure and simple.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Murphy, this matter should be looked at in a national way.  After eight years' existence of this particular Department we find that there are thirteen counties with practically no afforestation. Practically nothing has been done in the congested areas.  Little has been done outside four or five counties. It is in the hope that the Minister will reconsider his policy and give the congested areas their proper share of this money that I second the motion that the Vote be referred back.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that under sub-head C (1) it is proposed to spend £3,000 more in the acquisition of land.

      <NameTxt>Mr. George Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in the past enough attention was not paid to the kind of trees sown in certain parts of the country.  A great deal of money was spent by private people in planting unsuitable timber chosen for certain localities.  Money was spent by private people, and the profit that came to them in the end was very inadequate compared to what it might have been if another class of more suitable timber had been planted originally. That is a thing that any Department concerned with afforestation in this country must see to.  My own county of Kildare has always been foremost for a great many years in forestry.  As a rule the trees that were chosen had been of the proper type, and I am glad to say that a great many of the plantations put down are doing well.  I think that a great deal more might gradually have been done. There is a difficulty in getting suitable land.  In spite of what Deputy Cassidy says, suitable land that will be of service to the State in the growing of timber and will eventually pay is not to be found everywhere.  Sometimes you come on certain districts that have beauty spots, and in such cases you may perhaps disregard entirely the value of the timber when you are adding to the beauty of the district by the appearance of your trees, which are an asset in another way.  The proper plan is to go in for a class of timber that will eventually bring back money to the State and repay the cost of planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that there is a sum of £500 to be spent as an experiment in planting peat lands.  I do not know whether that has been very carefully gone into. My idea is that it would be rather difficult to grow profitable timber on peat land.  Peat land is all very well for rhododendrons, shrubs, and things of that nature, but for trees that might be expected eventually to be a paying property, I very much doubt whether peat lands are lands that should be planted.  In places where I have seen trees grown on peat lands they do not <Col N="2339" /> seem to me to grow to any great size or thickness.</P>
    <P>I notice with pleasure that a very considerable amount is spent on wages. I do not think that any of the emoluments that those engaged on forestry receive seem to be too high.  I do not think that very much fault can be found with that.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is possible to get the trees that are required for planting inside the areas that are being considered in this matter.  In Kildare the Department have their own nurseries, which turn out to be of very great advantage, and are very profitable too.  I should think the same should apply to other districts where afforestation is being carried on.  Personally, of course, like many others, I would like to see a very much bigger Vote for this Department, but we have to cut our coat according to our cloth. Taking all things into consideration, I think that what has been done and what has been spent is well done and well spent.  I hope from year to year to see the work increasing.  I hope the next generation will see a vast improvement in the acreage under trees in this country, not alone around the cities, but throughout parts of the country that are now bare and desolate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy and Deputy Cassidy, in proposing that this Vote be referred back, have accused the Minister not so much of a wrong policy, but of a want of policy.  They accused him of being inactive in his Department and not having done as much as he might have done for afforestation in this country.  That is a fair criticism.  There has not been much done to make any serious attempt to plant trees in this country. Only 3,000 acres roughly have been planted per annum.  That is so very small that it is very doubtful if we should continue the expense of maintaining a Department of Forestry at all.  I am glad to see a couple of items in particular in the Estimate.  The item for carrying out experiments on peat land is somewhat hopeful.  Deputy Wolfe does not <Col N="2340" /> appear to be very much in favour of it.  I know that Deputy Wolfe has some experience of seeing trees growing in that particular area, and though I have no experience, nevertheless I think this experiment is certainly worth spending a little money on. Considering the amount of bog and peat lands that we have in this country it is certainly worth spending a certain amount of money on it to see whether we could make any better use of that land than is being made of it at present.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I want to refer to, and that is the matter of giving grants to people who make private plantations.  Grants of £4 per acre are an encouragement to tree planting.  I think the Department is wrong in insisting on a minimum of five-acre lots.  It would not be very often that one finds an ordinary farmer with five acres of land on which he could plant.  Very often one finds a man with one or two acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will very often have a man with a small patch of an acre or an acre and a half.  What is the reason that there must be five acres? If there is any particular reason it would be well to know it, and if there is not the minimum ought to be reduced. If the Department will go so far as to give free plants to people wishing to sow their land, it would go some way in inducing people to plant. In that way a good deal of plantation might be got.  I know of some individual cases where I was asked by Wexford farmers who had one or two acres of land to know if the Forestry Department supplied free plants.  I said that I thought they did.  I know that in one particular case the man would have planted if he were supplied with the plants.  He would have done the fencing himself if he got the plants free.  If the Department would consider such a scheme as that, I believe there would be quite a lot of planting <Col N="2341" /> done at practically little cost to the Forestry Department.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Forestry Department would have a number of plants to spare each year out of their nurseries, and these plants might be given free to people who are about planting their waste land.  As Deputy Cassidy has already said, the fact that there were only 26 applications under this scheme shows that it does not take very well in the country.  I do not believe that it is very well advertised or known that there is such a scheme.  As long as the minimum is five acres I do not think it will be taken much advantage of.  The Minister said with regard to the operation of the recent Forestry Act that there were no hard and fast rules laid down.  In many cases where forests are cleared he said there was no obligation to replant.  I do not know if I am quoting the Minister correctly.</P>
      <P>I think when that Act was going through there was a big volume of opinion in the House that some powers should be given to the Minister to compel any man who is clearing a forest at least to replant an equal amount, if not there in some other place.  If the hard and fast rule of replanting is not being enforced, I think a great deal of the good of that Act is gone.  The Minister said that where the felling was excessive he had taken powers to prohibit the felling.  That is certainly to the good, but I think re-planting is very important and that the Minister should not yield on that point if at all possible. I think it must be possible in all cases to see that that provision is put into any permit granted for the felling of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wolfe that a great deal of this Vote is spent on labour.  As a matter of fact, when I was going through the Estimates I found under sub-head C (2), which is responsible for practically three-fourths of the entire Vote, that a good deal of the £45,000, in fact nearly £40,000, goes to labour.  That goes to show that afforestation is one of the very best things that can be undertaken to relieve unemployment in the country areas.  It has been stressed <Col N="2342" /> over and over again that if we want to give relief grants, for instance, in rural areas in order to relieve unemployment one of the best methods in which the money could be distributed would be on schemes of afforestation. We would, at least, be getting a return for our money and 80 or 90 per cent. of the money voted in that way would go on labour; and money that is voted for relief is, of course, voted primarily to relieve unemployment.</P>
    <P>I also notice under this sub-head, C (2), an item of £2,000 for the purchase of seeds, seedlings and transplants. I should like the Minister to give some information on that.  I may be wrong, but I was under the impression that the trees grown most successfully in any country are grown from transplants raised from seedlings in that country and not imported from another climate; that where they are reared in the climate where they are afterwards transplanted they do better.  I should like to know if that is the opinion of the Forestry Department, and if so, why we do not sow all our seeds here, have them reared from seeds to seedlings, from seedlings to transplants, and so on the whole way up. It should hardly be necessary for a Department that is only planting 3,000 acres in the year to spend £2,000 on seeds, seedlings and transplants. A big part of that £2,000 seems to go for transplants, because if only seeds or seedlings were bought it would hardly go near the £2,000 mark.</P>
    <P>Somebody may ask what is the motive for afforestation at all in this country.  There is, at the present time, the motive of relieving unemployment, which is, perhaps, one reason why we should go in for afforestation more than we would otherwise be inclined. Apart from that, we know that we require a certain amount of timber each year, and that if we are in a position to produce that timber ourselves, we should certainly do so.  We have large imports of timber in every form&mdash;raw timber, dressed timber, and timber sawn in planks.  Then we have furniture and manufactured windows and <Col N="2343" /> doors coming in also, so that we have timber in every possible stage being imported each year.  It would be very difficult to give any idea, therefore, of what our requirements in timber are, because the cost of the furniture coming in would not give us any idea of it. We can see, at any rate, that we require a large amount of timber each year of different qualities, some taken from hard woods, more from soft woods, and so on.  We know from experience that we have land here suitable for afforestation, as we have grown a, great variety of timber in the past.  It would also appear that our climate is suitable for the growing of timber.  We have also an inducement to plant in order to replace a great deal of the woods and forests that were cleared during the Great War, and to bring back the beauty of some of these places that were cleared of timber at that time.  We know that many places have been practically ruined as beauty spots as a result of these clearances, and we would like very much to see these places replanted, if for no other reason than to bring back the beauty that was there before.</P>
    <P>One of the big difficulties that will be met with when timber comes to be used in 40 or 50 years' time is that of transport, and we must always keep that in view.  It might be a very good economic proposition to plant a certain district with timber and have very good timber growing there, but we must keep in view the difficulty of transport at some future time.  In that way it may be more economic sometimes to take land that is more convenient for transport afterwards, although it might not appear at present as good an economic proposition as land that would be out of the reach of proper transport.  I saw some time ago an instance given of timber being sold in a district which was only about fifteen miles from the sea.  It was stated that the person who sold the timber got 1/3 per unit&mdash;I am not sure whether it was per ton, or what it was &mdash;and the transport people got 2/3.  It appears rather hard on a man who had grown timber for 40 or 45 years that he should only get 1/3 for all his labour, <Col N="2344" /> while the people who transported it to the place to which it was consigned got 2/3.</P>
    <P>There is also a good deal in what Deputy Wolfe said, that you must not always depend on the poorest land for the growing of timber.  There are certain varieties of timber, particularly pines, that grow fairly well on rather poor land, such as mountain sides.  If there is any considerable amount of soil on the mountain the pines will grow.  Other trees, however, such as oak, would not grow in these places. Oak would require very good land; almost as good as any agricultural crop, the only difference being that the oak is able to go farther down for nourishment than the ordinary agricultural crop.  There are certain mountains which people will claim are a better economic proposition for the grazing of sheep, say, than for afforestation. The Forestry Department, I am sure, are quite capable of calculating whether they can take over a mountain side, which was used for the grazing of sheep, at a fair valuation considering the income that the owner of the mountain who was grazing sheep was getting, and whether at that price they can grow timber in an economic way or not.  It should not be very difficult for the Department to calculate that.  The employment given by mountain sheep farming is very small as compared to what would be given on the maintenance of forests, apart from the clearing and planting.  The amount of employment given in the maintenance of forests on the mountain-side would be much greater than the amount of employment given by the herding of sheep.</P>
    <P>We do export a certain amount of timber from this country; it is not very large, but we find a ready market in Great Britain for pines and many of the inferior timbers, as well as pines which are used for pit props, and many inferior trees which are also used for pit props in England and Wales.  For our own requirements here I think we want more of the hard woods.  Our furniture manufacturers are quite prepared to use home-grown timber if they can get it.  They do use a considerable amount of home-grown oak, home-grown <Col N="2345" /> sycamore and home-grown chestnut. Then there are manufacturers of tools who use a certain amount of timber for handles, and for that purpose use ash.  But, generally speaking, we require the hard timbers here more than pine, and I believe if we went in for planting hard woods like oak, ash, and chestnut, and others, that we would require a better type of land than really rough mountain land, and also more sheltered land.  It might be a good economic proposition, but no one can say that except the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>I do not think, however, our whole policy ought to be based on whether it is an economic proposition or not.  We have to take several other things into account, like making the country more beautiful and things like that.  Some people hold it makes the country more healthy, because it absorbs a certain amount of moisture and lessens the rainfall.  I do not know whether that is so, but some hold that it is so, but we have the very important consideration at the present time, namely, the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are other matters I want to mention which concern Wexford in particular.  There was a plantation under the Forestry Department in Camolin, County Wexford.  Part of that was cleared in the recent past. While clearing it a great deal of damage was done to the roads.  Indeed, they were so damaged that the people who held land on these roads were unable to get into their holdings, and a good many people could not bring a horse and cart with any loads on to the lands.  The farmers could not bring manure to the lands nor a load of roots back to the markets.  Some time ago they were talking about relief schemes, and a number of those people interviewed the Forestry Department. The Forestry Department sent them home fairly hopeful that something would be done, but since that nothing has been done upon this point.  The roads are in a deplorable condition as a result of the work done by the Forestry Department clearing that wood.  I think the Forestry Department should have seen to it that <Col N="2346" /> the roads were left in good repair after they had finished clearing the wood, in order to give farmers a chance of going on with their own work and visiting their fields.</P>
    <P>The second matter that I want to mention has been raised here every year for the last seven or eight years since the Forestry Department started, and that is the planting of the mountain of Forth.  People in Wexford were very hopeful that the Forestry Department would plant the mountain of Forth, but as year followed year it was found that we got no farther. Only three years ago it was discovered there were certain difficulties in the way.  The people who owned the mountain and who had an interest in the mountain had to be bought out, and we were told that the recent Forestry Act had to be passed before that could be done.  The Act has gone through, and we thought that the next step to be taken would be to have the people bought out and compensated. They were willing to be bought out and compensated, thinking that if they could get work through the Forestry Department they would be better off than they are at present, in the position of struggling small farmers, but it does not appear that much has been done.  We were told again that the Forestry Department could do nothing until the Land Commission moved and that the Land Commission would have to take over the land and hand it over to the Forestry Department.  So that every year we find we are getting further away, and that new difficulties arose and new barriers stood in the way.  I would like very much if the Minister could give us any information upon these two points that are peculiar to the County Wexford when he comes to reply.  I would be glad if the would tell us about the wood at Camolin and the planting of Forth Mountain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let everyone praise the bridge as he crosses it.  There is an amount of employment given in my district, where we have two or three forestry schemes going on.  Everyone appreciates the amount of employment given there, especially in the winter months, when there is no other way <Col N="2347" /> of getting employment, but I would point out that a great many of these men are disemployed in the summer time.  There could be ample employment found for them in the way of weeding and cleaning the trees they have planted in the last two or three years.  I hope the Minister will look into that.  Deputy Ryan mentioned nurseries.  I am glad to be able to inform him that in my district, where we have a big forestry scheme going on, all trees planted there are grown in the district.  As he pointed out, they are natural and acclimatised, and they are better than imported ones, more especially when they are home-grown they give employment.  From the health point of view forests in any country are a great asset.  We are told that the pine forests in Switzerland attract tourists over there&mdash;the consumptives, if you like&mdash;who go there to try and get back their health.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I believe, is offering £4 an acre for land to plant.  I was speaking to a farmer on Sunday last who has 330 acres and he was willing to sell 130 acres of that for plantation and at a reasonable rate in order to enable him to clear off a debt he owes by way of annuity on the 200 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.  There are also in other parts of my constituency men who were offering 2,000 acres of land in Carrignavar. There is a gentleman prepared to give 2,000 acres of land at a very reasonable price.  I believe one of the objections to taking over small parcels of land would be that you would have to pay a caretaker as much to look after a couple of hundred acres as to look after a couple of thousand acres.  I guarantee if these 2,000 acres in Carrignavar are taken over that there will be ample for a caretaker when the complete work of planting is done.  In addition we have in the summer time drainage.  Some of the land requires to be drained.  That would give employment in the summer to men who are unemployed.  Then there is also the preparing of land for the coming season.  I hope that will be <Col N="2348" /> taken note of by the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan pointed out that we would want better land for the hard wood&mdash;the oak, the elm and other hard woods.  I agree.  There are several woods being cut down for the last twenty years where all those hard woods grew and were never replanted. That timber grew on fairly good land.  There is nothing to prevent the Forestry Department acquiring these old woods and replanting them again.  He also mentioned the beauty spots and I agree with him that in my parish there was a great amount of damage done in the last ten years.  I suppose it was necessary. It was one of the finest beauty spots in the country, along the glens and the valleys.  I hope when the Forestry Department are visiting their big tracts of land in that particular district that they will not fail to visit those places.  It would make our country healthier.  It would be an aid to the beauty of the country and it would bring tourists to see those places that were the beauty spots of not so very long ago.  It would do your heart good to see them.  I often walked through them when I was a young fellow and some one else walked through them as well.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, I would like to point out to the Minister for Agriculture that while I would like to see more money spent on forestry, I am sure Deputy Murphy would be the last man in this House who would close the gate for employment in any district in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I, for one, have got very grave complaints from the labourers employed in afforestation in our constituency. They tell me that their maximum wage is £1 9s. per week, and that they get no broken time whatsoever. Some of them have to travel eight or nine miles to work, and if they arrive a quarter of an hour late they are sent home.  It is rather an extraordinary thing to see a director with a thousand pounds a year drawing a cost-of-living bonus equivalent to the amount which these labourers get in a year, and to see officials here getting £2,627 cost-of-living bonus added to their salaries.  At the same time unfortunate men have to work for a maximum of £1 9s. per week.  I have also received complaints that the treatment they are getting is unfair and unjust.  I would like to emphasise one point.  I notice there is a special rate here for a forestry inspector.  I am glad to see that the forestry inspector is a married man.  I suggest that when the Minister was making a special rate for a forestry inspector and increasing his salary from £400 to £600 on account of being married, on somewhat the same lines he should consider the unfortunate men who are working for 29/-, and he should find out whether £1 9s. a week would be sufficient to support their wives and children as compared with the gentleman with £1,000 who is getting three men's salaries.  I think the time has come when there should be an end to what I honestly call slave labour in this country.  A wage of £1 9s. is not sufficient to support a man with his wife and children.  I think setting down a maximum of that description is grossly unfair and unjust. As has been pointed out the amount of labour employed in this department is very large in comparison with the vote for the Department. I think the Minister should put an end to the maximum rate that is being paid.  It is grossly unfair to send a man who is half an hour late home.  I would like the Minister to look into these points and I hope I will not have to allude to them again.</P>

      <P>I agree with the other speakers who said that the policy of this Department is slow.  It is slow, especially when we know that in other branches of the agricultural department the Minister set himself in a practical manner to endeavour to solve the difficulties of agriculture.  For the past five or six years the Minister has been reminded by Deputies from the County Wexford that there is such a place as Forth Mountain.  He repeatedly promised that something would be done.  In 1925 the matter was brought to his notice.  Inspectors were sent down, and they reported that this particular place was entirely satisfactory as far as planting was concerned. Notwithstanding the fact that various promises had been made by the Minister, nothing has yet been done as far as anybody can see.  I was told repeatedly that there were difficulties in the way which could be removed by the Forestry Act, which is now two years' old.  Notwithstanding the fact that it has been on the Statute Book for that period nothing yet appears to have been done.  When the Minister was in the County Wexford two deputations awaited on behalf of the Edermine area and another with regard to the Forth Mountain.  The Minister gave an undertaking as to what he proposed to do as far as these two places were concerned. I would ask the Minister to give some definite indication as to what his attitude is in regard to these two cases. As far as Edermine is concerned, a large tract there has been offered to the Minister, practically free of charge, so that I do not see any difficulty about proceeding with the planting of it. There is a great deal of unemployment there owing to the fact that it is adjacent to the River Slaney, where the fishing has been bad for the last two or three years.  It was with that object that representations were made to the owner, asking him to hand over the place to the Department for replanting. Up to this the Minister has turned a deaf ear to the representations that have been made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to the fact that 29s. a week has been fixed as the maximum wage paid forestry workers. I have drawn the attention of the <Col N="2351" /> House to that previously.  I think it is a scandalous state of affairs that a Government should stand over a stipulation of that kind.  I cannot understand how any man can be expected to support a wife and family in decent comfort on 29s. a week.  When I raised the question a few months ago it was stated that that was the agricultural wage paid in the area.  That may be so, but the agricultural worker does not have wet time stopped, and he gets perquisites over and above his wages that those engaged on forestry work do not get.  As a matter of fact in one part of the constituency I represent, 24s. has been paid, and I heard of 22s. being paid in another part.  In Curracloe only 27s. was paid.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position. I state unhesitatingly that it is shameful for any Government to stand over a wage of that kind.  I hope the Minister will now indicate what he intends to do about Forth mountain and Edermine. It is time that the Minister made up his mind definitely and told the people what he proposes to do about these places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange that there should be a discussion on forestry without any reference to co-operation from public authorities such as county councils.  I think at one time county councils were the principal agents in furthering an interest in forestry, and one or two of them had a great deal to do with getting a voluntary forestry movement going.  In that connection it is rather a bad sign to see a reduction of £150 last year in sub-head (d) advances for afforestation purposes.  In a memorandum circulated by the Forestry Department relating to the Forestry Act of 1928, it was stated that in the Act provision was made to meet payment of grants to private persons and public bodies for the purposes of planting and replanting.  I suppose we may take it that the reduction from the very small sum of £500 to £350 indicates that there is practically no interest in that provision on the part of individuals or public bodies.  If that be so the Department owes it as a duty to explain whether they have <Col N="2352" /> done anything to get the county councils interested.  Have they interviewed or made representations of any kind to these councils?  Have they got point blank refusals from them?  It seems to me that the present is rather a favourable time for representations of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently two or three county councils&mdash;Kildare and Wicklow for certain &mdash;introduced a new principle with regard to the granting of home help. They are attempting to insist that able-bodied men are to give some return in the way of labour for whatever allowance they receive-one or two days' work in the week.  If that be continued, or if it were the opinion of the Department of Local Government that it was desirable to continue it, obviously there is a way open to encourage afforestation work on the part of county councils.  It seems to me that if there was any enthusiasm on the part of the Forestry Department they would already have observed that movement and have taken advantage of it for the purpose of getting afforestation work going.  From the Minister's statement it appears that the planting of peat land is being carried on in the West of Ireland.  I do not know why it should be confined to the West, because there are big portions of bog in Leinster that could be utilised, if the idea be at all practicable, for that purpose.  I know that the director of the Forestry Department who has just retired was of the opinion that there were several fairly large pieces of bog in Leinster that could be utilised for that purpose. Taking these three things into account, that under the Act provision exists by which grants can be made to public bodies, that it is proposed to make an experiment in the planting of peat land, and the movement of the county councils to insist upon a return in the way of labour for home help, I think there would be room for an advance in forestry work.  As far as I have been able to observe, there has been very little enthusiasm in that Department for a long time.  Over twenty years ago the belief in afforestation as a necessary and desirable national work was almost a religion amongst the <Col N="2353" /> people, and for a few years we had Arbor Days.  Of late years there has been very little sign of that enthusiasm or of anything to take its place.  It is time that there was at least a show of more energy in the Department in the way of getting afforestation work going on a more dynamic basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>As, according to Deputy Cassidy's figures, the Department has planted over 1,000 acres in Waterford county, I suppose I should not be too hard on it.</P>
      <P>There is, however, always room for criticism.  Some time ago, some farmers approached me with a view to disposing of land to the Department for afforestation purposes.  I approached the Department and was informed that parcels of land under 300 acres were not an economic proposition for the purpose.  There are many farmers who are anxious to help in some way in planting land which is otherwise useless.  Many of them who reside in exposed localities would like to have shelter belts planted, and I was wondering whether it would not be possible to have some co-operation in this respect between the farmers and the Department.  The farmers, perhaps, could supply the labour and undertake to take care of the trees and fence them.  Perhaps the Department could modify their rule about not planting less than 300 acres at the time.  I know that three farmers offered 50 acres each but owing to the fact that the Department would not deal with less than 300 acres the scheme fell through.  If there were some scheme of co-operation between the Department and farmers small areas of land could be planted at a minimum of cost.  Deputy Moore referred to the Arbor Days that were held some years ago.  About ten years ago in many parts of the country trees were planted on those days and arrangements were entered into by which they were to be left in the possession of the Arbor Days committees. I do not know what has happened to these trees, whether they have been taken over by the Department or whether they came into possession of those who own the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2354" /> The question of planting along the sea-shore is rather interesting because there are many parts of the coast in the southern counties that could be made attractive by planting.  The difficulty about it, I understand, is the prevailing westerly breeze, but would it not be possible to start shelter belts along the more exposed portions of the coast and then develop them into more extensive schemes, because the land is often useless for anything else?  It is rocky and craggy but there is fairly good soil between the rocks suitable for the growing of timber.  I know instances where timber is growing fairly successfully on exposed mountain sides where the land is rather bad. Reference has been made to experiments in the growing of trees on peat land.  I have seen such trees as spruce, larch and birch growing successfully on cutaway bog and when thinned out these trees have realised a fair sum.  It should be possible to grow timber on cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was some labour trouble with the Department in regard to afforestation schemes in Co. Waterford.  Some men complained to me that during planting operations in the county outside labour was imported. That may be a small matter, but these men pointed out that in their particular district there were 90 men unemployed and they maintained that when work of clearing the lands and making the holes for the trees was available local men should have got preference, and I am rather inclined to agree with them.  Some Deputies referred to the fact that we should use our own timber.  Could the Department inform me why Irish timber is not suitable for working?  Carpenters tell me that it is difficult to work, that Irish oak is difficult to plane, and that Irish larch and fir are almost impossible to work.  I am sure that some Deputy in the House has worked Irish timber, and perhaps he would be able to give me the information I require. Why is it so difficult to work and why is Norwegian pine regarded as superior to Irish timber?  Is it due to the want of care in planting, or is it due to climate or soil?  If so, it should be possible to eradicate these faults, and <Col N="2355" /> in future Irish timber should be made suitable for working.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the difficulty of transport.  In this connection we have to bear two things in mind, that where planting is undertaken in future it should be carried out in districts where transport facilities, especially to a railway station, are in existence. If planting is done for scenic purposes it does not matter very much because in many parts of the country where we want to plant for the sake of improving the scenery or the climate, the question of transport does not matter very much.  I know localities which have been planted, but it would be almost impossible to transport the timber.  Some of the trees are practically the size of Californian trees and it would take three men to span one of them.  If one of them fell it would be impossible to remove it. Proper precautions should be taken to prevent the destruction of such beautiful timber.  I would like to be assured that the trees that were planted on Arbor Day some years ago have not been destroyed or have not fallen into the hands of people who will make no effort to care them.</P>

      <P>In looking over the figures given by the Minister some time ago I find that no planting has been done in County Mayo, and I would like to know from the Minister the reason of that.  We were told that in Galway 1,376 acres had been planted, but in my opinion the land in Mayo and that in Galway do not differ a great deal as to their suitability for afforestation purposes. We have hundreds of thousands of acres in the Gaeltacht in Mayo which are practically useless at present, but I think that it would be suitable for growing timber.  I may be mistaken, but I would like if the Minister would tell us whether his Department has come to the conclusion that it is unfit for such purposes.  If they have discovered that, after experiments have been conducted, we would be satisfied, but I am assuming that they have come to no decision on the matter, and that they have not made experiments or made any inquiry into <Col N="2356" /> the question.  If that be so, I think it is rather a serious matter, and that the Department should be censured for that reason.  In the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission a strong recommendation was made to undertake afforestation schemes in the Gaeltacht.  Such schemes would give useful employment, and from the State point of view would prove a good investment.</P>
      <P>It was understood years ago that when the first chance would offer under an Irish Government a national scheme of afforestation would be initiated.  Still, no effort is being made by the Department at present to proceed with a national scheme of afforestation.  We have hundreds of thousands of acres, I suppose, of waste land in Mayo.  That certainly would be very useful if it were planted.  It would give a very considerable amount of employment, and in after years would be a very valuable asset to the State.  I would like to know from the Minister if the suggestion in the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission has been considered or adopted, or if the question of planting in Mayo has been put aside as not being practicable, or if his Department has considered the question of planting at all in Mayo.  I would further like to know why such a large amount of land has been planted in County Galway, while in Mayo, where the land is at least equally suitable, no afforestation scheme has been proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that in Mayo there are hundreds of thousands of acres of mountain land which to my knowledge has grown timber in the past.  It is quite easy to trace the remains of the forests there at the present day.  There is no question of doubt that the land is capable of growing any amount of the best timber, and in fact all classes of timbers that are native to this country. There is no reason, therefore, except lack of attention on the part of the Department, why it should not carry on these operations in Mayo as well as in every other county.  We have been told since our childhood that <Col N="2357" /> Clew Bay, off the coast of Mayo, equals the Bay of Naples.  Yet the area around that bay has not in any way been aided by the funds that might be expected to come from the Department for afforestation.  No scheme of any kind has been carried out on either side of the bay, while more acreage is available there for planting than the Department has so far planted in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Anybody who looks at the map can see that.  On the north side of Mayo there is a chain of lakes, and tourists tell us that that particular district rivals Killarney in its beauty; but there, too, no scheme of any kind has been carried out by the Department. If those localities had been given a little attention by the Department, there is no reason why they should not prove a very profitable investment for the country.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of transport is concerned, the train goes practically over the North Mayo mountains, to places where, if facilities were given, the trees could actually run down of their own impetus to the railway embankment. The argument of lack of transport cannot therefore be advanced as far as the districts to which I am referring are concerned.  It is considered rightly that the production of timber and its manufacture into planks or other forms for export or for absorption into local industries would be a very profitable business to encourage. According to replies which I have received to questions I put in this House for the last couple of years, the Department have clearly shown to me that they have no policy whatever for the planting of the Mayo hills.  We are anxious to get a little employment in Mayo as well as the people in Cork. I understand from the Cork Deputies that many schemes are being carried out down there.  I am glad to know that, but I would be more satisfied if a few more schemes were going on in Mayo, because we have a lot of unemployment there, and we would like to see some of the unemployed absorbed into industries.  Next to the production of food, I think there is nothing more important than the production of timber for our own requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2358" /> There are very few products that from the beginning to the finished article would give more employment than the production of timber.  I hope the Minister will have some other reply than that he has no schemes for the planting of the hills of Mayo.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is concluding I hope he will give us an outline of his policy for the future. Deputy after Deputy has risen here and expressed his disappointment with the general outlook for reafforestation in the country.  There is no doubt that the criticisms are well founded and what is proposed in this Estimate is not a reafforestation scheme whatever. One can see that the Minister has not any serious intentions of re-planting this country when one looks at the amounts that he proposes to provide for different schemes this year. I think it is ridiculous that the Minister should ask for a small sum like this, particularly when one looks at the problem and sees the enormity of it.  England is looked upon as one of the worst afforested countries in Europe, yet they have four or five times the proportion of acreage under forest that we have here.  We are certainly far and away the lowest country in that respect in Europe and yet we are only going to provide for 4,000 acres next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know whether it is the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance who is the nigger in the woodpile in this case.  Would the Minister for Agriculture like to see more money devoted to this Department? If he got double the money this year has he any schemes in the pigeon holes that could be put into operation whereby he could expend double the money in an economic way?  I do not blame the officials of the Forestry Department for the small amount of acreage. I think that they would have sufficient professional interest in reafforestation to wish to see it going ahead more quickly.  Many Deputies have pointed out that forestry work is an ideal medium for helping to solve the unemployment question, as a large proportion of the money expended goes out in wages to the workers.  The Minister <Col N="2359" /> says there are 200,000 acres which the Department considers suitable for afforestation.  I suppose they put in the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; there and they want to get a return.  The Minister only proposes to plant 4,000 acres per year, so that it is going to take him forty years to plant the entire area. I wish he would go to Russia for one thing and take the five year plan instead of taking forty years, and thus speed up the work eight-fold.  If we are aiming at providing for our needs in wood this 4,000 acres per year is not going to be sufficient.</P>
    <P>We will have to speed up afforestation by at least five or six times its present rate of progress.  I hope that Deputies will force the Minister to speed up his schemes in the future.  If the Department of Finance is responsible I hope that the Cumann na nGaedheal people will bring pressure to bear on that Department and so speed up the work.  It would relieve unemployment and help in many other ways.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the plea made by Deputy Dr. Ryan for the giving of grants to farmers where the area available for planting is less than five acres.  There are very few farmers who can plant five or six acres.  If we could get a couple of hundred thousand farmers to plant a half acre, or even a quarter acre, more could be done in one year than the Minister proposes to do through his Department in twenty or thirty years.  I do not see any reason in the world why a proportionate amount in the way of grants could not be given to the farmer who plants half an acre of a shelter belt.  The Department of Forestry can never popularise reafforestation if they insist on a minimum of five acre schemes.  Such a policy is not at all suitable to this country, where 55 per cent. of the farmers have less than thirty acres of land altogether.  Such farmers could not be expected to lay down five acres in trees out of that quantity of land. If the 55 per cent. of the farmers who hold under 30 acres of land were properly encouraged I believe a great many of them would plant half an <Col N="2360" /> acre or an acre of trees on waste ground, or plant an occasional shelter belt.  These shelter belts of a detached acre, or couple of acres, would do most of all to beautify the country. I hope the Minister will amend his scheme and make the grants available in cases where less than five acres are about to be planted, even for a half acre of land.</P>
    <P>The people appear to have lost all forestry sense.  As a matter of fact, they have no forestry sense at all. This is a matter that requires to be taken up in the schools.  Nothing has been done in the schools towards educating the people in that direction. In the Educational Vote for the Department of Agriculture we have been urging that something in this direction should be done in the schools. This is a subject that should be of considerable interest to children.  If they only spent half an hour in the week learning about the different types of trees, and if they were taught to gather pods, and so on, sew them and watch the trees growing, they would then have their interest aroused in these matters.  I wish the Minister would take some steps to get the Department of Education to take a little interest in this subject. There can be a lot of good done in that way inside a couple of years.  We have been talking of propaganda, but this would be the cheapest and most effective form of propaganda we could indulge in in the matter of forestry.  Children will take an interest in it when they are taught a few things about it.  They will pay more attention to questions of afforestation and of making trees grow than they would pay to a great many other subjects.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that everybody is disgusted with the slowness of the work of reafforestation. There is no excuse now for the little that is being done in this direction. We have the land.  The Minister has already acquired 46,000 acres, but he has planted only 26,000 acres.  There are 200,000 acres of land that the Forestry Department think particularly suitable for tree-planting as against any other crop.  The President, <Col N="2361" /> the Minister for Agriculture and many other members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party go around the country saying that our credit is good.  If our credit is good it should be good enough to get men who are drawing unemployment grants to work on schemes of this sort.  We have nurseries to plant much more than 3,000 acres.  The few nurseries that I see myself would supply plants for three or four times that amount of land.  I hope, if the Minister does not do this work this year, that next year, if he is in office, he will come in here with a scheme of afforestation that will make it possible to do the things that we have been urging, and not continue tinkering with it, as he has been doing up to the present.</P>

It will strengthen the hands of the Minister when he puts forward a scheme next year to the Minister for Finance.  As far as I can see, from the Party point of view, the net result of this debate is that the Opposition Party are to get the credit for increasing expenditure in the development of afforestation in this country, and the Government is to get the blame for putting on extra taxes or raising taxes in order to do it.</P>

A five-year plan is supposed to be a paying proposition at <Col N="2362" /> the end of five years.  I have yet to learn that any type of tree that can be grown becomes a paying proposition within that time.  The Deputy became very enthusiastic about tree-planting and referred to arbor days.  I understand that a large proportion of the trees planted at that time in a moment of enthusiasm were pulled up by the roots by the members of the R.I.C.</P>

It is regrettable that Mayo has been left out of any scheme.  I would put it as a suggestion that the Minister might make Mayo a self-supporting county in this respect.  If we could persuade the Minister for Finance to tax the production of poteen in Mayo and devote the whole proceeds of that tax to afforestation much tree planting would be done.</P>

      <P>Now that the Dáil has got sufficiently convalescent to leave the hospitals and get out into the woods, I hope the Minister will indicate to us his policy with regard to afforestation.  There have been disappointments all over the country at the attitude of the Forestry Department in the matter of the planting of trees and woods.  There is one matter on which I want some information with reference to the cutting of timber.  Within the last three or four months between Dublin and Wexford I noticed dozens of places in which timber has been cut.  Is the Minister satisfied that too much timber is not being cut?  This timber is exported in the rough state, in the raw.  It is not even sawn in this country.  In one particular case there had been a lot of damage done to a very beautiful plantation.  The Minister has ample powers under the Forestry Act of 1929 with regard to tree planting and tree cutting.  I wonder in how many cases has he exercised those powers?  In reading the <Col N="2363" /> local papers one sees where the small farmer who cuts a few trees off a ditch has been brought to the courts and prosecuted.  I suppose other people can get permission to cut trees.</P>
      <P>Another matter I want to refer to is the importation of trees and shrubs. I was informed that last winter trees and shrubs were imported from Belgium to this country.  I think the Minister should put a tariff on these imports.  They could be grown very well in this country.  Another matter into which the Minister might inquire is whether any timber can be grown in this country capable of making butter boxes.  I have been told that within the past month two large shiploads of butter boxes were landed in Cork.  Whether the timber can be grown here or not, we know very well the butter boxes can be made in the country.  This perhaps is not under the Forestry Vote, but the Minister might take a note of it.  He might also inform us what number of acres have been planted each year for the last eight or nine years and the cost per acre.  He might also let the House know whether three pounds or four pounds per acre is the highest price that the Forestry Department would give for land, and whether the money here in this Estimate will purchase 3,250 acres at £4 per acre?</P>
      <P>I understand that land must be free of all annuities before being taken over by the Land Commission. A great part of this £13,000 would go towards relieving the outstanding annuities on certain of the lands to be taken over.  If that be so, there will not be even 3,000 acres taken over during the present year.  With regard to the matters raised by other Wexford Deputies there is general dissatisfaction in Wexford because the Forestry Department have been so slow in acquiring land on the Forth Mountain.  This mountain as we are all aware is a commonage.  I understand that everybody has the same right to a commonage.  Nobody has any certain right in it.  I do not know if that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised by Deputy Dr. Ryan with regard to the plantation <Col N="2364" /> belonging to the Department on Camolin Park.  There is no doubt that the Forestry Department was responsible for breaking up the roads in that district.  A deputation of small farmers was promised that these roads would be repaired but nothing has been done yet.  I suppose it will be just like the Forestry Department, slow but sure.  I would like if the Minister would see that these roads are put in proper repair.  To do it properly it will cost something like £2,000.  The roads are absolutely broken up, and there is no use in spending small sums of £50 or £100 on them.  Because of the state of the roads the number of farmers cannot get into their land.  They were built originally on a bog.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kilroy raised the question of plantation along the sea coast. There are big tracts of land along the coast of Wexford that I would like to see planted.  Sea-pine, I understand, would be suitable for such land.  As regards the number of acres in respect of which grants will be given, I do not see why the minimum should be five acres.  I think the Department should reduce the acreage down to an acre, or even half an acre, and give farmers the trees and shrubs to plant.  In that way they would be encouraged to plant shelter belts along the roads and otherwise.  At the moment there is no encouragement to plant, and no trees are being planted except by the Forestry Department. No encouragement is given to plant fruit trees.  I do not know if that would come in under this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lot of propaganda and talk about afforestation in the past, but there was a considerable amount of that hot air.  Deputies have to remember that there are two very distinct limitations in any programme of tree planting.  On the one side you have bad land, and on the other good land.  It is idle to talk about planting hundreds of thousands of acres of land annually, or even in a period of five years in this country. Where are the hundreds of thousands of acres to come from?  It is only since 1930 that we have compulsory powers to acquire land for forestry <Col N="2365" /> purposes, and until we had these powers we had to get land by agreement. That causes a certain amount of delay.  Now that we have the compulsory powers the question arises: is there sufficient land in the country suitable for afforestation to enable us to carry out a programme of planting hundreds of thousands of acres in five years, even if there were no practical difficulties in the way?  There are not, or anything like it.  As I said before, the first limitation is, on the one side, good land which is suitable for planting may be suitable also for agriculture, and, on the other side, bad land is not suitable for planting and will not grow trees at all.  High bog will not grow trees.  It is because high bog will not grow trees that we are spending this £350 in making experiments in planting trees in the West.  Mountains over 1,200 feet high will not grow trees.  There are a great many classes of land that Deputies would class as bad land.  You want fairly good land of a special type for planting purposes.  If Deputies travel in other countries, on looking out of the trains they will see trees growing on what looks like rock, for instance, in Sweden or Switzerland.  They will ask why should not that be done in Ireland. There, again, special soil and climatic conditions are necessary for the planting of trees, as well as for the planting of crops, in those countries. Land on the Continent that looks poor contains mineral constituents for the growing of trees; in addition, climatic conditions are suitable.  Anyway, it can be taken not as experimental but as ascertained that in this country it takes fairish land to grow even soft timber, and it can be taken as definitely ascertained, except in very sheltered places, that timber will not grow on ground over 1,200 feet.  So that you have a very definite limitation on the one side, namely, that bad land is not suitable for afforestation.  On the other hand, take fair land that could be planted in theory.  Can it be all planted in practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Deputies spoke of County Mayo and said that there were hundreds of <Col N="2366" /> thousands of acres in County Mayo that would be quite suitable for planting. I cannot recall what the area of any particular county is, but I know there are not so many hundreds of thousands of acres of land in Mayo altogether.  Let us take it that what they mean is that there are large tracts of land suitable for planting. What are these tracts of land?  They are either upland or ordinary lowland, of poor quality agriculturally.  But look at the other side of it.  There are hundreds and hundreds of congests in Mayo whose holdings can never be brought up to an economic standard, and the first duty of the Forestry Branch is to see to it that they do not take any land which could be used for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputies talked a lot about mountains in Mayo.  We all know that a £3 or £4 valuation holding, with the rights of grazing on a fairly good mountain in a county like Mayo, is as valuable as a £15 or £20 holding in the Midlands, and that a farmer is able to make more out of it.  It would be nothing short of madness to take a very big portion of the mountain or hilly land that is suitable for forestry for that purpose, in view of the fact that it is so urgently needed for the other purpose.  Deputies can take it that when you come down to brass tacks and make the calculation there is not a very considerable area of land suitable for forestry which in practice can be taken.  Even though we have compulsory powers, we cannot exercise them, except in accordance with general policy.  We would not dream of exercising them to acquire land which, even though it was suitable for planting, was also suitable for mountain grazing.  If we did, and carried out that policy, all Parties in the Dáil would find it necessary to stop it in a very short time, and anybody who attempted such a policy would come in for very serious criticism.</P>
    <P>On the few occasions on which we began to apply the Act since it was passed we were up against very considerable difficulties.  Take the case of the Forth Mountain.  That mountain has been talked of for a long time and <Col N="2367" /> I have been making conditional promises for a long time about it.  But Deputies are not quite frank when they say that they have heard nothing about it recently.  Wexford Deputies ought to have heard something about it, because last March all the Wexford papers contained advertisements that the Forestry Branch had decided to take it over.  These were official notices published within the terms of the regulations made under the Forestry Act.  They were the first steps taken towards acquiring part of the Forth Mountain compulsorily.  Since then we have had a number of objectors. I do not know the Forth Mountain myself, but I do not believe that it is very valuable for grazing even. But, such as it is, we have had a number of objectors.  We have had a number of people who claim rights of one kind or another over it.  Luckily, we can dispose of them now, and we will dispose of them.  The case is listed before the Land Commission and I have asked the Department to see to it that the Land Commission hear that case this summer.  If I may be allowed to say something which is in contempt of court I presume that on the day on which they deal with these objections, if they overrule these objections they will place us in possession of the mountain. If they do, then we will begin planting on 1st October next.  That is the earliest we can plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>But take that case.  The Forth Mountain is a case which has been canvassed, the circumstances connected with it are well known in the Forestry Branch, and there is no necessity to send inspectors down there to see what are the equities, apart from the legal rights of the people who make claims.  We know that the land is not very suitable for grazing.  There is a large area of it, and we can take a reasonably big proportion without doing very much harm to anyone and we are proceeding in that way.  In nine out of ten cases you cannot proceed in that way.  We could, for instance, go into an area in Mayo of, say, 2,000 acres of hills which are under 1,200 feet and list it at once to be acquired <Col N="2368" /> compulsorily under the Act for afforestation and have notices published. Possibly these notices would be ignored by a number of people and it might be only when we had acquired the area we would find that while we were the owners of the land we could not in equity proceed to plant it.  We might find that it was of the greatest possible value to a number of congests who have rights of grazing on the mountain.  Anyway, whether it was or not, it is absolutely certain that they would make that case and demand compensation.  I do not think that a claim for compensation in that case could be resisted.</P>
      <P>Consequently, before putting into operation the compulsory provisions of the Act we have to make a certain examination ourselves and make sure, as far as we can, that the area which we are asking the Judicial Commissioner to acquire compulsorily for us is an area on which there are no real equities and is an area which we can take without doing any real hardship to anyone.  I think the policy of the Forestry Branch is quite sound in refusing to take areas which are under 300 acres.  The only case in which they take areas of less than 300 acres is where they have a forestry centre and where they take a smaller area adjoining it, hoping to get other small areas so as to make the whole ultimately into 300 acres.  If we made the unit less than 300 acres we would increase considerably the expenses of planting, and the expenses of supervision of fencing, maintenance, inspection and care afterwards are very much greater in a smaller area than in a bigger area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that our forestry programme was to try and plant 5,000 acres of land per annum and that what we aimed at was to have 200,000 acres of State forests.  That looks a small programme, but the fact is that we have not been able to carry it out.  The average amount of land which we could acquire for the last three or four years is not 5,000 acres, but about 3,500 acres.  We have been offered land in West Cork and Donegal and, in fact, half of the bad and useless land of the country. We have been offered land in all parts <Col N="2369" /> of the country, but a very high proportion of the land offered is quite useless for forestry and a very high proportion of the useless land has been offered in small lots which are entirely uneconomic.  It has been stated that we have planted very big areas in Tipperary and parts of Cork&mdash;not West Cork&mdash;and in Wicklow, whereas in congested districts like Donegal, West Cork, and Mayo we have planted nothing.  Obviously you are likely to get better land in the counties I have mentioned than in the poorer areas of the congested districts, and while we are very anxious to carry out afforestation schemes in the congested districts we have a handicap in these districts which we have not got elsewhere, namely, that the areas of land suitable for forestry are much smaller and much harder to get.  Of course, there are special circumstances in Wicklow and the land there is particularly suitable for forestry, but in counties like Tipperary and Cork you have very suitable forestry land and less congestion. For that reason we can acquire areas readily.  Are we to refuse to acquire these areas because we cannot get similar areas in Mayo and Galway? It was mentioned that there was a certain amount of land planted in Galway. None of the land there is poor land; it is mainly around Ballygar.  It is upland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think I explained that.  You do not require land at £1 per acre to plant.  The point I want to stress is that the idea that any sort of bad land will do for forestry is wrong.  I enumerated the classes of land that will not suit&mdash;land over 1,200 feet high and high bog.  Cut-away bog is very suitable, but cut-away bog is excellent for agriculture.  In any event, you have two classes of land that are not suitable&mdash;high bog and land over 1,200 feet.  You require a &ldquo;goodish&rdquo; type of land for the purpose of forestry.  You require land which very often is extremely suitable for the grazing of sheep and the wintering of cattle, for forestry purposes. <Col N="2370" /> You cannot exactly draw a line and say what is suitable for grazing and what is suitable for forestry.  The point I want to stress is that far the biggest proportion of the bad land offered to us was quite unsuitable for forestry, and it would be quite useless to plant it.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that high bog is unsuitable for planting.  I wish to contradict that, to this extent: In County Leitrim I have seen planting carried on very successfully on high bog in certain areas.  If the Minister would send down one of his inspectors there it might facilitate very considerably the experiments which are being carried out, because high bog has been planted very successfully there, and very useful timber can be seen there.</P>

      <P>I do not know the circumstances connected with the area the Deputy has mentioned.  Perhaps we do not mean the same thing by high bog.  I mean, by high bog, high bank.  Everybody knows that practically all the planting done in high bog has failed.  You have only to look out of any railway train to see that.  We saw a lot of bogs planted in the past, but there are certain things that are now past the experimental stage, and up to this we have failed actually in large areas of high bog.  You might have a very small area very highly drained, well-sheltered high bog, with some particular constituent of soil, where you succeeded, but I do not know anything about that.</P>

There is hardly an agriculturist Deputy in the Dáil that does not know that.  Deputy Maguire says that if you add some other constituent like gravel it would help the soil.  I am sure it would, but that is not the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, and it is because of that that we make the experiments that have been welcomed by Deputies on the opposite benches. These experiments are directed towards planting, not so much the special type of trees, but towards draining and in a special way planting trees with a view to seeing whether we can encourage by these devices the growing of certain kinds of timber on high bog.  If we ascertained we could, there would be at once very large areas of land available in the country. I dare say if we added a top coat of gravel on soil of that sort to ordinary, high bog we could plant it, but that process would be too expensive. What we are really endeavouring to ascertain is whether high bog as it exists at present can be planted.  I said we are aiming at planting 5,000 acres a year.  We have failed up to the present to get 5,000 acres of land per annum at a price of £4 per share.  We have been trying, and trying fairly hard to get suitable land.  We find it extremely difficult to live up to our programme. It is said that we should look for land and not wait until we had a general offer.  There is no lack of <Col N="2372" /> offers.  We have had numerous offers, but I do not think that we should lightly contemplate the employment of inspectors going round the country to see whether suitable forestry land is available.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Esmonde says, certain parties in the Dáil would like to be in the position of taking all the credit for getting more work done while giving all the blame to us for increasing the expense which may be necessary in order to get the work done.  I am not in favour of employing inspectors to go round the country to find out where suitable land for afforestation is.  I think it is the wrong way to do it.  We cannot be always going on pressing people to do things for their own advantage. You had exactly the same suggestion in connection with the shelter belts from Deputy Goulding.  He said he thought we should give some facilities for shelter belts and that we should put forward some scheme. Deputy Ryan suggested supplying trees free; and Deputy Goulding suggested giving some grant towards fencing and looking after them afterwards. Will there be anything left in the way of planting for anyone else to do if we are to do all these things?  A shelter belt is, after all, only a rood of land, and it is planted in October, November and December.  Surely a farmer could be expected to do that himself. What prevents him?  It is not the trees.  A hundred seedlings or transplants cost little.  Take that proposition. It is very illuminating from one point of view.  The work could be done in October, November and December. The cost is extremely small.  It is all unskilled labour, and could be done by the man's own labour and his sons'.  It is merely a question of fencing the land and making holes.</P>

      <P>Well, we will not fall out over the figure.  Let us take 7s. 6d. as the price of one hundred trees.  That would be quite a big shelter belt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Make it one hundred or two hundred.  How many farmers plant one hundred trees?  Let us take two hundred, at a cost of 15s.  For £1 he could plant large shelter belts.  That is the only expense except the expense of fencing, and that is very small indeed. It is all unskilled labour, and at a time of the year when there was very little doing.  It is not the expense that is stopping them.  After all, I think, with great respect to Deputies opposite, we would be all better on this occasion in concentrating on the farmer and not so much on the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that planting is an operation that could be done in a small way by the small farmer himself.  He has all the facilities, and he ought to do it.  He does not do it.  Everyone knows that there is no difficulty in planting trees.  The difficulty is in maintaining them and keeping them going.  Everyone in the Dáil knows that in places where trees were planted they disappeared in three years.  The Arbor Day schemes, for instance, have disappeared.  Then there was a question of unskilled labour in the winter-time.  No facilities for planting trees are any good unless you have the proper spirit in people for keeping them afterwards, keeping the fences up and preventing trespass. That is something farmers should do themselves.  There are under certain local authorities special facilities in the way of cheap trees for shelter belts.  I am as anxious as other Deputies to expedite the forestry programme of the Department.  Up to the present we failed to get more than 3,500 and 4,000 acres of land, and all I can undertake is that I will try to see whether it is not possible, now that we have the compulsory powers, to ensure <Col N="2374" /> that we will get the full 5,000 yearly. If we do we will do fairly well.  While I am on that point, Deputy Cassidy remarked that in answer to a question some time ago I told him that we planted 22,000 acres, whereas to-day in my statement I gave 26,000 acres.  His question asked how much we had planted since 1922, and the figures I gave were since 1922.  The balance was planted before our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures were from 1922 up to 31st March this year.  The figures he gave were that he had planted over 26,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is to take it that 4,000 acres were planted before 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that 1922 was the first year a Vote was taken for this particular Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there was a Forestry Commission there before that which planted.  I profess to give the total area of land which was planted by us or by the Forestry Commission which preceded us.  Of the 26,000 acres, 22,000 acres were planted since 1922; the balance was planted before it.  That is the position.  I was asked about the 5-acre scheme, under which we gave £4 for planting five acres.  It was suggested that we should make the unit smaller, make it two acres, or even half an acre.  If we do that, the trouble there is that it is easy to plant, but the important thing is to maintain the plantation afterwards.</P>
      <P>If we are going to give money we must have inspection afterwards, and if we had smaller units than five acres the inspection costs would be very high.  It was decided in the Department, having regard to inspection costs and the responsibility for seeing that five acres were properly planted, that anything less than five acres would entail considerable inspection costs.  We have got twenty-six applications this year, and we anticipate that as the scheme becomes known we will get more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is not known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be advertised. When there is money going these <Col N="2375" /> things get known.  There are £2,000 available for transplanting and for seeds.  We supply practically all the seedlings and the plants.  A sum of £150 is provided for seeds and a very small sum for transplanting special varieties, such as macrocarpa or new types of trees which we buy for experimental purposes.  The balance will be required for seedlings, a variety of which we produce ourselves, but of which we may be short owing to sowing a particularly heavy crop in an area.  We have reached the stage where we produce all our own seedlings and transplants, except what we require for experimental purposes.  I have answered the point with regard to Forth mountain.  With regard to the other place, Camolin, in Wexford, where the road was injured, I admit the Department has the same responsibility for that as any other user, and we would have to take into account the fact that it was users of the road cut it up.  We have made an offer there to the effect that we will supply labour and stones, provided the local people do something themselves.  So far as the Forestry Act is concerned, where large areas of timber are cut as a rule we made it a condition that they must be replanted.  We take every <Col N="2376" /> case on the merits, and I am informed that, as a rule, where large areas have been cut they are to be replanted.</P>
