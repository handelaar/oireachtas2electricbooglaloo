      <P>The work of the Depot during the last year was largely preliminary in character.  The branches of the business involved included homespuns and handwoven tweeds and knitted wear.</P>
      <P>Sufficient stocks of tweeds had been accumulated to enable the systematic marketing of these goods to be undertaken on 21st February of this year. The value of tweeds sold during March was £677 10s. 9d., and sales amounting to £614 13s.  7d., had been made during the preceding nine months.</P>
      <P>In the case of knitwear the policy is to bring into the Depot only the goods from the several centres according as they can be engaged exclusively on the production of the standard garments.</P>
      <P>The old stocks of defective goods which had accumulated at all the centres which were of a book value of £3,105 17s. 6d. were first sold off and realised £285.  Other goods of out-of-date pattern were sold for £551 17s. 4d.</P>
      <P>Adequate stocks of the standard patterns for sale under the trade mark have not yet been obtained.  The rejections which at the outset amounted to some 90 per cent. of the goods manufactured have now fallen to about 15 per cent., and stocks are gradually being secured.</P>

In the case of interchanges, particularly interchanges following hot on the heels of a by-election, it is difficult to know what was said.

      <P>Deputy Davin has made a statement which I again repeat is incorrect, that there is a measure of agreement between the Government and Fianna Fáil as to how the proposed £750,000 for the relief of rates is to be distributed. As a matter of fact, there are important differences between the two <Col N="1216" /> Parties in that regard and for that reason I would urge that it is unfair to the House to present a Bill of this importance and to expect us to take the Second Reading within a day.  I might say, after it has been circulated because it will not be in our hands until to-morrow morning and we shall not be in a position to draft reasoned amendments, if we wish to do so, between then and Friday.</P>

If we are putting down amendments surely members of the Government Party might be reasonably expected to get time to consider the Bill and express an independent judgment upon it. It is quite possible that the President of the Executive Council does not want members of his Party to use any independence of mind or freedom of action with regard to Government proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Justice I move the Second Reading of the Adaptation of Enactments Bill, 1931.  The existing Adaptation of Enactments Act enables statutes of the post-Union Parliaments to be adapted.  At the time that Act was passed no provision was taken to enable the enactments and statutes of the pre-Union Irish Parliament to be adapted.  Now it is proposed to take powers so that these enactments and statutes may be made fully applicable to Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister got any particular Acts in mind when he mentions that?  Is it just a roving commission on the several centuries of the various types of legislation or does it merely refer to the enactments passed from 1782 onwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to all Acts of the Parliaments previous to 1800.  I think that no case has yet arisen where it was not possible to get along without <Col N="1219" /> the adaptation, but in certain cases some difficulty was experienced, and it was with a view to the same possibility of adapting provisions of enactments that existed in regard to pre-Union Parliaments that this measure is now being brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>This objection occurs to one right off.  One remembers that during the British regime certain old Coercion Acts were refurbished.  Acts of Edward III. were refurbished.  It would be a very objectionable thing to allow any Government, no matter what Government is in power, to have this kind of omnibus Act, so as to be able to draw on various Acts and bring them to life again by Order.  There is a provision in the Bill that these orders should lie on the Table of the House, but it seems a very large measure of power to take all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a safeguard, as the Deputy says.  I do not think any question has yet been raised in regard to the hundreds of enactments adapted from the post-Union Parliament. We have had to adapt them wholesale.  Their adaptation largely meant that the term &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; was adapted to mean &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; Otherwise the statute could not have been read owing to changed conditions.  Hundreds of adaptations have been made, and one adaptation sometimes covered a great number.  I do not think that any question has ever been raised with regard to any one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very much more satisfactory if the Minister could mention a particular instance arising at the moment where he wants to adapt a pre-Union Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any one at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the power which the Government secures under Section 2 will merely extend to the adaptations necessary to bring enactments into force.  It will not apply to modifications in the purpose or the legislative effect of the Acts themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right.  It only makes them apply here.  The Irish Parliament operated over a greater <Col N="1220" /> area than the Saorstát.  For instance, there might be the Great Seal of Ireland used in one, and you might be adaptating that under the Seal of Saorstát Eireann.  That is the sort of adaptation that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 gives the Executive Council power to adapt or modify any statute of a pre-Union Parliament.  Apparently the mere promulgation of the order is enough to make the law valid and operative. Supposing an order was promulgated during the period when the Dáil was not in session, a considerable number of things might be done under that order to which the Dáil would naturally object, but even the repeal of the order under Section 4 would not tend to make illegal anything which had been done prior to the annulment of the order.  I certainly think none of these adaptations under Section 2 should be operative unless they are made during the period in which the Dáil is in session and has an opportunity of considering them and of dealing with them under Section 4. I do not think there is much in what the Minister has said in relation to the Acts of the Union Parliament, because after all the great majority of those have been passed within the last century or so and are within the knowledge of a considerable body of lawyers, but the great majority of the Acts that were passed by the pre-Union Parliament have been altogether forgotten.  The position in regard to some of them may be altogether uncertain.  It is quite possible that a Government which does not hesitate to abuse powers, as in the case of the order in connection with the demonstration at Bodenstown, might disinter a Convention Act when the Dáil was not in session and proceed to act in a perfectly legal manner, if the House passed the Bill in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think before this measure gets a Second Reading that we should have a considered statement from the responsible Minister showing the Acts which he thinks would come within the scope of this measure.  To give the Minister power to resurrect a forgotten statute and adapt and promulgate it as law during a period <Col N="1221" /> when the Oireachtas is not in session would be, I think, a great mistake.  I think the House would be guilty of a dereliction of duty if it were to put such wide powers in the hands of a Government which has already shown itself capable of abusing any legislative power it may have at the present moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive has been able to get on for a very long time without this Act, and the Minister, I think, should be able to show us why he is bringing it in at this time.  He must have some particular Act in mind that he wishes to adapt.  It seems to me there is no urgent necessity for it.  I agree with Deputy MacEntee that it is looking for rather wide powers.  The Bill does not even define the word &ldquo;adapt.&rdquo; The Minister confines it to a narrow meaning, simply indicating an area of territory as something to which it may apply.  I think it is capable of much wider interpretation than that.  We have adaptations and modifications.  It seems to me that there is no limit to the extent to which it may adapt or modify.  We are quite unwilling that the Executive should get that power and I would suggest to the Minister who brought in this Bill that if there is any particular Act which is the immediate cause of its production he should present that to us, with a list of any other Acts which he wishes to adapt and let them be adapted specifically. Let the Bill have definite relation to the particular Acts that he wants to modify.  It is a much better line of procedure.  This gives the Executive practically uncontrolled powers of adaptation, and we will oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Connell Mr. T. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the number of Acts that will need to be dealt with under this Act will be very small, if the Minister would insert in the Bill that if any objection is taken the order will not become operative until passed by the Dáil, it might meet the situation.  That is, the order would come up definitely for sanction before the Oireachtas. These orders would be very rare and that suggestion would give the House control over every order that would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1222" />
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this power has existed in regard to United Kingdom statutes.  I think the Adaptation of Enactments Act was passed at the beginning of 1923 and no question has arisen.  These matters are generally small and purely technical.  They all have been of the nature I have indicated&mdash;adaptation of the &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Lord Lieutenant&rdquo; to mean the &ldquo;Governor-General&rdquo; and that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>As I say, no difficulty has arisen and I think there are no grounds for suggesting that Acts which have ceased to be in force should be revived by means of these methods.  I do not believe that such a thing could be done. There is no doubt that if it were attempted you would have to deal with the courts in regard to it, and it is not worth while in dealing with one particular group of statutes to have a different procedure, especially as there may not be five adaptations altogether. I have no idea of how many there may be, and it is not worth while adopting any different procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why, on a mere technicality and in the numerous cases which are likely to arise, we should find ourselves unable to do something that requires to be done, or that we should be held up because the law said something about Ireland, that could not be applied to Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are so few cases involved why not adopt Deputy O'Connell's suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it worth while.  My objection is that it would be yielding to a suggestion which I think is almost ridiculous.  One might say that the power of adaptation of British statutes was a wide power, but it only appeared to be wide.  Perhaps even a majority of the statutes relating to this country, which were passed during the Union period, had to be adapted one way or the other by a general adaptation&mdash;a general adaptation of such and such statutes of the United Kingdom.  You have had this widespread power, and no difficulties have arisen and no suggestions have <Col N="1223" /> been made that there is any attempt to abuse any power or to indulge in any malpractice.  If there is a sort of suggestion in regard to what is a limited power that there is going to be malpractice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the House be asked to take the Executive Council on trust?  The powers of the Executive Council should be definitely limited in so far as the revival&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;of legislation which has become obsolete, and even so far as the making of new legislation is concerned.  The Minister says that because certain powers have been given to him under the previous Act therefore the House should grant him a wider power.  The original Adaptations Act has to be read and construed in accordance with the clause in the Constitution which says in so far as certain things are consistent with the Constitution.  There is no <Col N="1224" /> safeguarding clause of that type here. I think the clause gives wider power in this Bill than is given under the original Act.  If the Minister thinks not, why not accept Deputy O'Connell's suggestion that the Act will not be adapted or applied to Saorstát Eireann until the Adaptation Order has been laid on the Table of the House and tabled for twenty-one days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter from the lawyer's point of view. There are many of these old statutes which would be very inaccessible and they will be adapted.  People will want to make use of them and I fear there will be the greatest difficulty in gaining access to them unless some provision is made.  In fact, I think the whole thing is too short.  There should be all sorts of restrictions put into the Bill in order to make it satisfactory from the Government point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £39,879 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1932, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Coigríche agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riara na hOifige sin.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £39,879 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The Vote this year shows certain slight decreases as compared with the Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate last year.  There are certain small increases in the first sub-head, A, due to annual increments and salaries and also to the appointment of additional cadets.  The incidental expenses also show a very slight increase.  The rest of the sub-head shows a decrease.  In the main, the increase is due to the appointment of two new officials rendered necessary owing to the increase in the work that has to be done at headquarters. That is in itself due to the establishment of the consular offices abroad and the development of the diplomatic and consular activities of the Department.  The Passport Office shows a very definite decrease due to the fact that emigration to the United States is now practically negligible.  As before, when pointing to a certain slight saving this year, I would like to emphasise once more that that saving is one that cannot be looked for in future because the office is still extending and no guarantee can be given that future estimates may not have to be increased. There is a definite need making itself felt for this extension of consulate work in certain parts of the United States and we hope to get certain revenue from the opening up of certain new offices abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that the amounts received from the United States alone pay for the total cost of representation in the United States and leave a certain amount on hands. It is not, of course, certain that any addition to the staff, any opening of new offices in the States, will be reflected immediately in a proportionate increase in visa fees and other things abroad as some might be distributed over the States which are now coming into some of the offices which are there.  The activities of the Department I have indicated here on many occasions.  We are carrying on a general type of work on behalf of <Col N="1227" /> other Departments.  We are trying to develop trade from the Free State to other countries.  We are reporting back here on the state of the market in regard to any items in which probable exporters are interested and we are also making special inquiries where these inquiries are called for. The Department of Local Government has made very considerable use of my Department during the past twelve months.  I think there is hardly a Department of the Government which has not at some time or another put forward inquiries on which we have got to get the opinion of our people abroad.  Since I last spoke, of course, there has been an increase in the representation of other countries here. The two appointments that were mentioned this time last year have, of course, now been made.  We have, since I spoke last, received diplomatic representatives from France and Germany. We have now four representatives here, the two I have mentioned, and the representatives of the United States and the Vatican.</P>
    <P>The legal work of the Department has proved to be much more extensive and heavier this year than in any previous twelve months&mdash;work which is not reflected and can never be reflected in legislation, or even in documents that will appear before the House, because there is a vast amount of work which simply turns on the fact that we have very close and active good relations with the majority of countries.  Those of our nationals who are abroad, from time to time call on the Department for assistance, or, at any rate, involve the Department in a considerable amount of work in seeing that their interests are protected.  I might mention that in the year just ended the Department dealt with something over one hundred cases of administration of estates of deceased persons in which nationals of the country were interested; certain workmen's compensation cases and other cases in which compensation falls to be paid to relatives of deceased persons under a rule of international law.</P>
    <P>We have at present something less than two hundred cases of the administration of estates of deceased people. <Col N="1228" /> All these cases were matters which used to be dealt with by the British foreign offices, and they are now being dealt with by our own Consular establishments and in our own Department. We have to carry through the office an amount of intricate work in connection with the legalising of certain documents in which connection, of course, legislation was passed this year&mdash;the Commissioner for Oaths (Diplomatic and Consular) Act, which has empowered all our representatives abroad, both diplomatic and consular, to administer oaths and perform certain notarial functions.  The registration of nationals for various purposes is another item which falls to be dealt with by the officers&mdash;registration for purposes of diplomatic protection, for purposes of certain population statistics and also for purposes of nationality law.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next year legislation will have to be introduced here to make easier certain international activities which are now being pursued. It is our intention, as it was the intention of most countries in the world, to make easy the collection of evidence in a particular country where that evidence is required in regard to cases which are being tried before a foreign tribunal.  There will have to be certain Conventions and definite legislation introduced in order to cover these.</P>
    <P>Certain Treaties and Conventions or Agreements, other than League of Nations ones, have been entered into on behalf of the State since March, 1930.  There was an agreement re specting certain facilities given to merchant seamen for the treatment of venereal disease.  There was, of course, the Treaty brought before the House in connection with the limitation and reduction of naval armaments. There were two Protocols amending certain articles of the Convention for the regulation of aerial navigation; a similar Convention respecting load lines, and in addition special bilateral agreements were entered into with particular countries.  We had an agreement for the exchange of money orders signed in these countries between ourselves and Belgium; and an agreement with Norway for reciprocal exemption from taxation of the business of <Col N="1229" /> shipping.  We had the treaty with Germany which has been before the House and the treaty with France which is to come before the House before the Session ends.  In addition, we have exchange notes regarding commercial relations, on the whole providing for most favoured nation treatment with Egypt, Greece, Guatemala and Roumania, and have, on special items with regard to passenger ship certificates and emigrant shiy regulations, entered into an agreement with Italy; and with regard to a certain item of unemployment insurance with Switzerland.</P>
    <P>There are special types of legislation with which the House will have to deal quite soon.  Under the ordinary regulations which are in force in regard to States which have come into being, or which have emerged from an old State after a period of subjection we have the right to avail ourselves of the treaties which were entered into in the previous period.  We can, of course, denounce them and make new agreements if we like.  On all these matters, as it is necessary to keep the scheme of things going, we have adopted the plan of making new agreements, where new agreements seem to be ones which would operate immediately, or where they are immediately necessary, but in the main we only dealt with those which came up for urgent consideration.  In that way we have taken over and have accepted the rights and obligations under certain extradition treaties which had been concluded by the United Kingdom with forty different countries, and we have made use of some of them from time to time as the occasion arose. We propose to conclude extradition treaties with certain countries&mdash;as many of them as possible, and as soon as possible&mdash;and we will then have to implement them by legislation.</P>
    <P>Legislation will also be required arising out of the Opium Convention with regard to which a certain proposal was brought before the House. In order fully to implement what is contained in that convention it will be necessary to have legislation amending the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920. and that legislation is at present in <Col N="1230" /> the course of preparation.  There are certain international conventions which we would like to have signed, but had to postpone the signature because there was not a satisfactory state of things from the legislative point of view in regard to their provisions. One of these is the Protocol relating to arbitration, and another the convention relating to the execution of foreign arbitral awards.  For these certain legislation will be necessary, and I hope it will be introduced next Session.</P>
    <P>Certain international Labour conventions have been accepted by us, and some of them will require special attention under the heading of a Merchant Shipping Bill.  Four of them will possibly fall for consideration and special treatment.  We have already accepted these, and it is a question of how far, with the legislation we have at present at our control, effect can properly be given to those conventions. There will be, in addition to the extradition legislation, a special piece of legislation to be brought before the House possibly in the New Year.  That will be a Bill dealing with nationality.  It is a Bill which is to some extent required under the Constitution. It is not of immediate urgency, and cannot yet be said to be of extreme urgency, but a situation has now developed when a comprehensive code regulating the acquisition or loss of Irish nationality ought to be brought forward, and I hope to bring it forward next year.</P>

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister for External Affairs gave us some very interesting details of the activities of his Department during the past 12 months.  Undoubtedly, basing appreciation of the Department of External Affairs on the statement made by the Minister the office seems to be going ahead pretty strongly.  I thought it rather strange that the Minister made no reference to the outstanding events which his Department has been concerned in for the past 12 months beyond the cursory passing references to <Col N="1231" /> the numerous treaties and conventions that we have entered into and signed.  This Estimate for External Affairs is one of the most interesting Estimates we have to discuss in this House, and the people of the country know too little of the activities of the Department and its cost to the State. It is very interesting, going through the Estimates for the past nine years since the Department was established, to discover the progress made from year to year both in the number of offices opened and the expense accruing to the State.</P>
    <P>I find that since the Office or Department of External Affairs was established it has cost roughly half-a-million pounds&mdash;£494,494 to be exact.  We find that of that sum headquarters has cost £125,566, and representation abroad has cost £330,786.  When we see these figures we are compelled to ask ourselves: Are we really getting a return for the amount of money spent by the State in maintaining the Department of External Affairs?  Because I believe we are not, and because I believe the Department of External Affairs is not representing this country abroad to the advantage that it could represent it, if the services were properly utilised, I think the Dáil should refuse to pass this Vote.</P>
    <P>We find some very interesting details on examining this Estimate.  In connection with expenses I find that 35 officials are attached to the Department and receive £14,519.  Of these, eight account for one-half of the sum; the other 27 are poorly paid.  We find also that the Department has the unique distinction that outside the salary of the Governor-General, who has the highest salary of any official in the State, the next highest is paid to our representative at Washington.  We find also under the heading, cost of entertaining distinguished visitors, a sum of £1,250, and under the heading &ldquo;London Office&rdquo; we find an item of £100 for official entertainment by Ministers while in London.</P>
    <P>The expenses for official entertainment by Ministers while in London <Col N="1232" /> reminds me of a list of names I read in the Press at the time of the Imperial Conference when a reception was held by the Minister for External Affairs at Grosvenor House, Park Lane.  Reading through that list I found that the names, so far as I could scan them, consisted of every enemy this country ever had in Britain; every anti-Irishman in London seemed to be there.  I question very strongly whether under the title of Official Expenses for Entertainment the Dáil should pass an Estimate which permits an entertainment of that type to be given by the Minister for External Affairs either here in Dublin or in London.  Surely it is sufficient to know that we are not a free nation without having the added insult that where an entertainment or reception is held by the Minister everybody who helped to make this country a slave nation, a partition nation, seemed to be there as the guest of the Free State. The whole policy of the Minister for External Affairs, to my mind, is based upon that.  It is based upon the assumption that this country being free it is right and proper that those who opposed this freedom in the past should now be welcomed as its friends. Because the whole policy of the Department seems to be based on that false assumption, I think the Dáil should refuse to pass this Estimate.</P>
    <P>We find that in addition to the special Vote of £11,355 for the League of Nations we maintain a representation in Geneva at a cost of £1,717. From this representation at Geneva we find amongst other things pearls of wisdom from our representatives there.  I quote from Reuter of the 8th of June: &ldquo;Mr. Ferguson, of the Irish Free State delegation at the Geneva Conference on Unemployment and Economic Depression, referring to the statistics of unemployment, said that agriculture in the Irish Free State had not suffered to the same extent as agriculture elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Press of October 14th, 1930, we find at a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations when the Free State was elected as a non-permanent member, Mr. McGilligan said: &ldquo;Irishmen everywhere will be proud <Col N="1233" /> that their country has been chosen to be one of the fourteen nations in a particular manner, a creation to whose care has been committed the maintenance of peace and harmony in the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we find that not alone are our representatives abroad basing their activities on the false assumption that this is a free nation and that Irishmen everywhere should be proud of the status that we have, I am strongly of opinion that it would be far better to have no representative of any description in any country in the world so long as that policy continues.  The Irish Department of External Affairs could be made an instrument for putting Ireland's case before the world in a straight and clean manner.  Advantage could be taken of it by a National Government that really desired to advance further than the partitioned status we now possess.  Much good could be done, but advantage is not taken of it.  Not alone is advantage not taken of it, but on every occasion that the representative of the Irish Free State speaks abroad he speaks of Ireland.  This is not Ireland, it is only part of Ireland, and the false assumption is created in the minds of foreigners and in the minds of conferences at which our representatives are present that this nation is completely free, happy and content, and that we are quite proud, as the Minister for External Affairs says, of the status we possess.  Surely it would be far better for the Minister for External Affairs when he speaks over the radio or otherwise or at international conferences, for the sake of this country to utilise the opportunity he is given to insist that the exact position of this country should be made known to the world instead of bolstering up as he has been doing, and as our representatives abroad have been doing, since the Department was established, a status which the Irish people do not want.</P>
    <P>We find also in the Estimate a sub-head dealing with repatriation of destitute citizens of the Free State.  That interested me considerably, because one time I happened to have a communication from a mother whose son was in the merchant service and who <Col N="1234" /> had gone ashore in Genoa, in Italy.  It so happened that he got into a little bit of a quarrel with the Italian police and found himself in pretty serious trouble.  The mother asked me whether it would be possible to use the intervention of the Free State in order to get the sentence mitigated, or at least to secure that he would get justice. He did not know the Italian language, and she was afraid there would be discrimination against him because he was a foreigner.  I wrote to the representative of the Free State at Genoa. I did not even get the courtesy of a reply.  I wrote to the representative of the Irish Free State at Paris, and again I did not get the courtesy of a reply.  Finally a letter was received months later from our representative at Geneva to the effect that he had no power and had referred the matter to the British Consul-General at Genoa for further investigation, but the British Consul-General at Genoa, apparently not taking a tremendous interest in the nationals of our sovereign State, did nothing.</P>
    <P>Surely if the Irish Free State has the status, and if its representatives abroad have the status the Minister tells us they have, these representatives of ours at Geneva should be able to do something in that matter without referring it to the British Consul-General at Genoa.  Direct representations could have been made under the authority of the Irish Saorstát Legation at Geneva.  No such representations were made, and the only information and satisfaction we could get from the Irish Free State representative at Geneva was a letter some months afterwards informing us that owing to the very little power he had he was compelled to put the matter into the hands of the British Consul at Genoa.</P>
    <P>We find here an item, &ldquo;repatriation of destitute citizens of the Irish Free State.&rdquo; I would like details of what exactly repatriation is meant by the Minister under that sub-head, and whether any such case has occurred since this Department was established. It would be interesting to know how that sub-head was utilised, because, judging by the experience I have <Col N="1235" /> quoted, Irish citizens abroad seem to get very little consideration from the representatives of the Irish Free State. I have other instances, not alone of courtesy, but of the elementary business inability of some of our representatives abroad.  When asked for certain information, statistical or otherwise, there was not even the courtesy of a reply for months.  Surely if the Minister thinks that is the way to do the Irish Free State a service he is making a mistake.  He should at least see that even they should answer a letter.  If they can do nothing else, surely they can write a letter.</P>
    <P>Representatives abroad, since we must have the evil, could find work in another sphere where at present they do nothing.  One way I looked for intervention of the Irish Free State Legation in Washington was in the question of objectionable movies.  Two objectionable pictures were produced some time ago at Hollywood.  They represented Irish people in a way that even the Minister, I think, would not tolerate.  His representatives in New York allowed that insult to the Irish race and this film appeared on the screen for weeks, until it was shown in a city where there was an Irish population.  They stormed the cinema and got it withdrawn.  Surely that was a case where the Minister's representatives should have interfered for the dignity of this country if for nothing else.  No action was taken.</P>
    <P>Another useful matter in which they could occupy themselves would be the question of trade.  In November 1928 I suggested to him that it would be far better if we had a vote for trade representatives only, without all the paraphernalia which goes to make up legations.  The Minister of course sneered at the idea although his adoring mouthpiece from the South strongly approved of the suggestion.  One went so far as to suggest that the legations abroad should be abolished as they were not giving any concrete return for the money expended on them.  Another way in which our representatives abroad could do a tremendous amount of good would be to act as national <Col N="1236" /> publicity agents.  A certain amount of tourist propaganda emanates from the office of the Irish Free State in various countries but not to the extent that it could be utilised.  The volume of traffic secured is very small compared to the volume that could be secured even though representatives abroad did lower their dignity a little.  It would be giving some concrete return rather than the illusory stuff we read of in speeches made at conferences entirely misrepresenting the actual position in this country.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be any protest made by the Department of External Affairs to the gross insult offered to this State by British, Canadian and South African interference with the sweep held under the authority of the Free State Government. I know that the C.I.D.&mdash;not our bunch of geniuses, but those across the water in Scotland Yard&mdash; proposed to conduct an intensive campaign in respect of the Manchester November Handicap Sweep in the belief that if they can do it in time they will completely stop all tickets being sold in Great Britain.  No protest has been made by the Department of External Affairs to Britain in connection with the opening of mails. Surely the Minister can find some scope for the activities of his High Commissioner in London.  Even though the protest would be ineffective at least some evidence would be given that the Irish Free State Government was not lying down, as they always seem to do, whenever the British authorities see fit to interfere in any way whatever with our position here.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the misrepresentation of this country abroad is the question of international matches, where a foreign flag and a foreign anthem are used when a team claiming to represent Ireland takes part.  That is a question where one of the Minister's representatives might say something or do something.  When a team under any code, football or otherwise, claiming to represent Ireland, for which the Minister stands, and on which his speeches are based, takes part and foreigners find that the national <Col N="1237" /> anthem of Ireland is &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; and the national flag of Ireland is the Union Jack, there is a pretty clear shaking of heads when they see introduced in the Dáil a Vote for External Affairs.  I suggest these points are worthy of consideration, even if the Minister does not think them important or dignified work for his representatives abroad.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points which strike me in connection with this Vote. We have entered into a most-favoured nation agreement with Greece.  To what extent that is going to benefit the Irish Free State I do not know.  I would like to have some information on the matter from the Minister when he is concluding.  As I read it we agreed to impose a duty on Greek currants, not to exceed 2/- per cwt., and in return Greece agreed to accord most-favoured nation treatment to goods imported from the Free State.  In 1930 the exports to Greece amounted to £907, while we imported goods to the value of £52,600.  It seems that the balance is very much in favour of Greece.  We were informed to-day that the Minister is contemplating commercial treaties of a most-favoured nation type with Rumania and a few other countries.  I find that the trade figures do not at all reflect the extent to which notice should be taken by the Department of External Affairs.  These treaties, concluded on a most-favoured nation basis, are certainly very interesting from the point of view of trying to prove that the Irish Free State is an independent unit, but I would like to see some explanation as to what this most-favoured nation treatment is going to mean to the Free State.  If every favoured nation that the Minister contemplates having treaties with shows the same inconsistency and unequalled ratio as Greece, then I think the sooner his Department stops concluding agreements of that nature the better for this State.</P>
    <P>I expected that the Minister would have made some reference to the Hague Conference of last year, which dealt with extra-territorial limits.  We did not get any information from the Department of Fisheries, which was directly interested, and I thought that <Col N="1238" /> some reference would have been made by the Minister on this Estimate.  No such reference was made.  We found no reference to what happened at the Hague, what case was put up by our representatives, if any, or what action the Government intended to take.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil on November, 1928, the Minister, in the course of the debate, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department must be to consolidate internally the position of the Free State and to maintain and extend that sovereign and exclusive control of the State over all its internal affairs.</P>
    <P>Further, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Information in the form of trade returns is circulated to Deputies as to the activities of our foreign representatives, mainly in trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised the fullest information on what was happening in the reorganisation scheme at home and abroad.  If the type of information that we got to-day, as to the activities of legations abroad is the Minister's conception of full and complete information, his conception and mine are different.  We would like to know something more in that respect, and the only satisfaction we will get, I suppose, when this debate is finished will be very little information.</P>
    <P>A letter appeared in the American Press some time ago from a lady who visited Ireland.  I am sure the Minister's representative at New York has furnished him with a copy of it, because it was a matter which called for some comment on his part, or some action on the part of his representatives. It dealt with the treatment of Irish girl emigrants at Cobh.  I propose to read the letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am neither happy nor satisfied with conditions here.  I must have taken on some of the unhappiness and dissatisfaction I have come in contact with.  I went down to Cobh and witnessed some of the humiliations and discomfort that many shy, shrinking little Irish emigrant girls who will be carried over on the same boat with me had to undergo at the hands of the U.S. immigration doctors.  I was told this physical <Col N="1239" /> examination each had to undergo was the third since applying for their passports and then their little personal belongings were thoroughly gone over and fumigated.  These girls are healthy and robust and it would seem after the examinations they had to undergo before they got their passports the humiliations of the port of embarkation examination could very well be lessened or eliminated.</P>
    <P>Many complaints have been made about this matter before.  Surely, when the Minister speaks about our Nationals and about our citizens, and the protection that this State can afford them, here is a case where representations could be made to the American authorities either here or in America, with a view to mitigating the hardships which our people have to endure at Cobh.  No action seems to have been taken and our people have had to suffer disability without protest. The American Legation is not so far from the Minister's Department, and surely he could take some action or make some representations to the American Government to alleviate the existing conditions at Cobh.</P>
    <P>A very interesting matter, and one which I thought the Minister would refer to was the proposition with regard to partition put up some time ago in the daily Press by a member of the Northern Parliament.  The Minister made a pretty stiff reply at the time.  I thought some reference would be made to it to-day because it raises a very interesting problem, and brings before the people here an interesting outlook on the activities of Ministers and delegations at the League of Nations in Geneva.  There was no comment and no hope of any action, I presume.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not this be raised on the League of Nations Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. Mullins Mr. Mullins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, if the Minister wishes it.  Since the Minister wishes to have it taken on the League of Nations Vote, I agree.  We will allow it to stand over for the League of Nations.  Another thing that strikes <Col N="1240" /> me in connection with this Estimate is the absurdity of having representatives abroad claiming to represent the Irish Free State, who do not take any steps or use any influence&mdash;which the Minister presumes they possess&mdash;to counteract the impression that has got abroad that this is a happy and contented State.  The Minister will say, of course, that it is not part of the duty of his representatives to go around contradicting rumours.  Hence I think it would be very inadvisable that the Dáil should vote any money to send representatives abroad.  As I said at the time, it is only continuing to maintain the great fraud that was perpetrated in this country in 1921.  I thought we would have some information with respect to the legislation that would have to be introduced here in consequence of the Imperial Conference. We got some indication from the Minister that legislation of that nature would be necessary.</P>
      <P>We got no indication yet as to what the Minister's attitude, for instance, towards the Economic Conference to be held in Canada next year is to be.  We got no indication as to whether the Minister had any concrete policy in relation to that.  I presume that we may get some on the debate on the report of the Imperial Conference, but I thought that some reference would have been made to it in the introduction of this Estimate, under which head it directly comes.</P>
      <P>I want to protest also, as this seems to be the only opportunity, against the very notable broadcast over the radio made by the Minister for External Affairs to the United States of America on 9th November, 1930.  This statement was broadcast by the Minister for External Affairs:</P>
      <P>If you wish to understand the position of Ireland in the Commonwealth of Nations you must, first of all, realise that Ireland became a member of that group because she believed that her national aspirations could be realised to the full within the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to prove his statement by pointing to the victory gained by <Col N="1241" /> the Free State in the matter of the Privy Council appeals.  I object very strongly to the Minister for External Affairs or any other Deputy claiming to represent this country in not alone using that stuff here in Ireland, where it can be contradicted, but broadcasting that declaration of allegiance to the British Empire over the radio to the United States of America.  Surely our position is deplorable enough without broadcasting a declaration that is not founded on fact, and which the Minister knows is not founded on fact, that the Irish people believe that their national aspirations can be realised to the full within that group.  I would like to know what national aspirations he meant when he spoke like that. That was a very strange thing, that that declaration of allegiance spoken over the radio by a responsible Minister of the Free State Government was sent to our fellow-countrymen in the United States at that time as part of the Imperial Conference offensive, to my mind, against the United States, and as part also of the game of bluff which was being played by the British Prime Minister in connection with the round-table conference on India.  It was part of the scheme for which our Minister made himself a willing agent to assure the people of India, of whom we heard so much one time when this Treaty was going through the Dáil, on the authority of our most brilliant Minister for External Affairs and of our young Government, that this country was quite satisfied, and that it believed that its national aspirations could be worked out through the frame-work of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Surely the Minister could find some more inspiring thing to broadcast to the people of the world besides broadcasting a statement which he knows himself is contrary to established facts.  I think that a responsible Minister holding the responsible position which he does in the Free State should think twice and should carefully read over what he intends to say in a broadcast declaration of that type which will reach, not only the ears of a few people here, but millions of our fellow-countrymen in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> There is another very interesting point which emerges from this Estimate, and that is this question as to how far our status has got as a consequence of these conferences. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister who is the responsible person concerned, whether as a result of these conferences which were entered into, the right to secede from the British Empire has ever been insisted on by his delegation or himself. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance time and again reiterated that we can break away from the British Commonwealth of Nations without consequences.  Yet, during the past three weeks we have been reading speeches which plainly mean, taking the words of the Minister for Finance as they are, that an economic boycott against this country would be one of the consequences.  I would like to hear from the Minister for External Affairs, who has been conducting these negotiations, whether any attempt was ever made by his delegation or himself to assert that position, and whether it is in fact an established precedent or part of the Constitution and usage of the Dominion, that the Dominion at any time, if it desires, can secede from the British Empire without fear of immediate and terrible war.  If the Minister can get an assurance of that kind from the responsible authorities at the head of the Empire the delegations abroad would be worth while. Until he does that I do not see how it is much use voting money for representatives abroad, whose only function seems to be to get the Minister supplied with information upon what I do not know.  I say that because when an ordinary citizen writes to these legations he probably does not get an answer at all.  Another thing to which I thought the Minister would make reference when opening this debate was this question of what policy the Free State has adopted in connection with the statement from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons on 24th June, when, speaking in the Hoover proposal for a world moratorium for one year, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> We feel that we should be interpreting the wish of this country in deciding to offer to the Dominions and India the same concessions as are proposed to foreign countries under the same conditions.</P>
    <P>I thought that we would have some information on that as to whether the Minister has any policy, or whether his Government has any intention of pressing Great Britain to include this as one of her Dominions.  Or is it the position that whenever anything is to be given away this Dominion is recognised by the British as being very much a Dominion, but whenever anything is to be got this Dominion is not recognised except as part of England?</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister has any policy in connection with the proposed world moratorium proposed by President Hoover, and whether the Minister's Department has made any representation to the British Government in that connection, and whether we are included as one of the countries which will get the benefit of the proposal, or whether we will get the benefits that are to be given to the other Dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations?</P>
    <P>There are so many items in this Estimate that one would like to discuss that it is hard to get at them all.  There is one item which I notice there has been very little reference to.  That is the activities of our Consul General in New York in reference to trade.  Some time ago I had a discussion with an American business man who told me that there can be developed in the United States a splendid market for butter, bacon, eggs, etc.  He said that the one thing required was that the ocean steamers should be provided with refrigerating plant in order to secure a clean passage of goods to the other side.</P>
    <P>The Minister's agents in New York and Washington would be au fait with the representatives of the steamship company there, and if there is any hope of so developing a direct trade with the United States of America along this line the Minister's representatives would be well advised, I <Col N="1244" /> think, to take the matter up and do something.  Instead we find, although they were got into communication with and although the matter was put before the Consul-General in New York, nothing whatsoever was done; no representations were made to any steamship company on the lines indicated.</P>
    <P>I had a very interesting look through the Dáil debates the other evening and I discovered that at the first session of the second Dáil held on 17th August the following appeared in the report on foreign affairs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dr. MacCartan, our envoy to Russia, arrived there in February. A report from him lately to hand states that he had an interview with the Foreign Minister, who was pretty well informed on the Irish question.  After the interview Dr. MacCartan was asked to make his request in writing and was promised speedy discussion and decision... The Russian Foreign Office had got the idea that Ireland would compromise and this affected their readiness to recognise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to return to this question of trade with Russia, whether that has anything to do with the Minister's refusal to consider the possibility of opening direct trade with the Soviet Unions.  I think that he said some time ago in a debate here on a similar matter that there is no worse mistake than to mix up our feelings with business, and the question here with Russia is a business proposition.  You have 130,000,000 of people with a market that we cannot ignore.  If the Minister desires really to develop trade and commerce from this country to any other you have 130,000,000 of people, and even the United States, without formal relations with Russia, encourages trade.  To my mind it is in our interests and in the interests of this country that when the Soviet Union emerges from its period of trial it should emerge having no grievance against Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably hesitates to deal with that question of trade relations with the Soviet Union because of outside pressure, but I would suggest to him that when America, <Col N="1245" /> Great Britain and various other countries who are endeavouring to develop in the same way a market which they cannot afford to ignore and which they find it profitable to investigate and which they, in spite of all the terrible tales we hear of slave labour and the rest of it, find it profitable to cultivate, surely the Minister ought to take into consideration the possibility of this State getting some of that market and securing a grip before it is too late. I understand, too, that there is in that country a market for hides, wool and fish.  Of course one could not expect the representatives of this sovereign Free State to sell fish.  The Minister said that before, but at the same time if selling, fish, hides and wool brings in money to this Irish Free State and gives employment to people here the Minister's representatives would be well advised to abolish their dignity in favour of business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the opening of trade relations I find that the First Dáil did not seem to be such a weak-kneed body as the Minister is in regard to Russia. Part of his fear I believe to enter into any discussion with relation to the opening of trade relations there is the outside interference and the outside criticism that might afterwards occur, but I would suggest to him that when Ireland wanted these people they were good enough to be asked.  Surely if they are in a position now to assist us to develop a market and to find employment for our people in Ireland they should be worth entering into negotiations with for a treaty something on the sames lines as the most-favoured-nation treaty which we have entered into with various other countries from whom we get nothing and who buy nothing from us.</P>
    <P>To refresh Deputies' minds with regard to that question the following very interesting paragraph occurs in the Report of the first Session of the first Dáil, dated June 29th, 1920:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Acting President moved:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Ministry be authorised to dispatch a Diplomatic Mission to the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republics <Col N="1246" /> with a view to establishing diplomatic relations with that Government.</P>
    <P>The motion was seconded by Proinnsias O Fathaigh (Galway South) and put and carried.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to know whether the Minister has any intention of doing anything in that line, or whether it is the policy of his Department to ignore altogether the existence of that Federal Union in the East.</P>
    <P>Some time ago he said that there were three things emerging from the present position, one the British Commonwealth of Nations, the other the United States of Europe, and the other the Soviet Union.  I would suggest to him if he finds it interesting to talk about that, it should be interesting also to the people of this country to know that there might be a possibility of trade with that country if the Minister would only make up his mind, and be a little bit less afraid of outside criticism than he appears to be.</P>
    <P>Another very interesting matter in connection with this External Affairs Vote can be discussed on the Vote for the League of Nations, that is, the question of the Imperial Conferences. I do not propose to go into it except to say, in answer to the Minister's declaration of loyalty to the British Empire, we find the very strongest supporter of Cumann na nGaedheal policy in the United States of America giving him this answer, and I think by refusing to pass this Vote it would also give him a severe reprimand for radio declarations of that kind.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Gaelic-American,&rdquo; commenting recently on some of the utterances of Mr. Ernest Blythe, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland's destiny lies outside the British Empire, and there will be no permanent peace between the Irish and the would-be conqueror until the great ideal of our race is accomplished. If the final goal cannot be reached in our generation the task must be passed on to the next. There must be no pause in the struggle for an independent Ireland, and England to-day is, as well as in <Col N="1247" /> the past, the enemy, not the protector of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister should take heed of those words and in future when doing anything in the broadcast line should realise that it does not serve this country's interest and that it does not redound to the credit of this nation to be broadcasting statements which he knows are contrary to fact and which might lead other countries to believe that a state of affairs exists here which the Minister and everybody in this House know does not exist.</P>
    <P>I move that the Vote be referred back on these grounds and I hope, in referring it back, that the Dáil will give the Minister, as I said, a severe reprimand and make him divulge what his policy is and what the policy of this Government is in relation to foreign affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the main events in foreign affairs which have occurred during the past year will fall for discussion on the next Estimate or on the motion upon the Order Paper which is not being taken to-day, and that on this Estimate it will be matters of administration which will arise chiefly to be dealt with.  In his introductory statement the Minister, however, made a remark which will requires development if a misunderstanding is not to arise.  He made reference to certain international obligations inherited from the old United Kingdom and indicated that he considered, or was willing to accept these obligations as binding.  He mentioned that a number of treaties relating to extradition had already been accepted and were in operation.  It is a matter of concern for this House if obligations not entered into with special consideration for the requirements of the people of this State can be imposed upon us other than by Vote of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it should be made quite clear and definite whether or not these obligations&mdash;that is, international treaties entered into by the United Kingdom prior to the establishment of the Free State&mdash;are binding on us, and if the Government accept them as such.  I <Col N="1248" /> do not think it possible for the Minister to pick and choose amongst them, to select some as worthy of acceptance and others worthy of rejection.  Either they are all obligations of ours or none of them, and no doubt as to the position should be allowed to remain.  I have some slight hope that a doubt which has emerged from a number of recent discussions in this House would be at last resolved in consequence of one sentence used by the Minister.  In his speech he stated that ratification of the treaty with France recently signed will be secured before this session ends.  Now, the doubt I refer to is the meaning of the word &ldquo;session.&rdquo; We discussed it here the other day; we discussed it in the past. What is a session of the Dáil?  The Minister has informed us that the treaty will be ratified before the end of the session.  Does he mean before the end of the year, before the next general election, or before next Friday week?  He quibbled upon that word when we were discussing the motion in relation to the General Act.  He has now used it himself in a manner obviously intended to give information to the House.  I am anxious to give him an opportunity of defining it and to state exactly what he means.</P>
    <P>I think it desirable that he should inform us of the progress made concerning other similar commercial treaties which are either in negotiation or contemplated.  He made reference to a number of such treaties when this Estimate was before us last year.  Only one of these has yet reached the Dáil. Another, we are informed, is likely to reach it within that problematical period, this session.  When will the others be forthcoming?  I think that, in introducing his Estimate, it was the duty of the Minister to give us a general review of these matters, so that the House will know exactly where it stands in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Since last year two trade reports have been published, one relating to the work of the Trade Branch of the High Commissioner of the Irish Free State in Great Britain, and the other relating to the work of the Consulate-General of the Irish Free State at New York.  However much we may feel dissatisfied <Col N="1249" /> with both the form and substance of these reports, the fact that they are available at all is something for which we can be glad.</P>
    <P>Deputies have in the past repeatedly pressed the Minister to make some such reports available regularly so that we could be informed as to the work done in these foreign offices for which we are paying.  A step has been taken in that direction and we trust that it will not be a mere flash in the pan, but that these reports will be followed by others relating to the same and other offices.  Deputies who have read these reports were, I am sure, struck by their different nature.  The report from the London office deals exhaustively with the work of the branch on behalf of Irish trade in Great Britain without giving any indication of market possibilities or dealing with the difficulties with which our exporters have to contend.  The report is, in fact, a long list of exhibitions held, shopping weeks organised, store displays, the cruise of the steamship &ldquo;Killarney,&rdquo; and matters of that kind. The report from the New York office, on the contrary, deals with the market position and possibilities exclusively and gives no indication whatever of the work done to extend our trade in the United States of America.  I wonder would it not be possible to secure that in future we would get from both offices reports dealing with both these matters&mdash;both the work of the Department and the possibilities of the market available for our produce in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the report from the London branch I note from the Estimate which we are discussing that the position of the Commissioner for Trade has been amalgamated with that of High Commissioner.  Is the abolition of that office an indication that the Minister has been dissatisfied with the work done by the Trade Commissioner in the past or does it mean that he has now discovered that there was no work for such an officer to perform, and that the work available and hitherto performed by two officers can be satisfactorily executed by one?  The report contains little of importance but it embodies a recommendation that the <Col N="1250" /> amount hitherto available for trade propaganda should be increased.  I should like if the Minister would give us an explanation of his attitude concerning that recommendation.  Does he think that expenditure worth while? As far as I have been able to discover there is no provision in the Estimate for trade propaganda at all.  I would not be averse to such expenditure if it could be shown that good results were likely to accrue.  Certainly the moneys which are made available for entertainments and similar purposes can be much more usefully expended upon such propaganda work.</P>
    <P>The report from New York is more interesting and more valuable.  It deals fairly exhaustively with the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that they are all here, I hope they will go away wiser. I have to instruct members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party about things in reference to which they are obviously ignorant.  I was dealing with the report recently published from the Consulate-General of the Irish Free State in New York.  I do not suppose Deputies have read it, but nevertheless <Col N="1251" /> it contains matters of interest about which they should be informed. Deputies who wish to follow up my remarks on the subject will find a copy of the report in the Library.  If they read it they will be a lot wiser about the condition of our trade in New York and about the difficulties with which our traders are faced there.  Deputy Davis will be concerned about a paragraph dealing with Gaeltacht industries. He, on occasions, pretends to be interested in the development of these industries.  It is stated here that there is quite a possibility of extending the sale of their products in the United States of America.  That is a matter which ought to concern Deputy Davis. It concerns most of the Deputies of this Party who come from the West of Ireland, and if Deputy Davis wishes to look after the interests of the people in the Gaeltacht he will get that report, read it, and learn what it contains, then endeavour to get into contact with the Minister for External Affairs and discuss with him what can be done to deal with the difficulties of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are others also who might read it and I am delighted that Deputy Davis has taken the unprecedented action, as far as Cumann na nGaedheal is concerned, of insisting on their coming into the House to hear of it.  The most significant parts of the report deal with the position of our woollen manufactures in the United States markets.  I would be glad to know if the Minister has taken any steps to convene a meeting of the manufacturers under the auspices of his Department for the purpose of discussing this report and seeing what can be done to safeguard the markets which they hitherto had in America and of which, according to the report, they are beginning to lose their grip.  The market there, of course, is affected by the trade depression, but the references made to the increasing competition from England, France and Germany have particular significance, and the suggestions made concerning the patterns and marketing arrangements should be brought forcibly to the notice of the people concerned. <Col N="1252" /> The publication and the preparation of the report can be of very little value to us unless we take every step necessary to ensure that the recommendations contained in them are brought to the attention of the people concerned and acted on by them.</P>
    <P>I think, also, important notice should be taken of the paragraph dealing with the increased competition with which our producers of bacon and hams have met and which, it is stated, they are likely to continue to meet in the American market.  In view of the position in that industry, the decline in production, the obvious alarm with which persons engaged in it are facing the future, any further diminution in our external market would be of serious consequence.  We would be very interested to know what the Consulate-General in New York is doing to safeguard the interests of our industrialists in the situation which he describes so well.  As I have pointed out, the High Commissioner in England omits to describe the position, but he tells us what he is doing.  His report is practically valueless if not accompanied by a report relating to Britain similar in nature to the report which I have quoted from New York. Similarly the report from New York is valueless unless accompanied by a report from that area similar to the report we got from Britain.  It is of little value to us to have an officer in the United States for the sole purpose of sending us information of that kind if that officer is not at the same time organising, in conjunction with the Department here and with the manufacturers at home, for the purpose of making greater headway in that market.</P>
    <P>Therefore, although these reports are defective in form and substance, they are nevertheless welcome because it shows a tendency in the Department of External Affairs occasionally to do as the members of the Dáil wish.  Our principal request in the past has been for information which has been most unreasonably withheld.  Might I call the attention of Deputy Davis to the fact that some members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have again left the Chamber and that if they continue <Col N="1253" /> to leave, a quorum will not be present in a short time?  It might look then as if Deputy Davis were not taking his duty as chairman of the party so seriously as we had at first thought.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would tell us what is the position of the negotiations in regard to the Irish Lights Services.  Certain statements have appeared in the Press to the effect that negotiations as to the type of machinery to be established for the control of these lights had broken down.  I think it is time that the Minister gave to the Dáil and to the country information both as to the manner in which the negotiations have proceeded, the case which he has made and that which has been made by the other side.  What exactly is he contending for?  What exactly has he failed to get?  What is the cause of the failure of the negotiations?  How is the position likely to develop in the future?  The position, as I understand it, is that the Treaty provides that the Government of the Free State is responsible for the maintenance of these lights, buoys, marks, etc.  I do not imagine for a moment that the Minister for External Affairs would attempt to evade any of the obligations of that sacred document. The suggestion has been made that he is trying to do so.  If so, I hope he succeeds, because it would be a useful precedent to have established.  Certainly that particular obligation of the Treaty has not yet been undertaken by him and we would like to know why.</P>
    <P>I would like also if the Minister would tell us what further steps he has taken, if any, to secure anything in the nature of reciprocal arrangements in relation to unemployment insurance.  I would like that information with particular reference to the Unemployment Insurance Act passed by the Belfast Parliament which was a matter for discussion at an International Labour Conference and which was referred to in this House when the Estimate was under discussion last year.  Has nothing further been done in the matter?  Has the Minister forgotten all about it?</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister's concern <Col N="1254" /> with the German minority in Poland, and the Ukranian minority in the same country, and other matters of that kind, outweighs his concern for anything relating to that part of this country from which he came.  Perhaps if we remind him occasionally he might succeed in taking some little action to deal with some of their grievances.  In this matter particularly we may succeed, as it is one which affects the citizens of this State as well.</P>
    <P>These are the principal matters to which I wish to refer.  I am particularly interested in the matters arising out of these trade reports which have been published, and I should like if the Minister would tell us if we had good ground for hoping that similar reports will be available in future, and if so, when, and from what offices; and if he intends to act on my advice and have these reports supplemented as I have suggested&mdash;a report from London similar to the report from New York, and a report from New York similar to the report from London.  The other matters dealing with external affairs which are of much more importance and significance will be discussed at another time on other motions.  Deputy Mullins has moved that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. We propose to support that amendment. We think that the administration of the Department is open to criticism and that the Minister has done nothing either on this occasion or on other occasions to meet such criticism as has been forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention on this Vote, and that is the question of certain agents from outside this State who have been earning for themselves a very odious reputation, who have been guilty of certain crimes and faults outside this State, and who have been purporting to act in this country as agents to obtain money for Irish citizens due under the administration of estates in America.  I think this is a matter to which the Department should give considerable attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of money constantly coming to this country from <Col N="1255" /> Irish people who die in America and elsewhere.  Undoubtedly two or three of these agents have been collecting this money and making representations to poor ignorant people here, who are easily defrauded, and in some cases these people have never received any of the money due to them.  I think the Minister would be very well advised to adopt the practice which has been adopted in Switzerland, where a Department of the Government acts on behalf of the people who are to receive the money and makes sure that they get it.  It would be analogous in a way to the Public Trustee in other countries for other purposes.  It would be a very valuable thing and it could easily be made a self-supporting institution if the Government were to undertake the work and see, when people die in America and there are people in this country to whom money is coming from them, that they should afford the amplest protection to the citizens of this State.  If the Minister wishes, I can give him details of the cases I know about afterwards.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mullins moved to refer the Vote back on the ground, first, that it is too expensive an office.  It was remarkable that in order to get a case for expenses he had to run ten years together.  Of course he could get a much better case by running sixty years together and simply presenting a large lump sum which would appear extravagant to people who took that sum and did not even bother to consider what was the work done for it.  I take the Departments here year by year and the amount of money expended on it, and indicate through reports and statements here what work is being done, and on that have to rely for the approval of the House.  Deputy Mullins thought fit to refer in very peculiar language to a reception given last year in London when he said that, as far as he could read, all the enemies of Ireland had assembled together. First of all, English papers will notice the particular people who please them, and it is not always safe to rely on the Press reports.  For instance, if <Col N="1256" /> there was a particular paper reporting a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party, it might be the new recruits like Deputy Geoghegan who would be specially picked out and not the people who represent the old bull-dog breed of nationalists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass might not be mentioned, and the names of these people would give a peculiar colour to Deputy Lemass's gyrations at the cross-roads.  People might think that there was something appropriate in his being so often at the cross roads.  We have a representative at Geneva in addition to all the money spent on the League of Nations, and that representative cannot carry out the particular function which Deputy Mullins would have assigned to him.  The Deputy says that he failed to have repatriated an Irish sailor under conditions which the Deputy described.  Deputy Mullins wrote on his own, not here, but to our representative in Geneva&mdash;a rather funny choice.  He also wrote to Paris, and he says he got no answer.  I cannot make any comment on that, as I have not, at such short notice, and at such long range, been able to get in touch with these two persons, and cannot indicate whether or not an answer was sent and failed to get him. At any rate, there was a sailor who had, according to Deputy Mullins, some little difficulty with the police. The Vote for the repatriation of destitute subjects of this country has very little to do, I am afraid, with the particular type of person to whom Deputy Mullins referred in these circumstances.  He made a peculiar statement after he had passed from that subject, &ldquo;That our representatives abroad, since we must have the evil....&rdquo; Yet, in fact, when his complaint about a sailor who had difficulties with the police is analysed it comes to this, that in the end our representative at Genoa, not being a representative at Genoa, had to apply to somebody who was at Genoa. So that what Deputy Mullins was com- <Col N="1257" /> plaining of was that we had not the evil of a foreign representative at Genoa.  How it is supposed that our representative at Geneva should be able to carry out functions which are, on the face of them, rather specialised in connection with a particular seaport, I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also was very wrath over certain statements made by representatives who go abroad from time to time.  He quoted one statement made recently that agriculture had not suffered to the same extent here as elsewhere.  That is a comment that has not only been made by an Irish representative at Geneva, but it has even been brought into the report on the economic depression of Europe, in which the position of agriculture here and the particular specialised type of agriculture that is dealt with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the quotation made from the speech of one of our delegation at Geneva to the effect that agriculture here had not suffered to the same extent as elsewhere. I said that that statement need not be queried as coming from any of our representatives because it is embodied after impartial and outside examination in a statement drawn up by an economic committee of the League dealing with world depression, and this country was singled out as one of the few that had stood the stress of economic depression.  Further on the Deputy made some criticisms and comments on the assumption that this country is a free nation, and Deputy Mullins's claim is that the case of Ireland should be proclaimed to the world in a clear, outspoken fashion which has not been done.  In that vein he quoted from a speech made in America in which I used a phrase not to his liking:&mdash;&ldquo;that people here believe that their national aspirations could be realised to the full within the group of nations known as the British Commonwealth.&rdquo; I was rather proud of that phrase because it is the exact <Col N="1258" /> phrase that occurred in a famous letter that brought Deputy de Valera to London on a rather short but very calamitous visit on one occasion when Deputy de Valera was invited there to find out how far the national aspirations of Ireland could be reconciled with a continuance of the British Empire. I was careful not to bring anything about the British Empire or allegiance to the British Empire into my speech.  I used the phrase that certain aspirations could be realised to the full within the group of nations known as the British Commonwealth. To that I adhere and the basis for it is that the Treaty has won support at every period at which it has been put before the country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy feels it is a matter for complaint against the Department of External Affairs that it has not protested against the action taken in England against Sweepstakes activities. I do not know whether that is one of the statements upon which Deputy Lemass supports this motion, but if it is, it is rather peculiar that recently his Party was of opinion that sweepstake activity here would promote diplomatic action against sweepstakes; that they were interfering so much with the ordinary course of law in other countries.  I have not seen myself and have not been told that anything happened of an illegal or extraordinary type in any of those countries with regard to this, and there is nothing against which a protest could be made.  Then there were some comments of Deputy Mullins about certain international matches where he said the Irish team took the field under the wrong flag and to the wrong anthem.  I have no knowledge of any such thing happening. I know that both here and abroad there are certain teams which do not play the proper anthem; they do not play any anthem and they do not purport to play anything in the nature of an anthem, and so far as I know the proper flag is flown universally in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement with Greece is queried on the ground that the balance of trade is entirely against this country.  Deputy Mullins expressed <Col N="1259" /> the hope that no other trade agreement would be entered into with countries which are, to use his phrase, based on the same inconsistent ratio of trade as in the case of Greece.  The attitude I have always taken to these treaties is: I move upon them as, and when, I realise that the manufacturers here require trade agreements to be made in order to have their goods sold abroad and I make them with the countries where these people insist upon the necessity of having conventions made, and Greece arose as a special case.  If we waited until the balance of trade rectified itself in every case complaints would be made that because the balance of trade had rectified itself was a reason why no commercial convention should be concluded.</P>
    <P>The remarks I made with regard to the sweepstakes and the international matches apply in some degree to the emigrants at Cobh.  I have not had yet properly indicated to me what could be described as a humiliation for anyone who has to leave the country. Even if that was so, it must be remembered that the American Government insists upon particular standards of examination for health as well as other purposes for persons who leave this country to settle in the United States, and that the final control of these regulations rests with the American Government.  If we object, there is an easy way out.  People need not subject themselves to this humiliation if they do not like.  But if there was humiliation or anything in the nature of an examination of an unusual type in the case of emigrants, that can be taken up on particulars being given to the Department.</P>
    <P>I am not going to speak in this debate on the Ottawa Conference.  It will more properly arise in any debate that may take place upon the Report of the Imperial Conference.  Similarly with regard to what is being said about the Consul-General in New York and the activities suggested for him with regard to the development of trade, and that ocean steamers should be fitted with refrigerators, I thought that representations of that kind should in the first instance come from <Col N="1260" /> the people concerned either to the Department of Industry and Commerce or External Affairs, and that we could then have a discussion as to the value of the suggestions and whether they were likely to be taken up.  So far I am without any suggestion of that kind.  Deputy Mullins complained that I have refused to open up trade relations with Russia.  If that is a fact I can only say this, that in dealing with Russia there are quite a number of considerations that have to be taken into account which do not occur in the case of any other country.  These mainly arise from the particular type of Government there.  The ordinary commercial convention or trade agreement which operates in countries where ordinary commercial industrialists operate in an individual way of business, proceeding on the basis of the ownersship of private property, does not operate there.</P>
    <P>These particular agreements will have to be changed considerably when one is dealing with a State which controls, in fact, through Governmental activity, most of the trade and commerce of the country.  It would be a matter of extreme difficulty if there is any serious approach on the question of trade relations with Russia to get an arrangement of a proper type with such a Government.  I am merely speaking of the ordinary agreement which would have to be made and which would not suit conditions in this country, as the Russians have a new system.  There would be other objections which would have to be met as well.</P>
    <P>As to the international obligations of which I spoke, we have inherited a certain number of these and we can accept them or refuse to accept them in regard to particular countries and treaties as we please.  As a matter of fact we have afforded certain extradition treaties in regard to particular cases.  There is no doubt that practice will be allowed to continue until such time as we have entered into a new course of making extradition treaties and of having legislation to implement it.  The French treaty will appear for approval before the two Houses next week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> The points of criticism that have been passed upon the trade reports will have to be considered so that the form may be altered if necessary.  As I listened to them I was not impressed, even if they did appear in a different form, that the criticisms would not have been any the less.  I would have expected that industrialists themselves would have seen fit to get these reports themselves and to have discussed them. I can have them brought before the Advisory Committee in each industry.</P>
    <P>The Irish Lights Services, which seemed at one time to be approaching an agreement, are now in the old state. The old circumstances did not embarrass me in the slightest.  The services have been carried on, and this country does not suffer any financial sacrifice with regard to them.  It would be a definite handicap to speak at any length of the difficulties that have occurred.  There is a reasonable prospect that these difficulties will disappear. There has been very little activity with regard to the Northern Ireland Insurance Act this year mainly because Deputy Lemass, by a foolish intervention in the debate last year, forced the declaration that it could not be stated that that Act broke the International Labour Office Convention. That being the case, we were correspondingly weakened in any advance we might make to the Northern Government.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's nature would run to that type of comment. There are times when I feel myself embarrassed by the dictates of Parliamentary procedure from properly describing the Deputy, but I manage to get the Deputy properly described on occasions.  I assert that the Deputy came in in a blundering fashion to the debate last year.  He made points wrongly.  He went so far wide of the <Col N="1262" /> mark that I had to correct him.  I said that I thought it was not a debate that should be engineered here at all. I pointed out the bad consequences that would follow.  What I said has taken place.  I had to reveal the case to the Deputy in order to correct the absurd impression he was making.  He had not studied the Northern Government Act.  That gave a real loophole to the convention.</P>

I hope he will realise that owing to the small staff there is abroad, and their different types of duties, it will be a matter of difficulty to get the representative we have in the United States to attend to a very big number of cases.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,355 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for a Grant-in-Aid of the Expenses of the League of Nations and for other Expenses in connection therewith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote shows a certain increase, part of which is under sub-head A&mdash; Grant-in-Aid of the Expenses of the League of Nations.  This comes under <Col N="1263" /> a particular basis.  We pay our share of whatever the increase in any year may be.  In addition there is an increase in Sub-head B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;due to the fact of our being elected on the Council and in consequence of many more visits having to be paid to Geneva.  The Budget of the League on which the Vote depends is subject to a very elaborate procedure of examination each year at the Assembly.  Attempts have been made from time to time to get that very narrowly confined, and they have succeeded in the main in having the Vote kept reasonably low.  Suggestions have been made from time to time that a particular sum should be set out, and that no increase on that should be allowed.  On that point we have, as members of the delegation, not ever accepted that particular suggestion, because we think that the activities of the League should be judged according as they are brought forward and according as any new suggestion is made.</P>
    <P>If the suggestion is a tolerable one we think the money required should be voted.  We have an easier task in that matter, because we pay only 1 per cent. of the entire budget.  It is much easier for us to bear an increase than some of the larger countries upon whom the extra amount would weigh much more heavily.</P>
    <P>The work of the League is laid before the Deputies each year by reason of the report issued after the annual delegation of the Assembly in the autumn of each year.  A very full report was published last year summarising the whole work of the Assembly and of the various technical and finance committees.  There are two or three important points which call for consideration just at this time in connection with the League of Nations Vote.  There has been a considerable misunderstanding for a great number of years apparently in this House with regard to the economic policy of the League and considerable criticism has been directed at the Irish Free State delegation from time to time for their appearance at certain meetings called for certain purposes <Col N="1264" /> and at what they say and do at these meetings.</P>
    <P>The economic policy of the League has in the last two years centred almost entirely on Europe.  In 1927 an Economic World Conference was called, and that, as its title indicated, had a scope definitely outside Europe.  Even while it was being discussed it was clear that it was the European economic system, and the other economic systems that had failed everywhere, that were discussed and that adjustments were under consideration. The World Conference of that year was not in the main made up of representatives of Governments. In fact, it was clear before the Conference started, and from speakers in introducing resolutions from the World Conference afterwards to the respective Parliaments, that the Conference did not in any way bind Governments.  The people who voted did not vote as representing countries. It was more to be regarded as a collection of experts in various matters who met together to take into consideration certain governmental and national difficulties that there might be about the solution of different problems.  These experts met in order to put their heads together to see if there was any solution possible at that time for the difficulties into which the world was drifting.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of that Conference has been always carelessly described as being anti-tariff&mdash;anti-excess tariff.  That specially-set-out phrase showed that on one occasion, when a particular resolution was being passed, one of the delegates objected to the phrase because it was too general of application. It referred to the movement against tariffs.  Our delegate called attention to what he thought was the unfortunate wording, and it was explained to him by a number of delegates who had gone through the sub-committees that that particular phrase was the result of a compromise.  It became clear that the phrase was intended to cover bargaining and excess tariffs, but not ordinary tariffs which any country would bring in for the protection of industries which it thought fit.  A certain <Col N="1265" /> direction was given to European economics by that Conference.  The various impediments to trade were brought under review, prohibitions, export bounties, troublesome customs formalities, and a definite view was expressed by a majority of financial and business people who had a special interest in shipping and wanted to see the greatest movement in trade activity. At any rate the suggestion of these people was towards simplifying trade relations in Europe.  Special attention was called to the position of economically backward countries or to new countries which had hitherto been dependent on agriculture.  Special reservations were made with regard to them.  Because of that, a number of European States who were agricultural States but had ambitions otherwise, decided to accept the report, and on this basis our delegates accepted it. As I say, they explained their position in speeches that were made at one of the committees dealing with industry and commerce, and finally in the Assembly.</P>
    <P>The 1927 Conference had, in fact, very little effect.  From that until the autumn of 1929 the tendency of Europe was distinctly in favour of tariffs, rather than against them, and tariffs tended to increase rather than to go down.  That being the case in 1929 when the question was beginning to be felt the Assembly of the League decided to make a collective effort to bring down the level of tariffs, aiming mainly at the high and extravagant tariffs in some countries of Europe, and they decided that a special Conference should be called.  That Conference is generally referred to as the Tariff Truce Conference and it had three meetings since.  The third meeting took place last year and it definitely showed that there was not any very strong support for the proposals put forward under the description of &ldquo;concerted economic action,&rdquo; which was generally against tariffs, aimed at stabilising tariffs for a particular period, and they went on to suggest that action should be taken by way of bi-lateral agreement between countries to see that tariff barriers were further lowered.</P>
    <P>While that Conference was having <Col N="1266" /> these operative meetings special emphasis had been laid on the European situation by the action taken by the French Foreign Minister who, in 1929, during the course of the Assembly, convened a meeting of representatives of European States and put before them proposals for what he described as an Economic Federation of Europe.  That Commission afterwards became bound up as part of the League, tied on to the ordinary economic organisations, and meets under the auspices of the League round about the time when Council meetings or meetings of the Assembly are being held.  It has had a variety of meetings and, on the whole, has been barren of results.  It is too early yet to say that there will not be results from it, even on the side of tariff adjustments, but so far very few have taken place.  Any that have taken place have taken place either as a result of the Tariffs Truce Conference or as a result of the meeting of the Council for the European Union.  People who have been disappointed with the results of these meetings can form small groups of their own, but there is a philosophy behind the European Union which might preserve it and give its activities in future a great deal more importance than they have secured in the past.  The difficulty of Europe, as seen from Geneva, comes roughly to this: That the situation in Europe is based upon the Peace Treaties, that there have been certain territorial divisions in relation to these Treaties, and although they are supposed to be sacrosanct, and people are unable to revise them for the time being, they have certainly demonstrated, in more ways than one, that they are economically unsound divisions.</P>
    <P>The purpose then at Geneva is how to get over the worst features of the bad division of Europe from the economic aspect while keeping political divisions as they are.  There are two schools of thought.  One is definitely for revision of the whole peace arrangement, the rearrangement of boundaries, the better dispositions of people and so on.  The other hangs on to the present distribution of peoples and territories in Europe and seeks <Col N="1267" /> to mitigate the worst effects of it by lowering all the barriers which nations erect, one against the other.  So you have proposals for freer movement of goods, and freer movement of peoples and for the better treatment of foreigners by the different States of Europe.  It is quite possible that the philosophy which lies behind these European proposals may lead to success in the end, because undoubtedly as Europe is at the moment the limitation of armaments would probably prevent new alliances leading to new barriers.  Any attempt to secure readjustment would provoke new alliances, whereas if territorial adjustments in Europe can be softened by doing away with these national barriers which people erect against one another the difficulties of the geographical situation may not be so keenly felt.  That is a point of view which certain people hold.  They definitely urge along the line of European solidarity as opposed to the original activities of other peoples.  Most European nations have decided on forming regional groups.  There has been one group amongst Scandanavian countries in Northern Europe.  There were unsuccessful attempts between Germany and Roumania and arrangements between Jugo-Slavia and Roumania.  Then there was a special treaty adopted to which so much attention was directed in the Spring. That was the arrangement between Germany and Austria.  Those who urge European solidarity believe that these small groupings make more effective barriers against people outside, and if there is to be any lowering of barriers it must be done by a general movement throughout Europe and not solidarity in certain areas.  That struggle still goes on. Meantime the economic depression goes on.  Ministers of different countries abroad who look back to their own countries think of the difficulties that may be caused by a reduction in tariffs.  A little bit of sacrifice here and there from the standpoint of national industry might be worth having in the long run and might lead to the better distribution <Col N="1268" /> of goods.  Finance and agriculture have both had a certain importance attached to them from the European standpoint.  In fact, the only positive thing that has proceeded from any of these various groupings recently has been the movement to set up the International Credit Corporation in order to assist certain of the more depressed countries in Europe to get into a better condition.  As far as we were concerned, the International Credit Corporation held out no prospect of advantage because although it was signed and signed solidly and with obvious eagerness, by some fourteen countries, the view expressed at Geneva was that nations would not succeed in getting money from this International Credit Corporation at any less percentage than eight or nine, and for some countries it was in fact five points higher. Our own Agricultural Credit Corporation would provide money at a much less percentage and consequently there was no advantage in our joining from that point of view, but there was advantage from the point of view of the benefit it would do and the sum of money which we would be called on to contribute was infinitesimal in comparison to the total.</P>
    <P>Further there was clear evidence that it was the wish of a number of States to make the Corporation function at once.  One of the activities that was advertised as amongst those which the Corporation would have to attend to right away was that of lending money to Austria, so that Austria might change over from her particular type of agriculture to the livestock business, and it was clearly obnoxious for this country to be lending money for the purpose of engineering rivals to herself hereafter. There have been quite a variety of activities in connection with these Conferences.  The economic situation is, as I say, recognised by those who meet at Geneva from the point of view of Europe to be very bad.  Yet, all these financial and business people and statesmen, meeting together, find themselves unable to get any agreement for alleviating the distress of <Col N="1269" /> those who are suffering depression most acutely, or for getting Europe into a better state.  The views generally expressed at Geneva, in the Spring of this year were of the most pessimistic type.  It looked as if all the sympathy for certain countries was going to be of little effect in face of the distress which was settling down in certain of the countries of Europe. At the moment, Tariff Conferences have come to an end.  The Committee for European Union has one positive thing to its credit, that is the International Credit Corporation, and it is proceeding with an examination of a variety of other things, but anything that emerged as late as the Spring promised no hope of early readjustment of economic conditions in Europe.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that will have to be faced in the Autumn.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>While this is going on in the matter of the economic state of things represented at Geneva there has been an endeavour to make some definite progress in the matter of disarmament. A draft convention in regard to disarmament was drawn up and the date of the general disarmament conference fixed for February next.  The draft convention is a disappointing document in some ways.  It is drawn up with certain schedules, and there are certain figures which will be filled in. The fact that there was not an approach to finality on some figures would augur that there was not a likelihood of success.  The fact that there are certain things omitted&mdash; trained reserves and war material&mdash; would argue very little in the way of success next February.  But some progress has been made.  There was a definite reluctance for years to approach the question of trained reserves or war material in the circumstances of almost completely mechanised war. The things that were vital and proper for a discussion and solution were being avoided, and so clearly avoided that it would have been worse than useless to call the disarmament conference while these things were avoided.  There are certain gaps in the document, and blanks where <Col N="1270" /> figures should be.  Still it is to the good that people have clarified all these points on which there is likely to be disagreement, and are preparing their own arguments as to what figures, if any, should be put in, and what amounts, if any, should be put down to trained reserves or war material, and the things to be faced up to in the general conference for disarmament purposes next February.  If one is to judge by the speeches made by the Foreign Ministers at Geneva from time to time, it is apparent that the acuteness of the economic depression has driven them to realise that expenditure on armies and war material is so much waste, that the money could be better used, and that these things are extravagances of a harmful type which should be definitely got rid of.  The document is a disappointment from the point of view of the small nations, who hoped to see a very big advance, or at any rate a definite reduction of armaments, if not complete disarmament.  Delegates from this country will be instructed to support everything that has for its object disarmament and to make everything proposed for that purpose or end as comprehensive as possible.</P>
    <P>While an approach has been made in this way by getting nations to meet in a friendly humour for this purpose, other things had to be attended to in order to induce that humour.  Security has been sought by certain countries and sometimes by what appears to be improper avenues.  There was one Convention in the way of an approach to security.  In addition there were also things I have spoken of here in the General Acts where nations have bound themselves and subjected themselves to the criticism of public opinion if they do not act by their guarantees in such things as the Kellogg Pact and the Optional Clause of the General Act which we had here some time ago.  It is quite impossible, of course, to say what changes may come before February and whether the fact that depression is still growing in Europe may have brought about such national changes that the Disarmament Conference may meet in an atmosphere that could not lead to proper results at all.  Provided that <Col N="1271" /> could be done, there was apparent a disposition to get down to facts and to the discussion of vital details of this whole matter of armaments.</P>
    <P>Various countries have complained that certain types of armament are things which do not matter.  Other countries feel that their special type has been singled out for publicity and attack.  On the whole there is a good disposition.  There was one phrase used by one delegate.  It was not controverted and it seemed to be accepted as one point of view with regard to the Conference.  This delegate referred to a certain disposition going on and said he did not attach so much importance to the publicity that was going to be given of the detailed information that was going to be laid before the Conference by certain Governments who made this clear that they were going to suffer only a certain percentage of deductions in their disarmaments.</P>
    <P>He said it was his opinion that any nation which came to the Conference in regard to disarmament by Europe comes there for disarmament.  That was a movement that seemed to lead further on.  That statement was not controverted.  I would not like to say that it was accepted.</P>

      <P>This is a Vote that has, for us, very little significance, and I do not propose to delay the House discussing it very long.  The chief event in relation to the League of Nations which happened during the past year was the election of the Free State to a seat on the Council of the League. That matter itself might not call for much comment were it not for the fact that members of the Government Party blew the Party trumpet so vigorously following on the event that it might be useful for them and for others to examine its history for the purpose of discovering whether it was the victory they pretended, or whether it was a reverse.  There are possibly some members of Cumann na nGaedheal who have taken an interest in the League of Nations and the part played in it by the delegates who attended it from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> Early last year it was announced that the Government had decided that this State would be a candidate for election to the Council.  It was generally assumed then, both in this country and abroad, that the Government's claim for election was based on the thesis that the seat to be vacated, which was held by Canada, was a British Dominion seat and that, as such, the only rivals for election would be members of the British Empire with whom an arrangement could be made. However, during the course of the year opposition to the system by which members of various groups, such as the British Empire, went forward in rotation for the non-permanent seats on the Council, was forthcoming from various quarters.  When that opposition developed the Government here changed its tactics and, on the 29th August, 1930, the Minister for External Affairs announced that the Free State was going forward, not as the representative of any group, but on merit alone.  That announcement appeared to cause some concern amongst the delegations from other British Empire States.  It is not clear that all those States are opposed, as the Free State pretends to be opposed, to the group idea.  Some of them may not be so confident of their merits as the Government here and may not see any prospect of election to the Council unless the group idea persists.</P>
    <P>On September 11th it was announced that the various delegations from the British Empire States had met and decided unanimously to support the Free State's candidature.  No further particulars of that meeting were given in the Press.  There was certainly no mention whether any conditions were attached to the support that was to be given.  The suggestion that some conditions were attached was denied here on Friday last by the Minister for External Affairs.  We have, of course, to accept his statements on matters of this kind, although we know, and have had it demonstrated to us within the last half-hour, that he is capable of making misstatements on matters of fact when it suits.  However, he said no conditions were attached to that <Col N="1273" /> support.  Although there has been some indication of a change of policy on the part of the Ministry following on their election to the Council, we cannot be certain whether any definite understanding was made.  The Free State was elected.  We were informed by the Geneva correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; on September 18th, that the announcement that the British Commonwealth delegation had decided to support the Irish Free State doubtless influenced other States to do likewise.  These other States were influenced, and the Free State Government was elected a non-permanent member of the League Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, who was a member of the delegation last year, returning home in a burst of enthusiasm, wrote an article for the official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal and described that election as &ldquo;a striking testimony of the international esteem in which the State was now held.&rdquo; Other States were also elected, such as Guatemala and Peru, and I am sure the Ministers for External Affairs of those States are also telling their people that such election was a striking testimony of the international esteem in which their countries were held.  The election of the Free State is of particular significance, for it would appear that instead of being &ldquo;a testimony of the international esteem in which the Free State was held,&rdquo; it could be more accurately described as an indication that the group idea is likely to persist, as the Portuguese objection, which is referred to in the Report, would seem to indicate.  It is stated in the footnote to this Report that the Irish Free State &ldquo;presented its candidature,&rdquo; not as a member of any group of States, but purely on its merits as a State member of the League of Nations.  While it is probably accurate to say that it presented its candidature on its merits, it appears to have been accepted because the majority of the delegates desired that the group system should be maintained, and the Free State, although presenting its candidature upon its own merits, represented the group idea and was elected in consequence. &ldquo;Such a result,&rdquo; said the Minister for <Col N="1274" /> Education in the article I have referred to, &ldquo;would have been unthinkable were the views of some opponents of the Free State on our status shared by the nations of the world.&rdquo; I do not know if many members opposite are sufficiently familiar with the constitution of the League of Nations to know how nonsensical that statement is.</P>
    <P>Every member of the League, which includes self-governing Dominions and Colonies, is eligible for election to the League Council.  India could be elected a member of the League Council, and I do not think there are many here who believe that such election would be held by Indian Nationalists to indicate that the status desired for their country had been attained.  Of course, the Indians are in the fortunate position that they are not geographically adjacent to the centre of the British Empire, and cannot be influenced to the same extent as members of the Executive Council here.  If, as is likely, the Free State's election by the League was merely due to the fact that its turn had come in rotation to get on the Council, to occupy the seat which, since the inception of the League, has been held by a British Dominion, then it is wrong for members of the Executive Council to misrepresent that election for the purpose of creating false ideas amongst our people as to the status of this part of our country.  We are a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire.  Nothing can disguise that fact, and it was as such that we were elected to the position on the League Council.  Such election did not affect our status one way or the other, and did not prove anything in relation to the argument that has been going on in this country since the Treaty was accepted in 1921.</P>
    <P>For the past two years we have received, after meetings of the League Assembly, reports published by the Department of External Affairs in relation to its work, giving special emphasis to the work done by members of the Free State Delegation.  We are asked now to vote money for the up keep of the League and presumably that request is based upon the reports <Col N="1275" /> that have been circulated.  Deputies are presumed to conclude from these reports that the work done by the League is so useful that it is worth our while taking money from the taxpayers of this country, in order to maintain it.  I am certain that any Deputy who has read these reports thoroughly can have received no other impression than that the whole institution, and everything in relation to it was wrapped in futility.  There are, I think, six Committees of the League, on each of which we had a representative, and an account of the work done by these Committees is contained in the report.  I said the work done. There was certainly an amount of time spent in discussing questions, but nothing was done, and nothing of any consequence was even attempted. Matters that came before one or another Committee were discussed at length, and then adjourned until next year.  That was the usual fate of any proposition made there.  Why important members of the Executive Council of this State and other important officers of the State should waste their time for a month or so in the year, attending meetings of such Committees, it is hard to say.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister for External Affairs, I know, has rather peculiar ideas in regard to this matter.  He spoke some months ago to a meeting of the Dublin Rotary Club and dealt there with our foreign affairs and our attitude towards them.  &ldquo;Countries like ours,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whose geographical and political situations enable them to take a more or less detached outlook on international affairs,&rdquo; are particularly useful in the Councils of the League.  When we have in charge of our External Affairs Department and leading our delegations to these international conferences a man who considers our geographical and political situation as being a detached one, permitting of a detached outlook, we are heading for danger.  When it suits the propagandists of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to draw attention to our geographical proximity to England and the fact that such proximity means that in trade and polities we must <Col N="1276" /> necessarily be greatly influenced by English developments, they do so. When it suits them to pretend that such geographical proximity cannot influence them, they do so.  But leaving the geographical part aside and concentrating our attention upon the political independence of outlook, to which the Minister refers, we want some proof of its existence.  In what way is it possible for any responsible public man in this country to take a detached outlook on international affairs because of our political situation? Surely our political situation, the realities of which no Deputy can ignore, is such that a detached outlook is not possible and, if possible, would be most undesirable in any public representative of the country.</P>
    <P>However, these people with the detached outlook went to the League meeting and there succeeded in doing nothing as magnificently as the delegates of any other country.  The first Committee considered the codification of international law, and decided to adjourn the question until the next session.  They then considered an amendment of the League's Covenant to bring it into conformity with the Kellogg Pact.  It decided to circulate its report to the various States for their observations.  The Committee then discussed a proposal to confer on the Permanent Court of International Justice jurisdiction to act as a tribunal of appeal in respect of arbitral tribunals established by States.  They decided to refer that matter to the next Assembly.  The work of that Committee might have had some importance for us.  It is of prime concern to a small State that the rule of the law should be substituted for the rule of fighting power in international affairs.  The first step towards that end is the codification of international law, but the whole attitude of the League seems to be to avoid doing anything to assist such codification.  It is true that the Free State delegate tried to get a committee set up to consider questions relating to it, but he did not succeed.  The matter was, as I have said, put back until the meeting of the next Assembly, and presumably when the next Assembly takes place solemn-faced delegates will <Col N="1277" /> attend there from all countries and decide to adjourn the matter further until the following year.</P>
    <P>The second Committee did little more.  But the work of the second Committee had some significance in relation to the particular circumstances of this State.  We have in the past expressed the view that the whole drive and purpose of the League in economic matters is in the direction of free trade.  We have expressed the fear that our Ministers attending meetings of the League Assembly and steeping themselves in the atmosphere of the League might make commitments that would bind their hands in the matter of tariffs or give them a wrong conception as to their duties. This is what appears to be happening. We have the rapporteur of the second Committee summing up the discussion as follows.  He said that &ldquo;the inadequacy of national action as a means of solving the world economic problem, the value of regional economic agreements&mdash;in particular European agreements within the organisation of the League&mdash;the evils of excessive protectionism and the necessity of endeavouring to remedy them are now fully recognised.&rdquo; We have the Minister for Education explaining that his Government &ldquo;are somewhat averse to tariffs,&rdquo;&ldquo;are not keen on tariffs,&rdquo; although when pressed he had to admit that they could find no other means by which a country situated as we are could redress the adverse balance as between industry and agriculture.  We have the Labour Party described there as a Free Trade Party, and the Labour Party weakly accepts such a description.</P>

      <P>That is right.  The tendency, however, which we have noticed developing to a considerable extent in members of this Government to deride anything suggestive of protection, to deride national action as distinct from international action for the solution of our economic difficulties, appears to have been acquired at the League, and the whole purpose and the drive of the League appears to be in that direction. In addition to the waste of time and futility involved, the danger that particular Ministers attending League meetings may put themselves into a position that will debar them from taking whatever action circumstances here seem to require for the economic development of the country is not to be ignored.</P>
      <P>The third Committee considered a curious proposal that has been under consideration for a considerable time and which is described at the Convention of Financial Assistance.  Of course, Deputies will remember that one of the purposes for which the League of Nations was presumably established was the elimination of war. This is a Convention the States accepting which agree in certain circumstances to finance war.  It is true that the financial assistance can only be given when a majority of the League Council decides so to give it and to fix the amount of it, but these two matters are of little concern when we consider the principle involved.  If the members of the League were particularly anxious to prevent war one would imagine them producing a Convention, the States signing which would bind themselves under no circumstances to give financial assistance to States at war, but the particular Convention we have signed pledges us to mortgage our credit so as to give assistance to States at war in certain circumstances. The Minister for External Affairs has signed that Convention and presumably he will come to the Dáil shortly asking us to ratify it.  When he does we will be able to discuss it more fully, but from the information relating to it which we have been able to procure I think the Dáil would be very foolish to give the ratification asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What advantages are we getting <Col N="1279" /> from our membership of the League? I want that question answered.  I have read carefully the speeches made by the Minister in relation to the work of the League both in this House and outside it and I have not been able to discover that any advantages are accruing to us.  He said that through the League we maintain contact with countries with which we have not got at present diplomatic representations. That may be some advantage, although it is a very minor one.  Personally, I would prefer the method of direct representation to contact through an institution of this kind, our membership of which is based upon an acceptance of a status which, whatever may be said about it, certainly does not represent what the national aim of our people has been.</P>
    <P>We are told also that the international environment in which the Ireland of the future has to live, is being made in Geneva.  If that is so, the indications of the environment they are producing, which we have received, are such that it would seem very advisable that we should detach ourselves from it as speedily as possible.  If there are any advantages to this State coming from our membership of the League we want them clearly stated.  We want it shown to the people that it is worth their while spending a considerable sum of money which could be put to some other purpose for the maintenance of the League, for the payment of our membership fee if I may so describe it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us a long lecture concerning the philosophy of the French plan for the unification of Europe.  I do not know if many Deputies listened to him with attention. He certainly brought in quite a number of matters with which the people of this State have very little concern.  As I have said before, our control over our foreign policy is very limited, and our Department of External Affairs should be more concerned with the abolition of the ties which make it impossible for us to adopt an independent line, and which may ultimately involve us in conflict <Col N="1280" /> with States with which we have no quarrel, but with which some one of our co-equal partners in the Commonwealth may disagree on some matter of vital concern.  If the Minister will leave the general theory of the matter for discussion at the Rotary Club or some such institution, and when he comes to this Dáil deal with the practical side and state the material advantages which we get as a result of this expenditure, it would be very useful. He has not done so yet, and I think he has an opportunity of doing so now which he should not neglect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has gone back again in the same vague way to the insinuation which he made on the General Act, that our position when we stood for the Council of the League was not an independent one. He has failed as usual to produce any evidence in support of that assertion. He says there is no evidence of various things.  He is making a case, and the onus of proof lies on him with regard to his thesis.  He brings into his argument the statement made by the Portuguese delegation at the plenary meeting for the Council elections.  He should be informed of this, if he does not know it already, that on a more recent occasion that same Portuguese delegation brought a statement to the League in which they pleaded for the independent position of delegations before the Assembly, and emphasised their independent position and fortified their whole argument by a quotation from the present Minister for Defence in a speech which he made in the Assembly in which he said, on the first occasion in which we applied for a position on the Council, that we were standing as an independent State, that we stood for the small States in the fullest and most independent way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Portuguese delegation tied themselves on to that declaration of the Minister for Defence, to that very point, in a further appeal to the League in conjunction with ourselves on the particular stand that we took in the matter.  Not a shred of evidence has been produced to show that in any way we compromised our independence. <Col N="1281" /> We stated on the first occasion on which we went forward that we were against the group idea, that we did not approve of it, and that we would vote for no one who went forward on that basis; that we would take other considerations, and that we stood ourselves as distinct opponents of the group idea.  We even went the length of saying quite openly to the Assembly, and saying in frequent talks with members of other delegations, that if there was anybody disposed to vote for us as the next in succession to Canada we would prefer not to have them vote for us at all. We made our position as clear as any position could be made, that we repudiated this idea of group activities and we are recognised at Geneva as one of the main upholders of the complete independence of the smaller States and as people who are against the group system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was not content to carry on the work which he does so well of reviling his own country, but he had to bring in comments against two other nations that really did not merit them, simply because his peculiar eye lit on them in this connection. He referred to Guatemala and Peru. No doubt they went home and talked of their election as indicating a particular status.  They could well do it. Deputy Lemass's reputation is not so world-wide that he could set up to criticise Guatemala and Peru.  These are two nations and they have their own nationals who represent them. They play a very effective part in their own way at the League and the Deputy might have known that Peru had nothing to do with the application for membership of the Council last year.  He slipped over a State which did succeed with ourselves last year, namely, Norway, which is recognised as occupying the position which we do ourselves <i>vis a vis</i> the other countries at the League, as standing for the fulfilment of the best League ideals, and standing for these in the most independent way possible without any association with the particular group idea.  It is sufficient for the Deputy to make the statement.  I have always recognised that in the debate on this <Col N="1282" /> Estimate we have to listen to Deputy Corry.  To-day they have substituted Deputy Lemass for Deputy Corry.  It was not a very wise substitution if we are to take the speeches at the level at which Deputy Corry always delivers them and what Deputy Lemass said to-day.  Even in that mood of ill-temper, for some reason he carries in the cross-roads atmosphere into the House and does not confine himself even to slandering his own people, but has to go outside, and, in a mood of peculiar exaltation, to discuss and criticise everybody who goes near the League.  The whole record is a record of futility! Fifty-two nations of the world think fit to send deputations at great expense and from long distances to the League Assembly, but in the Deputy's mind it is futile.  He said he had seen no better example of futility or the policy of &ldquo;do-nothing&rdquo; than was revealed here.  The Deputy has a fair conceit of himself. As I say, Deputy Corry does not make that sort of international blunder that the Deputy has committed himself to on two or three occasions to-day.</P>
    <P>It is a very facile but futile type of criticism that because a particular conference, called together for a particular purpose, breaks up without accomplishing all that it has failed in its purpose. If that is to be the test, I wonder would the Deputy apply it to everything he attempts himself, and, if so, will he tell us where a single success is shown as his?</P>

      <P>It is futile, because the convention meets if its full objects are not achieved.  What is the system that applies whereby such a thing as the Customs Union is brought forward for submission before the Council?  A discussion takes place, which Deputy Lemass would describe as futile, and it <Col N="1283" /> is referred for legal decision on particular leading points.  What would have been the old system?  Movement of Army corps, the calling of people up for the colours, probably shots fired, war engineered before the people had time to breathe.  But the Deputy with a conceit of himself would prefer this blundering rushing about to ordinary action.  Even if that ordinary action may not lead to immediate results, it may postpone the serious results that would follow from disorderly action that his mind seems to run to so fiercely.  The Deputy has returned also to his old comments of the economic side.  We have made clear our special position at the League.  We have not had to enter into that in any spirit of aggression in regard to any other countries.  We have been able to put our point of view fairly and squarely, and to have it understood and appreciated, and to have reservations made and accepted on any occasion they are called for in regard to plans opposed to the generality of Europe.  Again no reason given.  The Deputy is always afraid of these things. The Deputy has a fear that we might be in a position that would afterwards debar us doing something which the national interest might decide to be necessary.  If we waited till the end of the Deputy's hypothesis we would be as long in deciding as any sub-committee of the League of Nations.  We have a clear position with regard both to our national standing and to our attitude on the Council and with regard to economies&mdash;as clear a position as any person about the Assembly of the League of Nations have.  And when I say that I call attention to the fact that there are 52 nations in the world represented there.  If we are airing a futility we are airing it in good company.  The bull in the china shop is not always a successful policy, no matter how much it may appeal to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In this connection we on these benches are not prepared to accept this Estimate without discussion and without opposition because of the fact that it forms part of that notorious agreement known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  There are several heads of that agreement which we think are unjustifiable not only from the national, but from the moral point of view.  We feel that under the first head, under which the Government, purporting to act on behalf of our people, undertook to pay to the British Government the land annuities accruing due under the Land Acts, 1881 to 1909, is not an agreement that any Party standing for the historic principles of Irish nationality could assent to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to revise or reopen the land annuities controversy on this Estimate, but the fact that it is part of the agreement under which the amount now to be voted is to be paid is one of the reasons why we do not propose to allow this Estimate to go through without a division.  In addition to the proposals relating to the land annuities there is also the provision under which the Free State Government undertook to recoup the British Government up to 75 per cent. of the amount expended in payment of pensions and compensation allowances to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. We have satisfied ourselves <Col N="1285" /> that even under the terms of the Treaty and in view of the subsequent procedure under the Treaty in regard particularly to the R.I.C. this money is not justly payable by this country.  For that reason we regard the whole contract known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement as not binding and one which should not be kept.</P>
    <P>I do not know what case the Minister is going to make to the House for the repayment of these local loans.  I presume that he will say that as these moneys were provided originally by the British Treasury and were loaned to our local authorities for public purposes we are bound to repay them, but in that connection I would like to remind the Minister that the resources of the late United Kingdom were the joint resources of this country and of Great Britain, that they were held by us in common, that everything which derived from them, all the profits and all the assets which ultimately were created by the use of those funds and those resources were in the joint and common ownership not only of the people of Great Britain but of this country, and that, therefore, in view of that we were entitled, in any final account which might be made between this country and Great Britain under Article 5 of the Treaty, to a fair share and a just proportion of the amount of money which was to be repaid to the British Exchequer on foot of these local loans.  I know that the Minister is going to say that this Ultimate Financial Settlement was a fair discharge of our liabilities under Article 5 of the Treaty.  I would like to read that Article for the consideration of the House:</P>
    <P>The Irish Free State shall assume liability for the service of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of war pensions as existing at that date in such proportion as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set-off or counter-claim, the amount of such sum being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of one <Col N="1286" /> or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>By Article 2 of the schedule to the Treaty appended to the Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act of 1925, it is provided that the Irish Free State is &ldquo;hereby released from the obligation to assume the liability therein mentioned.&rdquo; The real point in that connection is this, that by the Amending Act we are told that any obligation which we have under Article 5 of the Treaty has been cancelled and that we are relieved of the responsibility for fulfilling such obligation.  If we were released from that responsibility and those obligations, how does this provision for £600,000 yearly by way of annuities in repayment of the amount of the advances from the British Local Loans Fund come about?  We are told by Article 2 of this Agreement that our responsibility under Article 5 of the original Treaty had been wiped out, but here under sub-head B of the Estimates we find that an annuity amounting to £600,000 is payable to the British Local Loans Fund under Article 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement in respect to the agreed amount of the advances to that fund outstanding on the 1st April, 1926.</P>
    <P>Surely if we were to assume liability for the service of the public debt of the United Kingdom, as it existed at the date of the Treaty, and if we are entitled to put forward, by way of set-off or counter-claim, any just claims we may have had, these two items would cancel each other, and the Minister acting on behalf of the Executive Council should not have accepted any responsibility whatever for what was really portion of the National Debt under another form. The Local Loans Funds were advanced out of British resources.  They were provided in the main by the National Debt Commissioners.  It is possible that a large part of those resources was provided by the creation of public debt in Great Britain.  If part of that public debt has been occasioned by the fact that advances would have been made to the funds of the local authorities in Ireland prior <Col N="1287" /> to the Treaty, and if our obligations in relation to that public debt were to be wiped out, surely there is no ground and no justification for redeeming in an indirect and roundabout way that part of the National Debt which was represented by advances from the Local Loans Fund?</P>
    <P>I feel that Article 5 of the Treaty is a very remarkable one.  It will be noticed that the specific obligation it imposes on us is to assume liability for the service of the public debt of the United Kingdom, and whilst that was an entity which was quite capable of being defined and was defined in the terms of the Treaty in such a way as to impose a considerable burden upon us, nevertheless, in drafting the Treaty no care was taken to state in the same definite way under what heads we could advance claims as a set-off against the liability which this Article imposes upon us.  It would seem that in this regard the interests of the people have been altogether overlooked. It would seem that the main thing to be considered was the amount of the British public debt which could be unloaded upon the pockets of the Irish people, although that debt had been annually created by Britain's foreign wars, by the Great War, and by the preceding wars in which she had conquered her Colonies and Dominions, and as a result of which Britain had benefited by increases in wealth of a considerable magnitude.  There was not in this Article an attempt to establish the rights of the Irish people to a share in the territories, trade, commerce and other tangible assets that had been created as a result of the expenditure of the money borrowed to create this public debt.</P>
    <P>That is merely by the way.  To get back to our original position.  The provision made under this Estimate is part and parcel of what is known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement, which we feel is disadvantageous to this country, and which we know is positively injurious in its effect upon our whole credit and financial structure. We think it is contrary to the historical principles of nationality, contrary <Col N="1288" /> to the principle that the land of Ireland belongs to the people of Ireland, and was given to them for their use and benefit.  We are opposing the provision of the £600,000 for Local Loans.</P>

Deputy MacEntee, who has been very clear in this matter, stated in the presence of his future Prime Minister and Deputy Fahy, that when the time comes when they will occupy these benches, there will be no paying of land annuities to the British Government or of any of this money that is arranged with regard to our contribution towards the pensions of the old R.I.C.</P>

I am one of those who have to contribute towards one of these things which the Deputy alluded to in a pretty large degree.  I quite understood my liabilities at the time.

      <P>I realise that we could have some hours' debate on this matter, so I do not propose to go into it at all.  I simply want to make it clear to Deputy Wolfe that we propose to hold the land annuities, and we propose not to be bound by the commitments the present Government entered into in secret, and, in our opinion, without any legal binding force.  But we do not take up the position that the Deputy would wish to place us in, and that is, that we are repudiating liabilities.  The whole question is whether these are in fact liabilities and just debts.  Our position is that they are not.  If that matter is clear all that I want to say on this particular point is said.  We object to this payment because it is part and parcel of a yearly payment that amounts altogether to something like £5,750,000, of which five and one-third millions are handed over directly to Britain.  This Estimate is part of that sum.  We believe that we are not legally bound to pay that money.  We believe that we are justly entitled to hold it.  I tried on more than one occasion to bring to the attention of Deputies the fact that this payment represents a burden on our people which precludes the possibility of any swift economic recovery here.</P>

    <P>In order that Deputies might realise what a burden it really is, I tried to make a comparison with the sum that has been voted by this House for the Shannon construction works.  I do not think the amount voted by this House directly for these works up to the present amounts to the sum of £5,750,000 which we are annually handing over to Britain&mdash;unjustifiably, in <Col N="1290" /> my view.  I think it is a fact that that sum is greater than the amount that has been voted by this House for the Shannon construction works.  Therefore, in sending this sum out of the country yearly we are making a present of a sum which, if retained here and used for that particular purpose, would enable us to finance completely a national enterprise every year as great as the Shannon scheme.  It is a very serious matter for this country and we have to ask ourselves whether we are justified at all in making a gift of that kind.  We believe&mdash;we have stated it before and given our authority&mdash;that we have right on our side in this matter and that we have law on our side, and that we are not just to our people in handing over the fruits of their toil to the extent we have indicated, namely, a sum that would enable our people every year to finance completely a national enterprise as big as the Shannon scheme, and to give our neighbours as a gift a sum of money which would enable them, if they used it for that purpose, to finance completely a scheme just as big as the Shannon scheme.</P>
    <P>I have tried in another way to get Deputies to realise what it means by pointing out that it represents a burden on our people greater than the burden on the German people for war reparations.  The amount that the German people have to provide for war reparations under the Young Plan represents, I think, between £20 and £21 for every £100 that they provide for governmental services.  Here the sum we provide represents £24 per £100 provided for governmental services. Another way of looking at it is this: The war reparation payments under the Young Plan represent a tax of £1 6s. 1d. per individual citizen in Germany.  With us this payment amounts to £1 16s. 3d. per head, so that if we take the average family in Germany to be what the statistics tell us it is here&mdash;4.3&mdash;the German family would have to provide £5 12s. 4d., whereas we have to provide no less than £7 15s. 10d.  I think I have made a case for very careful consideration before we vote this sum of money.  We cannot afford to pay this money.  A <Col N="1291" /> speaker on the opposite benches stated recently that if we kept these annuities Britain might put a tax of £1 or £2 per head on our cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part and parcel of a larger payment, and it is very difficult to disentangle if we want to see the full effect of each individual payment.  If we take the payments separately it is difficult to realise the full weight of the combined total.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to go outside except in so far as each particular payment here is concerned.  This is part of the general payment.  To realise the total burden we must take the payments as a whole.  The Minister referred to the question of the land annuities.  That is part of this payment. The fact, so the Minister told us, was that the British would retaliate by putting a charge of £1 or £2 per head on our cattle, whereas, as it stands, this represents a charge of £3 10s. per head on our cattle.  I introduce it now simply to get Deputies to realise the magnitude of this sum when they find that it represents a charge of £3 10s. per head on the cattle that we export to Great Britain.  All the Deputies realise that cattle is our biggest trade.  So that we are not entitled here as Deputies charged with looking after the national interests to vote away this money as long as there is a reasonable case&mdash;and I hold that there is more than a reasonable case&mdash; for withholding it.  I showed in connection with the land annuities what that case was.  We are voting against this because it is part and parcel of this whole Ultimate Financial Settlement, the terms of which we hold to be unjust and unfair, and not binding upon us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee and Deputy de Valera have, as usual, misrepresented the facts of the Ultimate Financial Settlement and its relationship to this Vote.  This payment does not, any more than the land annuities, rest on the Ultimate Financial Settlement. The Ultimate Financial Settlement dealt with minor matters.  So far as the land annuities are concerned, the Ultimate Financial Settlement dealt only with the income tax on the interest portion of the land annuities.  The land annuities are paid under a section of the Land Act of 1923, which also arises from certain things which preceded it, and not from the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  The Ultimate Financial Settlement only altered to the benefit of the Saorstát an arrangement already in existence.  The arrangement already in existence was that all the money collected in respect of the advances to the Loans Fund in the Saorstát should, after a deduction had been made for the cost of collection, be transmitted to the appropriate funds in Great Britain.  We arranged with the British Government to compound that, and to pay, for a period of twenty years, an annuity of £600,000. Long after the period of twenty years, receipts will be coming into the Saorstát Exchequer from advances made during the British time to local authorities or to individuals out of the Local Loans Fund.  For ten years after the expiration of the twenty years' period there will be a very substantial sum coming into the Saorstát Exchequer, and there will be a decreasing sum running actually to the end of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not that the British asked to have it changed.  It was we who asked to have a new arrangement made rather than pay all the amount collected. It seems to me to be perfectly clear that this matter has really nothing to do with Article 5.  The President, in his statement on the amendment of the Treaty which struck out Article 5 and the Boundary Article, pointed out that that agreement was made on the basis of an existing arrangement relating to land annuities, police pensions and these local loans. <Col N="1293" /> He made it perfectly clear how the position stood.  I have already quoted that statement in the Dáil two or three times.  He made it clear that on the basis of the arrangement amending the Treaty that this and other matters remain payable.  I think apart from the President's statement it is perfectly clear, and anybody who will look at it will agree that this has nothing to do with the question of our liability or lack of liability for the British public debt.  The Government in this connection is essentially only a postman or agent taking the money from the debtor to the creditor.  These local loans were advanced to local authorities and, in certain cases, to individuals. They were no different from advances that might be made to a local authority by a bank or to individuals by a bank for the purpose of land purchase.  They remained the property of the person who made the loan unless that person transferred his rights.  There is nothing in the Treaty to say that private debts due to the British Government were to become the property of the Saorstát Government, nothing at all.  Unless there was a special arrangement, normally they would not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>They were loans advanced by the British to local authorities for carrying out local work, just exactly in the same way as an advance made by a bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly in the same way as a British bank might have done it.  They did not become&mdash;merely because the debtor was here and the creditor in Britain&mdash;Saorstát property at all unless they were transferred, and they were not transferred.  The position, therefore, was that in the beginning, until this arrangement in regard to the £600,000 due by creditors here was made they were collected and paid to the British Government.  All these things, in so far as the debts were due to the British Government were a factor, <Col N="1294" /> and they would be a factor if we had come to the question of arbitration under Article 5 of the Treaty. Not only the public debt that Great Britain owed, but obviously the assets which Great Britain possessed, would be taken into account in determining what the liability of the Saorstát was. What actually happened was that Article 5, as was clearly pointed out by the President on the Second Reading of the Bill confirming the amendment of the Treaty, was struck out by the arrangement.  Article 5 was based on the assumption that these payments that were already made would be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be perfectly clear.  It is unmistakable. There is no question of its being given in a technical phrase or anything like that.  It was stated in the clearest possible way.  Deputy de Valera talked about the way in which this country is being drained by these payments. He tried to make the question of the size of the payments the fundamental question.  It is not unless in certain eventualities the country was unable to make payments.  Then, of course, the size does become a vital matter. In the ordinary way, the size is not the matter.  It is a question of whether they are owing.  I am perfectly clear that this money is owing, that the British Government advanced a sum to an individual&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the British Government, surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that they have a claim against the individual, and unless their claim was clearly transferred or apportioned to the Saorstát it remained an asset of theirs, an asset which would have to be taken into <Col N="1295" /> account in certain circumstances, as it was one of the things that reduced the total weight of their Public Debt, with a view to determining what the Saorstát liability was.</P>
      <P>Take this question of burden.  The British might complain about the enormous sums that they were paying into this country, to holders of War Loans and other British Stock, and to those who were receiving military service pensions from them.  If it was a question of burden and paying out sums they could urge just as strong claims as we could.</P>
      <P>There is another fact that should be borne in mind, that is that a great lot of this money actually comes back to this country.  If you take the R.I.C. pensions, a great number of the pensioners are living in the Saorstát, and the money comes back to the Saorstát again.  A considerable quantity of land stock is held in the Saorstát, and the money which is paid by way of land annuities for the purpose of the Land Purchase Account is paid to the stockholders here, and actually comes back here.  Any suggestion that there is a net payment of any of these sums that the Deputy mentioned out of the country is misleading. The main sums are really nothing at all in the nature of the German payments.  I do not want to go into that at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done so before, and I do not want to go into it now, but they are essentially private debts, loans made to private individuals. They are not liabilities due to the State.  The State, as I say, has the duty of postman or messenger, and nothing else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There were loans not by the British Government, as the Minister stated, but by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  If they were loans by the Exchequer of that Government then the people of this country have some right and some title in them.  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That right and title depends on Article 5.  If you were assuming portion of the British national debt or if that question had gone into arbitration, then when the British pointed to their debt you could at least point, on the other hand, to assets which reduced the total burden of that debt.  That is the only way they would come into account, and our liability would accordingly be less.  If there were assets to be taken into account, it would offset or counter any claim that might be made to reduce the net burden of the British national debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all.  The people who borrowed the money are the people who are to pay this debt&mdash; that is whether they are individuals or local authorities.  That is entirely a different question from this State assuming responsibility for a national debt.  There is nothing to indicate to us that the asset, because it happened to be situated here, gives us a right to it.  You could not urge that geography determines ownership in assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that sub-head A of this Vote proposes to provide £7,384 for the Central Savings Committee. This is an increase of £155 over the provision which was made last year.  While I do not propose to criticise <Col N="1299" /> it I am not sure that the State is getting full value for the money which is being expended.  At the same time, I do say that a Committee of this sort could fulfil a very useful function in endeavouring to create habits of thrift among our people.  I am not sure, however, that the amount of money that it is proposed to allocate to the Committee could not be reduced without the efficiency of the Committee being decreased in any way.  But leaving that to one side, there is one point upon which I would like the Minister to give me some information and that is whether any allowance is being made to the Chairman by way of expenses, subsistence allowance, or otherwise.  I believe the Dáil understood that the Chairmanship of this Committee was a purely honorary one and I do happen to know that the former holder of the position received an income of £1,000 for his services for a number of years.  An honorarium of that nature, of course, makes the position not an honorary one because the amount of time that was devoted to the work and the number of years over which his service was given were such as to make the emoluments payable on a very large scale, and I would like to know before the Vote goes before the House whether the Chairman recently appointed receives anything by way of salary, allowance for expenses, or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to sub-head B, which deals with the Civil Service (Compensation) Board, we propose to provide this year the sum of £15, against £115 provided last year.  I think the exact purpose of this is to determine whether certain officers are to be permitted to take advantage of the terms of the transferred officers' agreement under which, I think, the increased lump sum and compensation retiring allowance payable shall be defrayed by the British Government.  It seems to me that the Irish Civil Service Board is really an agency for the British Government and that the amount of money involved is trivial.  Nevertheless, I think that since it is, as I said, more or less an agency service for <Col N="1300" /> them and since they will, to a certain extent, benefit by its operation, which safeguards their interests, I think that we should not have to bear the expenses of such a Board even though, as I have said, it is comparatively trivial.  Sub-head C of this Vote proposes to provide £495 for a Committee of Inquiry into the position of national teachers in the Gaeltacht.  No provision was made for this service last year and I would like the Minister to tell the House whether the Committee has yet been set up and whether it has had any meetings.</P>
    <P>There is one other item&mdash;I do not know whether I am entitled to refer to it&mdash;and that is the Grain Tribunal.  A sum of £100 was provided to defray the expenses of that tribunal last year. There is no provision made for the tribunal this year.  The tribunal has met and had many public meetings and has taken evidence at considerable expense, which exceeds the provision which was actually made&mdash;and the point I have in mind is whether, in view of the fact that no provision was made this year, that is to be taken as an indication that the Minister does not intend to publish the report of the tribunal. Naturally, if the report is to be published, some provision would have to be made for it in the Estimates because any surplus money would naturally have to be surrendered.  I would like the Minister to deal with that point in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the first point made by Deputy MacEntee, I think that the work of the Savings Certificates Committee is very useful. Not only does the thrift side of the work depend very largely on the activities of the Committee, but I think even the subscriptions for Savings Certificates, which hardly come under the heading of thrift, but are more or less in the way of investments, come in to a considerable extent as a result of this activity.  On the whole, it is very advantageous to the Exchequer <Col N="1301" /> to have this inflow of subscriptions for Savings Certificates.  It places us in a stronger position for facing the money market for borrowing purposes.  Owing to the fact also that many people do not leave their money invested until it reaches maturity, we get that money at a small rate of interest.  No allowance will be payable to the Chairman of the Committee.  I presume if he made a journey somewhere on the Committee's business, he would be paid his travelling expenses in the ordinary way, but no payment other than some recoupment for actual outlay is made.  With regard to the former holder of the position, there was a number of special factors which will not recur.  The former holder for a time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  With regard to the Civil Service Compensation Board, I think the Deputy was under a misapprehension. A very small proportion only of the compensation awarded will be payable by the British Government. The only amount that they will pay will be the differnce between the amount that was payable under the original judgment of our Supreme Court and the findings of the Privy Council.  Practically all the cases of retirements in consequence of the change of Government have now been dealt with.  There may be a small number remaining.  What the Board in future will have to deal with will be the cases of people who claim that their conditions were altered to their detriment, and who will claim compensation on that basis.

    <P>With regard to the Committee which is to inquire into the position of national teachers in the Gaeltacht, that matter arises out of the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission and the White Paper of Government policy published in connection with it.  The Committee is to be set up for the purpose of considering whether some <Col N="1302" /> agreed scheme could be evolved for transferring elsewhere teachers in the Gaeltacht who have not a knowledge of Irish and who do not seem likely to acquire a knowledge of Irish.  The personnel of the Committee has not been completed, and, of course, it has not held meetings.  It is intended that it should be constituted something in the following manner&mdash;an independent chairman, three representatives of Managers, three representatives of the National Teachers' Organisation, and a few representatives of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Grain Tribunal, it is intended naturally that a report will be published.  It will possibly be paid out of the Stationery Office Vote. With regard to the Manuscripts Commission, there are several books on the point of being published.  There is, for instance, &ldquo;Duanaire Chloinne Aodha Buidhe,&rdquo; which is practically ready.  I have seen unbound copies, and it is somewhere in the stage of being published.  A great deal of the Book of Lechan has been photographed and a photographic facsimile is being produced.  I know that photographs have been taken, and the book is in process of being printed off.  The printing off is rather slow, because it is dependent on the weather.  Some times, when as few as eight prints have been made, the machine has to be stopped and the type has to be cleaned.  On other days, when atmospheric conditions are suitable, it might be possible to print as much as fifteen. As far as that book is concerned, the printing of one page occupies a considerable time.  As a matter of fact arrangements are being made to get a second printing machine for the Ordnance Survey, because it is not possible for one printing machine to keep pace with the photographic department which produces first the photograph and then also the gelatine plate from which the book is printed.  A good deal of progress has been made with another manuscript, the name of which I have not at the moment, from Trinity College.  Other books on hand include the &ldquo;Liber Primus Kilkenniensis,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Register of Hospitallers of St. John of Kilmainham,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The <Col N="1303" /> Civil Survey&rdquo; (Vol. 1).  Amongst works which it is hoped to publish in the present year are: The Rinuccini Memoirs, Rentale Terrarum, Fitzwilliam Papers, Civil Survey (Vol. No. 2), Register of Tristernagh, Lexique of Place Names, The Irish Nennius, O hUidhrinn, and O Dubhgain's Topographical Poems.  As a matter of fact, though nothing has appeared yet except two issues of the &ldquo;Analecta Hibernica,&rdquo; a great deal of work has been done in the preparation of the volume, and, as I happen to know, some of them are in a very advanced stage towards publication.</P>

      <P>Relatively little non-governmental work is done.  I could not state exactly what has been done in the nature of non-governmental work.  The work is clearly for Departments. For instance, in the year 1929-30 we had 26,600 samples for the Revenue Commissioners, 12,357 for the Department of Agriculture, 660 for the Department of Fisheries, 49 for the Post Office, 65 for the Stationery Office, <Col N="1304" /> 57 for the Department of Industry and Commerce, 100 for the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and 28 for the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Normally the work is really analysing samples of various sorts sent by Government Departments, samples sent for revenue purposes by revenue officers, samples of various classes of goods purchased from some other Department, and some dealing with criminal cases from the Department of Justice.  From the Department of Agriculture you have samples of dairy produce, margarine, fertilisers, feeding stuffs, sheep dips, etc.</P>

      <P>I know that the view which has been taken generally by the Government is that research is really a matter for the universities.  We do give a little help to the colleges by way of a research grant to encourage students at least to continue under their professor for some period after taking their degrees and to enter upon some line of research.  There has been from time to time some consideration of further development in that direction, but generally it is not thought that the State laboratory is the best place.  It is thought that it could be perhaps more effectually and economically done in the universities.  After <Col N="1305" /> all, there is this difficulty about research, that you cannot tell anybody what to find; he can only find what is there.  Perhaps more fruitful research work will be done by allowing those who are engaged on it as their daily work to some extent in the universities to direct it and co-operate with younger men who may be taking it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask is that a number of people have complained to me of the fees charged in respect of some of these examinations, which seem to be very high.  I think in the case of medical appointments the fee is as high as £2.  In that connection, I may say, that there is a general feeling among the medical profession, at any rate, and I suppose it applies to other professions also, that it would be very desirable if the Local Appointments Commission in advertising posts would state precisely the academic qualifications which are required, because it has been pointed out to me that a man has absolutely no chance of knowing whether he would be considered for a position which is vacant unless he pays his £2 and receives the conditions and has appeared before the Local Appointments Commission.  In consequence of that a number of candidates for posts have paid fees and found they had no chance whatever of securing positions. If the Local Appointments Commission is to fulfil a useful purpose I suggest that the fees should be made as low as possible, so that there will be no undue obstacle placed in the way of those who wish to apply for appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this question of fees is one that gives the Commission some little difficulty.  Part of the object in charging the fee is to recoup, to some extent at any rate, the expenses of the Commission.  Another is really to reduce the number of candidates to those who are really serious.  If you had no fee at all in certain cases you would have a great number.  Even with the fee, if anybody will look at the lists he will see that there are great numbers <Col N="1307" /> of people who enter and who are quite hopeless.  Without the fee the costs would be put up, and not only the costs, but the number of papers to be examined.  The number of people to be accommodated in examination halls would go up enormously, and not only would increase the expenses, but waste time, and, to some extent, would tend to interfere with the efficiency of the examinations. While very little is stated in the advertisements about the qualifications for a post, because advertisements are costly, I think that when a candidate applies for the conditions and for the particulars he does receive a good deal of information before it is necessary for him to pay the fee.  I shall give the Deputy a list of the fees for Civil Service examinations.  For an officer in the Customs and Excise the fee is £2, and the salary scale £110 to £350; the same fee is charged for the junior executive examination, where the scale is £90 to £350; £1 is charged for the clerical officers examination, where the salary scale is £70 to £200; 10/- is the fee for shorthand typists, whose scale is from 24/- to 38/-; 10/- for writing assistants, where the salary scale is 17/- to 34/-, and 2/- for Post Office learners and boy messengers. Some of these fees seem relatively high, but of course the posts, as posts go in this country, are valuable enough, and even with these fees there is a very big entry, and, of course, there is a considerable entry of people who are not at all in the running.  A reduction, while it might be justified from one angle, would cause loss in revenue. Perhaps you might make it up by getting larger numbers, but that would be hardly a good thing, because it is hard enough to get the papers dealt with at present in a reasonable time and by a reasonable number of people, and an enormous spreading out of the number of candidates, especially those who are not serious candidates, would increase the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty in that direction is that certainly it has placed obstacles in the way of a number of people who might find it very <Col N="1308" /> hard to afford two pounds and yet might be quite brilliant people and would make good officers if recruited for the service, but they are debarred because of the fee.  Even though it might create an administrative difficulty, nevertheless the proper way to approach this thing is that the widest possible section of the people should be permitted to sit for these examinations if they wish to enter the public service.  To a certain extent I suppose the position might be met if the examination for the ordinary Leaving and Intermediate Certificate in the schools were co-ordinated or related in some way to the educational qualifications that would be required for entrance into the various branches of the Civil Service.  In that way you could exact a qualifying condition that a candidate should have either the Leaving or Intermediate Certificate.  That would narrow the field somewhat.  At the same time it would not put an obstacle in the way of people who might find it difficult to afford £2 for an entrance fee for an examination for posts not too highly paid.  They may be attractive to the candidates, but that is because of their immediate financial circumstances.  It is those immediate financial circumstances that render it difficult for them to provide the £2.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the entrance fee is not a sufficient deterrent to people who are unfit and are not qualified to sit for the examination.  It is only not a deterrent in the case of unqualified people who are able to provide the entrance fee, but it may be a deterrent in the case of desirable people who are unable to provide the entrance fee.  I think it would be better to run the risk of having a larger number of unsuitable people for the examination because of the low fee rather than to prevent a number of people that would be suitable as candidates for the Civil Service sitting for the examination by reason of the high fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to professional people who make application through the Local Appointments Commission, they have to pay a fee with each application.  It is considered a hardship that in cases where a young <Col N="1309" /> professional man is in for an appointment he pays an appropriate fee, and, of course, though he may be called up for interview, only one can be appointed. Take the case of a doctor or an assistant surveyor or an engineer, or a man of that class.  A vacancy may occur again the next month, and another fee has to be paid before the applicant can have his name put before the Selection Board.  Could nothing be done by way of making reductions in subsequent applications after the first fee is paid?  If one of the reasons for the payment of the fee is to see that a person is serious, the fact that he paid it once and is willing to pay a reduced fee again, would show that he is serious at any rate.  I think it is rather hard that if a young man is not successful and has to make two or three attempts that he should have to pay a fee every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that there is a hardship there which is perhaps worthy of consideration.  But in contradistinction to the case Deputy MacEntee put it is more important with regard to those appointments, to keep the numbers down as much as possible.  If you are conducting a written examination you must print off the papers and pay fees to people to examine them, and all that must mean considerable expense.  It is not so easy when dealing with the appointment of medical officers, because the principle has been to get representative men in the profession to sit on selection boards.  It is often a great sacrifice for these men to do it.  They have to remain away from their practice, and selection boards have sometimes sat several days in succession to interview candidates and make selections. Anything that would unduly increase the number of candidates would be very serious.  It might just turn the scale between carrying on that system and not carrying it on.  It is a matter that I would like to look into a little more.  I feel that if a candidate has been up for a post or two if he has any nous at all, will be able to get some idea of what his chances are.  He will find out what the qualifications of the successful candidate <Col N="1310" /> were, what his degrees were, and what sort of people were going.  In that way he will be able, if in no other, to see what it was he lacked.  I have heard candidates say so and so got the post because he had this or that degree, generally not claiming that the degree was much good when the other person had it.  Nevertheless, he should be able to see in what the people who got the position excelled.  I think the hardship seems not to be as great as it appears.  However, it is a matter I will certainly discuss with the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I have anything more to say with regard to that.  These things have been thrashed out a good deal by the Civil Service Commissioners, and I know they feel that good candidates have not been deterred.  In fact no candidates have been deterred. I had occasion just recently to discuss the question of fees with the Civil Service Commissioners in connection with a particular appointment&mdash;as a matter of fact an appointment to the translators and whether people from poor areas in the Gaeltacht could pay the fee mentioned.  Members of the Commission to whom I mentioned it said they did not agree that there was anything to indicate that good candidates were being deterred from coming forward by these fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>They would get complaints. After all, people do write complaints. As a matter of fact, in this particular case one candidate wrote to say he was unable to pay the fee.  If there were many cases of that kind you would have more complaints about them.  I may say that while one particular candidate wrote to say that he could not pay the fee, when I spoke to the Commissioners about it I learned that he had managed to pay the fee somehow.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has given any consideration <Col N="1311" /> to some recommendations of the Dáil, in particular with regard to the periodical holding of sittings of the Commission to fill appointments, say, every quarter.  There could easily be an estimate made by which approximately the potential number of vacancies would be known.  It is an expensive thing for these candidates to attend meetings of the Commission. Many Irish doctors, temporarily in practice in England, have to come over for these interviews.  Holding these sessions periodically would save a good deal of expense.  At present it would look as if they had to come for one appointment, although I know the Appointments Commission have done their best to group their vacancies as much as possible.  Travelling expenses are very heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that there would be certain advantages in that, but I do not know whether it could be done without an amendment of the Act. I doubt if they can do other than advertise the vacancies which do actually occur.  Sometimes it happened that while filling a vacancy other vacancies have occurred.  The difficulty that exists there is that the local authority is likely to complain if there is much delay, because they may be paying more to a substitute.  It may be that it would be better to wait a little, at any rate, and to try to have two, three, or more vacancies.  Of course, in the famous case of a librarian there were several vacancies, and that is possibly how the difficulty occurred.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this is in order or not under what was sub-head (d) of the Vote.  I wonder has the Minister been able to do anything in the case of that poor man, Pat O'Byrne, whose case has been before the House?  I need not recite the facts to the Minister, but it seems to be a pitiful case.  I quite admit that it was not handled in the best way by the man himself, but I feel that his present unfortunate position is, to a certain extent, attributable to the Rising of 1916.  If it had not been for that he would not have been out in the street.  That was the primary cause of the whole chain of events which have left him in this unfortunate position.  Many members of the Minister's Party and members of the Labour Party have approached him in the matter, and there would be agreement in all parts of the House if special steps were taken to help him. It may be that on the merits of the case he has a great deal to blame himself for as regards his present position. But at the same time, in view of the fact that it did originate in the burning of Henry Street in 1916, I think we should not entirely wash our hands of any obligation to him in the matter.  If we can do anything to help him now, any action the Minister might take would meet with the general concurrence of all sections of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are any number of other hard cases, and I think more deserving cases, although they are not people who have the persistence to go around to Deputies and gain audience of them.  Many cases have been brought to my notice of people who are in an extreme financial condition, perhaps in a condition of <Col N="1313" /> poverty, and their poverty is due to circumstances arising out of the Anglo-Irish struggle.  There are a number of cases one has to meet from time to time.  It may be difficult to verify the facts, but people will come to you in great distress and say that the beginning of the break-up of their business was that they spent so much in keeping men on the run or keeping columns or other things like that.  That element is sufficiently important possibly to have been a deciding factor in particular cases, but there may have been wilful neglect of business or many other contributing factors.  I quite often had these cases before me.  I felt that quite probably, if it had not been for the struggle or their own part in the struggle, their financial position would not have been what it is to-day. Yet we have not taken any steps to deal with these cases, largely because of the extreme difficulty of being certain of the facts, but also because every person who has got into bad circumstances because of certain expenditure he made, can claim compensation.  You might as well claim compensation for people who are in good circumstances because of this.  If we are going to compensate for losses we must compensate for losses irrespective of whether the person is in a poor position or is relatively well off.  Therefore it seems to me that we can hardly deal with hard cases of this sort.  I have not looked at the file, but my recollection is that the misfortunes were entirely due to miscalculations and so forth of the individual himself, whilst possibly if there had been no Rising in 1916, and if his premises were never burned down, the person might be well off.  On the other hand, there may have been vicissitudes in business that we do not know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied from examining the case that he has no legal or, in fact, moral claim on us, and not as great a moral claim as thousands of others who have not pleaded or canvassed so persistently. I do not see any ground for dealing with a hard case simply because it is continually brought to our notice.  If proposing some sort of general scheme for dealing with hard <Col N="1314" /> cases many cases quite as good as this one could be made.</P>

      <P>I would like to put it to the Minister, quite apart from the circumstances of Mr. Byrne at the moment, which I think should be left out, that it is a question whether we have a moral responsibility.  I got the facts of the case some years ago.  I was not in a position to examine them with him, but there was prima facie evidence to satisfy me that it would be the duty of anyone who wanted to be fair to test whether the statements made were true or not.  It is not a question of the man's own fault.  At the time it seemed to me that his claim was not allowed because of some legal technicality, which was on all fours with the position that arose in connection with teachers' pensions.  Perhaps the Minister may remember the case that was brought forward by Deputy Fahy, where a teacher was deprived of his rights owing to misunderstanding a circular that went round, and because he did not make application in the prescribed way.  It appears to me there was a similar legal technicality in the case of Mr. Byrne, and it was through the operation of that that he was deprived of a right he would otherwise have had.  I think it is hardly fair to allow justice to go by the board, in default simply because there has been some legal technicality.  It would take me some time to go into the details, but I know that a very full file was presented.  I went through it and satisfied myself that there was at least prima facie evidence for ascertaining to what extent this man's claim was justified.  I think it is due to the man in justice that the Minister should go through it and have an examination as to whether the assertions made by Mr. Byrne are true or not.  If true, it seems that he has a good case.  It was only ruled out by what I might call a legal technicality, and justice was not done to him accordingly.</P>

      <P>I am not able to speak in great detail about the case now, because it is very hard to recollect the precise facts.  I know that I went into the case some years ago very carefully <Col N="1315" /> with another Minister.  We spent a good many hours discussing it with a very influential citizen that Mr. Byrne had induced to meet us.  We were satisfied at the time that neither on a legal technicality nor on the broader moral ground had Mr. Byrne any claim against the State other than the sort of claim any person who had misfortunes might perhaps make.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty of proving losses that might have been sustained in the case of Mr. Byrne.  There is a particular case in which he should have no such difficulty&mdash;that of Mr. Patrick Ryan, of Doon.  I think the Minister enjoyed his hospitality on many a day.  Mr. Ryan made repeated applications.  The Minister knows that he is a man who was very lavish with his wealth during the trouble.  He actually produced bills for some of the few he did keep, which only amounted to a couple of hundred pounds.  The Minister and the late Quartermaster-General of the Army, Seán O Muirthuile, are aware of the circumstances.  Mr. Ryan practically ruined himself, but he was treated as a sort of impostor by both the Minister and the President.  There is no question about his case.  The Minister may have assumed a judicial attitude in this matter, pretending that he did not know anything about it, when he has personal experience that Mr. Ryan suffered in the movement, and did not get one penny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, I do not think any payment has been made to people who kept men on the run or who kept columns.  I was not in Mr. Ryan's house except in the early days. I know that he was very generous and very lavish, but I do not know whether any payment was made.  The decision not to make such payments was really because of the enormous sum they would run to, taking the country generally, and the difficulty there would be of checking the amounts in any way. Cases could be pointed to that could be checked, but there would be an enormous number that could not be checked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.  Mr. Ryan understands the difficulty, but he actually got it vouched by Mr. O Muirthuile, and it was turned down.  He was treated in a most callous fashion. Mr. Ryan was not the type of man who would claim unless he came on hard times.  At least he should be paid the amount of money for which he had vouchers.  I cannot say what the amount was.  He was able to show that he was out of pocket a certain sum, and he had receipts.  His case received no consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulty is that there must be a general decision to pay for that sort of thing.  It is not possible to take out one individual or twenty or a hundred individuals. There must be a decision to pay under what is described as an Indemnity Act or else not to pay.  The general decision was not to pay because of general considerations.  As I indicated there might be many people who could trace their difficulties in that way. There may be contributory causes&mdash;I am not referring to any particular case &mdash;where such people are now in extreme financial difficulty.  Billeting was only a contributory cause, and perhaps only a minor cause, while in others it might be the main contributory cause.  The decision taken at the <Col N="1317" /> time the Indemnity Act was passed and that the committee was set up was to exclude billeting from the consideration of the committee.  There was no special treatment of a particular individual.</P>

A certain section of people who kept people like the Minister and others during the Black-and-Tan time were actually paid.  Mr. Ryan was not the type of man who would make a claim.  I admit that he was a bit too generous with people.</P>
      <P>At least it was money he could prove that he handed out and paid to Collins, money that he got a receipt for at first.  When I took up this case he was in extreme difficulties.  He was turned down as if he were a complete stranger, and as if he had no claim at all.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into a lengthy criticism of this Vote in order to advance reasons to show that we are not responsible for the payment of the R.I.C. pensions.  I desire merely to refer to one case.  The sad fact is that at present the burden for the allowances and pensions falls upon the Free State, and while that is so I maintain that applications for such pensions should be decided on their merits.  There is one case in which, in my view, the Minister for Finance gave a decision which he ought to reconsider.  I refer to the case of Mr. Austin O'Toole.  His number in the Gárda Síochána was 569.  I have the official documents here, if the Minister wishes to see them. This man was a member of the R.I.C. He resigned because he refused to carry arms against the Republicans. He was awarded his pension, which is proof that the Minister was satisfied his resignation was due to patriotic motives.  On the formation of the Gárda Síochána this was one of the <Col N="1320" /> first men to join the ranks.  Some time later he was granted a pension under the Superannuation and Pensions Act of 1923 as a resigned R.I.C. man.  By R.I.C. Resigned and Dismissed Pensions Order, 1924, that pension was liable to forfeiture under certain conditions. It was left to the discretion of the Minister of Finance to say whether it might or might not be paid. Mr. O'Toole had a successful career during the time he was in the Gárda Síochána.  After five months' service he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.  He was nine times commended by District Justices, and once he was personally congratulated by the Minister for Justice and by General Eoin O'Duffy.  He also received favourable records, money grants from the authorities, and certificates from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</P>
      <P>His wife, who had some means of her own, purchased in 1928 a small farm for herself and family.  To have such a farm is, I believe, contrary to the regulations of the Gárda.  At any rate Mr. O'Toole asked permission that his wife should be allowed to keep the place and that permission was refused.  She did try to sell it, but could not succeed in getting anything like what was paid for the place. Some further time was given, and still Mrs. O'Toole was unsuccessful in selling the place.  She then definitely refused.  I suppose even a Gárda has no power to compel his wife to get rid of property if she does not want to do so.  At any rate Mr. O'Toole had to resign from the Gárda as a consequence. He got no superannuation, and the pension allotted to him was taken away.  That was a matter at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that there is a letter here from the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, stating: &ldquo;In reference to his application for a refund of repayable deductions made from his pay, I am directed by the Minister for Justice to state that in view of the circumstances in which this man's services in the force were terminated, and of the provision of Article 15 (2) of the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order that the application could not be acceded <Col N="1321" /> to.&rdquo; Had not that man joined the Gárda Síochána at all he would have been in enjoyment of his pension.  It is rather hard that it is denied him now, considering there was no disgrace whatever attached to the manner in which this man left the force.  I have the actual certificate here if the Minister cares to see it.  It says that he was discharged on the 20th September, 1929, in consequence of his wife carrying on the business of farming without the consent of the Commissioners. There is much correspondence here, and I do not intend to delay the House by reading it.  The Minister knows the facts.  This man is being deprived of a pension of £101 8s., I think rather harshly.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the case; that is my purpose in raising it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some sub-heads in this Estimate to which naturally we would not be prepared to take exception:&mdash; the pensions, for instance, of the resigned and dismissed R.I.C., including their widows.  There are certain <Col N="1322" /> superannuation allowances which are properly due arising out of services which have been given to the State and the people of this State by members of the Civil Service.  There are injury grants, the salaries of the medical referees and other things which are obligations which we properly acknowledge, and which we would be prepared in the ordinary course to honour.  But there is one item in this Vote to which we take the strongest possible objection.  It is sub-head N, which provides for the repayment to the British Government of the ordinary pensions and disbandment pensions of the R.I.C.  It will be noticed that the payments which it is proposed to make under this sub-head relate to two classes of pensions, ordinary pensions are disbandment pensions.  The ordinary pensions are the pensions of those members of the constabulary who retired prior to the Treaty of 1921.  Under Head 11 of the heads of the Ultimate Financial Agreement the present Minister for Finance, acting on behalf of the Free State Government and purporting to act on behalf of the Irish people, agreed to repay to the British Government 75 per cent. of these&mdash;the pensions and allowances payable to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary under the Constabulary Acts.</P>
    <P>How can any obligation to pay these pensions properly fall upon the Irish people?  Whatsoever argument the Minister may advance in regard to the disbandment pensions, I certainly cannot see what justification he can offer to this House for accepting responsibility for the ordinary pensions.  There is not a word about these ordinary pensions in the Treaty.  There is no word about them in the agreement of the 3rd of December, 1925.  There may have been something about them in the secret agreement to which the Minister referred during the discussion on Estimate 8. That secret agreement had, apparently, been in existence from the day the Treaty was signed until the day on which it was divulged to the public by the President in a statement made to this House.  When he informed the people of this country that, having <Col N="1323" /> given away the Six Northern Counties of Ireland and ceded the right of the Irish people as far as he could cede it &mdash;his action in the matter, we hold, was altogether <i>ultra vires</i>&mdash;to the natural resources which the Six Counties contain&mdash;having done that, and having said he had made a &ldquo;damn good bargain&rdquo; because he had wiped out all our financial obligations under the Treaty, he informed the House, as we have heard from the Minister to-day, that there were certain other arrangements which had been secret up to that time, and that any agreement he had made in regard to the Six Counties and the boundary settlement was subject to, and additional upon, the State honouring these secret agreements.</P>

      <P>There is not a word about the ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary in the Treaty. There was not a word about them in the agreement of December, 1925, which amended the Treaty, and not a word about them until the Ultimate Financial Settlement, dated the 16th of March, 1926, which the Minister for Finance signed in secret and which was not published for the people of this country until eight months afterwards. For six or eight months the Minister for Finance dare not face the people of this country with this precious document after the President had told the people of this country they had wiped out all the financial obligations to Great Britain.  Under head 11 of this Ultimate Financial Settlement the Minister for Finance of his own volition and in his own discretion agreed to saddle the country with an obligation in respect of these pensions.  By the terms of the eleventh head of the agreement which <Col N="1325" /> I have just cited the Irish Free State Government agreed to repay to the British Government 75 per cent. of the pensions and compensation allowances payable to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary under the Constabulary Acts.  The first thing to note about this eleventh head of this Ultimate Financial Settlement is that its terms of Article X. of the from the terms of Article X. of the Treaty.  The exact terms of Article X. are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged by or who retire in consequence of the change of government effected in pursuance hereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that Article X. of the Treaty referred to and was applicable only to such members of the police forces as might be actually serving at the moment when that Force was taken over by the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eleventh head of the Ultimate Financial Settlement which I read to you was, as every member of the House can see, much more comprehensive and covered not only the members of the Irish Police Force who retired or who were discharged, or who might retire or who might be discharged in consequence of the change of government, but all ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, irrespective of the date of their retirement or discharge, and whose pensions were payable, not under the Treaty, not in accordance with Article X., but under the Constabulary Acts, which are not mentioned in the Treaty at all.  What justification has the Minister to offer to the House for including in the Ultimate Financial Settlement the provision which relates to the pensions of all ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who had retired prior to the Treaty?  That was an obligation which Great Britain had already accepted, and which she was bound to honour, and I ask what justification can the Minister <Col N="1326" /> offer to this House for what was Great Britain's sole responsibility in this matter?  Irrespective of whether you are in favour of the Treaty or not, there is no doubt about it that Great Britain had sole responsibility for these pensions; they were not mentioned in the Treaty, and I ask the Minister what justification he can advance for having accepted that responsibility and for shouldering the people with a burden which was not cast upon them by the Treaty?</P>
    <P>On one occasion, when I raised this matter previously the Minister relied upon Article XII. of the Transfer of Functions Order 315 of 1922.  That is the British Transfer of Functions Order of 1922.  Now in dealing with that I would like to refer first of all to Paragraph X. of that Order, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Order shall transfer to the Provisional Government the Royal Irish Constabulary or the administration or control of that Force.</P>
    <P>Paragraph XII., which is the one on which the Minister relied on a previous occasion, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any property, assets, rights and liabilities connected with the functions transferred under this Order shall, if connected solely with these functions, be transferred to the Provisional Government, and if connected partly with these functions and partly with other functions shall be apportioned in such manner as may be agreed between the Governments concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this paragraph, under which not only would the property, rights and assets be transferred, but the liabilities connected with the pensions under this Order would also be transferred, only relates to these services transferred to the Provisional Government.  There was no subsequent order nullifying the effect of Paragraph X and thereby transferring the Royal Irish Constabulary or the control of that Force.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, cannot rely upon the Transfer of Functions Order in any way.  There is no doubt but that it clearly excludes any liability <Col N="1327" /> for the ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and yet the Minister in the kindness of his heart, filled with an appreciation presumably of the service which &ldquo;this splendid body of men&rdquo; as they used to be described, rendered to the people of this country during the years when the battering ram was an instrument of British rule in this country, has accepted the responsibility for paying their pensions.</P>
    <P>In all the years since its establishment what service have the members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, those who continued to remain loyal members of that Force, rendered to this country that its members should receive such signal recognition from the Minister?  In the debate upon the preceding Estimate he told us with reference to men who had served this country, those citizens who had upheld and sustained the Army of this country during its contest with the British Forces, including the R.I.C. in 1920 and 1921, that the State could not accept any responsibility for the obligations they had undertaken, and could not, in any way, recoup them for the expenses they had incurred.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister, who says it is impossible for the Government of the Irish Free State to render that meed of thanksgiving to its own, to those who were loyal and patriotic citizens of this country, accepted responsibility for the ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary, for the pensions of the men who never allowed any call of country, claim of pity or of mercy to deter them from carrying out the policy of their British paymasters.  When they were serving that Force homes were not inviolate, altars were not sacred&mdash;we heard of the ministers of religion being arrested on the very altar by these men.  We know how some of them acted as the bloodhounds of the murder gang in this country.  We have heard how they have acted as instruments of evicting landlords in this country during the days of the Land League.  It is for men like these, and pensions for men like these, that the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1328" /> who reduced the old age pensions for Irishmen and Irishwomen who had served this country all their lifetime, accepted responsibility when he signed that agreement, that disgraceful agreement, known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  I say that the Minister cannot justify the payment of these pensions to this House, and if for no other reason than that this Estimate makes provision to recoup Great Britain for the money which she spends in paying these ordinary pensions, I think that the House should reject the Estimate.</P>
    <P>And now I come to the other class of pensions included in the Estimate. They account, I think, for the larger portion of the £1,152,000 which is to be provided for this purpose. Before I pass to them, I would like to remind the House that when the Old Age Pensions Bill, introduced by Deputy Ward, was before the Dáil and when that Bill passed its Second Reading by the votes of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party, and&mdash;not only some Independents&mdash;but some members of the Minister's own Party, the Minister and the President of the Executive Council refused to accept responsibility for carrying that Bill through its further stages on the ground that it would impose an additional burden of £350,000 upon the taxpayers of the country.  That burden of £350,000 would have been expended to make it a little easier for old men and women of 70 years of age who had served this country all their lives to secure a pension at the end of their days, would have removed certain irksome conditions relating to these pensions, and would have increased considerably the pensions to some of these aged people.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to find the money to provide for these increased pensions, and the Minister who refused to find that money has come to the House to-night and is asking us to provide £1,152,000 to provide for the ordinary and disbandment pensions of ex-R.I.C. men.</P>
    <P>I have shown that as far as the Treaty is concerned, these ordinary pensions do not come within its scope at all, and that the Minister has assumed responsibility for these, not by reason of any <Col N="1329" /> obligation the Treaty imposed on him, but of his own volition, and out of his own kindness and generosity to those who served the British cause loyally and well in this country.  What now is the position in regard to the disbandment pensions?  If he were to have any responsibility for these disbandment pensions at all, that responsibility would arise under Article X of the Treaty.  I would again direct the careful attention of the House to Article X.  Article X is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those created by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of the police forces, and other public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of government effected in pursuance thereof.</P>
    <P>I will paraphrase the Article a little and delete all qualifying words so that its purport may be clearly seen.  It will then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Government agrees to pay fair compensation to members of the police forces who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence on the change of government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Who are discharged by it or who retire&rdquo;&mdash;these are very important words.  It is plain that they relate to the one set of persons, and that as they relate to the one set of persons they also envisage these persons under one and the same condition, and that is in the service, and in the service only, of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>A study of the Treaty as a whole makes it clear that the Treaty contemplated that the so-called Government of the United Kingdom, as one of the parties to the instrument, was to hand over as a going concern to the other party, that is, the Government of the Irish Free State, and in this case possibly the Provisional Government of Ireland as it was called, the whole machinery of government in the country, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <P>That is the first and fundamental condition in the agreement.  That is a condition precedent to the operation of every other provision in the contract. <Col N="1330" /> All the others are secondary and consequential on the fulfilment of that condition only.  If the primary and fundamental condition is not fulfilled in every respect, in relation to any department or service of the Government administration in this country, then such department or service cannot come within the scope of the secondary and consequential provisions, and accordingly they cannot in any circumstances apply to it.  Quite obviously the Government of the Irish Free State could not discharge any public servant unless the service in which he was engaged had come under its control by transfer or otherwise.  If a man does not enter your service you cannot discharge him from it.  I do not think that even the Minister will attempt to answer that argument.</P>
    <P>If it ever had been contemplated that the provisions of Article X would apply, irrespective of whether the service had been transferred to the Government of the Free State or not, I suggest that a different form of words would have been used in the Article. The Article, as I have shown, reads, &ldquo;who are discharged by it or who retire&rdquo;&mdash;retire from its service.  If it had meant that this Article was to apply irrespective of whether the officers entered the service of the Government of the Free State, then the Article would have to read, and I should have to read it, as &ldquo;who are discharged or who retire.&rdquo; Since the phrasing of the Article is &ldquo;who are discharged by it or who retire,&rdquo; since that particular form of phrasing is employed, the Article has to be really read as, &ldquo;who are discharged by it from its service and who voluntarily retire from its service.&rdquo; That certainly does involve a prior handing over of the service, for just as the Free State could not accept responsibility for a public servant discharged from the service of another State by that State, neither can it accept responsibility for a public servant who retires from the service of another State, and, what is more incontestable still, it cannot accept responsibility for a public servant who is forced by that other State to retire from its own, that State's, service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> Bearing these facts in mind, let us investigate the position of the R.I.C. in 1922, and see whether it fulfilled the conditions which would bring its members within the scope of Article X of the Treaty.  Let me repeat again what these conditions are&mdash;first of all, that the Royal Irish Constabulary as a service must have been handed over to the control of the Provisional Government of this country; secondly, that unless it was so handed over the Provisional Government and its successor, the Free State Government, had no responsibility for the disbandment of that force, and was not entitled to assume under Article X any responsibility for the payment of the disbandment pensions of that force.  I have already read to the House Article X of the Transfer of Functions Order, No. 315, 1922.  I shall read it again:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Order shall transfer to the Provisional Government the Royal Irish Constabulary or the administration or control of that force.</P>
    <P>There is no subsequent order annulling that reservation and transferring the Royal Irish Constabulary at any time to the control of the Provisional or any subsequent Irish Government.  Until it was disbanded in August, 1922, when according to the Minister for Agriculture, he and his colleagues started civil war in this country, the force remained completely and unreservedly under the control of the Government of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I am sure that from the British point of view there were very good reasons for not transferring that force.  If the House will cast its mind back Deputies may remember the peculiar circumstances which then prevailed in this country.  We had responsible members of the Provisional Government proclaiming in Great Britain that they were prepared to observe loyally the bond which they had entered into with the then British Government.  On the other hand, we had emissaries of members of that Government going through the length and breadth of Ireland, meeting groups of the I.R.A. here, groups of the I.R.B. there, members <Col N="1332" /> of Sinn Féin clubs in one district, and speaking at quasi-public meetings in another, all proclaiming that the moment the British forces evacuated the country the mask was going to be off and the Republic of Ireland would be solemnly proclaimed as the lawful Government in this country.  The Provisional Government were speaking with two voices in this matter, one voice for their Irish dupes, and another voice for their British friends. But that did not deceive the astute gentlemen who had control of Great Britain at that time and they were not taking any chances.  Although they knew that the R.I.C. had been a loyal and faithful force to them, and served them well and truly, nevertheless they thought that that fidelity, faith and zeal were largely a question as to who was keeping the salt box. The R.I.C. had always been faithful, we were told, to their salt, and if the salt box should pass from the keeping of the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer into the keeping, say, of the Minister for Finance in the Provisional Government for Ireland no one in Great Britain could tell what dreadful things might happen in this country.  After all, they had the recollection of the Treaty of Limerick to guide them and they thought possibly that what had been sauce for the goose in 1690 might be sauce for the gander in 1922.  Therefore, they were taking no chances, and they kept the British forces here to pursue and carry out, and make effective British policy in this country; until they found another body of men who were prepared to put this country under British control in another way.</P>
    <P>As long as we were all united it was necessary that the R.I.C. should be maintained here under British control. But the moment the Minister for Agriculture, the war maker, had started the civil war, the moment the forces of the Provisional Government did what Macready refused to do&mdash; attacked the Four Courts and started civil war; the moment they divided the Irish people by the blood feud; then the British had no more need for the R.I.C. and they were disbanded by an Act of the British Parliament passed on 4th August, 1922.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> In case there might be any thought in the mind of any Deputy that it was the Provisional Government who disbanded the R.I.C., I should like to read the first part of Section I. of the Constabulary (Ireland) Act, 1922, Chapter 55 (1) which is as follows: &ldquo;The R.I.C. shall be disbanded on such date, not being later than the 31st day of August, 1922, as may be fixed by the Lord Lieutenant and on or before that date every officer and constable of that force shall retire from the force as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant and shall on his retirement be entitled to receive such compensation as may be awarded him by the Treasury&rdquo;&mdash;not by the Minister for Finance of the Provisional Government, but by the British Treasury&mdash;&ldquo;in accordance with the rules contained in Part I. of the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, in regard to this Act, I should like the House to note that it was passed by the Imperial Parliament, not even by the Parliament of Southern Ireland and not by the Parliament of the Provisional Government, if there were such a Parliament in existence; certainly not by the Second Dáil and not by the Dáil which was elected in 1923. Secondly, this Act compulsorily retired every officer and constable in the force.  They were left no discretion in the matter, no option or election.  The section definitely decrees that every officer and constable shall retire from the force as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant.  That is all there is to it.  They had to go when they were told to go, and they were told to go under these circumstances and under these conditions.  And when they were told, under such circumstances and under such conditions, they were discharged, but discharged not by the Government of the Irish Free State, but by the British Government.</P>
    <P>I think I have made perfectly clear to the House the circumstances under which the R.I.C. were disbanded.  Let us get back now to Article X. of the Treaty.  Article X. of the Treaty states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation <Col N="1334" /> to members of the police forces who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change in government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that when the words, &ldquo;who are discharged by it,&rdquo; were inserted in that Article, only two positions were contemplated&mdash;the first position being that of a public servant who was discharged from its service by the new Government, and the second position that of a public servant who would voluntarily retire from the service of the new Government.  Forced retirement from the service of any Government is in effect a discharge by that Government.  In the case of the R.I.C., all the men were discharged by the British Government.  It is explicit in the words of the Article that they could not possibly, in view of the fact that they were discharged by the British Government, come within the terms of Article X of the Treaty.  I admit possibly that an argument, which would not be a sound one, might be put up that if an officer was not actually discharged from this service if he remained in the service of Great Britain, and by reason of the change of Government was afterwards found to be a redundant officer and retired from that service of his own volition. I admit that the Minister might put up an argument like that, but I do not think it would be a sound one.  In this case, however, there is no question of that.  In this case the officers and men of the R.I.C. were definitely told that they should retire on the order of the Lord Lieutenant. They had to get out.  The whole force was disbanded, and had to go.  Thus they were discharged by the British Government.  That is the position?</P>
    <P>I submit I have shown quite clearly to the House that there is no obligation under the Treaty to pay £1,152,000 that it is proposed to vote under sub-head M of this Estimate, for the purpose of repaying to the British Government the moneys they have expended in respect to ordinary and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  What then is the position.  £1,152,000 is to be taken from our people, wrung from <Col N="1335" /> the toil of our workers and small farmers.  Widows will have to pinch and scrape in order to provide that money; children may have to go hungry in order to provide it, and they may have to go without boots to school or without a rag on their backs.  Shopkeepers who at the present moment are unable to make ends meet will have to find some part of that £1,152,000.  But they need not find it if the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party place their responsibilities and duties to the people above their loyalty to the Minister, and refuse to honour this misconceived agreement into which he has entered.</P>
    <P>After all, if you are in favour of the Treaty, surely you are entitled to stand, in dealing with England, for the letter of your bond.  There is nothing in that bond or agreement, nothing in Article X. that imposes upon you the obligation of finding that £1,152,000 to pay the ordinary and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary. If you are here as responsible Deputies, sitting as the true representatives of the people who sent you to this House, you must put the interest of the people first.  We know very well how the farmers have been crying out for relief.  We provided a miserable three-quarters of a million for them.  We know that so far as the great mass of the farmers are concerned that will afford no real relief.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Here you have £1,152,000 to add to that; that additional sum would almost completely de-rate the agricultural land in Ireland.  It is in the power of such Deputies as Deputy Gorey, Deputy Dr. Hennessy, Deputy G. Wolfe, and Deputy Bennett to keep that money here in this country and to devote it to the complete de-rating of agricultural land in this country.  As to whether this money goes wrongfully out of the country or stays in it they have it in their power to say, and I challenge them, after the case that has been put up to them, to go into the Lobby and vote for unjust and wrongful payment of this £1,152,000 of the Irish <Col N="1336" /> taxpayers' money over to the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the benefit of listening to the Minister for Finance when he spoke on Vote No. 8. From what I have heard now the Minister said something which might have shed a light upon this matter that the House is now considering. I will be pardoned, therefore, if I provoke the Minister to repeat something he said then.  I desire the Minister to inform the House how he suggests that a Royal Irish constable in 1922 who was disbanded or discharged by virtue of the British Statute of August, 1922, could sustain his claim for a pension if he were to bring it before any tribunal that had to adjudicate upon it.  The heads of the Ultimate Financial Settlement to which allusion has been made here is an instrument signed by the Minister and Mr. Churchill.  Does the Minister state or insinuate that that instrument has any statutory effect, or that it is in any sense a warrant for the payment of this money?  Does the Minister suggest that he can go outside the Treaty of 1921 or the agreement of the 3rd December, 1925?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The generally accepted canon of construction of a statute is, I think, that you must look for the intention of the parties to any instrument referred to in the statute and for the intention of the legislature to the statute itself.  What the Minister said, or what the President said, or what Mr. Churchill said, which led up to the entering into the instrument, afterwards confirmed by Parliament, has really only the same effect as what the soldiers said.  It must be utterly disregarded.  Now, beginning with the Treaty of 1921, it provides that compensation is to be paid to the constable who was transferred, and who was subsequently discharged or subsequently retired because of the change of government.  I do not desire to occupy the time of the House by going over the ground so well covered by Deputy MacEntee, but how can the Minister suggest that any individuals who by virtue of this Vote, and by virtue of the statute of the British Parliament, will receive part <Col N="1337" /> of this money, come within the words of the Treaty?  There is some sort of suggestion, some vague reference to something, in the Transfer of Functions Order.  I have heard such a reference in this House, and certainly outside this House, from supporters of the Government in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Will the Minister say now that any Order in Council is sufficient to onerate the people of the Free State with this burden?  Such Orders in Council, or something like them, must necessarily be for the purpose of implementing, providing the machinery for the working of a document like the Treaty, or the statute confirmed by the Treaty. But they must be mere bits of machinery.  They cannot of themselves fix such liability on any country.  We come then to the Agreement of December, 1925.</P>
    <P>It is a tolerably clear document and again I say if we are to accept a canon of construction that you must find the intention in the words of the instrument and not from any external source what is there in that document of 1925 that provides any justification whatever for these payments?  The Minister has, I think, frequently been challenged in regard to these matters.  I am not long enough in this House to say that the Minister has not ever given any definite answer.  All I can say is that in my little research in which I have indulged I have been unable to find any definite statement with regard to these points I have mentioned, and that the public when they adverted to these matters at all merely had, on the one side, speeches from members of the Fianna Fáil Party drawing attention to the various clauses and sections referred to by Deputy MacEntee and they had, on the other side, from various platforms in the Free State references to embezzlement, the Ten Commandments and other silly and childish statements. They never had the satisfaction of hearing tersely from the Minister for Finance or any other Minister the precise statutory authority for these payments.</P>
    <P>The House would, I think, be gratified if the Minister were now, definitely <Col N="1338" /> and pointedly, and without any vague phrases to refer to the words in any of the statutory documents that justifies the payment, for if the Minister makes the case that something said by somebody leading up to these documents is sufficient to justify it, it might be an advantage to the country if they had an explicit statement from the Minister to that effect.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to what I understand was regarded by certain people now in receipt of pensions under sub-head J and in the employment of the State to the manner in which they are being treated regarding certain deductions made from their pensions.  I refer to the individuals who are now receiving pensions under sub-head J, some of whom are employed as preventive officers in the Customs and Excise, and others who are employed in the Land Commission and other Government Departments. I understand that the Department of Finance, acting upon certain regulations, made under the Superannuation (Pensions) Act, 1923, are deducting a certain amount from the salaries of these people, and that the amount of the deduction in the case of these particular individuals exceeds the amount deducted from persons now receiving military service pensions, and who are also employed in Government Departments. Three or four members of this Party have been receiving repeated communications, some of which have been forwarded to the Minister or his Department, asking that where the people are in receipt of military service pensions or pensions granted under this particular Act of 1923, that they should be treated on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that where the individual employed in the Customs and Excise Department is in receipt of a military service pension or a pension granted under the Pensions Act, provided he is doing the same class of work, he should receive the same pay.  Seeing that the pensions are granted to people who have made sacrifices of some kind or <Col N="1339" /> another pre-Truce, I do not think there is any case for making a distinction as between the two classes.  It has been stated to me in writing that some of the individuals who are receiving pensions under the Superannuation Act are paid for overtime work.  I am not quite sure if the same applies to those working in Government Departments who receive pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act or not.  I will not go into detail further than to say that servants of the State, regardless of the Department in which they are employed or the work they are called upon to do, should, in the case of the two classes of persons, receive the same payment, and should be put upon the same basis so far as deductions from their pensions are concerned, and should in all cases receive payment for overtime when that overtime is ordered to be done by the heads of the Departments. I would like the Minister to look into this matter with a view to putting this on a sound basis, and to removing complaints that we have received in connection with this matter for the past year or two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer Deputy Davin's question in detail now as to what difference of treatment may exist.  I will answer it at a later stage. The deductions from resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men are made in accordance with certain rules, and as far as I recollect these rules would apply to any other police pensioners.  There is a special scale of deductions for military service pensions, and if there is some difference I do not know that that necessarily causes a grievance to the Royal Irish Constabulary men.  I think the most a pensioner could claim to be entitled to would be the same treatment as a police pensioner.  If the military service pensions people have a different scale I do not know that that gives any good ground for grievance to the others.  I have not the documents at hand, and I could not answer at the moment, but I will look into the point mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the case raised by Deputy Fahy, I have no information to <Col N="1340" /> hand about that.  I know that in general the position we took up with regard to resigned or dismissed Royal Irish Constabulary men who entered the Civic Guard was that once we gave them a job equivalent, roughly, to the job they had left, it was up to them to keep that job.  We put them in the position that they would have been in if they had not left the R.I.C., except that on completing their terms of service in the Civic Guard they would be entitled to the additional service. We took the view that if a man, by misconduct, or something of that sort&mdash; I know that there was no misconduct suggested in the case mentioned by Deputy Fahy&mdash;by a breach of some regulation forfeited his position, just as he would have forfeited it in the R.I.C., then we had no obligation to him, and I think that was perfectly fair.  I think if all the dismissed R.I.C. men could have been taken into the Civic Guard, or if they were willing to go into that force, then the position ought to have been that they should serve out their service in the ordinary way before getting pensions.  If they forfeited a position in the Civic Guard they forfeited all previous service, just as in the R.I.C.  I do not think that attitude involved injustice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point mentioned by Deputy MacEntee and by Deputy Geoghegan, the Royal Irish Constabulary were not transferred, not because the British Government did not want to transfer them, but because the Provisional Government did not want them.  Perhaps when the Treaty was being drawn up it might have been thought&mdash;I think from the wording of the Treaty it must have been thought&mdash; that it would be possible to take over the R.I.C. and perhaps retain a considerable number of them in the service, only discharging those against whom, for some reason or other, there was strong local or personal feeling.</P>
    <P>It became apparent in view of the debates on the Treaty, and the attitude that was generally taken up, that we could not do anything with the R.I.C. The Provisional Government did not want them, and it was arranged with the British Government that the R.I.C. <Col N="1341" /> would not be transferred, but would be disbanded by the British Government. That was a matter of arrangement, a matter for the convenience of the Provisional Government.  If the Deputies think that we could get out of the liabilities assumed by the Treaty, by in some way tricking the British Government, then that seems to me to be an absurd suggestion. The British Government acted in that capacity at the wish of the Provisional Government.  The suggestion practically is that we could say to the British Government, &ldquo;We do not want any of the R.I.C. transferred.  We will assume liability for the pensions, as if they were transferred and discharged by us,&rdquo; and then when the British Government did that we could say. &ldquo;Oh, there is no written word; there is nothing in the Treaty or in anything else which says that we are to pay the pensions.&rdquo; That sort of treatment is not the treatment that a country can get off with, and anybody who has gone into the question of international liabilities, and international agreements knows quite well that all the circumstances surrounding a transaction would be taken into consideration by an international tribunal, whether an arbitral tribunal or any other sort of tribunal.  You could not get off with the pettifogging sort of argument which was addressed to the interpretation of words, and had no regard to the facts of the transaction.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that the British acted there at the desire of the Provisional Government, and for the convenience of the Provisional Government.  The Provisional Government never suggested that we should thereby, because the British Government acted on our behalf, and in that capacity, get out of the liability which was undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreements were there in the arrangement with regard to the R.I.C. pensioners who had retired before the change of government. That was a liability.  The liability for their pensions was the liability following the transfer of functions of the police and if the Deputy will consider the question of, say, the Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners, it will be perhaps clearer. The D.M.P. as a force was transferred and, of course, the liability undertaken in the Treaty was for special treatment of those that might be discharged.  That was undertaken and carried through.  The D.M.P. was not a political force but an ordinary police force, except for a very small number of the members, and it had none of the traditions which made the R.I.C. and members of it obnoxious to the people.  There is no mention of the R.I.C. pensioners who had retired before the change of government under the Treaty, and it is perfectly obvious that payment of the pensions of D.M.P. pensioners is part of the ordinary Government expenditure on police.  If the British were to pay these pensions it would, in fact, be a subsidy towards the policing of the country, because in <Col N="1343" /> every country which had sufficient civilisation to have a police force for any considerable period the cost of police really falls under three main heads, the cost of barracks and buildings, the cost of the pay of the men serving, and the cost of pensioners who have retired.</P>
      <P>If you look at France, Germany, England, America, or anywhere else the cost falls under these heads.  There was no mention of the existing pensions of the D.M.P. in the Treaty, just as there was no mention of handing over the men, because the Treaty was a document which only dealt with a small number of major questions and did not affect, in any way, a multitude of minor arrangements and adjustments necessary in order that the change contemplated by the Treaty should be effected.  Although there was no mention of the D.M.P. pensioners in the Treaty, it is perfectly obvious that they were a charge on the ordinary cost of government of the country just in the same way as was the cost of civil servants who were attached to particular departments here and who retired.  The same thing applies to the existing R.I.C. pensioners, though Deputies perhaps might feel less gratification in meeting the liability, because of the feeling that had arisen with regard to the R.I.C. and also because of the fact that that force had been carrying out duties that were obnoxious to the people.  Nine-tenths of the duties of the R.I.C., except for the year prior to the change of government, had been in the ordinary nature of police duties, just the ordinary things that police would do in every country. There was, of course, a great deal more attention paid to the occasional turns of duty they did in other connections of a political character, or in some way relating to matters about which people felt very strongly, and that were hostile to the national movement.  But that was a very small part of the duties of the R.I.C.  In fact the R.I.C. pensioners, leaving out, if Deputies like, some small fraction of duties that were not ordinary police duties, represented one of the ordinary costs of a police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> The pensions of the R.I.C. represent part of the ordinary cost of the police, one of the things that every Government has to meet.  If we were put in the position here, as I said before, that our charges for police fell only under two heads, namely, buildings and the pay of the existing members, and we had not the liability to meet what has to be met in every other country for pensions, it would mean at the present day we would be receiving a subsidy from the British Government towards carrying on the police services in this country.  But there is no reason why the British after the change of government should continue to pay what was in fact part of the normal cost of police, and accordingly the pensions followed the transfer of functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The British Army left this country entirely.  It would have been impossible at any time to say what proportion of the British Army was actually related in any way to Irish needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole cost of the police was an ordinary service.  As I say, the cost of the pensions followed the transfer of the functions of the police to the Provisional Government. I have referred to the fact that these payments were being made&mdash;they were voted by the Dáil&mdash;before the agreement amending the Treaty of December, 1925, and before the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  As I have already pointed out, the President indicated clearly that he used as an argument for the cancellation of Article V. of the Treaty that we were already paying these pensions, and that they were as heavy a burden as we could bear.  These pensions were accepted as a liability from the beginning.  They are part of the normal cost of the government of the country.  There was <Col N="1345" /> nothing in the suggestion made in any of these negotiations that we should cease to pay them and that we had a right to cease to pay them.  We have, of course, been over the ground already.  It really amounts to a suggestion on the part of Deputies that we can, some way or another, coerce the British Government into meeting liabilities that are normally our own liabilities.  That cannot be done at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact you cannot do any sort of a trick like that. It is impossible to suggest as between Governments that you can somehow or another do some sort of sharp trick <Col N="1346" /> such as might be done in a petty sessions court or something that might be supported in the case of an individual. Very often an individual can get out of an obligation on some sort of a technicality.  But international arrangements are not dealt with on that basis.  A country cannot manage to trick another country.  The substance of the transactions have to be regarded, and there is no doubt that the agreement which cancelled our liability for the British Public Debt was come to on the basis of our continuing these payments that we had been making.</P>
