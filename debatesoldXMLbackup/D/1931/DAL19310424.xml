      <P>I propose to take the Estimates first and not to have the business interrupted, but I propose at a convenient hour, either 12 or 1 o'clock, to take the Land Bill from the Seanad.  The Parliamentary Secretary proposes to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>Is it not rather soon to take the Land Bill?  The amendments from the Seanad have only just come into our hands, and they require a certain amount of consideration and discussion.  Is there any urgent necessity to take that Bill to-day? Could it not be postponed until Wednesday?</P>

      <P>This is the 24th April, and it is very advisable to have the <Col N="314" /> Bill passed a sufficient number of days before the gale day, which is the 1st May, in order to avoid a multiplicity of calculations in respect to the alterations in the percentages that will take place by reason of the passing of the measure.  The Parliamentary Secretary will explain the various amendments, and I think that an opportunity would be afforded then of seeing whether it would not be possible to take it to-day.  I am advised to have it passed at least a week before the gale day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>A word of explanation is, I think, due by me as the Committee discharged my name from its list of members.  I resigned from the Committee on the ground that the nomination of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Committee appointed to deal with the Bank of Ireland Bill was ignored.  The nominations, therefore, to the Committee were not carried out as they are on other Committees.  Having taken up that attitude at that time, it is impossible <Col N="315" /> for us, until the Standing Orders are changed, to take part in that Committee. We reserve our right, however at a later date, when Standing Orders are, we understand, to be recast, to reconsider the whole matter then.</P>

    <P>The Dáil, according to Order, went into Committee on Finance, and resumed consideration of the following motion:&mdash;</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £7,543 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the President of the Executive Council.&mdash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter last night I gave as an example of what was occurring in the case of one family in the town of Cobh, a family consisting of four boys who had fought during the whole of the Tan régime. One of them was captured and executed, another was wounded, a third, after three years of unemployment, had to seek a living in America, and the fourth, unfortunately for himself, is a married man with a family, and had to remain at home.  He is still unemployed.  In dealing with this matter last night the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was their duty to look after those who had fought.  If it is the duty of the National Government to look after those who fought, do the President <Col N="316" /> and the Executive Council deem that they have any duty whatever towards that family?</P>
      <P>I regret to have to say here that the boy who was wounded and became a burden on his married brother, died last year from the effects of wounds. Two years ago I made an appeal here to the Minister for Finance for something for that wounded boy which would relieve the burden on the married man.  I was refused, and the boy died in Cobh hospital, where he had been kept by the ratepayers of Co. Cork.  That is the treatment meted out to those who fought.  The married brother is still at home with a wife and three children to support.  He is idle, while employment is being given in connection with the tanks at Haulbowline to ex-National Army men who are single men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very sinister feature about all this.  It is very strange that on the very same day that an order was sent down by the Minister for Local Government to the county councils to the effect that the maximum wage to be paid for work on the roads was £1 9s. per week, that order was coupled with an order that preferential treatment was to be given to ex-members of the National Army.  In other words, the respect which the Executive Council had for those who fought, as they put it, was to use them as blacklegs, strike breakers to break the labour movement, to bring down the wages of the working men to a level on which they could not live&mdash;£1 9s. per week on casual labour for a man who had to support his wife and children. That was the use to which the Executive Council turned their machine when they were done murdering their fellow-Irishmen.  That is the use they made there of them.  The Government turned them into a strike-breaking machine.  I have seen the effect of that as a member of the County Council. I have seen it within six miles of the City of Cork, where we got a grant for a certain road.  The farmers were to pay for a motorists' road something over £2,000 a mile.  We got a grant from the Road Fund towards it, and that grant out of the Road Fund&mdash; mind you, it was not relief work or <Col N="317" /> anything of the kind&mdash;was coupled with an order that the maximum wage was to be £1 9s. and that preferential treatment was to be given to ex-members of the National Army.</P>
    <P>There are not, and I am glad of it, many ex-members of the National Army residing in my district.  What happened?  These men looked for a fair wage from the contractor who had the contract.  They had broken time and everything else, and they asked to be paid by the hour.  The contractor refused to pay them and there was a strike.  The contractor went to the Labour Exchange in the City of Cork and brought down lorries full of ex-National Army men to break the strike of the labourers there for a living wage. The mothers and wives of those workers, who saw their husbands after twelve months of idleness again being deprived of a livelihood, turned out and drove off the ex-members of the National Army.  The strike continued for two months, and at the end of that period these workers had to get the wages they looked for, in spite of the order of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The point I make is that not alone are these men to get preferential treatment, but they are to be used to crush any hopes of any working man getting a decent living wage in this country. That is the use that has been made of them.  I have, perhaps, more respect for some ex-members of the National Army than the Executive Council.  I would honestly say I have more respect for them.  There are some good old comrades of mine who went and joined the National Army through their own convictions, and I would not like to see those men, after their services during the Tan regime and during the Civil War, used as strike-breakers and blacklegs by the Executive Council. That is the only use they have for the ordinary private soldier who served in the ranks, to use him as a blackleg.  A picture was drawn in this House the other night of what was given to others by Deputy Aiken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with preferential treatment given to ex-members <Col N="318" /> of the National Army.  This question is not confined solely to labour.  It runs right through to the Appointments Commissioners where so many marks are given to ex-soldiers.  We are told that the Appointments Commissioners act fairly and aboveboard, and that they judge candidates on their professional record and capacity.  But how does it work out in practice?  So many marks are given for service in the National Army. Although another candidate may have a better professional record he may be deprived of the position, and a candidate whose record is not as good may be appointed because he served in the National Army.  On Wednesday evening, on the Post Office Vote, I alluded to the same thing.  I dealt with the case of an unfortunate boy who was the sole support of his aged father and mother, who had worked for five years as an auxiliary postman, but who, when a vacancy occurred, was not promoted to a permanent position.  No, a hooligan&mdash;and I cannot call him anything else&mdash;who had disgraced himself in the position, was brought in and put into the job because, as he said himself, he had served in every army in the world.  He had served in the British Navy, in the British Army, and he followed up his work in the British Army by continuing to serve the British Army in green uniform.  When that man came back to the village on a booze he was put into the position, while the boy who was the sole support of his aged parents was not appointed.  At the time I appealed to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the case.  I pointed to the record of the man who had got the position, who had been found lying drunk on the strand in possession of a bag of letters that he should have delivered.  That was his last service in the position. However, he was taken back, but he only held the position for three months when he went on another &ldquo;bend.&rdquo; The job was not given to the boy who had been acting and who was only getting 5/- or 6/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I wanted to make political capital out of this matter I would not say a word about it, because the biggest thing that is killing the Cumann na <Col N="319" /> nGaedheal Government in the country at present is the bringing in of &ldquo;buckoes&rdquo; like the one I refer to and putting them into positions, while men with dependents are left on the roadside. If I wished to use such incidents for Party capital I would not say a word, but I have a duty to my constituents, who are being starved out, and who have not the money to go any place else.  That is the position of affairs we want to rectify.  I am not making any appeal to the Government. I have given up making appeals to the Executive Council, but I hope that the exposure will have the effect of compelling them to give justice to the unfortunate married men who happen to be unemployed while &ldquo;buckoes&rdquo; are brought in and given jobs.  The use of ex-members of the National Army as a lever to pull down wages of the working people is a bigger scandal still. We had an example a short time ago of how these people were treated.  A sum of £200,000 was given away to members of the National Army without the sanction of the Dáil.  Is it not time this state of affairs ended?  There is no use trying to shame the Government, but I hope that they will be driven into doing something by public exposure.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Corry suggests, there appears to be a universal policy in the Departments which have to do with the expenditure of public money to give preference in employment to ex-members of the National Army.  It is possible something could be said in defence of that policy a few years ago, but I submit the time has long passed when the regulations giving such preference to ex-members of the National Army, to the exclusion of members of the civilian population who have dependents, should be withdrawn. For example, taking the Unemployment Relief Votes, it would appear to me that when money is voted for the relief of unemployment the intention should be to do that regardless of the political views held by people who are unemployed.  I think it is altogether wrong, and contrary to the intentions of the House when voting money that it should be earmarked <Col N="320" /> for a particular section of the community, and a small section at that. The money is contributed by the taxpayers for the general good of the community, and the people who supply the money by way of taxation or local rates are entitled to be assured that it will be devoted to the relief of general distress and not to the relief of the small section that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are disposed to relieve. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Board of Works, and the Department of Local Government are, in my experience, the greatest offenders in this respect.  We gathered from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that while these regulations exist they are not being enforced in all Departments.  It would appear from the Minister's explanation of his policy that the extent to which they are being enforced depends on the enthusiasm of the Minister in charge.</P>
      <P>From my experience of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister in charge of that Department, the Minister for Finance, exceeds all the other Ministers in his enthusiasm. We had a number of appointments of postmen in County Monaghan recently, and though there were many applications from fully-qualified men with dependents, and also from people recommended by the local postmasters, invariably they were turned down if they had not served in the National Army. The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked for details in specific cases the other night.  In three distinct cases men have been appointed as sub-postmen who were not married, had no dependents, and were in receipt of Army pensions.  I think that is carrying preferential treatment too far.  In a recent appointment of a postman in a rural area in County Monaghan, the person appointed was an ex-Army pensioner drawing £2 10s. weekly.  There were many unemployed applicants in the district, fully competent to discharge the duties, who were recommended by the local postmaster, and who had a knowledge of Irish, which one would think would induce the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with his enthusiasm for the language to give them a preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it does not work out that <Col N="321" /> way.  In the town of Monaghan, preliminary arrangements have been made to expend the sum of £13,000 on a sewerage scheme.  I understand that £4,000 of that £13,000 will be given in the form of grants.  If the ratepayers of Monaghan are to put up £9,000 for the purpose of having this sewerage scheme carried out, I think it would be most unfair that the Minister responsible, or the Executive Council as a whole, should lay down as a condition of the expenditure of their money, that preference must be given to ex-members of the National Army, whether married or single, to the exclusion of the civilian population, many of whom are in dire distress and are being maintained out of the local charities or out of public funds.  This policy is the cause of considerable friction down the country, and, I suppose, in the cities as well.  It is not in a spirit of hostility to these people in particular that I make this protest; it is merely in the spirit of ordinary fair play.  These people have been already generously treated.  As was pointed out in the debate here last night, a considerable amount of public money has already been expended on ex-Army men and their dependents. The vast majority of these people are in receipt of pensions from the State. While in many cases the pensions may not be very large and may not be sufficient to maintain them and their dependents&mdash;if they have dependents&mdash; at any rate, they are in a considerably better condition financially than civilians who have dependents and who have no visible means of supporting these dependents.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Corry that this practice of giving preferential treatment to men who have served in the Free State Army applies from the labourer to the highest position that a public body or the Appointments Commission is called upon to fill.  I think that that is utterly indefensible and that it is time that the regulations were withdrawn.  If people are to be appointed to responsible executive positions in the service of local bodies, they should be appointed on merit and merit alone.  I do not want to cite cases on that head, but I think it will be generally agreed that <Col N="322" /> members of the National Army did not carry all the brains of the professions in recent years.  It is a significant fact that, especially in the professions, ex-members of the National Army are the only people who have been appointed to public positions.  I am sure that they have their ordinary share of ability, but I think it is asking too much to ask us to accept the position that they are the only people qualified in the professions in recent years who really have first-class brains, and are of first-class standing in their respective professions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The origin of these regulations which the President refers to as constituting the policy of the Executive Council, regarding preference in employment for ex-members of the Free State Army, seems to be shrouded in some obscurity.  We cannot get definitely from any Department precise information as to when these regulations were first made.  As far as I can discover, the first regulation made was in respect of the £2,000,000 grant, about 1923 or 1924, in connection with roads.  Orders were sent down that preference should be given to ex-members of the Free State Army in the following order&mdash;Firstly, ex-members of the National Army who are married; secondly, single members of the National Army and married civilians on a fifty-fifty basis.  There might have been some excuse for that course then, considering the position of affairs in the country and the number of men who were being disbanded, and for whom the Government had to get employment, or to whom they had to give grants.  But the Government should not forget, and the President of the Executive Council particularly should not forget, when referring to the service of these men&mdash; this is not a matter of party politics&mdash; that years before, without any reward or any hope of it, there were men who gave good service.  As has been shown, they are not being considered now.  They asked for no reward and they expected none.  I am sure that the President and members opposite will admit that on our side&mdash;on the side of those who oppose the Government&mdash;<Col N="323" /> are many hundreds of those who gave good service from 1919 to 1921, and who should not now be passed over.</P>
      <P>There might possibly be some excuse, also, in connection with certain grants or votes for giving some preference to ex-members of the Free State Army.  I do not speak with any animosity against ex-members of the National Army.  I only plead for fair play and that employment be given to those who most deserve it, whether they are ex-members of the National Army, ex-members of the British Army, or ex-members of any other army, if they are Irishmen.  I merely ask that married men with dependents, or single men with dependents, be given preference in regard to employment, and I think that there should be no necessity whatever in 1931 for making that plea, considering that thirty-four million pounds, as has been shown by Labour Deputies, has been expended on the Army.  They are certainly much better off than their civilian neighbours who have got no grant, no gratuities, no pensions, and it is most unfair to give them this continued preference.  I have had representations made to me by ratepayers in County Galway, and by councillors and commissioners in five towns of County Galway, some of whom are supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal.  They say that this is unfair and that there is no necessity to adopt this course to-day. The Government does not seem to appreciate that.  Preference is being given to single men.  I had one instance of that brought to my notice lately.  It was the case of a road worker in County Galway who had six children. He was put off and a single man, an ex-member of the National Army, was put on.  Consequently, this married man became dependent on home assistance.  The ratepayers are naturally complaining that his place should be taken by a man with a pension.  It is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They denied this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they denied this, but I sent a whole statement of the case to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health within the last <Col N="324" /> fortnight.  In the same way, there is the position in the town of Ballinasloe. I have had representations made to me from time to time by ex-British soldiers, who are Irishmen after all, because many good Irishmen joined in the British Army in the Great War. They were driven into it for one reason or another, driven very often by economic stress.  We know also that in the time of the Black and Tan War many ex-members of the British Army gave good service, and they should not be penalised.  These men complain to me bitterly.  They can get no employment there.  The positions available are not sufficient to absorb the ex-members of the National Army, and single men at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the President think it makes for efficiency that a contractor for public works has to employ these men whether he likes it or not?  I have been interested from time to time trying to secure employment for unemployed men.  Some time ago I wanted to get employment for two men.  One of them had been in the civil war and the other had not.  Both had been in the I.R.A.  I went to the contractor to get work for these men, and he said to me: &ldquo;I dare not employ them, because if I did I would lose my Government contracts.&rdquo;  That is the condition of things that runs through the whole gamut of employment as well.  Vacancies were to be filled lately in connection with Fisheries.  I would like to know if it is true that the candidates were asked about their services in the National Army.  This thing runs through the whole gamut of employment under the State.  In many districts in Galway there is great bitterness against ex-members of the National Army over this differentiation.  The President and the Executive Council, in continuing these regulations, are doing no service to ex-members of the National Army. They are turning their neighbours and the local councils against these men. The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that it must continue longer.  We have had a vote of £300,000 for the relief of distress passed in this House.  Surely that money should be for the relief of those who need it.  We were <Col N="325" /> not told when it was going through that it was relief for ex-members of the National Army.  We, as well as anybody else in this House, hope that ex-members of the National Army will get relief in proportion to their needs, that they will get relief as well as anyone else&mdash;but we want no preferential treatment for ex-National Army men or for ex-I.R.A. men, or ex-British Army men, or ex-anybody else.  This system of giving a preference to ex-members of the National Army is very much like using Government resources for Party purposes.  These regulations that the President still upholds look very much like that.</P>
    <P>Apart from the cases I have mentioned. I will mention the case of the grant to Mountrath.  There you had £5,000 raised locally, and the Government contributed £2,000, but the Government dictated who is to be employed. Though the local people had to put up the great bulk of the money the Government insists on dictating who is to get employment.  I think it is not fair to the ex-members of the National Army, and it is not fair to the public; it is not fair to the contractors. The Government is doing a very bad thing politically for themselves. Of course the Government would not take any advice from me in that matter, but I tell them now that they are creating a great lot of antagonism, and it is of no use to the ex-members of the National Army, for it is turning their neighbours against them.  It is time to stop it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say a great deal on this subject, but I do want to emphasise most strongly the bad effects resulting from this preferential treatment.  There may have been some case for giving a preference to these men immediately after the civil war.  I will put that stronger and say that there was a very strong case indeed for giving some preference to them at that particular time.  Some 60,000 to 70,000 men were gathered up from all sorts of places in Ireland without any atmosphere of careful selection whatever. They were got into the Army for a certain time under very irregular conditions.  The Army that was brought <Col N="326" /> together was rather an irregular and scrappy thing.  Out of that somewhat irregular military organisation something like 40,000 were demobilised. They were thrown on to the labour market.  I am sorry that the President has left, because he has a definite and particular knowledge of this particular subject.  He knows and the House knows that certain of these men who were, as it were, thrown out were men of very reckless character, and that there was a good deal of crime and disorder which was attributed to other people, but which was really the direct result of the sudden demobilisation of these men.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, just as in the case of the British Government who instituted an economic expedient which is having very serious results from the point of view of the future of the British people, the Government were faced with the problem of providing for the demobilised men.  The British instituted the general dole system in order to avoid the consequences arising from the demobilisation of their men. In the case of the British there were some six million to seven million men who had been trained to arms and who had been trained for some years to regard life and property not merely of no importance, but something to be destroyed as such, and it was necessary, in order to prevent the revolutionary aftermath of the European War, that the British people should be prepared to expend some thousands of millions of money for the purpose of preventing these men who had been trained in these habits being let loose, with consequences which would naturally follow to the community.  To some extent that was true in relation to our own demobilised Army.  You had a somewhat parallel case.  For a time I could see that the Government might have a duty of that kind, but with the fluxion of time that undoubtedly has passed away.  These men are now normal members of society. They have been absorbed to the extent to which the Government will allow them to be absorbed into the ordinary community, and they have to take their place as ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come here to this House we provide relief grants <i>ad hoc.</i>  We <Col N="327" /> presumably provide them for the purpose of relief of distress because of very urgent and real distress.  It is certainly radically and fundamentally wrong that that relief should be car-marked for a particular section of the people.  But if we were only dealing with these <i>ad hoc</i> amounts, however illogical the position would be, one might say &ldquo;these are small things, do not mind them.&rdquo;  But during a number of years the whole tax revenue of this country is being used in the same way as a patronage fund.  The contractor has to be of the right kind.  Unless the contractor is of the right kind, unless he is prepared to fall in with the atmosphere, he cannot continue as contractor to the Government.  The supplier of materials, the labourer, anybody who does not conform in this matter to the extent of the regulations, suffers in the expenditure of the £20,000,000 or the £23,000,000 which is taken from the community.  All that money is used as a lever.  The man to-day who would be politically opposed to this Government, who would enter into business, in which that Government would interfere, and risk his finance in the matter, would be very foolish.  I had a case at the last election of a man who came to me and said that he was prepared to nominate me as a candidate.  Before doing so, he said: &ldquo;I will tell you my position, and if you tell me that I ought to do so I will nominate you.&rdquo;  He told me his actual business conditions.</P>

      <P>Very well then, I will not pursue it.  The point we are dealing with is that in every department of the State, in the expenditure of the whole of the money which the State gets, the same atmosphere is running through it, the same atmosphere of preference and prejudice which is shown in this matter.  I am not taking this thing up in any bitter spirit.  I <Col N="328" /> think it is bad from the point of view of the Government.  It think it is bad from the point of view of the State. I think it prevents that settling down which I am anxious to see.  It prevents people getting behind whatever Government may be in power, independent of what it is or of what its policies are.  I hope that the Government, in the light of this debate, and in the light of the particular instances which have been given, and, if I may say so, especially in the light of the excellently stated case made by Deputy Davin, will turn their backs on the policy of proscription, and try, as far as the revenue of this country is concerned, and as far as their particular administration is concerned, to see that the benefit of it is fairly distributed over the whole community, and not confined to a section in which they are interested.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to a statement which the Minister for Industry and Commerce made yesterday evening, and which I think will have the effect of increasing the difficulties which several Deputies have referred to, and which take place when contracts for schemes of work are being carried out, in regard to this question of preference to ex-Servicemen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, as some of the speakers have said, is not by any means the first time in which this matter was raised in the House.  It was raised in the form of a motion in June, 1926 by Deputy Norton and Deputy Johnson and the Minister for Local Government who is now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, stated at that time that there was a tendency to have the regulations very considerably relaxed.  A very significant statement was made on that occasion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, just before the end of the debate and before the motion was withdrawn.  He is reported to have stated &ldquo;It is quite clear that there must come a time&mdash;I do not know when&mdash;because it depends on conditions of employment, but it should come I think, within a year&mdash;when this type of restriction will disappear altogether&rdquo; (Col. 2255, Vol. 16&mdash;Official <Col N="329" /> Debates).  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made that very definite statement five years ago.  It was his opinion at that time that inside a year or thereabouts the time would come when this particular restriction would come to an end.  I think all must agree that the time has come when the difficulty of carrying out that restriction, if it were nothing else, has so increased that it is impossible to carry it out with any degree of fairness, because not alone must you consider the question of dependents, but all sorts of questions will arise.  For instance, it may be that the ex-Army men joined in 1925 or 1926; they may not have the same claim that the men who went out in the period of Civil War would have. There are men who on several occasions, and under several schemes have got preference.  How long are they going to continue to get that preference? All these questions will arise.  I think the point that Deputy Davin stressed must receive consideration. The point I would stress is in some cases single men because they happen to be ex-members of the National Army, are getting preference over married men and men who have dependents.  I think that is altogether wrong.  I rose particularly, because I thought what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said about carrying it on further and even tightening up the regulations is not in keeping with the spirit with which we understood the Government regarded these regulations.  We think, whether the Minister actually meant that or not, that it marks a new departure in the policy of the Executive Council with regard to these particular regulations.</P>
    <P>I quoted what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in 1925. The Minister for Local Government at that time indicated that as time went on the regulations, which were then being relaxed, would continue to be relaxed and modified.  He said that the main object was to prevent victimisation of these men.  Nobody stands for victimisation of these men.  It has not been urged by anybody that there has been victimisation.  I would like to <Col N="330" /> know whether we are to take it from what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that there is to be a new departure on the part of the Executive Council in regard to this and a new insistence that after 10 or 11 years this distinction must be made and must be continued.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce definitely meant that.  Certainly his words conveyed that.  They will convey it to the local authorities and to whoever are concerned with getting employment for these people.  I would like the President to clear it up when he is dealing with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I thought might be emphasised and that is the question which Deputy Aiken put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night. What legal authority is there for this system of preference?  This preference applies not only to relief schemes but to ordinary normal employment in the State.  What legal authority is there for the regulations which have been published by the various Ministers&mdash;by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in relation to employment and public bodies and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the unemployment exchanges? There is absolutely no legal basis for it.  It is contrary to the Constitution; it is anti-national and anti-social.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet a matter like this victimisation of the general body of the people of this country, is undefended in this House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce who was put up ostensibly to defend this policy did not say one word in its defence.  He did not adduce a single solid argument in support of it.  He merely contented himself with saying that it was the right thing to do.  We are to accept that pronouncement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that it was the right thing to do, as an ex-cathedra pronouncement, an infallible and unassailable pronouncement not requiring any defence.  There was one significant admission in the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce which I think should be taken note of by the members of the House. <Col N="331" /> He said that because he believed this thing was right, three times he had issued instructions to the managers of the Labour Exchanges that certain regulations were to be enforced.</P>
    <P>On three occasions subsequent enquiry disclosed that the regulations were not enforced, and, because of the fact that he believed that they had not been enforced with sufficient zeal, the Minister said that he had come to the conclusion that this system of preference ought to be continued for some time longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is assumed to be one of the ablest members of the Executive Council, and he is supposed to be the man of push and go&mdash;one of these strong personalities that can force themselves on the Civil Service.  It is rather an indication of the lax way in which the Executive Council controls the whole administration when you have the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitting in the House that, though on three separate occasions he had issued instructions to the staff of his Department that certain regulations were to be enforced, subsequent enquiry disclosed that those instructions had been ignored, and that the regulations were not being enforced with the zeal which he thinks they deserve.  One or two things must follow from that, either that the regulations are so contrary to justice and equity and ordinary commonsense, or have so outraged public opinion that the managers of the Labour Exchange have found it impossible to enforce them, or else the Minister for Industry and Commerce is incapable of controlling his Department.  I am inclined to believe that the first is the real explanation; that these regulations are so opposed to general principles of justice and equity, so contrary to what public opinion believes to be right, that the managers of the Labour Exchanges find it impossible to enforce them, because people will not submit to them.  That bears out what Deputy Fahy and other Deputies have stated here, that these regulations do not tend to make the lot of the ex-National <Col N="332" /> Army man easier in this country.  The people they are supposed to benefits are merely being made the objects of envy, and those regulations tend to make their lot among their neighbours a little less happier than it would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to bear in mind what Deputy Lemass said.  He pointed out that it is not merely the followers of the Fianna Fáil Party or the followers of the Labour Party who are being victimised in this matter; the general body of the followers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are being victimised as well.  I am perfectly certain that among the 500,000 votes which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party got at the last general election there must be a considerable number of unemployed citizens of the Irish Free State who did service in the National Army.  I am perfectly certain that in Longford-Westmeath a large number of ex-Servicemen voted for Deputy Shaw. Similarly in Leix and Offaly I am sure a large number of ex-Servicemen voted for Deputy Aird, and I am sure that in Waterford large numbers of them voted for Deputy Redmond. Everyone of these supporters of Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party are victimised equally with the supporters of Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass, and other Deputies here on the Fianna Fáil Benches and on the Labour Benches as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress the point that the policy of the Government appears to be to victimise the general body of the citizens in favour of one comparatively small section, one section which may have, in the eyes of the Executive Council, rendered some service to the State.  If they did render any service to the State they have been well remunerated for it.  They have had this preference for over nine years in relation to all public employment under the State.  It is time now, if ever we want to end the bitterness, the division and the dissension which the civil war created, to liquidate the existing position and to abolish this preference once and for all.  So far as employment under public bodies in the State is concerned, for eight or nine years this <Col N="333" /> system of preference has continued to operate.  If, within that time, positions have not been found for all ex-Servicemen who were capable of filling those positions; if within that period all available ex-Servicemen have not found positions either in a professional or a clerical capacity under public bodies, it is because they are not eligible to fill them; they are not qualified to fill them.  Whatever selection board has had to consider their claims, they have been placed very low on the list, and others who had not the qualification of service in the Army have been placed above them because they were better fitted for the posts.</P>
    <P>The point is, whether we are to continue to fill important positions under public authorities dealing with matters of public health, engineering works and things of that description, under this system of preference with the dregs of the profession, because that is what it comes to.  There is no professional man discharged from the Army during the past four or five years who has not had adequate opportunity to find employment if he were capable to fill the positions that were vacant.  If they have not been employed up to this, then the reason is that that they are unemployable.  Surely to goodness we are not going to continue giving inferior persons a preference over men better qualified to fill the jobs?  On that ground alone I say it is time that the system of preference ended.  If there are to be any claims for preferential treatment there are other citizens in the State when, at one time or other, according to their lights and according to the prevailing opinion of the majority of the people, served the State equally as well as the ex-National Army men.  After all, the history of Ireland did not begin with the year 1922.  The years 1914, 1916, 1918, and 1921 marked periods when men were asked to come forward by those who were the responsible leaders of public opinion in this country and they served the country in arms.  They were asked to make sacrifices on behalf of the country.</P>
    <P>I did not always agree in 1914 and 1916 with the policy then advocated, but if people did come forward with the support of the majority of the <Col N="334" /> people of the country they are equally entitled to preference with those who came forward in 1922.  We cannot give preference to every section of the community, and it is not fair to victimise others by simply selecting for preference the men of 1922.  It is because we cannot give preference to everybody without victimising the people who served the country equally as well that I say it is time the whole question of preference should be ended.  We should liquidate all that has happened in 1914, 1921 and 1922.  Let us all start as common citizens of the country with an equal chance in the struggle for existence. That is what we on these benches are asking in relation to opportunities of employment in the State.</P>

      <P>There are two questions I would like the President to give me some information about.  In giving preference to men with Army service, does he make any distinction between the men who joined prior to 1924 and the men who joined subsequent to 1924?  If he makes no distinction between those who joined up prior and subsequent to 1924, will he tell the House what claims to preferential treatment these men have who joined in 1924 and subsequently?  I would also like him to give us some information about the position of Irishmen, and there are numbers of them, who took part in the Great War.  Is any preferential treatment given to them and, if so, what?</P>

      <P>Last evening Deputy Corry bolstered up his case on this ex-National Army issue by referring to a case in Cobh.  He stated, in effect, that this particular family was victimised by the Government.  I want to contradict that.  I do not think it is quite fair to let a statement of that nature go unchallenged.  I know the facts of that case.  I know that the local authority in Cobh did not victimise that family nor did the Government. I cannot understand why members of the Opposition should put up such a scandalous case as that.  I do not think it is quite fair.  As a matter of fact I approached the Government on two or three occasions with regard to that family and on each occasion the Government met the case very generously. <Col N="335" /> I simply rise for the purpose of stating those facts, because I do not think it would be fair for me to sit here and allow the terrible statement made by Deputy Corry last evening to go unchallenged.</P>

      <P>Yesterday Deputy Davin asked a question in the Dáil and mentioned that he would raise the subject matter of it on the motion for the adjournment.  I learned subsequently that Deputy Davin was rather disappointed and very displeased with the answer I gave.  Two points arose in my mind with regard to the question. One was, was it a question of policy?  If it were, I would consider that a debate on the motion for the adjournment would not be the proper way to have it ventilated.  If it were in respect of a particular Ministry then I would require to know what Minister was concerned, so that I could have him in attendance.  Subsequently, I had an interview with Deputy Davin, and he came to the conclusion with me that, on reviewing the circumstances of the case, a matter of this sort would fall properly for consideration on the vote for the Department of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two questions arise in connection with this matter.  The first is: What is the Government policy?  The second is: What is the effect of the Government policy, because it is one matter to make regulations and another to see how those regulations are carried out, or what is the effect of their being carried out.  We have had the case of Carrick-on-Suir mentioned, in which there was a general statement of hardship in respect of married men with families.  No particulars were given and no details mentioned.  In consequence, other than the general statement, scarcely anything remains for me to reply to. In the case of Mountrath, from what Deputy Davin said, something like twelve men were employed.  Three men were employed by the contractor on his own.  In the subsequent recruitment from the Labour Exchange, according to the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="336" /> one single man was employed. According to Deputy Davin a considerable number of married men were on the list of unemployed.  That question is in dispute.  The only question that is in dispute there is a question of fact.  Deputy Davin has certain facts, while the Minister has his information from his officials.</P>

The Ministers concerned were not here, and I cannot deal with the cases, as I do not know what they are about.  Deputy Corry had a case which I think has, to some extent, been controverted by Deputy Hennessy.  That exhausts the list of cases alleged against us in respect of administration, not policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to Limerick.  The policy with regard to this matter was outlined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night. I need not go over what he said, because I never like to delay either the time of the House or the time of the people.  The order of preference in respect to State appointments and State control employment is: Preference to married ex-Army men or ex-Army men with dependents; secondly, married civilians and single ex-Army men in the proportion of fifty-fifty; thirdly, single civilians.  In practice the third class is never reached.  When I say that I want to refer to State appointments or State-controlled employment. Exceptions have been made in the cases of Waterford, Limerick and Carrick-on-Suir, and I hesitate to think that that knowledge is unknown to Deputies representing Waterford, Limerick and those in touch with the situation in Carrick-on-Suir.  Yesterday I mentioned, when Deputy Davin raised this question, that in practice, taking the largest distribution of public money for which the Government is responsible&mdash;that is in the case of the Road Grant&mdash;the statistics of men employed in the summary furnished to me on the 15th April show: Total numbers employed, 12,970; ex-National Army men, 1,079; percentage, 8.32. <Col N="338" /> In essence, that is the case alleged against us.  One can make all the regulations that one likes, but the result is what really matters.</P>

      <P>That is another question.  As a matter of fact, no case has been made in respect of any such person, and if there are cases of that sort surely they ought to be within the knowledge of those who are most anxious to make a case against us and they could be cited.  Let us understand where we are with regard to this matter.  We are told that we require a holiday&mdash;that it would be good for us.  Who tells us that?  Those who are too indolent to make a case.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Davin, whether he likes it or not, is the saviour of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Yesterday they had no policy on my Vote.  The Deputy provided them with it.  Yesterday they were in the position of being led by an expelled member of their Party.  He held the carrot before their noses to move to refer this Vote back.  They had no policy on my Vote until Deputy Davin got up yesterday.  The Party was bankrupt as to political policy and had not got a single case to mention. Deputy Davin had the only one, that of an individual single man who had got employment, as the Deputy claims, to the prejudice of married men.  The sleeping beauties of the Fianna Fáil Party had not a policy yesterday in connection with my Vote, although last year they could park their members <Col N="339" /> out in various parts of the city to rush them in at the last moment in the hope of upsetting my Vote.  They pretended to be much more concerned about pensions to ex-R.I.C. men and people of that sort, or about the Governor-General's Vote, but they concentrated on the Vote for my Department. Some Deputies mentioned in the course of the discussion that the Local Appointments Commission gave preference to ex-National Army professional men.  The statement is untrue&mdash;absolutely false.</P>
      <P>In respect of all appointments made under the Civil Service Commission, professional and otherwise, a preference is given in respect of ex-National Army service, but no such preference is given in respect of any appointments under the Local Appointments Commission. It is very easy to make charges.</P>

      <P>I am saying that under the Local Appointments Commission no preference is given in respect of Army service.  The allegation was made that that was so.  The allegation was made that one Deputy, who is a member of the Government Party, was so appointed.  That is untrue&mdash;absolutely untrue.  That is the policy and the result of the policy. In the discussion that took place Deputy Davin mentioned yesterday that £33,000,000 had been spent on the Army since 1922, and that that was enough, or something to that effect, in respect of these men.  The proportion of that that went to men who served from 1922 until 1924 was very small.  You could divide the number of men that were in the Army into the £33,000,000 and could say, according to the law of averages, that is each man's proportion of public money, just in the same way as you could say that the income out of this State in respect of Deputy Davin, Deputy de Valera and the Governor-General is an average of £3,540 per annum.  I suppose the Deputy would object to that.</P>

      <P>We were treated to a very pacific speech, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce called it, yesterday evening by Deputy Lemass.  He alleged that while I am always preaching that we should exclude politics from our consideration in connection with the economy and business of the country, I was always bringing in the events of the last few years.  Amongst other matters, he referred to me in very eulogistic terminology as the super-hypocrite of the Dáil.  I suppose he is aware that that word comes from the Greek word  and that means an actor.  I have no pretension to compete with anybody on the opposite benches in respect to that. I never had, and I hope I never shall. What is the meaning of a hypocrite? Apart from the Greek derivation, what it means really is putting a pious cloak around impiety.  What is the Government policy in this matter? <Col N="341" /> Has it been stated?  It has, and stated clearly.  That is the objection.  If we did not state it, and pretended it was not our policy, and at the same time acted according to the policy, I think the charge might have some justification. But when it is stated, and that we are acting on it, and acting on it to the best of our ability, and that the result is as I have shown, I should like to know how the charge of hypocrisy arises.  I should like to understand a little more about what is in the Deputy's mind in respect to that.  If some four years ago, after having been what I would call a sea-green republican for a great number of years, I then became a statutory republican, it might then be alleged against me.  But that is not my history.  As we are considering this question, and the endeavour to disturb public feeling and so on, I should like to refer to what happened within the last two or three days.  On Tuesday night I made a speech in favour of attracting visitors to tourist resorts in this country.  On the following day we were informed by the party opposite that the weather is too bad here for anybody to stay in this country for any length of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can roam over a number of subjects, but I am to be prevented from roaming over any.  We are in the garden of the forbidden fruit for the last eight or nine years.  Deputies opposite only wandered into it a few years ago with their mouths open, and the grapes fell into them, and they said we could not keep our mouths shut, and that is how we got them.  It is all an accident that we have eaten of the forbidden fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Aiken said we had 2,500 unemployed ex-Army men out of something like 26,000 others registered. That, he said, is the result of fighting for the State or doing anything for this Government.  We had 50,000 men in the National Army at one time, and I am quite sure that 2,500 does not exhaust the numbers unemployed.  But I say that in comparison with either Germany, America or England, the <Col N="342" /> percentage of unemployed National Army men here is far smaller than the unemployed ex-Army men in those countries, which are much richer than we are, and have politicians much more hardheaded than we have, and have a long tradition of Government behind them.  And the result after seven, eight or nine years, is that we have 2,500 ex-National Army men registered out of 26,000.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  I am standing for the policy.  But the questions that ought to be raised upon this Vote are&mdash;I give them for what they are worth&mdash;first the general economy of the country, order in the country, education&mdash;some big questions.  Certainly not a question in respect of which 1,079 men, taking the matter at <Col N="343" /> its maximum, would be concerned. There would be no necessity for a discussion on this matter if we applied ourselves with the same degree of industry, assuming that it was bona-fide industry, to our economic situation and to provide the maximum amount of employment in the country.  And in that connection, while being charged by the Opposition with always throwing in the apple of discord, I would like to say that I saw a short time ago that probably the most venerable member of the Party opposite spoke in Kildare. He read an extract from some publication here to the effect that one of the awful troubles of this country was, that the Ministry, to a man, according to a man whom he described as the Right Reverend or Most Reverend, or otherwise dignified ecclesiastic, were clad from the skin out in foreign manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but that is the first.  We will deal with first things first.  Is the Deputy prepared to take up my challenge?  No, not at all.  Yesterday we were told by Deputy Aiken that there was going to be a new political Utopia in this country when Fianna Fáil came into <Col N="344" /> power.  We were going to have fair play for every body.  No question of distinction or preference.  Every citizen would have his rights.  If my recollection is right an appeal recently asking subscriptions for a paper started by Deputies opposite stated that one person was to be in absolute control.  There is no question of democracy there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is substantially the same as that for last year.  The increase of £650 in the principal section of Sub-head A1 <Col N="347" /> is mainly due to the normal increase caused by annual increments of salary. During the absence of the Secretary of the Department, as Chairman of the Tariff Commission, an allowance of £100 is payable to the first Assistant Secretary, and of £50 to the second Assistant Secretary.  Provision has also been made for the payment of £150 to a part-time official of the Department of Local Government and Public Health to act as pharmacist.  This post has been found necessary for the proper control of the importation and sale of dangerous drugs.  These increases are, however, offset by a saving of £330 in the Accounts Section of the Department. The increase of approximately £150, in Sub-head A2, is caused by the necessary increase of the salaries of the Film Censor and staff, in consequence of the additional duties and responsibilities caused by the introduction of &ldquo;sound&rdquo; films.  A saving has, however, been effected in two posts by the resignation of two officers and the filling of the vacancies by officers at lower salaries.  There is a considerable saving shown on Sub-head A3, by reason of the fact that it has not been considered necessary to provide for additional staff in this section.</P>
      <P>As has been explained on previous occasions, Ministerial control of the various services of the Department including police, prisons, court officers, etc., is exercised through this staff.  The District Court Branch, which is shown separately, controls the work of the District Court Clerks throughout the country and checks the receipt of all fines paid in District Courts, Circuit Courts and High Court.  The accounts branch, also shown separately in the Estimate, is responsible for the payment of the salaries and expenses of the Gárda Síochána, the prisons, the District and Circuit Court staffs, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, and the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice.  All the accounts work connected with the activities of the Department is performed by this Branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only staff provided for outside <Col N="348" /> Dublin is in the Immigration Office at Cobh.  A full-time officer is required there to carry out the provisions of the Aliens' Restriction Act and he is assisted by a part-time assistant who is paid an inclusive allowance of £100 per annum in addition to his salary as District Court Clerk.  The Immigration Officer also superintends the arrival of boats at Galway.  In addition to the provision of £1,572 in Sub-head A2 for the Film Censor's Office the expenditure in connection with this service is estimated to amount to £545 as shown in note (J) on Page 107 of the Estimates.  The fees received in stamps (i.e., the fees charged for film censorship) are, however, estimated to amount to £2,750 so that, allowing for overhead charges such as the time of the staffs in various Departments who are occupied in connection with film censorship, and for provision for insurance of films and machinery, consequential damages, etc., this service is, in fact, self-supporting.  The items of expenditure provided for in Sub-heads B, C and D are self-explanatory and do not call for any comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Vote be referred back for re-consideration. We cannot congratulate the Minister on effecting any sort of reasonable or expected economies in his Department during the past twelve months nor can we congratulate him on producing an Estimate that indicates any substantial decrease in the coming year.  If the Minister had any desire to effect economies we believe he could do so.  We stressed that point last year when the Estimates were before the House, but notwithstanding that no attempt has been made by the Minister to effect any real savings or any real economies. If the Minister had taken the trouble of getting a committee to go in and examine carefully into the working of the Department, he would find that considerable economies could be effected and that a considerable saving could be obtained.  However, it seems like beating the wind to expect that the Minister would do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, in particular, on this Estimate to refer to the policy of the <Col N="349" /> Minister's Department.  When discussing this Estimate last year attention was called to the many glaring examples where members of the C.I.D. had acted illegally and, I might say brutally in dealing with citizens of the State.  When we complained of that and pointed out to the Minister that many of those persons who were responsible for those crimes had been decreed and judgments obtained against them, the answer the Minister gave the House was one of encouragement to them, one of encouragement that they should act illegally.  He went so far as to say that the taxpayers of the country would have to pay the decrees and expenses of the illegalities for which these people were responsible. Since then many more cases have arisen, where prisoners were brutally assaulted, where other people were seized without proper authority, and where it was proved in the judgments that those people acted illegally.</P>
    <P>You will have the Minister, I presume, at the conclusion of the debate on this Estimate, stating that these illegalities must be encouraged, and that the taxpayer must again pay for whatever those people have done.  In cases that have arisen within the last twelve months, the defence invariably, and I think without exception, put up by these members of the C.I.D. was that they were acting under orders. But when we were discussing the Estimate last year we tried to get some particulars from the Minister as to who issued these orders, whether he accepted responsibility for the issuing of these orders, whether he was, in view of what had happened and in view of the judgments of the courts, going to take any steps to notify members of the C.I.D. that they were not to adopt similar methods in future. It is quite evident to the House and to every citizen that no such orders have been issued, and that these people, feeling that they have been encouraged by the statement of the Minister on the Estimate last year, have felt that they are on a loose rein, that they are entitled to do what they like, that illegalities would be encouraged, that they are entitled to arrest citizens, throw them into prison, <Col N="350" /> assault them, and so long as they have not to pay the expenses or the cost, so long as the Minister is sheltering and encouraging them, they feel it is their duty to carry on in that way. I would like to know from the Minister is it his policy or the policy of his Department that they should act in this way.  The Minister is well aware that they are acting and have acted during the past twelve months in that way. Is it the policy of the Minister that they should continue to act in that way?  Will the Minister on this Estimate state that all those decrees that have been obtained and expenses incurred during the past twelve months must be borne by the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>If not saying it in so many words, at any rate the meaning of it was that the taxpayer had got no value for the money.  I wonder is that his policy still?  Is it the policy behind which any responsible Minister or Government would stand?  Would any Government stand behind it except the Government that holds itself responsible to a certain section of the community, that has its followers to encourage them to give a loose rein to the C.I.D. in order that they can terrorise and carry on all those other things through the country so that eventually there will be a junta in office?  It does not end at that.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal in this Dáil about the independence of the judiciary and about the independence of the courts.  We have heard it from the platforms throughout the country, from election hustings, and so on, that the judiciary stood between the people and the Executive, and that the judiciary was independent of the Government.  We recognise, and everybody must recognise, that the only protection for the people of the country is the independence of its judiciary, and I think it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find in the records of any other government where a judiciary has been interfered with. But in the last few weeks it was disclosed in a court here in Dublin that a circular was issued, from the Minister or his Department, marked confidential, to the justice presiding in that court, complaining that the fines and the penalties he was inflicting <Col N="351" /> were not sufficient.  It was also disclosed on that occasion that it had been the practice to issue similar confidential communications to justices as to what they were to do in cases. The case I refer to was one in which a prosecution was brought under an Act passed here on the motion of the Department of Agriculture.  Why were those communications marked confidential?  Why all this tripe talk about the independence of the judiciary?  While these people are mouthing about the independence of the judiciary we have been issuing secret documents to their judges, telling them what they should do. Who can have confidence in the judiciary when there are those secret communications passing between the Department of Justice and the Justices?  I hope at least that when the Government goes out to speak on platforms it will not mouth phrases about the independence of the judiciary.  It is a good thing that this was disclosed, because there is no way of getting at information of that sort. There is no way of finding out a thing like that.  We may have suspicions here and there, but if we hinted at anything like that in this House, if we had not evidence for it, the Minister would get up indignantly and say: &ldquo;How dare you say anything like that, where is your evidence?&rdquo; and deny point blank that such a thing happened. How dare anybody think that a Government which calls itself a responsible Government would do such a thing?  The independence of the judiciary!</P>
    <P>We know that thing has been going on definitely for twelve months according to the statement made at that time &mdash;confidential documents telling the justices and the judges what to do. &ldquo;We are not satisfied with the fines you are imposing.&rdquo;  If it is some unfortunate person who is brought up for some trivial offence where the Government have some spleen against him who knows what private documents are going out telling the judge that he must do so-and-so.  Where is this barrier between the Executive and the Court if a thing like that can go on?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> When the Courts of Justice Bill comes before the House one provision, I hope, will be that the District Justices will be on an independent footing the same as the Circuit and High Court judges and that you will not have this underhand thing done by the Minister and his Department telling the Court what to do, to fine somebody so much, put another fellow into jail for 3 months and so on. Did anybody ever hear of a responsible Government doing anything like that?  Did anybody ever hear of a dictatorship doing anything like that? They set up some sort of drumhead courtmartial but they do not tell it you are bound to sentence so and so to death or to do so and so to somebody else.  Did the Minister ever read of a Government doing what his Department has been doing for the past twelve months with their confidential documents to the judges?  That is, I suppose, law and order.  That is what we should expect from people mouthing about law and order.  That is the way to get respect for law.  Can there be any respect for law or can there be reasonable and ordered conditions so long as that practice continues? As the Minister knows from his experience if a client consults a solicitor and afterwards interviews a counsel one of the last questions that will be asked is: What do you think of the chances?  Who can tell what are the chances?  Who can tell what way the law is going to be administered if you have a judge with a secret document from the Department of Justice telling him not to do what the statute law lays down but to do what the Minister or his Department thinks should be done in a particular case? It has reached the position that certainly no self-respecting citizen can have any respect for law that is administered in that way and I think until that method is ended and until we have heard the last of this unfounded, blatant, tripish talk about law and order we will have no order or no responsible government.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Courts of Justice Bill is brought in that some protection or some clauses will be inserted that will be some protection to the people of the country against that kind of <Col N="353" /> underhand secret communications to judges and secret interference with judges and justices on the bench. That is a matter which should have been dealt with long ago.  The courts of Justice Committee went to considerable trouble and sat a long time and the Minister was in great trouble during the time it was sitting in getting his Rules of the Circuit Court through. Those Rules have been held up waiting for a Bill.  We moved that they should be held up until the report of the Committee on the Courts of Justice Bill was brought in.  The Minister very reluctantly consented to that. He felt there was an urgency in having the Rules introduced.  It is a considerable time since the Committee has reported.  That report is with the Minister's Department and so far we are waiting for the Bill that was so often promised.  I am afraid it will be like the Town Tenants Bill.</P>

They have the report and the recommendations of the Committee, and the Minister should have had ample opportunity of examining them and introducing a Bill.  He knows that there is almost chaos as a result of the large number of appeal cases that are held up, some of them for eighteen months or two years, waiting for the Bill.  They cannot be dealt with in the meantime.  As it is proposed by the Committee's report to make drastic changes, it is a matter of extreme urgency that the Bill should be put before the House.</P>

      <P>A number of other matters are to be added to the Circuit Court jurisdiction.  A question was asked recently by Deputy Corry about a Peace Commissioner down the country who committed an assault and was fined £5.  At the time the Minister stated that he did not think it would be in the public interest to have this man removed from the Commission of the Peace.  He was asked if he was aware that the District Justice had referred to the case as perjury.  The Minister said that he was not aware of any such thing.  When asked if he would inquire, he said no.  That statement was made in the House, and I think, at least, the Minister should have made inquiries into it.  Does the Minister think that is going to strengthen respect for the law as administered and as it should be administered by any decent Government, and not as it is administered by this Government?  Does he think, even to keep up a semblance, or a show, or a pretence, that the law is being impartially administered, that it will help the pretence to keep an individual like that in the position of Peace Commissioner, and not only that, but to refuse to make any inquiry as to the offence he has committed? This is one of the things that one would think the Minister, at any rate, would do for the purpose of this show business, to inquire into it, and that he would take some action with regard to it.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate last year we pointed out that this Department is the centre of several Departments, that it covered Votes 31 to 37, and included something over two millions, or one-tenth of the total Estimate. Therefore, we would expect from the Minister, when he was introducing the Vote, a fairly detailed account of the work of this Department, which is the <Col N="355" /> connecting link between various Votes, so that the House would be given some opportunity of forming judgment as to whether the work is well divided and whether there is not an undue amount of expenditure.  We are left with a few detailed statements about a few sub-heads, and we have no indication as to how the work is distributed, or whether the Department is being run on extravagant lines or not.  From the silence of the Minister we must assume that there is a great deal to be covered up.  The conclusion that we arrive at admittedly must be correct, that there is a considerable amount of extravagance in the Department.  Deputy Ruttledge has referred to the policy of the Minister in reference to the detective officers.  We can take two cases and compare the attitude on them.  One was a case about which I asked a question in the House, where damages were given against certain detective officers who were dismissed.  There was another case, a very glaring one, in the city of Dublin.  It occurred on the 20th February, 1930, and the action was tried on the 3rd and 4th of March of this year.  In that case several persons took actions against certain detective officers.  The first of them was Gerald Dempsey, who was arrested without any charge and who resisted arrest.  He was dragged out and was asked his name, although they knew it very well.  He was threatened and was told that there was a nearer place than the Red Cow or Clondalkin.  He was stripped to the shirt in gaol, and was left without blankets or bedding of any kind.  He was allowed out next morning at 10 o'clock, and was asked if he would go back to Cleevers Hall, where he was arrested.  He said that he would.  He was then told that he could make his will before going back there.  Another of the plaintiffs was Mr. Joseph Vaughan.  He smashed the glass, as most of these men did, in the cells as a protest against being arrested without any charge being made, as it had been held by the Judge in an earlier case that they were entitled to make such a protest. The detective officers tore off his <Col N="356" /> clothes, took away all the bedding, and left him in that condition for a considerable time.  He was released the next morning at 11 o'clock.  When asked his name he replied: &ldquo;You know my name.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;Oh, we all know it, Joe,&rdquo; showing that the conduct of the police was sheer farce.  The next was Mr. R. O'Brien.  He was dragged out of the hall and one of the detective officers used obscene language.  Detective Coughlan caught him by the hair.  This is his sworn evidence in the court, on which he got damages.  Mr. Holden corroborated, and said that Detective-Officer Corry struck the witness in the neck, and when he was in gaol he was given blankets which were actually verminous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Hamilton, another of the plaintiffs, was taken in a lorry and the tail-board of the lorry broke and he fell out.  No attention was paid to the fact that he was hurt by it, and he was kept in jail until 11 o'clock next morning. Mr. Thackaberry was actually stripped, and he was asked by one of the detective officers whether he wanted to be made another Robert Emmet.  All these people obtained damages from a jury in Dublin.  It came out in the evidence that Detective-Officer Corry and two other officers had in the previous March a case of a similar nature against them, in which damages were given for £75.  When the judge asked one of the detective officers in the witness box why they arrested these men, he said he had instructions.  Whose instructions?  Who was the person who gave these instructions?  Was it the Minister for Justice?  Was it the Commissioner of the Gárda or the Head of the Detective Department? If so, is the Head of the Detective Department under the control of the Commissioner of the Gárda at all?  I understand he is not.  I understand he is acting in some independent capacity and I want the Minister to clear up the matter.  The judge in charging the jury said there had been no evidence of any felony being committed and so the jury awarded damages.  Yet we have not heard of any of these detective officers being dismissed from the force.  Is it because <Col N="357" /> certain detective officers were operating in Waterford that they are to be made victims and dismissed from the force, and the detective officers in the City of Dublin who do very much more outrageous things are not dismissed from the force?  Here we have men committing repeated acts, one of whom had damages given against him a year or so previously and yet he was not dismissed the force. The partiality of the Department of Justice is such as to render it impossible for anybody to have confidence in that Department or in the administration of justice in this country. Does the Minister think that by allowing that sort of thing to go on that he can get the conditions which we all desire in this country?</P>
    <P>There are other matters on this Estimate to which I would like to refer.  One is the administration of the Censorship Act.  It is not working out as satisfactorily in a sense as we had hoped.  There are certain papers, and in particular the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; which seems to be determined to defy the operations of that Act. It goes out of its way to publish lists of books which are censored.  It helps in an abuse to which I think the Minister's attention should be drawn, namely to sell in the Saorstát those books from Belfast and other places. I have heard several complaints saying that this makes the operations of the Censorship Act nugatory.  I hope that the Minister will use all the powers he has to prevent an abuse of that kind.  We in this country want to have the highest quality of life and we cannot ignore the fact that at present there is in other countries a flood of a kind of neo-paganism of which any decent pagan would be ashamed.  There is a kind of literature poured out in other countries and in order to protect this country and keep it in a normal condition the Censorship Act was passed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will exercise all the powers he can in order to make the Act effective.  I know that the Minister will answer that we on the passage of the Bill prevented the use of certain societies in Dublin for the reading of books.  But then that was <Col N="358" /> to have been done on a voluntary basis and we argued at the time that in the end the Government would have to pay those people and it was not a proper way to go about it to allow at first any particular society to do that. That work should be the work of a Government Department.  Surely the Minister has at his disposal policemen and officers of that kind?  He has the detective force, and if that force were used to get hold of books of this kind it would be far better than using it on the work in which it is at present engaged.  The Minister is laughing. I suppose he is laughing at the idea that the present detective officers would be sufficiently competent to deal with such work.  But there is no reason why he should not get persons who would do it.  I know of individuals who have gone out of their way in the public interest to look for books of this kind and they told me that they have found books that should not be allowed into the State at all.</P>

      <P>It is only quite recently I heard of it.  Some efforts at least should be made to try to make the operation of the Act more effective. Another Department of the Censorship is the Censorship of Films Board. There is a campaign in the interests of certain trades against the Censor of Films, and this campaign sometimes amounts to persecution.  In that case every assistance should be given to the Censor of Films.  It is a shame that an officer like that, who seems to be giving general satisfaction, should be attacked in the way in which he is attacked.  I do not think that that Department is sufficiently manned. I think the officer is overworked, and that a little more expenditure should be sanctioned in the Department by giving the Censor of Films an assistant. That might considerably relieve him of some of the work, because I do believe he is an overworked officer. That may also give more satisfaction <Col N="359" /> to the trade, because sometimes there is an accumulation of films, and I suppose that is inevitable.  No one can question the rapidity with which the Censor works, and the way in which he carries out his duties.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be well for him to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>In reference to the amendment to the Court of Justice Act, I hope the Minister will speed up that as much as possible.  After all the Minister worked us very hard on that Committee, and it is hardly fair now to allow the matter to wait so long when the Committee work has been finished. There are already some glaring instances in the Court, as pointed out by Deputy Ruttledge.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Rules of Court should be brought into force apart from the amending of the Courts of Justice Act.  I do not see how that can be done, particularly when the system of appeal is to be changed.</P>

      <P>Of course I did, and rightly so, and the profession thanked me for it.  Of course the Minister is not a solicitor, and that is the trouble in the matter.  There is a whole lot of detail.  One likes to know where one is with the rules of court.  I would like to have them ship-shape, and fit in with what is in the new law. There is one matter to which I hope the Minister will pay special attention, and that is with regard to sheriff's fees.  I hope he will carry out an examination as to the exorbitant amount of sheriff's fees.  He could do it either in administration or he could do it through the Act afterwards.  It <Col N="360" /> was outside the purview, and it was held to be outside the terms of reference of the Courts of Justice Act Committee; rightly or wrongly it does not matter now.  But the instances that came before us were very glaring, particularly in the matter of the defaulting annuitants.  It was these fees which inflated the costs so much more than any other costs in these cases.  When speaking of costs I am referring to the sheriff's fees. There is one other matter to which I want to refer, and that is the Criminal Law Amendment Committee of Inquiry.  I move to report progress</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that a judicial sub-tenancy must be declared a tenancy to which the Act of 1923 applies, provided that it is substantially agricultural or pastoral in character or partly agricultural and partly pastoral.  I think Deputies will agree that it is only right that every sub-tenant who had a <Col N="361" /> judicial rent fixed should be brought within the terms of the Act of 1923.

These judicial tenants are tenants who are themselves subtenants. Apparently they were excluded up to the present even though they had judicial rents fixed on their holdings.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a drafting amendment. It provides that an appeal on questions of fact, as well as on questions of law, shall lie to the Supreme Court from any Order made by the Judicial Commissioner under the section relating to the amendment of vesting orders.  Such an appeal does undoubtedly exist at the moment on questions of law, and in the opinion of the legal experts in the Land Commission such an appeal does already lie on questions of fact, but in order to make it perfectly certain that an appeal shall lie both on questions of fact and of law, I think it advisable to accept this amendment.  It is very difficult to separate questions of fact from questions of law.  They are so <Col N="362" /> intermixed that it would be quite impossible to separate them.  For that reason this section in the Bill stands in a somewhat different category from the other sections.</P>

      <P>My attention was drawn by a member of the Dáil to Section 32, which makes the date of the conversion of real estate into personal estate different from the appointed day.  The point was made that making the appointed day a date prior to the date on which the list of vested holdings is published might inflict a certain hardship on vendors.  It is quite possible that the vendor might die in the interval between the appointed day and the date of the publication of that list. As a consequence, of course, serious trouble would arise for his heirs or successors to prove that they were entitled to the property which he left behind him.  It is purely a legal point, and it is at the request of the members of the legal profession that this amendment has been introduced.</P>

      <P>Section 40, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; in line 42 the words &ldquo;or objection made&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as Deputies will understand, is for the benefit of persons who have been peacefully exercising grazing rights.  As the law exists, these rights are confirmed, if they are enjoyed for a period of twenty years. Until this Bill is passed that law will remain.  Such rights must have been openly, peacefully and continuously enjoyed, according to the existing law. Under this section such rights are confirmed after eight years user on the date of the passing of the 1923 Act.  Hitherto, according to the existing law, these rights would not be confirmed until the user had proved he had been undisturbed in peaceful possession for twenty years.  During this period the owner of the land may not have been able for several reasons to interrupt the user as he would be undoubtedly entitled to do.  The word &ldquo;interruption,&rdquo; in the sense in which <Col N="364" /> it is used in this section, means stopping a person from using a right. There are cases in which the owner may not have been able to stop parties exercising a grazing or a turbary right.  He may have been away and, for one reason or another, he may not be able to stop the exercise of particular rights.  He may, perhaps, have attempted to take legal proceedings. Except for this particular section he would have twelve years more in which to take legal proceedings; that period represents the difference between the eight years and the twenty years.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that if formal objection were made the rights should not be claimed.  When it was originally introduced the section was not intended to benefit, and certainly should not benefit, persons who seized grazing or turbary rights by force and kept out those who really had rights there.  That has happened in many parts of the country.  In my experience of Land Commission administration during the last three years I have come across many cases where one tenant has seized a grazing or a turbary easement which undoubtedly was the right of an adjoining tenant, and which it was the intention of the landlord that the adjoining tenant should enjoy.  It is not only the landlord who would suffer damage by such unlawful trespass.  In regard to mountain grazing and bogs, there are several tenants who have bona fide rights of grazing and turbary, and these rights will possibly be infringed by this section.  They should be protected as far as possible from the claims of unlawful and, perhaps, violent trespassers.</P>
    <P>This amendment will undoubtedly help tenants just as much as it will help the owners.  There are many cases throughout the country where certain tenants are exercising rights of grazing and turbary to which they really are not entitled, and the landlord never intended these particular tenants should have these grazing or turbary easements.  It will, for that reason, give the Land Commission an opportunity of setting right these cases.  I may say that these <Col N="365" /> difficulties are numerous in many parts of the country.  The words &ldquo;objection made&rdquo; are introduced for this end only.  They do not mean a person objecting merely because of dislike; he must make a formal objection; he must take some definite open step to stop the user before he will be held to have made an objection.  It will be for the courts to determine whether any such steps have or have not been taken.  The amendment is a reasonable one, and, in a sense, it is more in the interests of the tenants than of the owners, and I ask the Dáil to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment we would like to examine somewhat more closely.  It owes its origin to an amendment introduced by Deputy Geoghegan, the effect of which would have been to confirm tenants in the possession of grazing or turbary rights which they enjoyed since a date prior to the passing of the 1923 Land Act. The Parliamentary Secretary met us very fairly in that matter, and he introduced a special section containing four sub-sections in order to deal with it.  In that section it is laid down:</P>
      <P>Where the tenant of a holding to which the Land Act, 1923, applies openly enjoys any grazing or turbary on the lands of his landlord and has so enjoyed such grazing or turbary without lawful interruption since a date prior to the passing of the said Act, the Land Commission may, on the application of such tenant and if it thinks proper so to do having regard to all the circumstances of the case, declare the enjoyment of such grazing or turbary (as the case may be) to be a right appurtenant to such holding subject to such (if any) conditions and limitations as the Land Commission shall think fit to impose and shall specify in such declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment, it seems to us, is to limit the rights of the tenants because if the tenants had enjoyed grazing or turbary rights under the Bill as it stood without lawful interruption since before the 1923 Land Act, then they would be entitled to have such rights regarded as an appurtenant to their holdings.  Now, <Col N="366" /> however, if any other person comes along who claims he has rights in this matter and who says he has made objection, without even specifying what the nature of the objection is, the whole right of enjoyment which we were trying to safeguard for these tenants is going to be jeopardised.  I think the amendment is very loose indeed. The words are &ldquo;or objection made.&rdquo;  What is the nature of the objection to be?  Is it a legal objection or is there to be a legal process in connection with it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I already explained the meaning of the objection. The owner must make a formal objection; he must take some certain open step to attempt to stop the user before he would be held to have made any objection.  The nature of the objection is a matter that will have to be determined subsequently by the Land Commission, and it will be for the Land Commission to say whether the objection is or is not within the meaning of this section.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This is really more in the interest of the tenant than the owner.  There are many cases where tenants are enjoying easements of this character which really belong to other tenants and which it was the intention of the landlords that the other tenants should enjoy.  As a matter of fact, the Land Commission have frequently to settle disputes of that character between tenants enjoying turbary rights and certain grazing rights.  These are very common kinds of disputes.  My own opinion and the opinion of my legal advisers is that this amendment does not take away from the effectiveness of the section. In fact it clarifies, to some extent, the <Col N="367" /> meaning of the words &ldquo;lawful interruption.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will have an explanation from the Minister for Justice&mdash;I fail to see how such an explanation can be satisfactory&mdash;regarding the secret instructions that were sent out some time ago and that were specifically referred to by my colleague, Deputy Ruttledge.  In my opinion, the issue of such instructions strikes at the very root of the independence of the judiciary and tends to undermine public confidence in the administration of the law. Time after time we have been told in this House that the judiciary is independent of the Executive, that it is absolutely fair and that there is no question whatever of any interference with it.  It is difficult, therefore, to see how the circular referred to is consistent with those expressions that we have heard so often, not only in this House, but on public platforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should take <Col N="368" /> some steps to prevent the publication of the list of prohibited books under the Censorship Act.  I am afraid that such publication encourages a certain type of person to try to get those books, some way or other, into the country.  My own view is that it would be better if the list were not published at all.  I fail to see the necessity for publishing it.  Regarding the publication of that list and certain references that have been made to films, we have been told, of course, that there is a class that stands for intellectual liberty, political liberty, freedom of the subject, and all the rest.  I hold that liberty should not be allowed to degenerate into licence, and that is the whole trouble.  There seems to be an insidious campaign in operation, from certain references that I have seen even in the Dublin papers, against the film censorship and the Censorship Act.  If the Minister wants to strengthen his hand in that respect and thinks that the existing law is not strong enough to prevent abuse&mdash;not to further curtail liberty but to prevent abuse&mdash;and in order that the Acts passed by this Dáil are enforced, I am certain that he will get from all sides of the House the support that he requires for such measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Estimate was interrupted I was referring to the work of the Criminal Law Amendment Committee of Inquiry. I made representations to that Committee.  I understood that its terms of reference would be wide enough to deal with all the matters it might be expected to deal with.  There is one matter that I think the Minister should pay special attention to, that is, having an inquiry carried out in reference to certain cases which have been occurring recently with rather too great frequency, so that the law may be tightened up in that matter.  I heard of one particular kind of case in which the police found that they had not sufficient power to deal with it.  Then there is the case of people&mdash; quite a number of them&mdash;who are constantly committing the same offence. Owing to the nature of the offence apparently the habit they have contracted is too strong for them, and <Col N="369" /> they are not able to get out of that way of life.  When one looks at the prison reports and sees there the large number of people who have been convicted of certain crimes, perhaps as often as twenty times, I think that this Committee should advert to that problem with a view to seeing how such people could be dealt with.  In a sense, perhaps, they are not now altogether culpable, and possible if some system of detention were in operation there might be a hope of improving their condition.  Help might be given in that way to assist them to get rid of their bad habits.  I think that is a matter that is deserving of consideration.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the question of censorship, I think it should be emphasised that the Censorship Acts are actually a protection to persons who are concerned with the publication of films, newspapers and books.  Let me take an example.  During the recent war I had the experience myself&mdash;this is an extreme case perhaps, because at the time it was a censorship which could be very strongly objected to, as it was purely a political censorship&mdash;that the Censorship Act at that time was in a sense a protection, because you knew exactly the lines you could go on.  The first Act of the new regime, introduced about the time of the Black and Tans, and in operation during the last six or eight months of the war was to abolish the censorship altogether.  Where censorship is justifiable, people, instead of complaining of it should welcome it, because it actually gives a line, an indication to the general public as to what is not allowable. If there are specific cases of grievance it is easy to raise them in the House.  That has really nothing whatever to do with intellectual or political freedom.  In conclusion, I would like to ask the Minister whether he proposes to deal in the same way with those detective officers who have been found guilty in the Dublin cases as he has dealt with those in the County Waterford.</P>

      <P>I must protest against this Estimate being made the occasion of a perennial attack on the Civic Guards, and especially on the <Col N="370" /> Detective Branch of that body.  Their actions have been described in the most lurid and exaggerated language. They have been held up to public odium by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am inclined to think that such a course is certainly responsible for a lot of the tragedies that we have in this country. We hear a great deal about impartial administration.  There is one thing in this country that is very evident, and it is that no jury is afraid to bring in a verdict against a Civic Guard or a member of the C.I.D. division of that body.  The same cannot be said when other parties come up for trial.  It is enough for some of these people to say, &ldquo;We do not recognise your court,&rdquo; and no jury will be got to bring in a verdict against them.  I am not surprised that juries are afraid to bring in verdicts.  We have too many instances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have too many instances in which jurymen and witnesses after they had discharged their duties in accordance with the oaths they had taken, were, some of them, murdered, while in the case of others an attempt was made to murder them.  Again it is an extraordinary thing that we had instances where the assailed proved readier than the assailant with a lethal weapon&mdash;of members of the Opposition giving their sympathy to these people, attending their funerals and sometimes going to the extent of attending the funeral of the wrong man as happened in a recent case.  Now I do not think that is helpful to the administration of justice in this country.  We hear a lot about the beatings and everything else but these beatings and these thrashings are rarely supported by medical evidence.  I do not want to detain the House but I desire to protest against this perennial attack on the Guards <Col N="371" /> and on the men in the Detective Division. The country owes these men a great deal and if it were not for the armed section of the Civic Guard I doubt if we would be allowed to live in this country at all to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest against the attitude of Deputy Dr. Hennessy in endeavouring to whitewash certain sections of these men.  Some of them carry out their duties fairly enough but we know that in the Co. Waterford there have been cases where these men acted with absolute brutality.  I have here signed statements made by men who have been mishandled by them. Some of those who carried out this mishandling the Minister for Justice has since seen fit to discharge from the service.  When we made complaints here before, we were told that we were attacking them unfairly.  It should be proof of the truth of our statements when they afterwards had to be discharged from the service.  We have no objection to men who carry out their duties fairly decently.  It would certainly give people far greater confidence in the administration of justice if these men had been checked far earlier than they were.  There is one particular portion of Co. Waterford in which the administration of justice has been brought, I am afraid, into very great disrepute and the people there have very grave reason to fear that justice in their case has not been administered very impartially.  We wish to make it clear that we are not attacking the force as a whole.  It has been charged against us before that we are trying to draw a distinction between the uniformed and the non-uniformed members.  We certainly draw a distinction between the decent men in the force and the blackguard section, and the sooner the Minister for Justice weeds out this particular section the better it will be for the administration of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ruttledge started off by saying that no economies had been effected in the administration of the Department and that a committee should be set up.  Rather unfortunately, Deputy <Col N="372" /> Little did not seem to have been listening to him, because he said some opportunity should be given to the House of seeing whether there was too much expenditure of public money in the Department.  At the present minute they cannot form any such opinion.  Deputy Ruttledge then is convicted by Deputy Little of merely talking sheer nonsense.  The Economy Committee has examined into my Department as it has examined into every other Department in this State.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ruttledge and Fahy made great play with what they called secret instructions which were sent out to District Justice by my Department. No secret instruction as to how a District Justice is to decide any case has ever been sent out by my Department. Deputy Ruttledge talked a great deal about the independence of the judiciary and said that Dublin justices were being told what to do. That statement is absolutely unfounded. The Deputy tried to base it upon a statement which was made in the District Court by a District Justice with reference to a circular sent out to District Justices by my Department. That circular was marked confidential.  It was a document which it was our intention should reach the District Justice himself unopened by any other person.  I am not ashamed of that document&mdash;I stand over it absolutely.  What was it?  It was a circular sent out by my Department as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice thinks it proper to circulate for the information of the Justices of the District Courts the attached copy of a minute received from the Department of Agriculture on the subject of the penalties imposed for breaches of Section 1 of the Live Stock Breeding Act, 1925.  The Minister for Agriculture has been informed that unless and until the law is changed the entire discretion and responsibility as to the proper penalty to be imposed in these cases must rest with the Justices dealing with the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is said to be secret instruction <Col N="373" /> sent to District Justices telling them how they are to decide a case and what fines they are to inflict.  We are told in the beautiful rhetoric of Deputy Ruttledge that we are making blatant, unfounded, tripy speeches about the independence of the judiciary. Using that elegant phraseology of the Deputy, I say that he made a blatant, unfounded, tripy attack on my Department when he described that document as being in any way an interference with the independence of the judiciary, since the very thing which it does point out is that the justices must use their own discretion.</P>
    <P>Take the document which was sent out.  It was to this effect: Certain laws have been passed by this House. In most matters the House thinks the laws passed should be effective.  The magistrates in carrying out the law must decide as to what are the proper penalties to be imposed, so that the law will be effective.  If crime becomes very common a large penalty is obviously necessary to stop it.  If crimes are comparatively small in number large penalties may not be necessary.</P>
    <P>To know the extent of the crimes which are being committed, to know the number of the crimes is most valuable to District Justices, in order that they may in their unfettered discretion decide what is the proper penalty to be inflicted.  It was pointed out that under the Live Stock Breeding Act, and, to some extent also, under the Forestry Act, the penalties that were being inflicted were so small that they were not acting as a deterrent, and that offences of this nature were increasing. Is it not right that information should be placed at the disposal of the District Justices?  Is it not the correct thing to do?  In order that they might see that these particular offences were increasing, is it not right that these statistics should be placed before District Justices?  To place these statistics before a District Justice is described by Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Fahy as interference with the discretion of the District Justice. Has any more unfounded charge ever been made?  Based on that, Deputy Ruttledge ventures to come along here and suggest that District Justices are <Col N="374" /> being told how to decide individual cases and the penalties to inflict.  He says that without a shadow of foundation. The statement is so utterly false that it seems to me very difficult to understand how a Deputy belonging to his profession and having the standing which he has, or ought to have, in this House, would come along, and without the slightest shadow of foundation, indulge in such language.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ruttledge and Little went on to talk about the decrees given against detective officers.  My views have been clearly stated before, and I will state them again now as clearly as I can.  If members of the Gárda Síochána are dealing with a dangerous association, and if they consider that for the prevention of crime they should take certain steps, and, acting hastily as they must act, acting on the spur of the moment, as they must act, using their discretion, as they must use it, those men occasionally go too far, then the State is going to stand behind them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as in the Waterford case where third degree methods were found by a jury to have been used, the State does not stand by that. That is a clear, definite distinction.  If an officer of the Gárda Síochána, in the exercise of his discretion, happens to make a bona fide honest mistake, that man is going to have the State behind him.  We are not going to have it in this condition: that for every single ruffian a Gárda arrests he may have an action taken against him, very probably by a man of straw, with the result that it would be impossible for the Gárdaí to carry out their duty.  If you could terrorise the Guards by bringing actions against them and breaking them financially, then the Guards could not carry out their duty and a campaign of that kind would be very successful.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite are very willing to attack the &ldquo;S&rdquo; branch of the Gárda &mdash;the detectives&mdash;who show zeal in doing their duty.  Are they equally willing to attack the persons who murdered Guards?  If one single member of such an association has even his little finger bruised Deputies opposite will get up in indignation to denounce the Guards.  Would a single one of <Col N="375" /> them dare to get up and denounce the association that is guilty of murder of the Guards?  Deputy G. Boland said on one occasion that there was to be no more use of the gun in this country, but he was called to order pretty quickly in certain quarters, and I have seen no similar speech made by him since.  We heard no reiteration of that sound principle from Deputy Ruttledge or from any other member, responsible or irresponsible, of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little talked to-day about the conditions we would all desire to see in this country.  The condition I desire to see in this country is the condition of peace, that nobody shall attempt by force of arms to upset this State, that nobody shall be entitled to drill or to use firearms except persons authorised by law so to do.  That is my view.  Peace can only be got if you can keep down persons endeavouring to disturb the peace.  What is Deputy Little's view?  I judge a man's view by his conduct and by the words circulated outside this House in the country and Deputy Little's view and the view of his Party are as clearly as possible those: &ldquo;Encourage people to have arms and encourage people to illegal drilling; stand over them at every single opportunity you can.  If these soldiers say they have been treated in the slightest hostile fashion by the Guards, immediately come to their assistance and let these brave fighting men, this vigorous anti-State Army come and win in Court if the slightest thing is done against them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pass away from that matter and I come to some others that Deputies have touched upon.  Deputy Little spoke about the Censorship Act and said that the names of prohibited books, published in certain papers, was doing harm.  I agree.  I wish that the names of these books were not published in any paper, certainly not in any paper circulating in this country.  I cannot see that it does any good to have them published in papers which circulate in this country. Deputy Little said that books of this nature were imported from Northern Ireland into the Free State.  Deputy <Col N="376" /> Little seems to have a great number of sources of information at his disposal. I certainly have never heard of any such importation and I fancy that if it were taking place it would be reported to me by persons who knew of it.  If the Deputy can give me any information upon which I could act I shall immediately see that the Gárdaí act.  In this matter, Deputy Little comes along with the very brilliant idea.  He says let the detective branch of the Gárdaí allow people drilling do just as they like, but let the Gárdaí search the book catalogues, read books and send them to the Censorship of Publications Committee. That is his idea of the proper function of the detective force.  I leave it to the House to decide whether under the present administration or under an administration of which Deputy Little is likely to be a prominent member the detectives will do the more useful work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little talked about the censorship of films.  I am perfectly satisfied that the working of the Censorship of Films Act is entirely satisfactory. I know that there are objections to this work and I am perfectly aware of the fact that representations were made by what is called the trade to the effect that there may be a shortage of pictures, if the present rigorous line of the censorship is kept up.  We intend to keep up the present line and if the supply falls short it is to the producers to produce films that can be shown in respectable company. I have nothing more to add except to deal very shortly with the question of the Rules of Court and the Courts of Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be utterly impossible for the new Courts of Justice Bill to be introduced before next Autumn.  We have a very heavy programme before us, and that programme must be carried through.  The Courts of Justice Bill is one of many Bills of very great importance and urgency, but it must wait its turn.  I am as interested in the Courts of Justice, from the position I now hold and from the fact that my whole adult life was spent in the Law Courts, and I am as interested in the successful working of the <Col N="377" /> administration of the law as anybody in this House could possibly be.  I myself am of opinion that the appeal system from the Circuit Court&mdash;the main suggestion the report contains&mdash; which is now in force is a system that should be altered, and I am anxious it should be done as soon as possible, but owing to the pressure upon time it cannot be done at once.  I again express my great sorrow that the Circuit Court Rules were not let through at the time they were brought before this House, because if they were let through then they would have been working from that time up to the present.  If there were any defects in them they would be seen, and they are precisely the same rules we will have to start off with when the new Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I must refer to.  That is the specific case which Deputy Ruttledge brought up about the Peace Commissioner.  This Peace Commissioner was engaged in a fracas in Cork.  The facts of the case were these.  He was at a fair, and there was an argument about the sale of some young pigs.  His son was accused of having interfered with the bargain almost on the point of completion between a prospective purchaser and the owner of the pigs.  Later on in the day these persons met and started abusing each other.  The son of this Peace Commissioner and another man came to blows. The Peace Commissioner interfered in the fight on behalf of the son, and there was undoubtedly on that occasion a very regrettable fracas. The Peace Commissioner was fined £5 for his share in the struggle.  Up to that time this Peace Commissioner, who had held the office for some four years, discharged the duties of his office very satisfactorily.  Because he happened upon this one occasion in hot blood, when his son was engaged in a row, to intervene, does not appear to me to be in itself a sufficient ground for his removal from the Peace Commissionership. I stand over that absolutely.  The main thing that happened was that the false teeth of the gentleman on the other side were <Col N="378" /> broken, and that accounted for the amount of the fine.</P>
