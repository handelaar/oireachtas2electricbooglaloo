      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland (for Mr. Corkery)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the reasons assigned by Mr. Daniel O'Neill, now residing at Enniskeane, Co. Cork, for his resignation from the Royal Irish Constabulary when communicating it to the authorities of that force in April, 1918; (b) whether he has received an application from Mr. O'Neill for a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, and (c) on what grounds he has refused to authorise the grant of a pension to Mr. O'Neill.</P>

      <P>I have heard of the reasons given by Mr. O'Neill in 1918 for resigning from the Royal Irish Constabulary. The only official record of the reasons then stated is in documents in the custody of the British Government, the contents of which I am not in a position to disclose.  As I have already caused the Deputy to be informed, I have received, and have refused, an application from Mr. O'Neill for a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  In administering that section I have found it necessary to adopt the rule of not making public the reasons underlying the refusal of a pension, and accordingly I cannot see my way to give the Deputy the information asked for in the concluding part of his question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1986" /> Finance to state when it is his intention to determine finally the amount of compensation to be paid Mr. S. J. Baker, Main Street, Dingle, for damage to his house and property (estimated at £500 by an independent contractor) during the occupation of the house by the Irish National Army in 1922 and 1923 and the amount of compensation for serious loss of health to the late Mrs. Baker and Miss Baker who were as a result of the occupation continually under doctors' care.</P>

      <P>Compensation totalling over £150 was paid to Mr. Baker by the Department of Defence in respect of the occupation of his premises by the troops, including compensation for damage due to wear and tear, and in respect of items of damage not covered by these payments the Board of Works, after careful inspection of the premises, have assessed and offered a sum of £13.  The item in Mr. Baker's claim for loss of health is not an item which can be admitted.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Glyde River Drainage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the drainage works carried out on the Glyde river by the Board of Works have resulted in an increase of flooding of the land along the middle and lower reaches of the river; further, whether he will take steps to compensate the farmers whose lands have been made worse, and to relieve of the burden of drainage rates those farmers whose land has not been improved; and further, whether he will take steps to have the works necessary to reduce the flooding on the river to at least its former proportions, carried out without cost to the farmers affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The works of restoration carried out in the Glyde Drainage District under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, were completed some years ago, and as there have been no complaints of serious flooding up to the current year, the present conditions may be fairly attributable to the <Col N="1987" /> recent extraordinary rainfall with which the district was never intended to deal.  It is not proposed to pay compensation to any person whose lands have been flooded.  However, not because the works had not been well done, but because the restoration works cost much more than was anticipated (mainly because extra works had to be carried out), the Minister for Finance some time ago decided to increase the Government free grant from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. of the actual cost of the works, so as to relieve the farmers in the district of a great part of the burden of the drainage rates.</P>
      <P>As much work as is permissible under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, has already been done in the district, and, if further improvements are desired, the occupiers may proceed by petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, for the formation of a new drainage district.  Of course they would continue to be liable for the charges in respect of the works already carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the people in this Finance interviewed the people in the locality at Ballyhoe Bridge before the General Election, and gave them to understand that the drainage was to be completely free?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the people of the district are complaining that there has been serious flooding for the last three or four years, and that the lands along the middle reaches of the river, instead of benefiting, have been worsened; that the upper regions swamp into them after rain, and that the flooding is of much longer duration than it was prior to the drainage operations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first year we have had any complaint.  It is an abnormal year.  We have had more floods in Ireland this year than for the last twenty-five or thirty years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary send inspectors down to the district and let them see for themselves?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people concerned wish to proceed under the 1925 Act we will facilitate them in every way, but it is for them to take the first steps by petition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is this: the people of the district understood that these drainage works were simply to give employment to ex-members of the Free State Army.  They thought the scheme was altogether free.  I have interviewed several people in the flooded districts, and they say that the lands have been very much disimproved. Under these circumstances, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he will send down inspectors, and, if he finds that that is the case, if he will have the work carried out free of charge to the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no power to do that.  As a matter of fact, we have given a concession there that we have not given in any other district in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The concession does not meet the case.  I know people who are paying £14 extra in drainage rates for land which is much worse than ever it was before.  I know the district myself. I often travelled through the bogs, and I know you could not travel through the bogs now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that in the year 1925 Lisheencreagh National School was closed as a result of an undertaking to provide free transport facilities for the pupils attending that school to Ballydehob No. 1 National School; if in pursuance of that undertaking a contract was entered into providing for motor transport at £90 per annum; if consequent on increased taxation (from £28 to £70 per annum) the contractor sought to annul the contract but was induced to continue same on the representation by the manager and inspector that increased remuneration would be given; if notwithstanding the representation made no such increased remuneration was given the contractor for one and a half years and if it is proposed to carry into effect the representation made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In substitution for the Lisheencreagh National School, which ceased operation, a grant of £90 per annum was allowed, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, towards the cost of the conveyance of the children, from the district served by that school, to and from the Ballydehob (2) National School from the 16th November, 1925.  The grant was payable to the manager of the latter school, and, in accordance with the conditions for the payment of the grant in such cases, the van was provided <Col N="1991" /> and all other arrangements were made by the manager and the local parties.</P>
      <P>The taxation on the vehicle was increased, as stated in the question, from 1st July, 1929.  The inspectors of my Department who were serving in the area of the school at the time state that they made no representations that increased remuneration would be given.</P>
      <P>From the information at my disposal the service was continued by arrangement between the manager of the Ballydehob (2) National School, and the contractor.  The manager made application for an increase in the grant towards the annual cost of the service in view of the additional taxation.</P>
      <P>The general question of the taxation of commercial motor vehicles conveying children to school, such as that used in this case, has been the subject of inter-departmental correspondence, and, as from the 1st January, 1931, the increased taxation has not been applied to the vehicle on condition that it is not used for the carriage of passengers for hire other than the children when being conveyed to and from school.</P>
      <P>The application of the manager for increase in the grant in respect of the service for the period antecedent to the 1st January, 1931, during which the higher taxation was paid, viz, from the 1st July, 1929, to the 31st December, 1930, is under consideration, and my Department is in communication with the manager on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said on the last day that we should have taken this matter to the Dáil long ago, and it was suggested that if we did we would receive helpful suggestions and that very likely this dispute would be settled.  This discussion has come before the Dáil and we have had the benefit of a couple of hours' debate upon it, and what are the helpful suggestions we received? Deputy Derrig suggested compulsory arbitration or, to use his own phrase, &ldquo;something else.&rdquo; In fact, running through the whole of the debate there was that suggestion from all Parties that we should do something undefined. Some suggestions like compulsory arbitration got a sort of doubtful blessing from Deputy Derrig and a complete condemnation from Deputy Davin. Generally speaking, it was to be left <Col N="2004" /> to ourselves, that we would do something, that we ought to stand by our people, etc., etc.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig, however, to some extent did commit himself to compulsory arbitration as an evidence that he was extremely anxious to settle this dispute, and he implied that a figure of 49/- might be paid for beet. I shall ask the Dáil to consider that point.  That was thrown out in an indefinite way by people who are anxious for a settlement.  Let the Dáil mark this, the Beet Growers' Association, the people genuinely interested, the people who are to get the money, the people who have not such an interest in the politics of the matter but have an interest in the economics, asked for 46/-.  I dare say they would take less.  I am not saying how much less.  They asked for 46/- The helpful people all out to settle it ask 49/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compulsory arbitration is an easy phrase, easily understood and like everything else compulsory arbitration is supposed to settle all difficulties. But anybody who has any experience of business and who thinks over this proposal of compulsory arbitration for a moment will see it is not so simple as it looks.  Why compulsory arbitration in this case? Are we to confine compulsory arbitration to the beet growing and to the beet factory?  I presume we are.  I presume compulsory arbitration is not going to become general in business in this country.  I could understand Deputies taking up the line definitely that &ldquo;we are State Socialists, we think the business of the country should be run by the State&rdquo; because that is what compulsory arbitration in the long run, analysed back, comes to.  They do not take that line.  In this case there is to be compulsory arbitration.  What is the distinction between this business and others? There is one distinction between this class and numerous other classes of business and that is that in this business the State is giving a big subsidy. Am I to take it that there is to be compulsory arbitration every time the State gives a subsidy, that somebody outside the business is to fix the price <Col N="2005" /> at which the business is to buy raw materials and presumably to fix the other price?</P>
    <P>But I will come to that later.  It should be remembered that this is not the only industry in the country run with the help of money which does not come out of the business itself but comes either from the taxpayer or the consumer.  Practically every factory which is operating in this country under a tariff is getting good money from the consumer, who is the same person as the taxpayer. Are we to have compulsory arbitration there?  If Deputy Derrig and other amateur economists of Fianna Fáil will think over it they will find you cannot say &ldquo;compulsory arbitration&rdquo; and stop at that.  Compulsory arbitration raises a number of very difficult and thorny questions which would divide all parties.  Further if we are to have compulsory arbitration not only in this case but every case where there is a State subsidy, whether it comes from the consumer or the taxpayer, what is the arbitration to be about?  The price of the raw material?  Is it to include the wages of the employees?  Are the farmers who are supplying the beet to the factory to accept compulsory arbitration in regard to the wages they are to pay their employees?  That is what it amounts to.  You cannot have it both ways.  The fact that the words &ldquo;compulsory arbitration&rdquo; have been used merely shows an absence of any argument, any thought or any practical suggestion.  Coming to Deputy Davin's point, the suggestion of compulsory arbitration came along with the suggestion that 49/- should be paid, which is 3/- more than the Beet Growers' Association ask.  That will give the Dáil some idea of the anxiety of Deputies opposite to settle the dispute.  It will give the Dáil some idea whether the real anxiety was to keep the dispute going and to make political capital out of it.  Deputy Davin suggested that the factory should be taken over.</P>

There were references to foreigners and so on&mdash;a new sort of Sinn Féin&mdash;the operations of foreigners and the Congo methods.  All that is going to help to settle the dispute and to encourage enterprise! I say that these references, whatever the merits of the dispute this year, are a disgrace to the Dáil.  They are references which were not made at any time by the parties who are suffering most, the farmers themselves.  It was left to the leaders, the public representatives, to come here to make statements of that sort purely and simply for political purposes.</P>

If foreigners come in here they are entitled to the benefit of the law.  If they do anything which is not right we can deal with them.  While they keep the law and give employment and establish industry they should not be met by irresponsible criticism of that sort.  The fact that Deputies in the Labour Party or that members of the Fianna Fáil Party make statements of that kind shows conclusively that they are more interested in keeping the dispute going than in settling it.  The fact is that there are only two parties here who are seriously concerned and who are attempting to settle this dispute, the Beet Growers' Association and the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>I will come to that. The Deputy might contain himself and leave the question of order to the Chair.  I had not Deputy de Valera's quotation before me, and I accepted his statement.  I will give him an extract from what he did say:</P>
      <P>At least, he (that is I) could say now to the company: &ldquo;We have been generous with you.  You are asking our people to grow beet at a price that is uneconomic.  That price gives you an unfair profit, and because the circumstances are such we are going to help our own people in their fight against you and support any organisation that they set up to defend their interests against you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what we are to do this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any subsidies that we are going to give you or remissions to encourage beet growing we will use, and more money as well, in order to see that those who have had to devote their land to other crops will be put in a position to fight you <Col N="2009" /> and if necessary to see that you get no subsidy.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this it?</P>
      <P>To get back to this particular matter, we want to see the powers that are here to defend our own people exercised.  If there is a portion of the subsidy not paid as a result of the beet not being supplied, we think it is only fair that the farmers who have been compelled to sow other crops in place of beet should not suffer a loss by that, and portion of that subsidy should be devoted to seeing that they do not suffer a loss.</P>
      <P>That makes the matter quite clear. I had a distinct recollection of that statement.  However I leave that point.  Wild statements have been made here and elsewhere which have not tended to settle the dispute, with the result that the country as a whole has got a very wrong opinion of the merits of the case.  I will try to show what the merits of the case are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>To clear up a few preliminaries, it has been suggested that the company has been extremely wrong in depreciating to the extent that they have depreciated, and secondly that they have paid a bad price for beet from the beginning and high dividends.  I want to say first that it must be realised that the factory is not getting as good terms here as they could have got in England.  From that point of view it must be remembered that the subsidy in England applies not like our case to one factory or even to two factories, but to anybody who establishes a factory there.  If this factory had been established in England a higher subsidy would be paid.  It would be higher by about £400,000. One point that can be made is that during the last year, as a result of the very large amount of sugar which this factory made in the first eight years and as a result of their being confined to a certain maximum quantity of sugar, the subsidy here during the last year would not be big enough to enable them to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> If the subsidy here were increased during the 10th year by an amount sufficient to bring it up to the amount on the 8th year the factory would be still getting less by £300,000 in the 10th year than any English factory of the same size.  Further if the 1s. 3d. which is being got this year in England were not given during the next three years the factory here would still be getting less than the English subsidy by £300,000.  If both considerations were present, namely, that we increased the subsidy here by £100,000 in the past year, to bring it up to the amount of the previous year, and if the English factory were not getting the 1s. 3d. which they are getting this year, and which everyone knows will continue even in these contingencies, the factory here would be receiving £100,000 less than the factories in England receive for the ten-year period. That was the bargain we made.  In England all the factories to a very great extent have been financed by State-guaranteed money.  Here the factory was put up at the expense mainly of the directors, put up entirely out of their own capital.  That should be known.  We must deal with both sides if we are to get the merits of the case.  In the first year they practically paid 10 per cent., for the next three years 15 per cent., and last year they had a loss of about £15,000. That was never mentioned.  The balance sheet has just come out.  I am not sure of the amount but I know that the balance sheet shows a loss of about £15,000.  That is very far from being an exorbitant dividend, considering everything, when the four years are put together.  The dividends here are not bigger certainly than those paid by similar factories in England.  From that point of view the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company declined, and, in my opinion, rightly declined, to be compared with any factory except the best group of factories in England.  There is no question about that and it should be realised by people with the interests of the industry at heart that the factory in Carlow is certainly one of the best in the world.  It is admittedly a better factory than the best and most efficient in England belonging <Col N="2011" /> to the Anglo-Dutch group.  The output on coal and per sugar content of beet is as high as in any factory in Europe and those in charge decline to compare it with any but the best factory in England.  That is a position I have great deal of sympathy with.  People should get credit for that efficiency and from that point of view their dividends are similar to the dividends paid by the Anglo-Dutch group in England.</P>
    <P>Further it has been stated that their provision for depreciation has been enormous.  In that connection it has been pointed out that the amount of subsidy would not only pay for the beet, but would give them a certain amount over.  Deputies will have to realise that they do not know all about sugar beet, and that there are some things which they have to learn in regard to sugar factories.  They will have to realise that it is a fact that it is the invariable custom in every sugar factory to attempt to depreciate in the first ten years and it is a fact that the balance sheets show that the depreciation, plus reserves of the Anglo-Dutch group in England has been considerably higher than the depreciation, plus reserves of the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company.  I compare them with the Anglo-Dutch group in England for this reason. They are admittedly the best groups in England.  Their factories run about 13,000 or 14,000 tons of sugar. They are admittedly the best factories in England and you can very readily and with justice compare these factories.</P>
    <P>I take the position in regard to depreciation at their factories at Ely, Ipswich, and King's Lynn.  These factories have been in operation for respectively five years, five years and three years&mdash;giving something of an average of over four years.  The total capital of these factories was £1,666,000.  Their total reserves are £446,000 and their total depreciation £772,000.  If you add these figures you will get £1,223,000, while the total amount of the capital invested is £1,666,000.  I would ask Deputies to compare these factories with the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company who <Col N="2012" /> have not depreciated or built up reserves to anything like the same extent as the Anglo-Dutch group.  The point of that is this.  The subsidy in Ireland is somewhat smaller than the subsidy in England and at the same time even though they got a bigger subsidy, if you compare the four years which have just passed up to 1929-30, the Irish factory, even though the subsidy was smaller, paid the same price and made practically the same dividends as these English factories. They paid as good a price on a smaller subsidy.  This particular year their subsidy is higher than the English subsidy.</P>
    <P>The English factories have consented to go on this year without any profit, with nothing for depreciation and no reserve.  The Irish factory have put forward the case, and on these figures it must be admitted that there is something in the contention, that the English factories can afford to do that this year because their reserves and depreciation are so very much bigger.  An examination of the figures makes it clear that there is something in that point, that they have a bigger depreciation and bigger reserves.  The total amount of reserves and depreciation of the Anglo-Dutch group is £1,223,000, while the total outlay is £1,666,000.  They have built up reserves and depreciation to more than three-fourths.  That is the answer of the company to people who say that they should accept this year the same terms as in England.  Their answer is, in fact, &ldquo;We gave better terms for the past four years than the English companies&mdash;better terms in the way of price and better terms generally.  If we had given worse terms and depreciated to a greater extent we might be able perhaps to do what the English companies are doing.  We have not done that, and you cannot have it both ways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say there is something in that point.  It is no use, as Deputy de Valera suggested, in saying that they are getting a subsidy which covers the price of beet and something over.  That is so, but no factory in England has been able to run on any other terms. The point is, that whatever subsidy <Col N="2013" /> they are getting is smaller than the English subsidy, and, as I say, the English Act is a general Act.  Anybody who comes in can establish a factory under it.  It invites factories.  People will come there and take the best terms they can.  It is a fair test to take.  The argument that the amount paid by way of subsidy is more than is paid for the beet, if that argument is used, can only be used for one purpose, and that is, that the production of beet is not economic.  If that argument is to be used and is to have any validity, it can only mean that the production of sugar beet is not economic. If the Irish factory is getting enough to pay for beet and leaving something over, the factory is in the same position as the English factories&mdash;in fact, they are in a worse position, because they are getting a somewhat lower subsidy.</P>
    <P>Coming to the merits of this year's dispute, it is true that the factory is getting a bigger subsidy than it got last year.  It is true that when you add that increase and also give the company the benefit of the decrease in the price which they are paying for beet, a decrease of from 46s. to 38s., in that way they save something like £80,000.  They, of course, put up figures to show that as compared with the year 1929-30 there is a drop in the price of sugar and in sugar pulp which would amount to £80,000 or £90,000. To make a long story short, they produce a balance sheet which shows that on a payment of 36s. per ton for beet they would provide ten per cent. dividend and leave this year some £10,000 or £7,000 to carry forward.</P>

      <P>And provide £45,000 for depreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Now we come to the other side of the case.  I say that up to this year the beet factory gave good value and I think the growers will agree with that. 46s. was a good price last year.  It was a good price last year and it was a goodish enough price the year before. As a result of that price the farmers did get a fair share of the subsidy.  In fact for the last four years this factory, coming in here at a time of great <Col N="2014" /> difficulty, gave good service to the country, not only to the farmers of the district but gave good value in the production of sugar.  They gave up to this year as high a price and in some cases a higher price, and they did it on a somewhat smaller subsidy. This year a dispute occurred and as I have told you their case is that the fall in the price of sugar and beet pulp, together with the increase in some other things would more than counterbalance the increased subsidy this year plus the advantage they gain by paying a smaller price for beet.  On these figures there can be no question of doubt about it, the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company put themselves definitely in the wrong.  Say that we can make all the other admissions as to depreciation, that we can admit that they depreciated up to this year normally, that their interest, taking everything into account, was not exorbitant&mdash;we can admit all that without weakening our case one iota&mdash; that even this year they attempted to get across an agreement which was not fair to all the growers.  They admit that this year they are increasing the provision for depreciation from £40,000 to £45,000.  That is unfair, and £40,000 or ten per cent. is the normal orthodox depreciation in a beet factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem extraordinary that in a year in which sugar fell to a price which was below or round about the pre-war price, that in a year in which sugar fell to a price below which experts agree it can scarcely fall further, the company increased the provision for depreciation.  They excuse themselves by saying that they were uncertain as to their position in the tenth year.  That is no excuse. The factory even as scrap with the buildings around it would be worth £50,000.  There is no excuse to depreciate by £5,000 extra this year and endeavour at the same time to pay a ten per cent. dividend&mdash;what they themselves admitted is to place the entire fall in the price of sugar on the farmers.  That was unfair. Further they over-insured themselves in certain small items which taken on the aggregate are rather big.  They budgeted for a very big price in the <Col N="2015" /> full period.  It is generally agreed and it was clear enough to me in the negotiations that took place between myself and the factory that they over-insured themselves there.  They also over-insured themselves in regard to the increase in freights.  Above all they over-insured themselves in regard to the price of sugar.  Of course the price of sugar is a very important item and they calculated at the beginning of the year what they could pay.  Sugar had fallen to about 6s. 9d. per cwt.  Some months afterwards when it was too late to settle the dispute the text of an agreement was published in the papers, an agreement come to by all the sugar manufacturers of Europe and in other countries as well, and since that agreement the price of sugar has been going up a bit.  I think it might reasonably be inferred that the company knew when they were making this agreement that sugar was not likely to fall any more.  I have no doubt that they were prepared to carry forward £5,000 for depreciation.  There were other items which would bring that sum up to £15,000 or £16,000.</P>
    <P>All these items gave them £15,000 to £18,000 to play with which in all equity could have gone to the farmer in the price of beet.  I am not saying this on behalf of the Beet Growers' Association. I am not committing the Beet Growers' Association to any price.  I am merely saying that on their own figures, this year there was that amount of money there which could have been given.  I am merely saying this as I was closely in touch with the Beet Growers' Association and knew their minds&mdash;I was, as also was the President, in touch with the Sugar Manufacturing Company and I can say that if they had shown any tendency to see the equities which were standing out there, this dispute would have been settled.  Unfortunately they wanted to fight and the fight is over now so far as this year is concerned.  It is unfortunate, but it is over as far as this year is concerned.  We made, as everybody knows, as Deputy Derrig knows, because he was in touch with the Beet Growers' Association, every effort&mdash;I as Minister for Agriculture and the <Col N="2016" /> President, as Head of the Executive Council&mdash;to compose this dispute.</P>
    <P>We failed this year after the Spring had definitely passed and even when it became too late to sow beet, we immediately took up the question of re-opening negotiations for the next four years.  We have made a considerable amount of progress in the last month.  Deputy Davin said that the Sugar Manufacturing Company are not going to meet the Beet Growers' Association. I hope he is wrong, but if that is so, it opens another question. On the contrary I have been in negotiation with the Sugar Manufacturing Company within the past two months and I am hopeful and in fact I believe that they will meet them.  I believe that this dispute can be settled in the coming year without recourse to any of the heroic measures put forward such as compulsory arbitration, compulsory acquisition of the factory or compulsory this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>I think that that is really all that is to be said on the merits of this case. If Deputies consider that the Government should establish an industry here and insure it against any possible dispute they are asking for the impossible. It cannot be done.  Everybody would agree with that if they were to consider it dispassionately.  It is hard for the Beet Growers' Association and the farmers who are losing heavily this year to realise that.  I do not expect that the farmer in bad times will remember that he did well out of this crop for four or five years.  Naturally, he concentrates on his misfortune this year when he cannot grow the crop and has to find a very much less remunerative crop.  It is only natural too that politicians would make a certain amount of capital out of any trouble that arises, but having some regard for the future of the country and to the fact that other industries must be established here and the fact that their own policy has been to subsidise or to encourage industries, both by the money of the taxpayers and of the consumers, and by State interference, I would expect them to remember that. When you come to consider it dispassionately, in nine out of ten cases <Col N="2017" /> can there be no alternative to what Deputy Derrig calls haggling but what I call negotiation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin stated he would not have compulsory arbitration.  It might lead us on a very long road.  I do not care on this point what the Beet Growers' Association say.  I think I am talking more really for the farmers of the country when I say that they will not have compulsory arbitration also, either on this or other matters. Compulsory arbitration is the last thing except acquisition of the factory is the last thing.  This dispute has lasted for one year unfortunately, but I believe that it will be settled in the coming year.  It is as between 38s. and 46s. a ton, and it does not justify any such heroic measures.  I believe it can be settled and will be settled, but there is this to be said: if it is not settled, if either party put themselves in the wrong, it will have to be dealt with.  Anybody can make one mistake. Every dog, I believe, is entitled to one bite.  People do things and say things on the spur of the moment in heat.  Everyone can make allowances for that, but they have been fighting long enough.  They have tried it out now, and I should say that both sides are in a better mood at the moment to end the dispute.</P>
    <P>I was told that the farmers are suffering great loss.  They are.  So is the factory.  It may be a very brutal way of settling disputes, but the Labour Party, the farmers and everybody else settle disputes in that way. They usually stand on their legal rights.  Every party insists on its legal rights.  If they considered it a little more calmly they would find that stupid, obstinate insistence on legal rights gets nobody anywhere.  To come to business and settle it is far better than compulsion.  The fight is over for this year, and, as I said, I believe it will be settled in the coming year. Both sides have to remember that the taxpayer has a very big interest in this factory and that we cannot stand by and see an establishment which has been conducted successfully and creditably up to the present wrecked because tempers have run high.  Moreover, <Col N="2018" /> we would not stand by that.  I need not go into that question any further at the present moment.  There is no use dealing with difficulties that have not yet arisen.  I have been in constant touch for the last four or five years both with the Beet Growers' Association and with the factory.  I believe, notwithstanding or, if you like, because of what happened this year, that this dispute will be settled for the remaining years of the subsidy, and I do not propose to adopt any of the heroic measures that have been suggested here for the settlement of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are put at a very serious disadvantage by the Minister.  He generally manages to express his views fairly strongly here, both on the question at issue and on the people who have spoken, but if we attempt to state our views on a question like the sugar beet industry we are immediately told that we are doing it in order to make political capital.  We are always out for political capital, and the Minister is always out for the good of the beet growers or whoever it may be.  It is an extraordinary thing.  I suppose we should be thankful to have such a high-souled man at the head of agriculture in this country, that he would not attempt to make political capital out of any question.  It must be very annoying to the Minister to have such political opponents as we are, who never see the justice of the case, but who are always making political capital out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that it was part of our policy to subsidise certain industries and certain production. Let us accept that.  Broadly speaking, we are perhaps more inclined to subsidise certain production than the Government is.  Is it not much more to our interest to see an industry like the sugar beet industry succeed than it is to the interest of the Minister for Agriculture who is against subsidising production in any way?  If the Minister wants his policy of free competition and production, without subsidies or anything else, to succeed it is only going to convince the people of this country that the Minister's policy is right if the <Col N="2019" /> sugar beet factory fails or if the whole sugar beet scheme fails.  It is going to militate against us if that experiment fails.  Hence we are very anxious that the thing should succeed, whatever the Minister may say&mdash;I do not think he believes it&mdash;in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister made two statements here the last day.  He repeated one of them to-day.  He said that first of all the bargain he made with Messrs. Lippens was an excellent one and secondly he said that when you compare the Carlow Beet Sugar Factory with a factory of equal size in England the English factory would get £400,000 more in subsidy in ten years than the Carlow factory would get.  He challenged us to dispute that figure.  It is a very difficult figure to dispute because the subsidy is paid in different ways in the two places.  In England there is a subsidy on molasses.  Here there is a subsidy on sugar and there is also a remission of duty.  The only thing I can do in order to throw some doubt on what the Minister has said is to quote a speech that he made here in 1928. Speaking on this subject in this House on the 24th of February, 1928, first of all talking about the excellent bargain that was made he said: &ldquo;I believe that but for the events of the last five years we could have had a factory with a smaller subsidy&mdash;not very much smaller, because when you compare the subsidy in our first ten years with the English subsidy there is not such a tremendous difference.&rdquo; He had made a speech about the petrol tin, the smell of burning houses and so on, and he went on to point out to the people of the country how we had been responsible for making a worse bargain on the sugar beet than would have been the case if there had been no Civil War.  But since then evidently the Minister has come to realise that the people of this country do not now lay the blame of the Civil War on us and he says the bargain was the best that could be made.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the subsidy for the first ten years worked out at, he thought, 22/6, and the English subsidy <Col N="2020" /> for the first ten years was 19/-.  On the 24th of February, 1928, the Minister stated in this House that for the first ten years the subsidy in England would work out at 3/6 less than the subsidy here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Remember that would be if I were calculating it on the first two or three years of this subsidy.  They made less than 13,000 tons of sugar, and handled less than 22,000 tons of beet. In 1928 we had only the figures of the first two or three years.  If you calculate on less than the total quantity of sugar which the factory could make being made you will, of course, increase the subsidy, but immediately after the first two or three years, as of course we foresaw, the beet growers even more than doubled the capacity of the factory. The Deputy will get the figures in this publication which has been issued.</P>

      <P>Yes, later on.  The subsidy here, according to the Minister on the 24th February, 1928, was 22/6, while it was 19/- in England.  It is possible that the Minister may be able to put a better complexion on that now than he was on the 24th of February, 1928.</P>

      <P>The President spoke about half an hour afterwards.  He said: &ldquo;Taking into account what the Minister has said that there is a difference of 2s. between the subsidy here and in Great Britain&rdquo;&mdash;the Minister's case is that the difference is 3s. 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the figures, it is clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In column 382 the Minister is reported as stating the difference to be 3s. 6d. while in column 394 the President is reported as stating the difference as 2s.  That is over three years ago.  If the Minister had been right in his statement of 3s. 6d. difference the subsidy here would be exactly £400,000 more than the subsidy in Great Britain.  In half an hour the difference of 3s. 6d. becomes 2s. and after an interval of three years the £400,000 becomes reversed.  In any case, I have read the statement of the Beet Growers' Association.  I believe they went to considerable trouble to get the figures they produced, and the balance sheets and so on would appear to support their case.  They make the very definite statement that if you compare the factory in Carlow with a factory of similar size in England for this year the factory here would be getting £100,000 more than the factory in England.  I do not think it is fair for the Minister to come here and state that we are getting off £400,000 better than a similar factory in England.  I do not think it is fair for him to <Col N="2022" /> come and challenge us to prove it wrong.  He should have given us the figures when he was making his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that statement three weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was fair for the Minister to throw three or four columns of figures now at me, not giving me an opportunity of looking into them, and asking me to accept them as proving his case.  We have had a good deal of talk from the Minister and others about the businesslike way in which the agreement was made.  We very seldom have a discussion here at which we do not have a lecture from the Minister on business methods.  He tells us &ldquo;that is not the way business is done.&rdquo; Another time he tells us &ldquo;anybody who knows anything about business will do it in this way.&rdquo; I find that the Minister was delegated by the Executive Council to negotiate with Messrs.  Lippens in order to start this Carlow Sugar Beet Factory.  He was the person who was there negotiating with Messrs. Lippens, and we have it that when the Minister was making this agreement with Messrs.  Lippens he went in to make it in the most businesslike way possible.  He did conclude an agreement with these people, guaranteeing them a subsidy for ten years, but he only got in return a guaranteed price for the beet growers for three years.  That, apart from anything else, should have made it fairly plain to anybody that the agreement was one-sided.  If there were two parties to that agreement, and if the two parties had maintained their rights in that agreement, surely the Minister would not have guaranteed them a subsidy for ten years unless in return the people who were to manufacture the sugar were prepared to guarantee a price for the beet for ten years to the beet growers, or, in default of that, a provision should be made in case of dispute that there would be some arbitration machinery to settle that.  That was the businesslike way the Minister made this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told before to-day how this agreement was made.  The Minister speaking down in Athy on the 14th June told the people how he made this <Col N="2023" /> agreement.  He told them how when he met Mr. Lippens that there was a financial adviser of Messrs. Lippens present.  He told how the financial adviser told Mr. Lippens that this was no country for him to come into at all.  He reminded him of the Civil War and he said he doubted that the farmers would grow beet satisfactorily and that labour was unreliable.  The Minister told this financial adviser that he was a liar.  We were also told dramatically by the Minister how Mr. Lippens said: &ldquo; I believe you,&rdquo; and started the factory.  Messrs. Lippens started the factory having been assured by the Minister that the financial adviser whom he had brought in was a liar, when he had told him that it was inadvisable for him to start a factory here.  That is the businesslike way in which this was done.  The only convincing point in the story was that the Minister was able to call the financial adviser of Messrs. Lippens a liar.</P>
    <P>The publicists of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were so delighted with the story that they really got out a leaflet and distributed it all over Kildare showing how the Minister had the wit and courage and wisdom to call an Irishman a liar and that Mr. Lippens turned to him and said: &ldquo; I believe you.&rdquo; That leaflet was got out in order to convince the people of Kildare that Mr. Hogan was a good business man, that he was not afraid to say to an Irish financier &ldquo;You are a liar,&rdquo; and was always prepared to talk out his mind on any subject.  That leaflet was sent out headed &ldquo;That is the stuff behind Conlon.&rdquo; The people of Kildare evidently thought that they would like something more substantial behind Mr. Conlon.  They were not a bit interested in the caption &ldquo;Straight Speaking Means Straight Government,&rdquo; and they disregarded the advice of &ldquo;Vote No. 1 Conlon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister when talking on this subject tried to give the House the impression that he was holding the balance of power as fairly as any man could do between the two parties. First of all he told us about the costs <Col N="2024" /> at the factory.  He gave us a very fair outline of the case that the factory had.  Then he turned to the Beet Growers' Association and told us the case that they had and he wound up by saying &ldquo; Taking everything into consideration it is my opinion that the factory could afford to pay a little more for the beet.&rdquo; And so they could.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister has not for the last five or six years shown the factory that he was prepared to stand up against them, as he was prepared to see the price of beet reduced if such a reduction should be necessary.  The Minister speaking here on the 24th February, 1928, was asked a question as to whether there would be other factories started in this country and he said &ldquo;there is no question of starting other factories on the basis of subsidising agriculture to the tune of £24 an acre.&rdquo; There is only one meaning that can be taken from that answer and that is that in his opinion the subsidy that was going to agriculture was too high, that the farmers were getting too much out of the beet and that if it were ever possible to start another sugar factory in this country it should be on a basis of giving less for the beet.  Talking on the very same subject on the 24th February, 1928, the Minister said, in dealing with the factory: &ldquo;I cannot understand why people take a balance sheet in connection with this experiment, examine it and say that the company made £50,000 net profit, £114,000 gross profit and consider that this is criticism of the scheme.  I consider that is in his favour.&rdquo; Then he goes on to say: &ldquo;I am sorry they have not made £100,000 or £200,000. I should like if they had made £400,000.&rdquo; Contrast those two statements. Imagine a man like Mr. Lippens or anybody else connected with the factory reading that speech and seeing the Minister had stated here publicly that he was not going to have any more to do with sugar factories when the price paid for beet amounted to a subsidy of £24 an acre.</P>

I do not know whether the owners of the <Col N="2026" /> factory read that statement or not. Whether they did or not, if they did not, what I have suggested here is what they would do if they had read the Minister's speech.  That is what they have done.  They have consistently tried to cut down the price of beet, and they have continued in spite of the slump in the price of sugar to pay £60,000 in the form of dividends, £40,000 depreciation, and £6,000 reserve.  The Minister has told us now that he has seen an advance copy of the balance sheet for the last year and that it shows a loss.</P>

      <P>Another matter that Deputy Gorey mentioned here the last day is this.  The Deputy mentioned, whether on his own initiative or encouraged by other members of his Party I do not know, but he told us it was a delicate matter, and he said that certain people interfered in this dispute, and that it would be much better if they had not interfered.  I quite agree with him, and I want to tell him this, that he thought I had laid a trap for him.  I did not.  I thought at the time when he was speaking of this matter that he was referring to somebody on this side, because he could never say anything too bad of this side or when anything bad was to be done it was somebody on this side that did it.</P>

      <P>No.  But I thought the Deputy was getting extra polite.  At any rate, I asked the Deputy who it was, and now I want to say publicly that I have just as much courage as. Deputy Gorey in saying that the Bishop of Carlow should not have interfered in this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he did say it, to give him his due.  The Bishop interfered in this dispute.  But in interfering he only expressed the same sentiments as the <Col N="2027" /> President himself expressed.  The President said that he had spoken to the farmers privately, and they told him that they were getting a fair price for their beet and that they were satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It was published in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on the following day that the President said that he had privately discussed the matter with the farmers and that they said they were quite satisfied with the price they were getting.  The President did not say whether he was referring to this year or last year.  He might have been referring to last year's price.  The beet growers might come to the conclusion that the efficiency of the Carlow factory was such and that the price was such that they should take the price, and that there should be no interference by the Beet Growers' Association with the growers.  Again, the Minister told us here that it was a most successful bargain that was made with the factory owners when the factory was started, that it was one of the best factories in Europe, that it is most efficient and that it is making profits.  All these things are admitted. In the debate here a few years ago, on the 8th November, 1928, when the Minister for Finance was pressed on the matter as to why he did not encourage the investment of capital in the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory, and even go so far as to invest some Government funds in it, he said that it was the policy of the Government to make the people who were coming in own a substantial part of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His idea was&mdash;it may be all right&mdash; that if the company which was coming in did not own a substantial part of the factory they might not give the same care or the same time to the working of the factory as they would if they were practically full owners of the place.  The Minister has said that the <Col N="2028" /> subsidy is less in England this year than it is here.  It is much less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  Let the Deputy refute the Minister's figures.  That is what we would like to hear.  Do not read the speech you wrote out last night, which has no relation to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the man who asked three different Ministers about flooding and never asked the right one.  The subsidy in England this year is 6/6; it is 22/6 here.  The Minister of Agriculture in England some time ago brought in a supplementary estimate for an extra 1/3, and the money given under that estimate to the beet factories in England was only given on condition that they would pay no dividends, put nothing towards depreciation and nothing to reserve.  In other words, that the whole benefit of the State subsidy would have to go to the growers if this extra 1/3 per. cwt. was to be given.  If it is a fact, as the Minister said, that the owners of our factory could have got better terms in England than they are getting here, it is strange that the English factories this year have to work on that basis of not paying any dividends, of not putting anything towards depreciation and to reserve.  That is the condition of getting the subsidy in England.  There is no such condition here.  If a factory working here can get this subsidy, and is permitted, if it can so manage, to pay a dividend and put money towards depreciation and reserve and everything else, as long as it can beat the farmers down to a certain price that will suit it, surely that factory is working under better conditions than in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said that the Subsidy Act passed in England would admit any number of factories that came along.  The Act here, including the agreement, I believe gives a sort of monopoly to the factory. Surely a monopoly is more favourable than coming in and taking your chances amongst others.  A factory in England has no guarantee that another factory will not come into the same district next year, and there is no guarantee that it will get a certain <Col N="2029" /> amount of beet.  The Minister on the last day referred to Deputy de Valera's wrecking policy.  I believe he went so far as to say that Deputy de Valera's policy was always a wrecking policy.  I do not know if the Minister&mdash;he denied it on one occasion &mdash;thought that about Deputy de Valera in 1916.  At least there are men behind him who applauded that statement who thought in 1916 that Deputy de Valera's policy was a wrecking policy.  What is his wrecking policy?  His wrecking policy is going to wreck the Minister in trying to maintain the factory here and get the beet growers down to a certain price.  Deputy de Valera read extracts here when the Minister tried to misrepresent him, and he made it quite clear what his policy was as stated in column 1956 of the Official Reports.</P>
    <P>If there is a portion of the subsidy not paid as a result of the beet not being supplied we think it is only fair that the farmers who have been compelled to sow other crops in place of beet should not suffer a loss by that and a portion of that subsidy should be devoted to seeing that they do not suffer a loss.</P>
    <P>That is the policy which is called a wrecking policy.  Previously on that day, when Deputy Derrig was speaking the Minister asked him what was his policy with regard to the beet growers and those who were coming in to grow beet for the first time and Deputy Derrig said:</P>
    <P>I want to see the small growers getting the benefit out of it as well as the big growers, but I am not prepared to say that the small growers should come in now at the expense of breaking up the Association.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said: &ldquo;That is my position also.&rdquo; We want to see the small growers getting the benefit from this as well as the big growers. We seem to be united on both sides of the House that we are not prepared to see the small or the big growers coming in now and breaking up the Association which is making this fight for a better price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entitled to come into the Association.</P>

    <Col N="2030" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with their coming into the Association.  Deputy de Valera made a suggestion that would give these people a chance to fight. He made the suggestion that, if you have growers of beet who this year said they were going to stand by the Association and were not going to grow beet, that they are going to grow barley and oats instead, and are going to suffer a loss by doing so of £4 or £5 an acre&mdash;it may be much more&mdash;that these people should be helped and should get part of the unpaid portion of the subsidy in order to help them to put up that fight.  The Minister called it a wrecking policy.  The Minister is prepared to pay a subsidy to the factory for the people to come in and grow beet and wreck the Beet Growers' Association.  He is prepared to subsidise the factory to fight the Association by getting other people to grow beet.  Because Deputy de Valera said: &ldquo;Help those who are not growing beet to grow another crop,&rdquo; he said it is a wrecking policy.  What is it going to wreck?  Is it going to wreck the Carlow factory in its fight? It is going to compel them to pay more.  That is what we want to see. That is what Deputy de Valera's suggestion amounted to, that we should compel the factory to pay more but because this suggestion came from Deputy de Valera it was a wrecking policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told from another source that it does not matter very much what subsidy we give to the factory.  The estimate this year is £108,000.  Then we come to &ldquo;Pamphlets for the People, No. 1&rdquo;&mdash;there are more to follow. This pamphlet asks, &ldquo;Where do taxes go to?  Back to the people.&rdquo; That is issued by Cumann na nGaedheal and we find mentioned among the taxes that go back to the people&mdash;the beet sugar subsidy of £108,334.  That is part of the £23,000,000 that goes back to the people, according to this pamphlet.  A most extraordinary thing is, according to this pamphlet, that the people pay in taxes £20,000,000 and £23,000,000 goes back to the people&mdash;£23,000,000 out of £20,000,000 goes back to the people! Part of the £23,000,000 that goes back to the people is the £108,000 beet subsidy.  Let us take <Col N="2031" /> the last balance sheet of the Carlow factory.  Out of the £108,000, £40,000 goes for depreciation, £60,000 towards dividend and £6,000 to reserve. £106,000 to the Lippens group out of the £108,000, and that is how the taxes go back to the people! It will be most interesting to see the other pamphlets when they come along, as this is only No. 1.</P>
    <P>We are told that negotiations will be resumed.  We were told in Kildare that they would be resumed on 7th July.  The polling there was on 29th June and they had to leave a margin and they said negotiations were to be resumed on 7th July.  On 8th July they were resumed in the High Court.  The Beet Growers' Association were brought there by the owners of the factory for contempt of court and they were found guilty and had to pay the costs and so on.  That is where the negotiations were resumed.  Now they are to be resumed again.  I believe there are several other cases coming on in the High Court so that there will be plenty of opportunities while they are waiting for the cases to be called for Messrs. Lippens and the Beet Growers' Association to talk about the price of beet.  We are told that it is no argument to say that they are getting more in subsidy than they are paying for beet.  It is not, I suppose, comparatively speaking&mdash;I mean the same thing may be occurring in England and in other countries in Europe.  Even so, it is no harm to say it.  According to a statement which I saw from the factory contradicting a statement made by the Beet Growers' Association, the factory stated that they received 58s. 9d. per ton for beet for the first four years and paid 54s. 4d., and they only made 4s. 5d. in addition to getting the beet for nothing.</P>
    <P>I am not against beet growing.  I think it is the proper thing to do. It is the proper thing to supply our own needs in sugar, as it would be in anything else.  We certainly should supply our own needs in sugar, just the same as in anything else, even if we have to pay 4/5 per ton to the beet factory, as well as paying for the beet altogether.  Deputy Heffernan, I am sure, would not approve of that. He made a very serious objection some <Col N="2032" /> time ago to paying millers half the price of wheat&mdash;only half.  Here we are paying 120 per cent.  Fifty per cent. was a grave scandal to the Farmers' Party but 120 per cent. was all right.  The Minister says that we cannot have compulsory arbitration and perhaps he is right.  He says we cannot have buying out only as a last resort.  I put it to the Government that the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera was the fairest and straightest suggestion made here, because we are not entering into the question of compulsory arbitration, although I myself, sooner than see the beet sugar experiment a failure, would vote for compulsory arbitration if necessary.  I would vote, if necessary, for the compulsory buying out of the factory and hand it over to the sugar beet growers rather than see the experiment fail.  But we have the third alternative suggested by Deputy de Valera and there is no objection to it as far as I can see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;none from the point of view of the people who are so particular about contracts.  If they are particular about the sanctity of contracts let them keep their contract with the factory and pay the subsidy as they have contracted to do, but there is no objection whatever to subsidise a very important section of the community to put up a fight against the people from the other side who are putting up an unfair fight.  Deputy Byrne said the other day that in his considered opinion as a lawyer the Government had no power to interfere. I believe they have.  I believe that when two people make a contract both parties are entitled to expect the utmost good faith.  That is, I believe, what they call <i>uberrimae fides.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture made this contract with Messrs. Lippens and has maintained his good faith in the matter by paying the subsidy, even though he sees his own people wrongly treated, that is the utmost good faith on the part of the Government, and Messrs. Lippens should also show the utmost good faith.  We are entitled to get the utmost good faith from them by seeing that they pay <Col N="2033" /> a fair price for the beet.  That is one reason.  There is another reason and that is, that an agreement can be broken if it is unconscionable.  I believe that the Minister, when he was giving us an account of how this contract was made, showed that that agreement was made in an unconscionable way, because it is evident from the way the Minister turned on the financial adviser and called him a liar, and so on, that Messrs. Lippens were too well able for the Minister. Therefore you have an agreement made by one party who is an expert and knows what he is doing and the other party does not know what he is doing, and an agreement can be broken where it is unconscionable.  That is the second reason why it should be broken.</P>
    <P>We on these benches are supporting the motion to have the Estimate referred back.  We would be prepared to vote against the Estimate completely and to have it held up, but we are prepared in the interest of peace and in the hope that a settlement can be made and that the Minister may succeed in bringing the two parties together to vote for Deputy Davin's motion to have the Estimate referred back.  I believe it is up to every member of this House who is interested in the beet growers to see that the Estimate should be referred back in order to show the owners of the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory that they must do something reasonable to get this dispute settled. They will see that members of this House are dissatisfied with the way things are going if they refer the Vote back to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Go settle this dispute before you get more money,&rdquo; but if the House passes this Estimate without referring it back then it would be a vote of confidence in the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory and for the way in which they managed their business not only for the last 4 or 5 years, but this year also in trying to break up the Sugar Beet Growers' Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephHassett" hpid="Mr. Hassett Mr. Hassett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hassett</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said by Deputies on both sides of the House on this Vote that I shall necessarily have to be very brief.  I would begin by paying a tribute to the Government for establishing the <Col N="2034" /> sugar beet factory in this country at a time when there was considerable risk in establishing any industry in the country.  I go further and say that every grower of sugar beet in the County Tipperary&mdash;and I am a beet grower myself&mdash;in the early years, at all events, after the factory was established made a considerable profit out of the transaction.  The Government evidently at the time this factory was about to be established saw that grain was not a paying proposition; that the time was coming when grain growing was going to be a complete fiasco as far as bringing the cost of production into the pockets of the growers was concerned.  It took considerable courage on the part of the Government to establish a factory of the magnitude of the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory.  For the first year we were very well pleased.  We appointed a body known as the Beet Growers' Association to look after our interests and we trusted them to see that we would get a fair deal.  Men of considerable standing in the country were placed at the head of the organisation and any little differences that arose between Messrs. Lippens and these were happily tided over through negotiations.  Latterly it would appear that as a result of the attempt which the factory people made to cut down the price of beet with fifteen and a half per cent. sugar content to 38/- last year it was for us growers of beet all over the country to consider whether or not that was going to be a paying proposition and it was time for the Beet Growers' Association to consider whether Messrs. Lippens, the owners of the factory, were going to give us a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself, who kept in very close touch with both parties, namely, the factory people and the growers, told us in the course of his speech to-day that the sugar beet growers were not getting a fair deal this year.  He said that the factory people were allowing £40,000 for depreciation, that they were paying 10 per cent. on the money invested and he went further and said there is no excuse for what they are attempting to do.  They have over-insured themselves <Col N="2035" /> with regard to the price of pulp and increase of freights and in regard to the price of sugar.  The thing he says can be settled without the compulsory acquisition of the factory.  The farmers did well out of the factory up to this year.  If we have done well out of the factory up to this year we are prepared to carry on.  We are prepared to grow beet if we get a fair do in the time to come.  There was one very hopeful note struck by the Minister and that is that he expects that this thing will be satisfactorily settled before next year's crop will be put down.  I think anything we can do on both sides of the House towards bringing about a satisfactory settlement of the dispute ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I do not like to say anything bitter about the owners of the sugar factory but it is rather galling at a time like this when the Minister was using every possible effort to bring about a peaceful and happy settlement between the parties to the dispute that the owners of the factory should bring some of those people that we trusted in the organisation before the High Courts and should mulct them in costs and continue that threatening attitude up to the present time.  I think a stop ought to be put to that. If negotiations are going on between the Minister on behalf of the Government and the Beet Growers' Association on behalf of the beet growers, and the owners of the factory, then these proceedings of the High Court ought to be stopped.</P>
    <P>What are the demands of the Beet Growers' Association.  These are the demands:&mdash;1.  &ldquo;That the Irish Beet Growers' Association, Ltd., be recognised as the body representing beet growing in the Saorstát, and that all negotiations for and concerning the growing, delivery and fixing of prices with the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company during the subsidy period be carried out through the Beet Growers' Association.&rdquo; Those of us who followed the dispute know that the particular aim of Messrs. Lippens for some time past has been to smash the Beet Growers' Association.  They know that if they can smash that Association of which we are members they would <Col N="2036" /> have the beet growers at their mercy all over the country, that they could deal with them individually and that they would be able to take into consideration the bad economic position of the farmers all over the country and that they could get down-and-out farmers all over the country&mdash;blacklegs all over the country&mdash;to grow beet at the price that is not economic.  To do that they offered several sums to individual farmers, I might say, in the nature of bribes.  The condition of agriculture is bad to-day and has been for the last few years.  Now these people come along and say we will give you seed; we will trust you to pay us back when the crop is grown.</P>
    <P>We will give you the manure so as to give you an opportunity for putting the seed into the soil.  The factory owners do that at a time when farmers find it impossible to get seed and manures from local merchants and elsewhere, and consequently farmers of that type&mdash;farmers who are down and out&mdash;are glad of the opportunity to get something to put into the soil, even though they know eventually that it will not be a paying proposition.  Now the second demand put forward on behalf of the beet grower is &ldquo;that when a mutual agreement cannot be arrived at each party shall agree to submit the point in dispute to an arbitration board consisting of a representative of each party and a referee mutually agreed to, or, alternatively, appointed by the Government, both parties being bound by the decision of the Board.&rdquo; There is nothing very drastic in that demand of the Beet Growers' Association.  There is nothing in that that the factory ought not to accept if they have a fair and a clear case.  I assume that any arbitration board would act fairly as between the beet growers and the company, and that they would act as far as possible on the lines of doing justice as between the company and the growers.  The next suggestion was alternative &ldquo;that the factory be compulsorily or otherwise acquired by purchase and to be run on co-operative lines.&rdquo; If no settlement can be come to-I have discussed this matter with representatives of the beet growers themselves&mdash;then we are prepared to take over the factory and <Col N="2037" /> to work it on co-operative lines.  After all, why should we not?  It may be said that when the £400,000 capital necessary to be found for the factory was being looked for the farmers got an opportunity of contributing and that we had no confidence in the undertaking. Well, to begin with, at the time we knew nothing about the business; it was too big for us; we were not able to rise to the occasion; we had no training in beet growing, but we did our share, and we did everything we were asked to do once a company was formed.  We produced sugar beet of a type that was second to none. We produced more per acre than the people of Belgium, than the people of Czecho-Slovakia, or the people of England or anywhere else where sugar beet has been grown as successfully as with us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this question much longer, but I think it would be the wrong time to import any great heat into the matter.  Some of us feel very strongly upon the matter, and some of us feel that as growers unfortunately we were badly treated and some of us feel that our Association was badly treated.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Executive Council to continue their negotiations, and to do everything possible to bring about an amicable settlement as between the factory and the growers, and to remove any undue obstacles that may be in the way.  If the owners of the factory still persist in the unreasonable attitude that they have taken up in the past, some of us will find it very difficult to come in here and to support a subsidy for them this time twelve months if the matter is not satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the circumstances already exist which Deputy Hassett said if they existed at some future time would compel them to oppose the Government.  I think the time has already arrived.  The beet factory, before the time for sowing, definitely turned down the beet growers' demands. At the very last minute they again turned them down.  Now, a couple of months after the beet should be sown, they are still holding to the same position.  The fact of the matter is that the factory have flouted the beet growers, and have gone so far that the <Col N="2038" /> Minister for Agriculture, who usually backs them up, says there is no excuse for what they did this year.  On figures, he said, the factory put themselves in the wrong.  Again, he said if the factory wanted to see the equities the matter could have been settled this year.  Surely there is a situation in which Deputy Hassett, if he has any manliness in him, should come forward and definitely vote against the factory.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan clearly stated that a vote for giving a subsidy to the factory this year was a vote of confidence and support in fact and in deed to the factory for what they have done to the farmers, and Deputy Hassett cannot get round that by any threat of what he will do in the future.  He has the opportunity of doing it now, and we would like to see what he is going to do.  I wish Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies would really act up to what they think in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that a large number of the members of Cumann na nGaedheal do not approve of the methods of the Government towards the Beet Growers' Association.  The members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, no more than ourselves, have not the real figure.  We are given one set of figures by the Government at one time, and within half an hour we get a completely different set of figures, just as in 1928 the Minister for Agriculture, in the course of the debate, stated at one time that the factory was getting 3/6 per ton more than similar factories in England. Later the President stated that the factory here was only getting 2/- per ton more than the factory in England, while last Friday the Minister for Agriculture stated that over a ten years' period a factory in England would get £400,000 more than the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory, thus completely reversing the figures given three years ago.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies must know perfectly well that they cannot trust the Government. The Minister for Agriculture stated to-day that the factory here was not getting as good terms as a similar factory in England.  I wonder if anyone can believe that.  He forgot he had said that because he said that in <Col N="2039" /> England they invited factories.  If this factory was invited to England, and if those who are running it could make more money there, why did they come here?  Did they come here because they love us, because they love President Cosgrave, because he has fair hair, or because they love Deputy Hassett's blue eyes?  The fact of the matter is, as any man with ordinary commonsense can see, a factory which was at liberty to go to England came here because it was thought that more money could be made here.  That bears out what the Minister for Agriculture stated three years ago, that the factory here would make £400,000, or, as the President said, £300,000 more than it would make if it went to England.  I think the commonsense deduction is that the factory came here because it would make more money.  The British factory decided to forgo profits and reserves this year in order to give a better price to the farmers than would ordinarily be given.  I think it is up to any Deputy who wants to support the Irish farmers to see that they get a fair show, and to support us by not voting the subsidy until the whole position can be examined.  The Minister says, &ldquo; Hands off the foreigner; we must keep contracts.&rdquo; Surely the contract with the Irish people, that Irish farmers were to get a fair price, should be kept by the Government.  I hope Deputy Hassett and others will, when a division is being taken, show by their votes on the motion to refer back the question of giving the subsidy, that they are not going to stand the nonsense of the Carlow Sugar Beet people any longer.  If there is any dispute between foreign capitalists and the Irish people let them show that it is the interests of the Irish people they will plump for when they are fighting for their rights.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate, but I have certain points of view that I wish to express. I might shorten my statement by saying that, having listened to what the Minister for Agriculture said, I am very largely in agreement with the opinions he expressed.  There are certain aspects, however, of his statement <Col N="2040" /> with which I do not quite agree, and that I intend to explain.  I listened to Deputy Ryan, the shadow Minister for Agriculture in the Fianna Fáil Party, expounding the theories and doctrines of his Party in regard to the sugar subsidy, and I could not help thinking that the Deputy must have almost forgotten that he was speaking in the Dáil and thought he was still speaking in County Kildare.  I am sure Deputy Ryan was not unaware of the fact that certain prominent members of the Beet Growers' Association were listening to him, and that he had in the back of his mind the possibility, if not the probability, that next week the &ldquo;Wexford People&rdquo; or some other Wexford newspaper would have a full report of his speech, and that the farmers and the beet growers would know what a champion they have in Deputy Ryan. The beet growers in Wexford may remember however that when the subsidy was passed by the Dáil, and when the scheme was hammered out, we had not the advantage of the presence here of Deputy Ryan and his colleagues.  Perhaps they may say that if they had been here we would have had a better scheme.  However, we had not that inestimable advantage, and we had to work out the scheme as best we could, without their help.  I have been very silent on this question, and I did not mention it in any speeches I made in the famous Kildare election.  I claim however that I have a better right to speak on behalf of the beet growers' and their association than Deputy Ryan or than any Deputies on the other side.  I think it cannot be refuted that the idea of having a beet growers' association here in Ireland originated in the first instance with me.  When the scheme was originally passed I went on my own initiative and, incidentally, at my own expense, to England to acquaint myself with the working of similar concerns there.  I visited one important factory and got into touch with the Beet Growers' Association formed there. When I returned I got into touch with people here in the Association to which I belong.  I told them that it was essential that a beet growers' association should be formed in the interests of the growers.  I believe it was on my <Col N="2041" /> initiative that the General Secretary of the Farmers' Union got to work and called a meeting and, as well as I remember, Deputy Gorey was elected the first chairman.  Credit should be given to the Farmers' Union and to Deputy Gorey for the action he took on that occasion, because then, as now, we were a political organisation, and having started the Association we thought it inadvisable that an organisation political in character should continue to organise an association of beet growers which we believed should be non-political.  Deputy Gorey generously withdrew and allowed a non-political chairman to be elected.  That is my justification for speaking for the beet growers and for their association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the problem with which we are dealing, and which we are trying to solve, I think that everyone who wants to solve it is entitled to get the facts and the figures available so as to try to discover who is at fault, the factory or the Beet Growers' Association. The figures made available yearly in the balance sheet are not sufficient to let us examine in detail the working of the Company so as to arrive at a conclusion whether the price offered is the highest that could be economically offered.  We have fortunately available this year certain figures issued not by the Beet Growers' Association but by the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company in defence of the claim that they could only pay 38/- a ton.  After examining these figures I am convinced that those who are running the sugar factory are convicted out of their own mouths in not offering a better price.  I understand the figures were made available first to the Department of Agriculture and communicated by them to the Beet Growers' Association so that they are not confidential.  The Minister for Agriculture dealt with them to-day showing that the offer of 38/- a ton was not as good an offer as the factory could make in the circumstances. If that is so we have them convicted out of their own mouth that they have not done as much as they should.  The figures given are comparative figures between the working of the factory in the year 1929-30 <Col N="2042" /> and the probable effect of working it in 1931-32.  Allowing for the various changes that have taken place in the situation, allowing for an advantage of 8/- per ton to the factory in view of the lower price offered for beet, from 46/- to 38/-, allowing on the other hand for the increased subsidy, for the fall in the price of sugar and pulp, the fall in the rate of interest on the reserves that the factory draws, and various other factors, they show that there is £44,800 available for distribution as dividends, a sun that is capable of paying approximately 11 per cent.  For instance £20,000 will pay a dividend of 5 per cent. on the company's capital.  I want to show that there is a simple way of dealing with the figures in order to show that the factory could pay a higher rate.  There is a mistake of fact in the figures as they have been issued, and I think that mistake has been accepted by the factory.</P>
    <P>There is a mistake of £4,000 in regard to the quantity of sugar manufactured. The factory only estimated on 150,000 tons of sugar beet being handled, whereas they dealt with 160,000 tons.  That leaves £48,800 available for distribution.  The figures also allow £45,000 for depreciation. That would be sufficient to depreciate the full cost of the factory in nine years, whereas in former years the balance sheet only allowed for depreciation at the rate of £40,000.  I see no reason why the factory should increase the rate of depreciation this year.  I think the rate of depreciation that existed was more than sufficient. Taking the additional £4,000 that is available for dividends, due to the mistake in the figures supplied, and the £5,000 in the rate of depreciation, we have £54,000 available for the payment of dividends.  Examining these figures we get some idea of what the factory could pay.  We take it that the factory has paid 15 per cent. dividends which is an unduly high rate in a year of unprecedented economic depression. We think the shareholders could get along nicely with a dividend of 10 per cent. which would leave a surplus of £14,000 available for distribution amongst the beet growers. That £14,000 would allow an extra <Col N="2043" /> 1/9 to the 38/- a ton which the beet growers were to get.</P>
    <P>If, however, we say that 10 per cent. is too high the amount for distribution will be correspondingly higher.  It might reasonably be put forward that in this exceptional year when there is general depression and when the farming community are particularly depressed, when the farmers who are getting 38s. per ton are probably receiving a price below the cost of production, we might say that 5 per cent. is a sufficient dividend for the factory. That makes available an amount which will allow for a payment of over 4s. per ton extra.  Allowing the factory to pay a dividend of 5 per cent., they would be able to pay 4s. per ton extra to the beet growers.  The figures with which I have dealt have not taken into account various other items which could be questioned and challenged and which would not bear very close investigation. For instance there has been, as the Minister stated, an estimate of the reduction in the price to be obtained for sugar pulp.  With the estimate of the factory for the increased loss on the sale of sugar pulp, the Beet Growers' Association or those speaking for them do not agree.  I think that the estimate of the Beet Growers' Association is as likely to be right as is the estimate of the factory.  That is, the factory have allowed too great an amount for the fall in the price of sugar pulp.</P>
    <P>There is another item which can be questioned.  That is the interest that is credited in the balance sheet on the amount shown as reserves.  The interest credited for the year 1931 on this amount has been considerably reduced. I cannot give the exact figures as I have not them before me at the moment, but the amount shown as bank interest was lower than in the previous years.  It seems to me that the question of allowing interest on the reserves of the company at bank rate is an item on the balance sheet which might reasonably be questioned.  The balance sheet shows a very large reserve and a very large amount for depreciation. Are we to understand that that is drawing interest at the ordinary bank rates?  It seems to me that, <Col N="2044" /> allowing for a sufficient amount of cash to be used as working capital, it is not unreasonable to expect that the balance of the reserve might have been employed in some such way, which, instead of showing a decrease in the amount of interest, might reasonably show an increase.  Taking the figures supplied by the factory itself it can be shown that, at the lowest estimate, they could pay 1/9 per ton extra to the beet growers even after allowing for dividends, while, if they forgo their dividends for this year and allow for interest on reserves and the various figures which I have quoted, they might pay anything up to 6/9 per ton extra.  This figure of 6/9 is based on the idea that the factory, allowing for the general depression, would not pay any interest to the shareholders.  I do not say that that is a thing we ought to demand or expect from the factory, but we ought to bear in mind that the factories in England&mdash;certain of the factories, not all of them, the Anglo-Dutch Corporation I believe&mdash;made the offer; I cannot say whether there was an agreement finally entered into&mdash;to manufacture sugar beet into sugar on a scale that would allow them nothing for profits, nothing for depreciation, or nothing to go to reserves.</P>
    <P>The circumstances are somewhat different here, as has been pointed out by the Minister, but in view of the fact that the English factories were prepared to do that, and taking into account the unprecedented depression and the fact that a very great sacrifice is being asked of the farmer, it would not be unreasonable to ask, and we should certainly emphasise the fact, that the factory should be prepared to suffer some loss, that it should not throw all the losses on the grower, and that the company should be prepared to make some sacrifice, that they should be prepared to make a sacrifice in some way on a level with the sacrifices which the growers of beet are called upon to make.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with that aspect, I have to my mind satisfied myself&mdash;I am speaking purely for myself and the small Party which I represent at the moment&mdash;that the factory can in the circumstances which exist this year, reasonably be expected to make a more generous offer than the offer <Col N="2045" /> which they have made.  Undoubtedly the aggrieved party is the Sugar Beet Growers' Association.  One must approach it from the point of view of what may be done.  I have been listening to the Labour Party whose views were expounded by Deputy Davin, and to the Fianna Fáil Party, for any constructive suggestions of what might be done, and I have not heard a single constructive suggestion which does not involve in some form or another, breaking the contract.  I listened to Deputy de Valera, and I heard him say that the Government ought to stand by their own people against, I think the word he used was, outsiders.  The Government were asked to take a stand against outsiders. It so happens, in this case, that the factory's representatives are to a large extent outsiders, and the money which is invested in the factory is the money of foreigners, but all the money invested is not the money of foreigners, and all the directors are not foreign directors.  Here is the point which I want to make.  It is merely an accident, due to the circumstances which existed at the time, that the factory people are foreigners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of unfairness does not arise at the moment. The suggestion is that we are told that our Government ought to get behind the people, our own people as against outsiders, against foreigners, to stand for our own nationals as against foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, as I said, a mere accident of circumstances that these people are foreigners.  I have no doubt that if the technical skill, and if the money were available at the time here, the Government would have been glad to make a contract with the nationals of our own country, rather than with foreigners. I heard Deputies of the Fianna Fail Party speaking on this Vote in former years, and I heard Deputy Flinn on that occasion complaining that the Government did not take sufficient steps to ensure that Irish capital was <Col N="2046" /> put into the undertaking.  It so happens that the factory is largely owned by foreigners, Messrs. Lippens and the other people associated with them, but it might equally happen that the factory might be owned by, say, Messrs. Flinn, Dowdall and O'Shaughnessy. If that did happen to be the case, would we be asked to take up the cudgels for our own people against a hypothetical corporation of hypothetical Irishmen&mdash; Flinn, O'Shaughnessy, Dowdall and Company?  The situation would be just the same, and here we have this appeal to the prejudices of the people when we are told that the Government should stand for their own people against foreigners.</P>
    <P>To my mind the question whether the factory is owned by foreigners or not does not arise.  The question is that a contract was made.  We are asked to take steps to repudiate that contract.  We are asked to introduce an element into the situation which did not exist when the contract was made.  The scheme might not have been all it should have been.  The contract might not have been as tight with the factory as it ought to have been, but it was the best we could work out then.  I am certain that, if suggestions of this kind were made to the factory people, that if we did introduce an additional clause into their contract, a clause for compulsory arbitration, or a clause that in certain circumstances the Government would have the right to buy the factory at their own price, the people who entered into that contract would either refuse to enter into it, or if they did enter into it would demand a much higher subsidy.  It is no use playing round the question and suggesting that there would not be repudiation of our obligations, that the sacredness of the contract was not at stake.  There is the question, as Deputy de Valera puts it, of fairness.  There is no use in playing around these aspects of it, because we cannot introduce elements into the contract which were not in it at the beginning.  Who is to judge of fairness?  Are the growers or are we to be judges of fairness?  If the working of a contract is not supposed to be fair, are we always supposed to violate the contract?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> I, at least, am not surprised that suggestions of that sort come from Fianna Fáil, because, as far as I can gather, their whole policy is based on a repudiation of contracts.  A contract is not to be kept unless it suits one party! Every contract that is made, no matter how small or big, even if it is only a question of buying a horse at a fair, can therefore be broken because one party is not quite pleased with the contract. One could very easily heeltap a contract in that way and say &ldquo;That does not suit me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I did not get fair play.&rdquo; It is easy to stress it from that point of view.  I do not believe in repudiating contracts.  I have been pressed very hard by the growers, and I represent a county in which a good deal of beet is grown.  I have been told by the growers and their representatives that it would be an unsatisfactory thing for me if I supported this Vote, and if I did not vote against it. I am perfectly aware of that.  It will not be a popular thing for me with certain people because they do not fully understand the situation.  I believe that in the interests of the country, and even in the interests of the farmers themselves, the best service we can do to the country is to say that we will stand by the contract which we have made, because if we break one contract to-day there is no reason why we should not break another to-morrow.</P>
    <P>We have already gone out in the international market to borrow money to finance farm developments such as the Agriculturel Credit Corporation, which provides money for farmers. We are getting that money at about 4½ per cent.  If we proceed to violate a contract is there any guarantee that we will get that money in future?  If we violate a contract we will not be helping the farmers but working against their interest.  If we were to do what we are told by some Deputies &ldquo;to stand by our own people&rdquo; we would not in the end be standing by the farmers but in reality working against them.  I supported the subsidy for this factory with some reluctance mainly because it was an experiment in industrial production on a large scale in this country.  It was also an experiment <Col N="2048" /> which would help agriculture.  I am sorry to say that the developments which have taken place have not improved my views on the question of subsidies.  We have the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party saying that we should subsidise the production of sugar to meet the requirements of the country.  To my mind it is an extraordinary thing that such a policy should be seriously propounded in the Dáil.  At present for a subsidy of £3,000,000 we are producing about one-sixth of our sugar requirements.  If we are to produce our total sugar requirements under similar conditions it will mean an expenditure of nearly £18,000,000. There would also be a wheat subsidy of £4,000,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Where is this money to come from? That is the mystery to me.  It means to a large extent that the non-beet growing farmers would be paying the beet growing farmers the subsidy which they are getting.  I was more than pleased when I heard the Minister's statement to-day because all my sympathies are with the growers.  I believe they have the right in this quarrel and I believe that any support that we can give them within the terms of the contract ought to be given to them.  The Minister was not specific in his statement as to what would be done.  Probably he was wise.  It seems to me that there are considerations which must affect this factory besides the actual contract.  Public opinion must affect the factory and it is dead against it.  It cannot hope to go on producing in this country with public opinion up against it.  I do not think that there is anybody in support of the offer which the factory made and it is not going to be a paying proposition for that factory to go on producing for the next three years or if it intends to go on producing after the present contract expires.</P>
    <P>Other questions must and will arise if the factory are prepared to go on; they must keep in touch with the Government on other questions as time goes on.  The Government I think ought to make it clear to the factory people and we as Deputies speaking on behalf of the Government ought to make it clear that inside the terms of that contract if there is anything the Government can do to help <Col N="2049" /> the beet growers they will do it.  There has been a great deal of capital made out of this question of the difference in the amount of the subsidy paid to the English factories as compared with the subsidy paid to the Irish factory.  We have the Minister's figures that the total amount of the subsidy is less than the amount paid to similar English factories. That is contradicted by Deputy Ryan.  But they can be examined and I am certain the Minister's figures will bear the closest examination, but that does not now arise.  It is not of vital importance whether a bargain could have been made for a less amount or not.  The only matter of vital importance is the question of the sacredness of the contract.  If we refuse to give our vote for the Estimate we will be violating a contract made by the State. We will be besmirching our national honour.  I am not prepared to stand over that, however popular it may be with the beet growers and farmers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We wondered when we heard the argument put up by Deputy Hassett and Deputy Heffernan what they intended doing on this Vote. We heard complaints here on Friday last and again to-day about outsiders interfering and the damage that they were doing.  But the damage will be done here in this Dáil this evening if this Dáil passes £162,500 for those very clever gentlemen who having got the best end of the stick are now using it against the farming community. If they are going to get £162,500 out of the farmers' own pockets they can certainly carry on.  That big stick that the late leader of the Farmers' Party brought forward&mdash;public opinion&mdash;bears very lightly on a man who has got £162,500 of the people's money in his pocket.  I think Deputy Heffernan, the Parliamentary Secretary, is a very good example of that because the public opinion of the farmers of the country was borne very lightly by Deputy Heffernan in the last four years.  That to my mind is the straight question that Deputies have to ask themselves.  If they pass £162,500 for the Belgians then once and for all they are preventing any <Col N="2050" /> settlement and it is no use saying that we hope for negotiations.  The negotiations are finished once those gentlemen get the cash in their pockets.</P>
      <P>We heard any amount of different assurances down in Kildare at the election time as to the negotiations that were going on and how the whole thing was going to be settled.  A very striking instance of how the whole thing is being settled was reported last week in the High Court.  That is the manner in which the Belgians are going to settle it.  Yet we had Deputy Heffernan claiming credit for the great bargain that was made.  He helped, he said, to put an industry going on a guaranteed subsidy for ten years.  This whole beet growing was in the nature of an experiment.  One would think that when you were starting an experiment that you would at least protect everybody concerned, especially when the money is coming out of the people's pockets.  But what happened?  The Belgian is protected for ten years and the farmer for three.  That is the bargain.  That is the arrangement that was made. The farming community who, after all, should be our first care, were protected for three years while the Belgian gets protection for ten and then we are told that we cannot interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen here Bills brought in to subsidise men who were fined in the courts.  Special legislation was brought in to pay their fines.  Money was passed to pay the fines of men who were convicted of assault, but we cannot find any means of bringing in legislation to protect the farming community.  I wonder why some retrospective legislation would not be brought in to deal with this case.  I think it is a case that would need it.  We had Deputy Hassett bewailing the fact that there was a good price for grain in 1924.  The prices for grain and barley were going down, but we in Cork had to put up with a bad price for grain ever since and we got no protection.  Now, apparently, the price for beet is going to go down, and the farmers who cannot grow beet at the price that is being offered are asked to pay £162,500 to the <Col N="2051" /> Belgians for the pleasure of looking at the factory rusting in Carlow.  Surely there is only one remedy.  We have any amount of sympathy with the foreigners.  You must be a foreigner to get anything in this country.  You need only go to Copenhagen to-day.  There we have, representing the Department of Agriculture, two Englishmen and a Dane at the World's Dairy Congress.</P>

He claims credit for taking £3,000,000 but it is a very bad thing if we suggest doing it. This intellectual gentleman also claims credit for the Landlord's Land Bill of 1923, that increased the rent of farmers ten per cent. and fifteen per cent. down the country.

      <P>When we heard the claims put forward to-day by those who had some responsibility for forming the Association which is now before the High Court, we expected to hear some suggestion from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is the great leader of the Farmers' Party and who, if he had been here instead of being out in France in 1918, I am sure would have put Dan Breen in the shade.  We were waiting to hear some suggestion from him as to what was going to be done to remedy the thing. A bargain is a bargain, we were told. If we are going to be held to all the so-called bargains that have been made since 1922, if the unfortunate farmers of this country are going to be held to the bargain which the so-called Farmers' Party made for them, I do not know where we are going to be.  They made a very good bargain for themselves but a very bad bargain for those they pretended to represent.  The less said about these bargains the better. If the President is in earnest in suggesting that he is going to do something to relieve this position let him bring in some legislation to take portion at least of this £162,500 and guarantee a price to the farmers for their produce.  The least the farmer may expect is a fair price for what he grows, if the Belgian is to get £162,500. If necessary, I say, take over this concern altogether from them.  Pay them off and take it over.  We need not be afraid that we are going to interfere with industries started here.  As far as industries started here are concerned they are all on a lop-sided basis, as far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comments were made here by the Minister for Agriculture about protecting prices and everything else. If instead of the policy which has been pursued here by the Executive Council, the policy of putting on tariffs not for the purpose of helping industry but with the two eyes fixed <Col N="2053" /> keenly to see how much could be got out of the tariff for revenue purposes, if instead of that they put on a prohibitive tariff and saw that there was no profiteering carried on in the tariffed article it would be more in their line and better for the country. The Government should see that the farmers would get a proper price for their beet and also see that no profiteering is permitted on the part of the Belgians.  In that way the farmers would be protected in their business. The farmer surely has as much claim as any Belgian.  If the Government were a proper Government they would say that their first duty is to the farmer, and they would say &ldquo;we will look after our own first.&rdquo; I only hope that an early General Election will rid us of one eye-sore in this House, the Deputy who is misrepresenting the so-called Farmers' Party.</P>

I have been very credibly informed that the present executive of the Beet Growers' Association are not representative of the main body of the beet growers at all.  I understand there are 16,000 beet growers in the country, four-fifths of them growing from one to four acres, some of them only 1 acre and I understand that the gentlemen of the executive of the Beet Growers' Association are large farmers and are not in reality entitled to speak for the beet growers at all.

      <P>&mdash;and got the figures he would find that that statement of his could not possibly be substantiated. Now I have the figures here, and the figures for 1926-27 show that in England the subsidy was 26/9 as against 24/6 in the Free State.  In 1927-28 the Irish subsidy was 24/6, and there was paid to the English factory 26/9.  In 1928 the English subsidy was 26/9 also, and the Irish subsidy 24/6.  If you come to 1929-30 you find that the Irish subsidy is 22/6, and in England it is 20/10.  If we go further and analyse the figures we find that the subsidy paid in 1929-30, that this subsidy of 22/6 only amounted, taking the average on the whole production of sugar, to 16/11, as against the figure of 20/10 paid in England.  One would have thought that a man in the position of Deputy Ryan, who could have got those figures so easily, would have taken the trouble to get the correct figures.</P>

I notice here that when a Deputy has anything to say by way of refutation of figures, that in some parts of the House it is thought well to get over his case, and to get rid of him and his facts by interruption.  If Deputy Ryan thinks that interruptions will serve his case he is welcome to these interruptions. In the course of this debate not a single word has been said in favour of the beet sugar factory, or of the men who established it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been heard, but not quite finished, and I am entitled to refer to it, and to refer to the common knowledge.  I am also entitled to refer to the fact that there was a seizure at Durrow of the beet by armed men.  I want now to ask the Opposition were these proper tactics for dealing with a new industry which has just been started in this country?  If we would wish to have any sympathy in the matter of the difficulties that exist between the beet growers and the factory we should be more careful not to say anything that would increase these difficulties with which the Government are faced at present in this matter.  I have listened in this House since 1927 to pleas made by all sections in this House for the development of industry. Yet here we have a new industry established, of which we should all <Col N="2056" /> be proud, and what do we find here? The position is, that Deputies on every side of the House, even here on the Government side, and especially Deputies on the Opposition side, join in the attempt to tear it to pieces. We have them wanting to tear to pieces an industry of which we should all be proud.  If you want the elimination of this industry, or the destruction of this industry the tactics of those Deputies are the things that will bring that about.</P>
      <P>What is the only criticism levelled against the industry and levelled against the success which the industry has obtained in a short time?  I have listened here to farmers asking to take over this beet sugar undertaking as a co-operative concern, and I asked myself what is to happen to the beet sugar subsidy?  If it were to be handed over to the farmers we all know what would happen to it&mdash;what happened to the co-operative societies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is asked to find the sum of £162,500 by way of a subsidy.  I wonder if we were now in a position similar to the position in England in the case of the beet sugar factories there what criticism would be levelled in this House?  I see here that the main criticism against this factory is that it has been worked successfully from the beginning.  We have been asked to repudiate the contract with the great firm that invested £400,000, but the men in Ireland who had money in their pockets were afraid to put a single £1 in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Who asked them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>They were asked time and again.  When the repudiation was suggested Deputy Ryan was present. If we repudiate this contract I wonder what would be the position as regards the development of industry in the future in this country?  What foreign capital will come in?  What Ford or Lever will come in to invest money in this State if this State does not stand for the sanctity of contracts?  This Vote concerns the credit of the State. <Col N="2057" /> We have heard a good deal about the doctrine of repudiation.  We have heard about the repudiation of the National Loan; then we had talk of the repudiation of land annuities, and now members opposite want repudiation of the sugar beet contract.  I say here and now that repudiation means non-progress and annihilation of the credit of the State.  What would be the position here if the beet sugar factory were in the same position financially as similar factories in England?  Do the Deputies know what happened there? Do any of the Deputies know of the state of affairs in the beet sugar factories in England?  If we had the same position here what criticism would come from the opposite side of the House?  What criticism would be levelled at the Minister if the position existed here that existed across the Channel?  Anybody who knows about the beet industry in England knows that in the case of a factory set up at Norwich there was a capital loss of £350,000.  And yet Deputy Ryan stands up here and tells us that the subsidy here is costing us £100,000 more than the subsidy to a similar factory in England.</P>
      <P>Why did not the Deputy consider the loss with which the English factories are being faced?  Would not that have been a reasonable thing to consider? The Deputy should have looked up the facts connected with the initial stages of the industry in England.  I wonder in such a case would Deputy Ryan think that the subsidy that we have paid was a dead loss to the State.  Not only had the English growers had this experience in Norwich but they had similar experience in other parts of the country.  A sum of £400,000 was invested in Carlow, and in a similar industry in England every penny of their investment was lost.  We have heard talk here about a couple of million pounds for the setting up of this industry which is a huge success, and it is criticised because it is a success.  As much as thirty million pounds has been given in eight or nine years as a subsidy in England by the State in addition to the capital losses there in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It only shows that the industry must be a valuable industry when the people there are prepared to make those sacrifices.  If we had any appreciation of the value we would not hesitate to make the sacrifice of voting this £162,500.  Deputy Ryan gets up and says that this factory is costing us £100,000 more than the subsidy given to a similar factory in England.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement, whether made in ignorance or with deliberation, was as untrue a statement as was ever made in this House.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Heffernan say that the establishment of factories in this country to deal with all the domestic needs of the State would involve an expenditure of £18,000,000.  A more absurd statement could not be made. When one examines the question of subsidy and deals with the intricate question of protection, one has got to look at the ramifications of that question&mdash;its gains and losses.  If anyone who stands for industrial development in this State says that this expenditure of £162,000 is a bad bargain by the Minister for Agriculture for industrial development here, the only thing I can say in reply is that he does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if I might examine the reactions of this particular subsidy upon the beet sugar industry here. It is easy to say that we are paying out £162,000 of the taxpayers' money. We should also ask, what is the taxpayer getting in return for the £162,000?  Is it a good bargain or a bad bargain for the State?  The Minister said that it was one of the best bargains made by this country. I unhesitatingly say, with some knowledge of the ramifications of protection, that a better bargain could not possibly be made under the conditions existing when that bargain was made.  I do not want to refer to the Civil War, but we all know that <Col N="2059" /> the industry was set up in the midst of a civil war and that those people had the courage to come in and invest £400,000 when the factory might never have been permitted to work and the machinery might have been destroyed.  Deputy Ryan has never examined what the reactions of this £162,000 amount to.</P>
    <P>The great dilemma I find myself in when listening to a debate here on protection, is that those who speak upon the subject of protection know very little about it.  The Labour Party appear very reluctant, but both the great Parties in this House have committed themselves to a policy of protection.  Let me examine for a moment what that policy means in connection with this Vote of £162,000. Is it in the national interests that we should pay this subsidy, or is it in the national interests that we should withhold the money?  If the Dáil does not vote this money it means that that £162,000 will not be forthcoming and that we stand as repudiating a contract entered into with this factory. Is the payment of this £162,000 in the interest of the State?  I challenge contradiction when I say that it is the best bargain that this House has ever voted money for.  What does it mean? It means a reduction of £22,000 or £23,000 in the import of sugar into this country which amounts to something like £460,000.  It means £40,000 in wages paid by the factory to workers.  Yet, Deputy Davin wants to destroy an industry that pays wages amounting to the huge sum of £40,000 per year.  It means that there is something like £60,000 odd paid in freights to the Irish railways.</P>
    <P>In boxes and cloths manufactured by Irish manufacturers, mainly at Clara, it means something like £13,800, and in limestone and by-products, £3,600.  The grand total amounts to £595,000 in annual circulation in this country.  Does any business man realise, in a country with such a restricted circulation as we have, what the annual circulation of £595,000 means not alone to farmers, but to business men and every other section of the community?  We are asked by the official Opposition not to <Col N="2060" /> pass the Vote because the factory has refused to permit the beet growers to dictate the price it shall pay for the raw material.  Does any business man realise what that proposition means? Does any business man think that an industry could be carried on if the producers of the raw material were to dictate the price that should be paid for the raw material?  Could anybody visualise that it would be possible to carry on any industry under conditions of that kind?  Another wild statement has been made by Deputy Derrig, who stated that compulsion had been applied to the British factories.  There is not a single word of truth in that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not one word of truth in it.  What happened?  An offer of 35s. was made by the English beet factories to the English growers and the beet growers said they could not produce beet at 35s.  An examination of the books of the factories revealed that they could not pay a higher price than 35s.  Then the British Government got both parties to meet and agreed to give a further subsidy of 1s. 3d. provided that subsidy went directly to the growers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>This debate has at least done one thing, it has cleared the air and let us know where we stand.  It will enable us to sift the wheat from the chaff, and I think that when the chaff is sifted from the arguments of the official Opposition there will be very little wheat left.  If the English beet factories could only pay on an examination of their books, 35/-, what justification is there for the assumption that has been made in this House, without the production of a single fact <Col N="2061" /> to support it, that the Irish factory could pay 41/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is getting £100,000 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the fairest possible statement of the case that could be made.  He said he considered the factory did not act fairly towards the farmer.  That is the summing up of the whole case.  When I hear Deputies lay down 41/- or 42/- as the price that the factory should pay for beet, I say they know nothing about the subject.  I should like to ask one question of the farming interests in this House.  If the English farmer, who is under much higher working expenses, who does not own his land, and whose overhead costs are much higher than those of the Irish farmer, could produce beet this year for 35/- surely the Irish farmer should have been able to do likewise for one year until the factory has got over the tremendous slump in the price of sugar.  I have never heard one single word addressed by the official Opposition to the fall in the price of sugar.  What is the controlling factor in the whole situation? The price of sugar.  The price of sugar controls the factory and controls the beet growers.  If the growers want to close their eyes to the existence of a salient, preponderating economic fact of that nature, it is only fair and reasonable that that fallacy should be exposed.  I am one of those who honestly believe that the best day's business this Dáil could do would be to set up the four other factories which this country requires for the production of the industrial and domestic sugar needs of this State.  I am one of those who believe that the Minister has made a good bargain.  I am one of those who agreed with the Minister when he said&mdash;Deputy Ryan endeavoured to misrepresent the meaning of his words&mdash;that the State could not afford to set up four other factories upon the same terms that this particular factory, in its experimental stage, had been set up.  I represent people who are contributors to this £162,000 and who do not get one single penny directly in return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected nothing but a silly question like that from Deputy Ryan.  We are not going to grow beet on the streets of Dublin.  I urge the Minister for Agriculture to hold fast to the conviction he holds that he has made a good bargain for the State, and I would ask him not to be discouraged in the setting up of further factories in the State.  If the few big men who have control of the Beet Growers' Association are at present in power, they will not be always in power, and the small beet growers will have an opportunity of voicing their rights and their privileges.  The whole acid test of the efficiency of this industry, to anybody who knows anything about it is easily ascertained.  The farmers here allege that they have a very great grievance, that they have received unfair and inequitable treatment at the hands of the Government.  They allege that the prices paid for beet are inequitable, and that the prices are under the cost of production.  I do not want to say one hurtful word about the great industry of agriculture. I know the value of that industry to the State, and I realise that if the industry goes down, the State goes down with it.  But there are limits to the ability of the taxpayers to pay and there must be also limits to the demands which the beet growers and the farmers make upon the remaining taxpayers.  This is a highly competitive industry, and it cannot exist in any country without a subsidy. Although I have seen statements in the official organ of Fianna Fáil that at the end of a certain period the subsidy must cease, I unhesitatingly state that this industry cannot exist without a subsidy, and I say that the £162,000, as I have proved from the figures I have quoted, is well spent money in the interests of the State. What is the price paid for beet in other countries?  Can Deputy Ryan answer that?</P>

I think that in the interests of the State Deputy Ryan should avail himself of the benefit of the information with which I am in a position to <Col N="2064" /> supply him.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that as well as I do.  They have 170 factories in Czecho Slovakia and we have only one here.  As I have said the true test of the efficiency or inefficiency in this country can be found out by asking oneself one question: What price has the consumer to pay?  The Irish consumer has to pay 3d.  In Czecho Slovakia he has to pay 6d.  Yet in Czecho Slovakia they can dump surplus sugar f.o.b. at Hamburg at 7s. 9d. The fact of the matter is that Deputy Ryan and his colleagues know nothing about it.  If I compared what our Government has done for the Irish farmers and what is being done by the Government of the greatest sugar producing country in Europe I find that in the year 1929&mdash;the latest figures available&mdash; the price paid in Czecho Slovakia for beet per ton was 22s. 6d., the price of sugar was 38s. and the subsidy 17s.  In the Saorstát the price was 51s. for beet, for sugar 21s. 6d. and the subsidy was 22s. in 1929.  But in 1929 the Irish output was 20,500 odd tons and only 10,000 tons received the 22s. subsidy so that the subsidy in fact worked out the average to about 17s.  Yet Deputy Ryan and Deputy Davin think that this is a scandalous bargain entered into by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Figures are terribly stubborn things, especially for Deputy Davin who never goes to the trouble of inquiring into them.  All that he is concerned with is making an attack on the Government and the factory they have established so successfully in the country.  I want to pay a tribute to that factory.  It has been one of the most marvellous successes.  The figures of losses which I have quoted in England&mdash;£350,000 in one factory; £400,000 in another&mdash;go to show that from the inception of the industry while we made a financial success of it, the English taxpayer had to find all these mil- <Col N="2065" /> lions to keep the industry on its feet. £30,000,000 is the sum.  I want to ask the House not to be led away even if a few members on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches are discontented with the present position of the beet industry in the country.  Anyone who knows anything about this industry will only be too anxious for the maintenance, not of a single factory, but for the setting up of the other four or five factories on the same lines as  working in Denmark.  What the Dane has done the Irishman can do.  We proved our success in the experimental stages of this industry, and I hope that we shall see not merely one factory but four or five factories erected in Ireland. I have heard from farmer Deputies in this House that their constituents in beet.  I believe the beet crop could be different areas were anxious to grow produced at 38s. per cwt. to meet all needs but for the boycott the Association placed upon the production of beet.</P>

      <P>And it would not be under the cost of production&mdash;I mean 38/- per ton.  I want simply to say in conclusion that there has been no sound argument put forward by the Opposition to show that this subsidy should not be paid.  I say that if we repudiate this contract and refuse to pass this Vote of £162,000 we will have done the worst day's work which the Dáil ever set out upon.  I hope that we will see another four or five factories set up in this country very soon.  On the figures as I have analysed them I have shown that the effect of this Vote of £162,000 is to put in annual circulation in this country the sum of £595,000, which are figures over which any Government can stand and be proud of.</P>

      <P>So much has been said upon this question that I do not intend to take up the time of the House for very long.  But as one who is anxious that this dispute should be <Col N="2066" /> settled I was rather pained listening to the unfortunate speech which has just been delivered by Deputy Byrne, in which he thought fit to condemn what in my opinion is the most respectable body of men to be found within the State, that is the members of the Beet Growers' Association.  It is an old maxim that when you have two parties to a dispute it is very unwise to rile either of them.  We in this House want in the best possible interests of the country to have a fair settlement of this unfortunate dispute. Deputy Byrne, if I heard his speech aright, has done a bad day's work in this matter.  He has postponed for a much longer period the settlement which the Minister for Agriculture gave the House to understand was in sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two aspects in connection with the growing of beet affecting the constituency I represent which, perhaps, the Deputies might not be aware of.  One of the most important things to be noted for us in Louth, which is a considerable distance from the factory, is that the growers of beet in that county have to pay at least 7/- or 8/- per ton by way of freight, so that the average price they receive per ton is somewhere in the region of 32/- or 30/- per ton, and not 38/-. Again, when this factory was established, and I may say that I gave full credit to the Government for what they did, many farmers in Louth, in response to the call sent out by the Government, rallied to the support of the Carlow factory by growing beet in answer to that call.  One very large farmer in that county, of the class whom Deputy Byrne has thought fit to condemn, changed his mode of farming, and for the past four or five years has grown many acres of beet.  The point I want to make is this, that one of the primary objects of establishing the factory in Carlow which the Government had in view was to produce what was much needed, namely, employment. This particular farmer whom I have spoken of, as a result of the growing of beet, was in the position to give employment to at least forty or fifty men.  That is an aspect of the subject that should not be lost sight <Col N="2067" /> of by Deputy Byrne when he spoke, as he did, in a very unfair way of the members of the Beet Growers' Association. While 38/- may do certain farmers, who farm with the aid of their own families, and can sow the beet with the aid of such labour, and when the time arises when the beet has to be reaped, can employ the members of their own family at this particular work, one can easily understand the position of the large farmers, who have to employ a number of hands to do the work.  As everybody knows, the labourer is worthy of his hire, and farmers have to pay these labourers wages.  We can very easily see that, although 38/- may&mdash;and I do not agree that it does&mdash;pay even the small farmer, by no stretch of the imagination can it pay the type of farmer to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>It was often said in the Dáil that nothing should be done for the larger farmer.  We heard a great deal of talk about the small farmer and the small employer, but it is the big farmer and the big employer that this country is in need of, and if you put these big farmers and these large employers of labour out of business you are going to create more unemployment.  It should be borne in mind by the Government when approaching this question that those men have loyally answered the call, and grown beet, and thereby given much needed employment in their respective districts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin's motion is that this matter be referred back for reconsideration. As one who is a member of the smallest Party in this House, I am anxious that some settlement should be arrived at, and I appeal to Deputy Davin and to the Opposition that, in the best interests of the country, and after having elicited this discussion, they should come to some agreement with the Government whereby a speedy end will be put to this dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister as I stated has already hinted in his speech this afternoon that he had good ground for believing that there will be a settlement in the near future.  Therefore, it would be no good to refer this Vote <Col N="2068" /> back.  It would not speed up, by one hour, the settlement.  The Opposition, the Labour Party and Deputies on the Government Benches have had an opportunity of expressing their views. Having done so I think the proper course now would be for Deputy Davin to withdraw the motion.  Whoever speaks for the Government before the debate ends should give some indication to the House that no time will be lost in bringing the parties in the dispute together and if possible effecting a settlement.  I believe a settlement can be effected if common sense prevails.  I am against strikes in any shape or form, and this is a sort of strike against the factory, if I may put it that way.  In my opinion there is this advantage that it is a policy pursued by a section of the community who do not want to be in their present position and who are anxious at the earliest possible moment to be relieved of that position.  I do ask Deputy Davin and the members of the Labour Party and the official Opposition to withdraw the motion.  I have no doubt that they will secure the object they have in view, and that we all have in view, as speedily as if there was a vote taken against this motion.  Moreover, it does not follow even if that Vote were carried that the sum of £162,000 would not be greatly affected. It would.  Governments, like individuals, can be brought to the courts and, while I am not a lawyer, I think it is commonsense to say that it would be within the power of the owners of the beet sugar factory to bring this Government to the courts and to recover that £160,000.  If the Vote is referred back or if the amount is reduced by the House it does not follow that those who are running the factory could not recover that amount by law.  Taking everything into consideration, that this is a very important industry, that depression is prevalent, not only here, but in all other countries, it is absolutely incumbent on all parties to the dispute to come together.  I am sure it will be possible for the Minister for Agriculture, acting on behalf of the Government, the directors on behalf of the factory, and a representative of the <Col N="2069" /> Beet Growers' Association, to come to an arrangement that will be satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contradict the statement made by Deputy Byrne that the organisation did not represent the Beet Growers' Association.  I can say that 100 per cent. of the beet growers were members of the organisation last year, that 64 per cent. are shareholders in the association and that the other 36 per cent. are subscribers.  Deputy Byrne's statement that the beet growers' organisation did not represent them is not true.  The Deputy also stated that the executive was not elected but set themselves up.  The beet growers' executive is elected by the members on a most democratic basis, and that executive represents the association in the same way as Deputies represent their constituents. Deputy Heffernan spoke about the sacredness of agreements and about besmirching the national honour if they were repudiated.  No Deputy on this side suggested that the agreement should be repudiated.  Deputy de Valera suggested that the unexpended surplus after paying for the beet that was grown should be given to those who did not grow beet this year.  It is not besmirching the national honour to spend money on people who are suffering this year.  Deputy Byrne made capital out of the fact that farmers in England are growing beet at 38/- a ton, and said that the Irish farmers refused to do so.  One reason why the Irish farmers refused to grow beet at 38/- a ton was that they did not see why they should suffer the whole cut while the factory suffered none.  In England, the Government is not allowing the factory to make any profit, to pay any dividend or to put anything towards depreciation. Here in Ireland the factory wants to pay the usual dividends and directors' fees and to put one-tenth of the capital away for depreciation.  That is one reason why the farmers did not grow beet this year.  Another reason was that it would not pay to grow beet at 38/- a ton.  There is no doubt about that.  Every farmer who understands the growing of cereals and root crops knows that beet could not be grown for 38/- a ton.  Deputy Byrne suggested <Col N="2070" /> that farmers who had the help of their own families could grow it and that that would be economic.  Certainly the labour of farmers who have families of sons and daughters should be worth as much as that of agricultural labourers, whose wages are small enough.  At least, these people should be paid that much for their labour.  I only hope that while the factory is offering such a low price for beet not a single farmer will be found to grow it next year.</P>

      <P>After listening to Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, I gathered that most of them agreed that the beet growers were not fairly treated by the factory people.  With the exception of Deputy Byrne, they all agreed that the factory could have given a better price for beet, but they all said they would vote against the amendment.  They said as this was a contract the money should be paid.  I think Deputies should remember that the farmers have suffered an injustice, and that owing to the beet war they will not be able to pay their annuities.  There are many now idle who would have found employment thinning, hoeing, and working on the beet crop.  Some provision should be made for these people. A few days ago I asked the Minister for Local Government what provision was going to be made for those who are unemployed owing to the beet crux, and the reply I received was that that was a matter for the boards of health.  I think it is hardly fair that local bodies should have to shoulder the burden that will be put upon them in the shape of extra rates owing to the beet crux.  I find it very hard to understand how any Deputy could vote this subsidy until he knew the terms of settlement.  We have been told that a settlement is in view.  That sounds like the election promises we heard which were broken.  We were told what would happen, but these things did not come to pass afterwards. Deputy Gorey spoke about the credit of the State.  I do not know what the credit of the State is abroad, as I have not been abroad, but I think the fact of my being here shows that its credit is very low at home.  A promise was made by a high official in <Col N="2071" /> the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that if the result of the recent election went against the Government they would go to the country, and that they would take it as an indication that they had lost the confidence of the country.  I think they have lost the confidence of the country, and that the beet question had a lot to do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fairly obvious from all we have heard in the discussion since it started, that it has been more concerned with vote-catching and electioneering than with sound business.  When this factory was started in the first instance, it was not with a view to vote-catching.  It was to do a particularly necessary and helpful act towards the agricultural industry. In order to do that a very big sum was imposed on the taxpayer each year.  For the ten years it amounted to something like £3,878,580, or one might say, in round figures, practically £4,000,000 of money.  The taxpayers of the country are entitled to inquire how that money was spent, whether it has effected its purpose.  In connection with effecting the purpose that was in the mind of the Minister and of the Oireachtas at the time the industry was started, it is fairly clear that the success of the whole industry, the success of beet growing, the manufacture of sugar, and of the factory, was the main consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of speakers when dealing with the matter, started out with the idea that to show their interest in the growers they had to show hostility to the factory.  It is obvious that they are unaccustomed to business methods, or unaccustomed to the exercise of administration or authority, and that they are not likely after the words of wisdom that have come from these benches, to improve until they get older, and gain a little more experience.  Taking the first four years in respect of which complete figures are available, the facts&mdash;and they are different from arguments&mdash;are that 55 per cent. was paid in dividends &mdash;15 per cent. for each of three years, and ten per cent. one year&mdash;approximately £220,000; £208,000 was written <Col N="2072" /> off, and there was something like £65,000 placed in reserve, making a total of £493,000.  I expect these figures will be admitted.  If there is any question about them I will go through them one after the other in order to clear up the matter.  That is what the shareholders of the factory were entitled to out of the first four years working.  There were directors' fees paid to the extent of £12,000, making a total of £506,000.  In addition to the general reserve fund there was on 30th June, 1930, a special reserve of £54,000 for taxation of profits, doubtful debts, and stamp duties on share warrants.  In all probability there are considerable hidden reserves in these figures.  But, as far as the company is concerned, and those partaking of the benefits&mdash; the shareholders and so on&mdash;we will say that in round figures half a million was paid to them.  Who got the other portion of the total sum paid in subsidy or remission of duties over that period, amounting to £1,562,605? Somebody got the remainder.  That is what the factory got.  That is a very considerable sum, and the taxpayers of this country have put up the whole of it.  Listening to the various suggestions that were made for composing these figures, for finding a solution of this problem, I am not surprised that this Government is still in office, and that it is likely to remain in office for a very long time.  Deputy de Valera would divide a portion of the subsidy not expended this year among those who were growing beet last year or the year before, or possibly the year before that, back if you like, to the first year beet was grown here.</P>
    <P>Did anyone ever hear such a ridiculous or such a senseless proposal? It looks to me like this, that there is a rich man who does not know what to do with his money, and who wants to select some popular method of distributing it.  That was not the intention we had in mind when the industry was started.  It was started for the specific purpose of seeing whether or not the experiment of manufacturing sugar in this country was likely to be a success.  This was a better bargain, as the Minister for Agriculture stated, <Col N="2073" /> than the bargain made in England.  The mere fact that this year, if the whole of the subsidy were paid, and if the whole of the remission of duty were granted, we would spend £100,000 more than would be spent on a similar factory manufacturing the same quantity of beet, does not affect the issue.  It is over the whole period of ten years that we are taking the figures.  When Deputy Ryan complained of some figures that he got during the last couple of years, he ought to remember that in taking out the figures the officials take them as they were before them.</P>

Other than that I was substantially correct, and if Deputy Lemass was even within 50 per cent. as correct in any figures he gives he might thank his stars.

I understand that the arrangement by which the Executive of that body is elected is on a most democratic basis. It is obvious that if we are to get to business in connection with the price of sugar beet, that there ought to be a body to deal with the question on behalf of the growers, and that body should concern itself by seeing, as far as it can, that ordered conditions prevail.  It ought not to countenance anything in the nature of sabotage.  I do not believe it does. There may be individual cases in which these things might happen, but they are not going to serve a useful purpose, and if Deputies directed themselves to matters of that sort, telling the people the truth and putting before them the necessity of having ordered conditions, it would be very much better.</P>

      <P>Taking a hostile view against the factory is not going to solve the question.  The factory directors in my view have not taken a sound common-sense view of the problem this year, and as a consequence I believe that the factory is going to lose money.  I believe it will not be a successful year and I believe that the best interests of the factory and the growers would be served by taking the advice of the Minister for Agriculture, and the advice that I have given them.  I had hoped that they would accept that advice.  I make Deputies opposite a present of all the seats they like to win on it but I am not <Col N="2076" /> going to win a single seat in the country on false promises.  If people are not satisfied to stand by me in carrying out a bargain that this country&mdash;not myself&mdash;is committed to by a statute of its own Parliament, then I say let them get someone else to serve them.  I will not serve them. The Association and those directing it must remember that the people of this country are putting huge sums into this industry.  The directors must remember that the growers are entitled to go into an association and to do legal acts affecting their rights, and that the best interests of all concerned is in meeting and finding how far it is possible to get accommodation on the question of a price.  The Association must remember that it is not by uttering hostile comments on the factory that their best interests are going to be served.  We stand for this contract as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the Money Resolution I would like to have a ruling on points of procedure.  The Money Resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to amend the Electricity (Supply) Acts, 1927 to 1930, it is expedient to authorise the advance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of such sums, not exceeding in the aggregate Two Million Pounds, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify to be reasonably and properly required by the Electricity Supply Board for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions under the Electricity (Supply) Acts, 1927 to 1930.</P>
      <P>To that an amendment is being moved which first of all cuts down the sum of money and takes out the phrase &ldquo;as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify to be reasonably and properly required by the Electricity Supply Board for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions under the Electricity Supply Acts, 1927 to 1930,&rdquo; and makes a change the effect of which I do not yet know.  Are these three points to be discussed on the Money Resolution or is it the procedure that I formally move the Money Resolution and debate the amendment when it has been moved?</P>

      <P>The Minister is in the position that he may either formally move the Money Resolution, hear the amendment proposed and speak on the amendment or speak first on the Money Resolution and subsequently on the points raised on the amendment which he did not deal with before.  I think it is a matter entirely for the Minister whether he deals with the matter first or deals <Col N="2079" /> with the matter when he hears the case.  Perhaps it would be better for the Minister to move the motion and then hear the amendment moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have had some contacts privately with the Deputies who have amendments down. It seems to me that the whole matter can be debated on the Money Resolution and on this amendment of Deputy Lemass's and that questions to obtain decisions can be put.  I think that having discussed the matter as Deputy Lemass says of the three points raised in the amendment and such other matters as may be relevant on the Money Resolution, it would be undesirable and it would probably be agreed that it is not necessary, that we should again discuss these matters in Committee on the Bill.  Deputy Lemass's amendment raises at least two points, one with regard to the sum of Money to be granted and the other whether the money should be granted on the certificate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If it is so desired it would be possible to put questions which would give separate decisions on these points.  Where it is proposed to delete the words &ldquo;two million pounds&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one million one hundred thousand pounds&rdquo; the question would be that the words &ldquo;two million pounds&rdquo; stand; the second question would be that the words &ldquo;as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify&rdquo; stand. That would give a decision first as to the amount of money, and secondly, as to whether the Minister's certificate would remain in.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words from and including the words `Two Million Pounds' to the figures `1930' and substitute the words `one million, one hundred thousand pounds, as may be required by the Electricity Supply Board for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions under Section 12 (3) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which is before the Dáil is one the main purpose of which is to provide a sum of two million pounds which may be advanced to the Electricity Supply Board for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions under the Electricity Supply Acts, 1927 to 1930, on a certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that such money is reasonably and properly required by the Board for that purpose.  When the Bill was before the Dáil on its Second Reading, Deputies will remember that the Minister did not attempt to give any explanation whatever as to the purposes for which this two million pounds was required. He gave us no information as to the basis on which it was calculated, he expressed his inability to give us any information as to the purposes it was required for.  He expressed the view that he thought it would prove to be more than was likely to be required.  He made it quite clear, however, that the figure was arrived at by a process of guesswork, that it was put into the Bill without any serious grounds for assuming that it was required or was necessary for the Board in the proper performance of its duties.  We think it preposterous that any Minister should come to the Dáil and ask the Dáil to sanction the expenditure of such a large sum on such grounds. A House presumably serious about its work and anxious to carry its responsibilities properly, which would sanction the expenditure of two million pounds upon the information which the Minister has given <Col N="2081" /> would be, I think, open to the charge that it had seriously neglected its obligations and had jeopardised the welfare of the people to whom the House was responsible.  A House which would sanction two million pounds in that way would sanction anything.  I do not think that there is any other Parliament in the world in which any Minister ever came with such a proposal as that which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has put to this House.  He wants this two million pounds to be expended on a purpose which he cannot explain, which he says may not be required, two million pounds concerning which he can give the Dáil no information whatsoever.  It is to be given to him in whatever manner and for whatever purposes he likes, and no section in the Bill provides that any check is to be given to the Dáil on that expenditure or that the Minister is to be responsible in any way for a proper accounting of it.  We do not propose to agree to the giving of that money in that manner.  We propose to ask the Dáil definitely to limit the amount which is to be made available for expenditure by the Board on the certificate of the Minister in the manner proposed in the Bill.  We propose to limit that amount to £500,000 and to provide in addition a sum of £600,000 which will be available for the Board as and when required by the Board, for the express purpose of repaying the capital liabilities acquired by the Board when it took over the electricity undertakings of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In order to satisfy the House that the proposals which we are making to-day are reasonable, it is necessary to review briefly the present financial position of the Board as explained by the Minister in his speeches here on Wednesday and Thursday of last week. Deputies will remember that when the 1927 Act was passed, a sum of £2,500,000 was provided for the Board to finance all its activities, to meet its requirements in all respects except in regard to the maintenance, operation and repair of the Shannon works. Briefly, this £2,500,000 was to finance <Col N="2082" /> the distribution activities of the Board as distinct from its activities in the generation or transmission of electric current.  The Minister told us here on Wednesday, for the first time, and to the astonishment of the Dáil and people generally, that the Board had overspent that sum by £600,000, and that, in addition, they had entered into commitments involving the expenditure of another quarter of a million pounds.  In other words, that the total expenditure and liabilities of the Board to date amounted to £3,350,000. He explained that of that sum £600,000 represented capital liabilities of municipal and electrical undertakings acquired by the Board, and in respect of which the Board was required by the 1927 Act to keep those local authorities indemnified.  If we deduct that sum of £600,000 from the total of £3,350,000, to which I have referred, we get the figure of £2,750,000.  The Board has received to date from the Central Fund under Section 12 (3) of the 1927 Act, in respect of its distribution activities, a sum of £1,950,000; £200,000 went to repay some of these acquired capital liabilities, but that is the total which the Board has received and which we can deduct from the other figure of £2,750,000 to which I have referred.  That leaves us a figure of £800,000.  We have got to provide for the Board that £800,000, and, in addition, to give them a sum of money which will enable them to carry on their activities pending whatever inquiry or whatever reorganisation scheme the Dáil may decide upon. There is to the credit of the Board with the Minister for Finance a sum of £550,000.  The Dáil in 1927 provided £2,500,000 to finance these activities of the Board.  Of that sum only £1,950,000 has been drawn.  There is still available or withheld from the Board a sum of £550,000.  If the Dáil accepts our proposals concerning the capital liabilities of the municipal electrical undertakings that sum becomes released to finance the Board's activities, and we propose to add to it a sum of a half a million pounds.  That will enable the Board to pay off the existing liabilities, to provide for the commitments into which it has <Col N="2083" /> entered, amounting to a quarter of a million pounds, and will leave them with another quarter of a million pounds with which to engage in activities for the period during which the inquiry or reorganisation scheme will take place.  That, in brief, is the nature of our proposal.</P>
    <P>We propose that the Board should be given sufficient to pay off those liabilities to date and to carry on for a strictly limited period.  We are particularly concerned that the Dáil should not agree to give carte blanche to the Minister or to provide a sufficient sum of money to enable the Board's activities to proceed for a long period without having some assurances, some definite and positive assurances other than the words of the Minister, that a situation will not arise in the future similar to that which has arisen, and which has necessitated these demands on the Dáil.  We want a full inquiry into the present position and the future possibilities of the Shannon scheme.  We want to be satisfied that the scheme is likely to prove remunerative when saddled with additional two million pounds capital liability which this Bill proposes.  We want to be satisfied also that a proper reorganisation of the Board is likely to take place.  The Minister has said that such a reorganisation is in contemplation.  He has informed us that he has reappointed to the Board three part-time members for the purpose of discussing with them some manner in which a Board can be constituted which will have none of the defects of the old Board, but which will at the same time permit of the existence of business members on it.</P>
    <P>I take it that that reorganisation cannot take place without submission of legislative proposals to the Dáil.  It would be necessary therefore for the Minister in the next Session of the Dáil to come here before us with additional legislative proposals relating to the Shannon scheme.  We suggest, in relation to the financial position, that we give the existing Board sufficient to carry on until then.  I do not think that the Dáil should, under any circumstances, agree to provide for the <Col N="2084" /> purposes of the Board or any other purposes a large sum of money until it has submitted to it a clear case for the provision of that money, and until it is demonstrated that the expenditure of it is likely to prove remunerative. There has been no attempt made to do that as yet.  Deputies must remember that the original Shannon scheme was alleged to be an economic proposition on the basis that its cost would be limited to a certain definite amount, and that sale would be available for a particular number of units of electricity.  The total cost of the scheme was to be £5,210,000 on the construction side, and £2,500,000 upon the distribution side.  These were the figures upon which the original Shannon scheme was based.  We were given to understand that there was no likelihood of an increase in these figures.  Time and again the Minister made statements that these figures were not likely to be exceeded.</P>

      <P>When I made reference to the first of these figures, the cost of construction, the Minister asked me for that quotation.  I stated then that the Minister had informed the House that he had binding estimates for the construction of the Shannon works, estimates which could not and were not likely to be exceeded.  I am quoting from the Official Report of the debate of the 3rd April, 1925, volume 10, column 2019, in which the Minister said: &ldquo;but the only scheme that is under consideration at the moment is the scheme entailing a cost of £5,200,000.  Nobody can question that is the amount which we are considering because for that we have binding estimates, if we care to accept tenders here and now.  With the exception of the item referred to by Deputy Thrift on page 80, limited to civil constructional costs, the prices are absolutely fixed and binding. They are maximum prices from Siemens Schuckerts' point of view. They are not the minimum from our point of view.  We have checks and controls by which if we find a reputable firm in any other part of the world that would do any part of this <Col N="2085" /> work at less than Messrs.  Siemens Schuckert then we can beat them down to that, or give the contracts on those parts to other firms.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister came to the Dáil in 1929 with a Bill to provide additional money for the construction works.  That £5,200,000 was increased on that occasion by £600,000. When the Minister was asking for that additional £600,000 to meet the increased costs he assured us positively that there was to be no increase in the distribution costs of £2,500,000.  In June, 1930, he told the Dáil that he had no reason to believe that that figure was likely to be exceeded.  He has now come to ask us for an additional two million presumably for distribution purposes, but of that we cannot be sure.  We must remember that each addition to the cost of the scheme must mean an addition to the revenue of the Board in some form or another. The Board is required by its charter, the Act of 1927, to so arrange its charges for electricity that the revenue will meet all outgoings in respect of interest, sinking fund, capital charges, working expenses and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to increase the cost of the Shannon scheme by two million pounds then in some way the revenue of the Shannon Board must also be increased by the amount necessary to pay the charges on those two million pounds.  The Minister has given us no information as to how that is to be done.  Is it to be done by increasing the price of <Col N="2086" /> electricity?  If so what is the average increase per unit likely to be?  I think the Dáil should be very slow to provide any sum whatever for the purpose mentioned in this Bill until it knows what the exact consequences of the additional expenditure are likely to be.  Will the whole or any part of this money prove remunerative? Will this expenditure increase the revenue?  Will that revenue be sufficient to pay the charges upon this money without an increase in the cost of electricity?  Have the Shannon Board up to date been selling electricity at a price which will enable it to meet these outgoings when the appointed day arrives?</P>
    <P>Deputies will note upon the sheet that has been circulated to them that there are three separate amendments in my name and I would like to deal now with the points raised by them because they are all affected by this amendment of mine to the Money Resolution. The Minister explained here on Wednesday last that the dispute between the Executive Council and the Shannon Board arose out of the question whether under the Act of 1927 the Board were entitled to the whole of the £2,500,000 provided by Section 12 (3) of that Act to finance its activities or whether the Board was only entitled to such part of that sum as remains after the capital liabilities acquired with municipally owned undertakings have been deducted from it.  Apparently the drafting of the Act left the legal position different from what the Minister had intended.  I take it that it was the Minister's intention that that £2,500,000 should be provided for the purpose of meeting all the financial requirements of the Board, its distribution costs as well as its acquired capital liabilities, but that through defective drafting the actual result of the Act was different from what he had intended.  I presume anyway that if it were quite clear under the Act that his interpretation of it was the proper one, he would not have found it necessary to say to the Board in 1929 that he would introduce a section into that Act to amend the original Act and make the position as clear as he intended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> The legal position, whatever it was, is not changed by this Bill.  This Bill does not propose to rectify or remove any doubts that may exist in that respect.  If these £2,000,000 are provided, they may, or may not, be used for the purpose of discharging these acquired capital liabilities.  If the Board were entitled to maintain heretofore that the moneys provided by sub-section (3) of Section 12, need not be used for the purpose of discharging these liabilities, then no part of this sum of £2,000,000 need be used for that purpose.  We are proposing to take these capital liabilities out of the arena and we are proposing that, of the sum which we provide for the Board, £600,000&mdash;that is the aggregate, roughly, of these liabilities&mdash;should be earmarked and made available to the Board for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of repaying these acquired capital liabilities if and when it is proposed to repay them.  There is, of course, no obligation to repay them. Certain sinking fund arrangements existed in respect of these liabilities. The Board is required by the original Act to pay whatever charges arise in that connection and to pay the interest charges out of its revenue.  We are not proposing to take that responsibility from the Board.  We think it is most unlikely that any part of this £600,000 will be called upon, but the Minister thinks it necessary that a sum should be available so that the indemnification clause of the 1927 Act should be complied with.  As I have already explained, if a special provision dealing with these acquired capital liabilities is made, the £550,000 of the original 2½ million pounds which the Minister has withheld from the Board will become available to the Board to finance its ordinary activities and to discharge the liabilities which have been mounting up during the past nine or ten months in consequence of the Minister's withholding of the money.  The amount of these trade liabilities, together with the total of the financial commitments into which the Board has entered but which have not yet matured, we are informed by the Minister, <Col N="2088" /> amounts to £850,000.  We will be providing a sum&mdash;these figures are only approximate&mdash;of from a quarter of a million to £300,000, to enable the Board to proceed with whatever development programme it believes to be necessary in order to reap the benefit during the next few months of its past expenditure. I do not know to what exactly that £250,000 for commitments to which the Minister referred relates. We take it that it means the cost of the Board's development programme in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Now, we come up against the question whether this half-million pounds should be provided by the Board in the same manner as the original £2½ million was provided, or whether it should be only made available if and when the Minister for Industry and Commerce certifies it to be reasonably and properly required by the Board under Section 3 of this Bill.  We dislike the section of the Bill which requires this certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we had to consider very carefully whether we would propose to the Dáil to delete the words which dealt with it, or whether we would leave them as they are.  This is our position: We wish to see the Board independent of control by the Executive Council or any member of it.  We think the original plan of an independent Board the best one, and we hope it will be found possible in a very short time to return to it.  But we have there a Board which has, according to the Minister, not done its job properly. We are not putting any responsibility upon that Board.  The Minister is responsible to this House for everything that has happened.  He selected the members; he appointed them, and he reappointed some of them when they resigned, or for certain reasons they vacated their jobs.  They are there. The Minister is answerable to this House for his selection.  There are on that Board at present, I understand, two whole-time and three part-time members.  The three part-time members may be disregarded.  They are not active.  I have heard it stated that they are not even being summoned <Col N="2089" /> to meetings of the Board at present. The other two members of the Board were members when the greater part of this excess expenditure was entered into.  The Minister told us, for example, that in the middle of last year he asked this Board for certain statistical information, and that he had not got it yet.  He told us about the delay in furnishing the accounts, that a firm of auditors has been working there for a long time, and has not yet succeeded in straightening them out. I do not think that any member of the Dáil would say that he would willingly give to that Board, as described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, unlimited control over this sum of half a million pounds or two million, or whatever sum we provide for the purposes of the Board in the future.  A reorganisation is in contemplation.  We propose that until that reorganisation takes place this requirement of certification by the Minister for Industry and Commerce should remain.</P>
    <P>The other amendment in my name provides that the money can only be expended by the Board for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 3.  The wording of the amendment to the Financial Resolution on this point is unsatisfactory, but the amendment to the Bill makes the idea clear. As I explained to the Dáil, Section 12 of the 1927 Act provides for the financing of the Board's activities. Sub-section (2) of that section provides the money which is to be expended upon the maintenance, operation and repair of the Shannon works.  Sub-section (3) provides the amount which is to be spent by the Board on all purposes other than the maintenance, operation and repair of the Shannon works.  The Minister has led the Dáil to understand that the £2,000,000 mentioned in the Bill is required to discharge liabilities entered into by the Board in its distribution activities, and to finance future development upon the distribution side.  We want it to be clearly understood that no part of this money can be utilised for additional developments on the generating side without the Minister being under an obligation to come to the Dáil and explain his proposals.  We <Col N="2090" /> want it to be clear that no part of this money can be used to pay increased cost of construction, if such an increased cost has arisen.  References have appeared in the Press, for example, to a claim which Messrs. Siemens Schuckert are making against the Board in connection with construction work done.  If any part of this sum is being ear-marked, or is required for the purpose of meeting any such claim, that should be clearly stated.  The Dáil should not be asked to provide money without knowing exactly what it is to be used for.</P>

      <P>I think I have now dealt with the three matters that arise. It will be possible to deal with some other aspects of them later.  My main concern at the moment is to impress on the Dáil my view that it should not in the future give the Executive Council or the Minister or anybody else a free hand in relation to the Shannon scheme.  I refer to the Minister in <Col N="2091" /> this matter, although the responsibility under the 1927 Act is placed upon the Executive Council, and the Executive Council have exercised that responsibility. As far as the Dáil is concerned it must hold the Minister responsible for the position that has arisen.  We do not think the Minister should get behind the Board for the purpose of getting away from his share of that responsibility.  He appointed the Board.  He was responsible for their appointment.  He presumably selected the people whom he thought best fitted for the position.  If he did, then whatever consequences arise from those appointments he must take responsibility for in this House.  He had the power to dismiss members of the Board if at any time he considered a situation had arisen which would justify such action.  He allowed a position to develop in which the financial conditions of the Board, according to his account, got into considerable confusion and in which considerable over expenditure was indulged in.  He took no action.  Certain prominent members of the Board resigned.  Their resignations forced his hand and made it necessary for him to come to the House with this Bill to make the explanatory statement which we heard last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the first statement that this House heard concerning any dispute that existed between the Minister and the Board.  We must remember also that it was the Minister and not the Board that prepared the original estimate of two and a half million pounds to meet the activities of the Board on the distribution side.  That estimate appears to have been wrong, as far as one can judge from the statement of the Minister and other statements which have appeared.  Every member appointed on that Board from time to time expressed the view, in one form or another, that it was impossible to carry out the functions of the Board within that figure.  The Minister, however, instead of coming to the Dáil and admitting that his original estimate was wrong and asking for an increase in the amount provided <Col N="2092" /> appears to have stuck his heels in the ground.  Instead of increasing the sum he endeavoured to force the Board to do what members of the Board, experts in finance and experts in electrical matters, expressed the opinion it was not possible to do.  Under those circumstances the amount of confidence which members of the Dáil can have in the Minister must be strictly limited. When a Bill like this comes before the House, a Bill which proposes to provide a huge sum of money with which the Minister can do practically what he likes, the House should be slow to pass it.  Deputies should not pass it in its present form and with the information now available.  We think there is a case for providing temporarily a limited sum to be expended in the manner proposed in the Bill, subject only, however, to proper assurances being given that a full expert enquiry, such as has been suggested, will be held, and that the Board is reconstituted in such a manner as will permit of its being given an independent status, and that will be some sufficient guarantee to the Dáil that the position that has arisen in the past will not arise again in the future.  I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was speaking on the last occasion he read a letter which I addressed to him.  He also read the reply.  At the time the Minister was reading the reply I understood that he was referring in the last paragraph to the Whips of the various Parties.  I have not been able to trace my letter, but since reading the official report of the debate I am satisfied that the letter the Minister read was the one I received because it refers only to the Whips of his own Party.  I want to take this opportunity of withdrawing any suggestion that I put on the letter that the Minister read&mdash;that it was not the one actually sent to me.  Having since had an opportunity of refreshing my memory and of reading the report, I want to take this opportunity of making that statement.</P>

      <P>I will come to that.  I am trying to show the Minister that it is hard sometimes to do the gentlemanly thing.  I have done now what I consider to be right.  I did not use the phrase, but if I did suggest that it was a fake letter I think the proper thing for me to do is to make amends at the first opportunity for making that suggestion.  I am doing that now.  As regards the letter itself and the merits of it I can deal with that later.  I hope the Minister understands the motives that have prompted me to do what I have just done. Perhaps it is just as well that I should deal with the letter now.  I wrote a letter to the Minister after having made a careful examination and study of the accounts as presented to the Dáil.  I was satisfied that not only did these balance sheets and accounts not conform with the sections of the Act which stipulated what class of accounts should be submitted to the Dáil, but I was also satisfied that a debate at that time was imperative. I thought that the proper attitude for me to take was to write to the Minister himself and find out.  I knew from previous questions that I had asked in the House and from previous debates that had taken place that the Minister never wanted any light thrown on the Shannon scheme either as regards the Shannon works or the Shannon Board.  I wrote to the Minister and got the letter that is now on the records.  That indicated to me that the Minister was not prepared to suggest time himself for a debate on the accounts, nor was he prepared to facilitate&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show that it is essential that we should reduce the amount.  The Minister has given no reason here showing why he requires the money.  He does not say what it is required for, and he has not accounted, in the manner laid down by the Act, for the moneys which he handed over to the Board.  If we are to get as little information with regard to the money now being voted as we have got in relation to moneys paid over in the past, the proper attitude to adopt is to vote against giving any money except what is absolutely imperative to keep the plant going, and even that money should only be issued on a certified statement.  In Section 32 (3) of the 1927 Act, the Minister is directed to produce to the Dáil a definite statement with regard to any moneys handed over.  Sub-section (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall lay as soon as <Col N="2095" /> may be before each House of the Oireachtas a copy of every report made to him by the Board under this section, together with a copy of the last capital account, revenue account, profit and loss account, and balance-sheet of the Board...</P>
    <P>In the statement presented no profit and loss account appeared.  I dare say the Minister will now take up the attitude that he adopted on the Second Stage when he tried to convince the Dáil that he was unable to give to us the information we requested because he himself was not given it.  I contend that the Minister had no right to circulate the balance sheet he did circulate, with the signature of his auditors appended, without giving us the very definite information laid down in the Act.  The Minister is not prepared to give us the information we require in regard to former moneys handed over.  We are now, apparently, precluded from discussing whatever portion of the two and a half millions was handed over. The Minister has violated the Act because he has given us a balance sheet which I will prove, if I am permitted, does not reflect the true position of the undertaking.  In those circumstances we should consider very seriously before we give any more money.  We should at least wait until we have some definite statement as to what has happened in the past and what is going to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful before we sanction any further payments to the Minister.  We find that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, are jointly and individually responsible for what happened in the past.  The Minister may talk about the difficulties he had to contend with, but can he argue that under Section 7 of the 1927 Act he had not at all times the right to examine and have placed before him in any way he liked the accounts of the Board, or does he contend that he should not be kept au fait at all times with what was happening there?  I am almost tempted to say that Section 7 puts the two Ministers in the position of being ex officio members of the Board and therefore, <Col N="2096" /> in regard to anything that has happened as regards finance, the Ministers, as far as we are concerned, are responsible to us; they cannot throw their responsibility on the shoulders of other people.  It might be well for the Dáil to refresh its memory with regard to Section 7:</P>
    <P>The Board shall keep in such form as shall be approved by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance all proper and usual accounts of all moneys received or expended by them, including a capital account, revenue account, profit and loss account, and a balance sheet, and in particular shall keep in such form as aforesaid all such special accounts as the Minister on his motion or at the request of the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct.</P>
    <P>How any Minister with that power can say cold-bloodedly here: &ldquo;I know nothing about the finances of these people.  I do not know how they keep their accounts.  All I know is that the accounts are in a mess and I have had to have my auditors in there for a considerable time trying to get things straightened out,&rdquo; I really do not know.</P>
    <P>I have addressed a question to the Minister asking if he is prepared to say what is the nature of the report he received from his own expert, Mr. Fay, with regard to the business of the Board, during the period when he acted as liaison officer.  I have also asked the Minister if he is prepared to produce his own expert's report to the House which has a special reference to the financial position and the financial future of the Board.  I shall probably have an answer to that question to-morrow.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that when the present Chairman of the Board was appointed he must have been given special instructions by the Minister.  As far as I understand, it was the present Chairman who asked that auditors be sent to try to straighten out things. Is it not fair to assume, in view of the manner in which the first and second balance sheets were presented, that a <Col N="2097" /> lot of the present work deals with the periods with which those balance sheets were concerned?  I maintain that the accounts were not presented in the manner directed by the Dáil. It may be argued that we should now only give such moneys as are sufficient to meet requirements and to permit the carrying on of all the operations of the Board, so that we will not be adding extra cost to the scheme in the shape, for instance, of solicitors' fees for serving civil bills, a great number of which are in the possession of the Board.  They would not be there if the Minister had given the Board money when they were in need of it.</P>
    <P>In the balance sheet presented to us for 1928-29 there is one item of £10,574 12s. 0d., which is referred to as a surplus of revenue over expenditure. Can the Minister explain that surplus?  I believe the Minister could not possibly show any surplus, particularly when it relates to the initial stages of the undertaking, when they were selling a very nominal amount of electricity and when they were engaged in preparing the most important part of the project.  I have consulted qualified auditors in regard to this item, and, as a result of the information I have been given, I am satisfied that these accounts which the Minister circulated are not a true reflection of the business of the Board during the first two years.  The Minister apparently did not know what he was doing when he issued them.  I believe he was responsible for their publication, and not the Board.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister claim that his auditors were not furnished with everything they required when they were examining into the Board's affairs?  I have read the addendum to the auditors' report, and they say that they were furnished with everything they required, with the exception of one or two items; they could not certify certain liabilities because they were not vouched for.  We are now asked to give practically a blank cheque to the Minister, and we have absolute proof that he did not carry out his duties in accordance with the <Col N="2098" /> Act in regard to the moneys formerly handed to him.  He had no right to do what he has done.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to refer to is this.  In portion of the reply given to-day to a question by Deputy MacEntee, the Minister, in giving particulars of the salaries and remuneration paid to the members of the Board, included an item of £1,250 paid as a lump sum to the late chairman when he took up the position of an ordinary member of the Board.  On the Second Stage of the Bill, when I asked the Minister if the previous chairman received any compensation when he retired, he said no.  Then he argued that he got something by way of extra remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be discussed in a particular way.  I do not want in any way to hamper this debate.  We had a Second Reading debate on the Bill, and we are now discussing whether the Minister will get £2,000,000 or £1,100,000, and whether the money will be given as Deputy Lemass suggests in his amendment, or whether the Minister will be asked to certify for the amount.  The Deputy is really discussing the accounts of the Board, and not how the Minister has carried out certain obligations imposed upon him by the 1927 Act.  The Deputy occasionally is saying, &ldquo;for these reasons we should not give the Minister £2,000,000,&rdquo; but that does not put him in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of relevancy is this: the Minister has given certain figures for which he says he required this money.  I am not prepared to accept that he has proved to us in a clear, open and frank manner what the amounts are for which he requires the money.  He spoke of £250,000 to discharge certain trade liabilities and he said he required a further sum of £600,000 for another purpose.  I was in doubt, and I believe others were in doubt, when he spoke of the undischarged liabilities of undertakings, as to whether portion of this money was for that purpose.</P>

I asked: &ldquo;Is there any foundation for the statement that the previous chairman of the Board was given any compensation whatever <Col N="2101" /> when he resigned from the chairmanship?&rdquo; The Minister intervened and said: &ldquo;I could answer that question simply by saying `No,' but that would be misleading.  He did not get it on resignation, but he got it by way of extra remuneration on being reappointed as a part-time member.&rdquo; I then asked: &ldquo;Could the Minister say what was the amount?&rdquo; and the Minister said: &ldquo;I have not it in my head.&rdquo; Then I asked: &ldquo;Would the Minister promise to get the amount?&rdquo; and the Minister said: &ldquo;Certainly, quite soon.&rdquo; Then I went on to say further: &ldquo;If the Minister has come to the House now to give the ex-Managing Director £2,000 on his resignation on the grounds the Minister stated, I say the Minister had no power previously to give the previous chairman any compensation by way of extra remuneration when he resigned from the chairmanship over differences on policy. That chairman was brought back as an ordinary member of the Board.  He has also gone out with Dr. MacLaughlin. I do not suppose he is getting compensation again this time.&rdquo; The Minister then said: &ldquo;Section 2 is where my power was to do whatever was done.&rdquo; I then asked: &ldquo;Why is not the late Managing Director given compensation under that section?&rdquo; and the Minister replied: &ldquo;Because it does not apply.&rdquo;</P>

It was not anything else but compensation for something or other.

      <P>Deputy Lemass gave the Minister an indication as to the reasons for his first amendment and the Minister, I believe, has given an assurance, which amounts practically to an acceptance of the amendment, that no moneys will be used for any purpose other than described in sub-section (3) of the Act.  As regards the £2,000,000 which the Minister wants, and the third amendment in the name of Deputy Lemass, which states that the Minister should have £500,000, I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to say that his figure will cover all the immediate requirements of the Board.  I presume this £500,000 will be in addition to the unexpended balance that the Minister <Col N="2103" /> has at his disposal for the Board out of the original £2,500,000.  I think the House is entitled to know at the earliest possible moment what is the true position as to the affairs of the Board, and the House should be given an opportunity of setting up an inquiry to find out who is to blame for the situation that arose.  I want to make this point, that the Minister will be held responsible for any loss that the Board has suffered, due if you like, on the one hand, to being held up in the normal working of the undertaking on account of not having the funds in hands which the Minister withheld, and for the extra costs which have been piled on to the Board in meeting legal expenses arising out of the position adopted by the Minister. I hope the Minister will, on an early occasion, take an opportunity of giving to the House a detailed statement of the exact amount he has cost the Board by his peculiar action and by his attitude during the last four or five months anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know what attitude he will take when he gets this money. Is he going to take up the attitude again of keeping from the Dáil the information they require from time to time or is he going as he indicated the last day to give an opportunity at the earliest possible moment to have a debate on the published accounts as circulated, or will he again, once more that he has got sufficient money to carry on the scheme for a certain period, close up and leave the Dáil and the country ignorant of what is going on and what has transpired? I do not know whether the Minister when he replies on this amendment is going to give any indication as to how the capital situation of the undertaking stands and will stand from the extra money he is getting in relation to the charges for electricity that will be consumed by the users. He knows whether there are certain contracts existing between the Board and certain traction undertakings to supply current at a certain price. Is the Minister in a position to assure the House that the extra capital that <Col N="2104" /> he is now going to get and which is going to be added to the cost, that the whole of the additional charges will not fall upon the ordinary users of electricity but that there will be some means of recouping it from some of the undertakings that have had special consideration.</P>
    <P>I must say it is almost impossible to deal with this matter in the manner in which it should be dealt with.  The Minister is not responsible for the rulings of the Chair although he is responsible for an awful lot outside of that, but the Minister is not responsible for that.</P>

      <P>I want to know what is the position the Minister is taking up now with regard to the auditors and their activities with the Board.  I understand the auditors themselves have accountants on the premises of the Board, and they are reorganising all their financial affairs, accounts and books and so forth, and that they will prepare the accounts for the Board and then that they themselves will audit their own accounts.  I ask is it fair to ask a firm of auditors to complete the accounts of the Board in such a state of affairs as the Minister describes, and then for them to certify their own accountancy?  Is he prepared to have an inquiry as suggested, or, at least, is he prepared to get a firm <Col N="2105" /> capable of dealing with accounts of a nature such as this to certify the accounts of his own auditors?  As far as I am concerned, and as far as this Party is concerned, so far as I understand, we want to see that everything is done that would clear up whatever difficulties there are, and that would assure as far as possible the future success of the undertaking.  I cannot at all believe, for instance, that the attitude the Minister has taken up is going to bring about that.  I believe the Minister in concealing from the House certain essential details is going to lead to more difficulties in the future, and we will have the same thing again to face as to what happened and more disquiet in the minds of the people as to what is happening and when it is going to end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister's interpretation of Section 7 of the Act.  Is he going to apply rigidly the powers conferred upon him by that section?  Will he admit his responsibility for the accounts and the affairs of the Board and the manner in which they kept their accounts, and will he be able to state exactly what is happening? There is an item in the accounts of 1928-29 of £35,000 suspense account to which the auditors refer, which the Minister at that time had from his own auditors' report, but he never presented it to this House, and which must have drawn his attention to the unsatisfactory state of certain of the items.  I do not know whether the accountant of the Board presented a statement of accounts to the auditors which was unsatisfactory, but certainly I am satisfied that the Minister's auditors and the Minister himself presented to this House a statement of affairs far from satisfactory or clear. Anybody taking the slightest trouble to try and read that statement would have been satisfied when it was issued that there was something wrong.  At the present time, if we assume that things are as bad as the Minister says, then things must be considerably worse, yet at the present the Minister is asking for a considerable sum of money without giving any undertaking that he is going to exercise his power under Section 7, and not the <Col N="2106" /> powers he had not got and which he did exercise.  I think the Minister should first of all accept&mdash;I do not know whether he will or not, but I presume he will accept&mdash;the amendment moved by Deputy Lemass without any quibble.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not going to accept the amendment.  What argument has the Minister got against it?  He says he wants this money for the purposes of the Board.  We say: &ldquo;Very well, if you demand whatever money you want for the purposes of the Board at least take it in a Bill which has distinct reference to the purposes for which it is to be expended.&rdquo; The Minister says he will not do that; that he will give us his word, but he will <Col N="2107" /> not put it in an Act.  The second amendment proposes to reduce the amount to a certain figure.  I say that the Minister, if he is wise, should accept it, and that the first opportunity he gets he should call the Dáil together &mdash;if it is not dissolved during the long adjournment&mdash;and present a true and frank statement of the affairs of the Board.  Some people will not be terribly upset if that statement shows that the scheme cost more than the Minister anticipated, but the fact remains that we should only give him as much as will enable him to carry on for the present, and give a full detailed statement of the position as regards the present situation, as regards future development, and whatever capital is supposed to be required.  I feel that the Minister has no reason to refuse to accept the amendment.  I do not know whether the Minister disputes or disclaims the statement that there was a claim made by the builders for further money.</P>

      <P>I think on the Second Reading we made our attitude on this situation fairly clear.  It is not necessary to go back on the general points that we raised further than to the distance necessary to enable Deputies to understand the purpose of these proposals.  On the last occasion it was pointed out that the three main points on which difficulties between the Minister and the Board arose were the accounts, the question of a certain agreement, and what were referred to as matters of major policy.  With regard to the accounts, we were inclined to accept the Minister's position that there was a delay which could scarcely be explained.  Some Deputies, I think, said that the accounts were in a mess. Thinking over that since, I am not at <Col N="2108" /> all so satisfied that we were right in coming to a hasty judgment on that matter.  I recollect that the Dáil accounts, the full accounts for each year, are very late in appearing and when you take into account that this was a new enterprise on which a great deal of new work was being done, that a completely uncharted road had to be travelled, I begin to ask myself whether I was fair in coming, on the Minister's statement, to a judgment of these accounts.  As I have said, there was the precedent of the Dáil where at least for some years past we have had a very well defined system&mdash;things have been got into a definite routine order &mdash;and if it takes the Dáil a year or so before it presents its final accounts, we should not be too hard on an enterprise such as the Board if its accounts are delayed somewhat longer.  Even the Post Office accounts are delayed here for a year and a half sometimes. Therefore, our position on the accounts was at first somewhat to side with the Minister and I think it is only fair that we should realise&mdash;and I want to confess it as far as I am concerned&mdash;that our judgment was rather hasty.  I am afraid also, that when I thought of the accounts being in a mess, I did not fully realise that it was entering up, so to speak, transactions, that the materials were there, that they could be gone through, and that really what was at fault was there was delay in following up the mass of material that was available and putting it in the order which would satisfy the auditors. However, we pass away from the accounts.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the agreement, our position was that we here were not in a position to pronounce upon the merits of that dispute on partial statements, the ex-parte statements that were before us.  It would be unfair for us on these ex parte statements to come to any final conclusion. We ask, and I think we are entitled to ask, that all the relative material, the material relevant to that particular agreement, should be laid before us so that we would take that into account and know what was all the correspondence relating to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> The third matter was the question of major policy.  There again it was not easy to find out exactly what were the differences between the Minister and the Board.  The Minister told us that there was no such thing as a budgeting system.  They were going blindly ahead, spending money without any idea whether it was going to be remunerative or not.  I find it very difficult to agree that any people who had any business experience whatever were likely to proceed in that reckless and wild manner.  I am inclined to think notwithstanding the statement made by the Minister that there must have been a system of budgeting in the Board.  I find it very difficult to think that the Minister did not at an early stage indicate to the Board the form in which he required the accounts kept, and indicate that he would like to have some information on this particular head.  As I say, I find it very difficult to believe that if the Minister was doing his work at all, that if he was interested as we have every reason to expect he would be interested in that enterprise, he did not at an early stage get from the Board material which would enable him to give some opinion as to whether the Board were proceeding in this wild, reckless manner or not.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are not here in a position in which we would be able to judge whether the policy the Minister stands for or is going to stand for, or the policy of the Board is the better one. On that head, we said that there was a case for an examination into the whole present position by people who would be competent to judge on it&mdash;not by members of the Dáil&mdash;a point on which apparently there was some misunderstanding on the last occasion.  My view is that the whole of the present position should be submitted to experts for examination and to present their report on the present condition of the enterprise.  It is due to the enterprise and to us that such a report should be presented.  Having stated that, as our general attitude towards these three questions, the question of giving the Minister further money to meet the wants that have to be relieved arises. <Col N="2110" /> The Minister found fault with the Board for not living within two and a half million pounds including what they themselves felt did not come under that head at all&mdash;that is to make provision for some capital to meet the capital liabilities of the acquired undertakings. He comes to the House now and asks to get two millions more.  In face of that it seems very strange that he should want the Board to live within two and a half millions when he comes here and confesses that he was so far out in his estimate that he proposes to give himself two millions in addition.  That seems very strange to us and therefore we are not prepared to give to the Minister two million pounds, practically to do as he pleases, at least to hold it for the Board and use it as a means to compel the Board to work as he wants them&mdash;not as they themselves think, in accordance with their own views, is best to be done.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned we do not propose to give the Minister the two million pounds to be at his discretion to use in any particular way. We do not think it would be wise for the House even if it did feel confidence in the Minister, to give him that money in the present circumstances. We feel that what the present circumstances demand is that the Board should get just that sum which would enable it to meet its present liabilities and to enable it to carry on any work it has in hand for such time as will enable the necessary information which the Dáil ought to have to be prepared.  I think six months or so should be sufficient for that.  I believe that if experts were to enquire into the present condition of the Board, men who know what the business of electricity supply is, they would be able to supply us with a report which would enable us to take action within a period of three months.  Assuming that three months would not be too short a time, I think that we ought to vote supply for the Board for no longer period than six months and that we should not give the Minister supply for a longer period.  That should be sufficient time to enable him to make whatever adjustments are necessary <Col N="2111" /> to meet the circumstances and to meet the immediate liabilities of the Board &mdash;to give them such a sum as would cover their commitments for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>We are likely to be at cross-purposes as to the amount that is actually required. That is a difficulty, I admit. When we asked the Minister he said he could not tell us what sum is required. He has given certain indications on which we have based the figure we have put down here.  He has said the Board has overspent to the amount of £600,000.  I am taking it that therefore the Board on the head of that expenditure requires a sum of £600,000.  I would like to know from the Minister whether or not I am correct in that.  Did the Minister mean us to understand when he mentioned a sum of £600,000, that they were debts, so to speak, due by the Board which they had to meet to the extent of £600,000?  That is, their immediate debts, bills, so to speak, that have to be paid, require a sum of £600,000 at the present time to meet them.  I think the Minister, before debating this at any length, as we may be talking at cross-purposes, should inform us on these essential points and should tell us definitely whether he means that that £600,000 is overspent, that there were immediate debts due by the Board which they had to meet and that this sum was required to meet them.  I am going on that assumption at any rate. It is for the Minister to point out in what respect I may be wrong, if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that the Board had to meet some commitments to the extent of £250,000.  I want to know whether when he spoke of commitments to the extent of £250,000, he estimated that the sum of £250,000 in addition to the £600,000 was required by the Board in order to keep them going for the immediate present &mdash;I take it for a period of six months. Assuming that the Minister meant that, we calculate that a sum of £850,000 is required to cover the immediate requirements.  To meet that there is a sum of £550,000, which the <Col N="2112" /> Minister has, of the Board's money. We believe the law was that the Board should get that.  We believe that that is due to the Board, and, therefore, in this proposal our attitude is that that sum should be made available to meet this total sum of £850,000 which they require.  We propose then to add to that a further half million. That will give the Board a sum of one million pounds available to meet liabilities which the Minister had estimated at £850,000.</P>
    <P>I take it that our proposal to give another half million pounds to the Board is generous to the extent of providing £150,000 more than the sum which we understand the Minister says is necessary to meet debts that have been incurred, and to meet the immediate liabilities for, say, the next six months.  In fact we say that the sum we have suggested should be sufficient to give the Board the money required to enable it to operate for a year, if necessary.  The sum is not niggardly, but is generous.  As regards the other sum, which is the subject of dispute, and which is referred to in the agreement we have heard of, namely, £600,000, which remains of what are called the capital liabilities of the acquired undertakings, we propose to take that matter out of dispute altogether, and to deal with it this way: The Board, by its Charter under the Act, is bound to indemnify and to keep indemnified local authorities from whom these undertakings have been taken over in regard to the capital debts of those bodies.  We propose that that sum should be put at the disposal of the Minister for Finance to enable him to meet any demand that may be made by the Board on the basis of keeping them indemnified with respect to the clearing off of any capital debts.  In order to know the exact situation in respect to all the undertakings, we would have to have details of the nature of the capital borrowings of the local authorities concerned, and to know whether they are redeemable at a certain time or not.  If there were not certain periods in which this capital sum was to be redeemed, we do not understand why the Minister <Col N="2113" /> wanted the £600,000 at all.  Clearly, the Board was responsible for meeting sinking fund and interest on the loans, and if they are going to be paid off in the usual way, by sinking fund and interest annually, then the Board was responsible for meeting the annual payments and meeting them out of revenue. Lest there should be some undertakings where some extraordinary arrangements were made, which we do not know of, for the repayment of the loans, we propose to give the Minister for Finance authority to pay over to the Board as and when required, any sum that may be necessary in accordance with the conditions of the original borrowing, to meet the capital liability.  Therefore, the position would be as regards these liabilities, that the Board would meet from year to year the annual payments, the interest and sinking fund necessary, and if there were some conditions in the original borrowings which demanded that the capital sums be paid, then those capital sums would be available to the Board on requisition to the Minister for Finance.  I hope Deputies understand what we are trying to do.  We want to take the question of the capital liabilities of the acquired undertakings away altogether from the sums being voted to the Board.  We want to get them aside, only to be used if it should be necessary for the Board to make application for them.  The ordinary liabilities from year to year to meet sinking fund and interest, should be met by the Board out of revenue.  I think that was the position the Board took up.  We do not want to alter it. Once we have taken away the question of the capital liabilities of these acquired undertakings, and set them apart to be dealt with on a special basis of their own, we have provided for the Board a sum of money necessary to cover immediate debts and immediate working needs for the period just ahead.</P>
    <P>We think then that our proposal from the point of view of finance is in no way niggardly at all, that it is on that basis generous and we think that the Dáil, in order to preserve its own rights to interfere if <Col N="2114" /> there is any other proposal which the Minister may have in mind and which he has not revealed here, ought not to put him in a position in which he can go off on his own to agree with the Board to do things that have not come before the Dáil for sanction. There were, for instance, certain debts mentioned.  The Minister pointed out that these debts could not be met by that sum.  But there may be other things.  These were ones that occur to us at first sight.  They appeared immediately.  There may be other things the Minister may want to do with this lump sum for which he has not given any detailed budget.  We do not propose to give him that lump sum. We believe that the sum proposed here, £500,000 in addition to the £560,000 which is due to the Board, which together comes to over a million, would cover the £850,000, and as regards the other question of the capital liabilities, that that should be dealt with in a separate way, and that if there are any payments due on that particular score that the Minister for Finance should be empowered to deal with them.</P>
    <P>That covers our proposals.  As I say I want if we can to have here before us, before there are any further commitments in this particular matter, what we have not got at the present time, full information.  We are anxious that this enterprise should not suffer by reason of anything that has happened between the Minister and Board.  We believe that the best interests of the Shannon scheme will be served by getting experts' statements on the position which will be authoritative. Any statement by the Minister or by some accountant or auditors who would be incapable of presenting the scheme as a whole would not be enough.  We want to get from the experts in this particular business a statement as to what, in the present position, are the prospects of the Board and some estimate as to what sums of money would be required for the best development for the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe has asked me in the course of a long and <Col N="2115" /> wandering discourse would I be prepared to come to this House at some date and tell the House what my interference with the Board has cost the country&mdash;I am not quite sure that that was the word he used, but it was its implication&mdash;what my interference with the Board has cost.  I am going to do that now.  If I could find out what was the smallest coin that has ever been before the Deputy's mind in any business transaction which he ever had to carry out, and if I had that coin divided into one million parts, I would not accept responsibility for the one-hundredth section of one of these parts.  That is what I have cost the scheme by what I have done.  But one of these days I shall have to put before the House and tell the House what my interference and the interference of the people I put in upon the Board has saved the country.  That would be a big sum, indeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe made amends to-day with regard to one letter on which he certainly had wrong ideas on the last day.  But having made amends, he proceeded to say that his view of the letter which he has now before him, is the same as he described it a few days ago&mdash;that I refused a discussion.  The letter clearly states that I was going to put it as a point of order to the Chair that there should be no discussion of the Electricity Supply Board Accounts on my Vote, but winds up that if a debate were wanted there was a way of getting it&mdash;the general way of arranging for time with the Government Whip.</P>

      <P>What it said was: &ldquo;It is not the Minister's present intention....&rdquo; The letter, however, went on: &ldquo;If, however, there is a desire to have the reports and accounts discussed, and that an application for such discussion would seem to be approved by a fair number of Deputies from a particular Party or from several Parties, it seems to the Minister that the proper course to follow would be to seek an arrangement with the Government Whip as to the setting aside of time for the purpose.&rdquo; Is that refusing a day?  That is the point upon which the Deputy based his allegations that I refused to have the accounts discussed.  He adds this further statement by way of insult, after making amends to-day, that it was clear from other statements of mine that I never wanted any discussion. The Deputy will, I hope, in the course of some later debate, refer me to one or two quotations which make it clear that I never wanted a discussion on this.  I courted discussion. I remember on a couple of occasions when people like Deputy Flinn were disclosing their ignorance to the countryside at cross-roads, asking why they would not discuss this sort of thing here where it could be answered.  But I never got any of them bold enough to attempt a discussion.  I looked for discussion.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wanted to shake my credit later on in his speech.  That was his long irrelevant point to-day.  He stated that when he asked if any compensation was paid to the Chairman I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I asked him to quote what I said.  This is exactly what I said: &ldquo;I could answer that question by saying `no,' but that would be misleading.  He did not get compensation on resignation, but he got it by way of extra remuneration on being appointed as a part-time member.&rdquo; Those are exactly the facts and if I had to study that particular question and that reply for a couple of days I would not change any part of that reply.

      <P>What I said was&mdash;I think it was clear to every Deputy&mdash; that I was inclined to give a hasty judgment on the last occasion when the accounts were mentioned and to side with the Minister in thinking that there had been unconscionable delay.  But on thinking over it since and realising that the accounts of this House are not presented in full form for over a year, that the accounts of the Post Office are not presented in final form for a year and a half, and that these are long established so to speak, and running on routine lines, I asked myself have I not been guilty of a very hasty judgment when I judged as against the Board on that account, on the question of fact as to whether they were late or not and as to whether there was blame.  I was inclined to attach blame to the Board for having them so late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe I hope will take a lesson from that.  I can leave this matter of the accounts aside without much more ado. The Deputy thinks that because I have power to prescribe accounts under Section 7 I have power to appoint myself almost an official of the Board.  I can prescribe accounts and see that they are asked for, but that does not say that I will get them.  I have prescribed a form of accounts and asked for information repeatedly, pressed about them and wrote letters about them.  Deputy de Valera said the material was there but that unfortunately it could not be put together for the auditors.  I have evidence that records were not there. The material was not there, and what these outsiders have been doing, and I am informed now that the number has gone up from 7 to 17, is not putting the material together but doing what the accounts side of that particular organisation should have been doing for about two years, collecting information that should have been in hands.  Deputy de Valera is in a peculiar position over this.  The other day he was inclined to pass what he thinks <Col N="2120" /> now would have been a harsh judgment upon the Board, because he thought the accounts might be in the arrear, &ldquo;in a mess&rdquo;&mdash;somebody used that phrase.  He thinks it is unfortunate. He thinks we should not be too harsh on this new business.  As far as the accounts are concerned he keeps in his usual state of philosophic doubt.  At any rate, he is not going to pass judgment on the Board in the matter of the accounts.  The Board is out of it as far as one of the three charges I made against it are concerned. He says that he understands the material is there and that it is only a matter of putting the material in order for the auditors.  That I can assure him is not the case.  People have been engaged on remaking records, getting receipts, looking for invoices, and so on.  The whole system of records was disorganised.  There was no material for the auditors, but the Deputy has his own view upon that.  He says the Board is all right. At any rate, he will not pass judgment upon the Board.</P>
      <P>As far as the agreement is concerned the Deputy again reserves judgment.  Until the documents are published the Deputy will not say one thing or another.  The third thing is the major item of policy.  On that the Deputy's conclusion is that there must have been some system approaching a budgetary system.  So on the three items which I really felt I was by implication charging against the Board, the Deputy said I am not in a position to pass judgment.  Nevertheless he will not give them any money.</P>

      <P>There however is the situation.  Yet the Deputy will not allow this Board to get money.  The Deputy, as a matter of fact, is talking not really what he believes when he said what I have repeated.  In fact he has a feeling in his heart that there is something wrong and he is quite right in refusing the money but he cannot refuse the money on the ground he has stated.  The Deputy says I have found fault with the Board for not living within this two and a half million pounds.  I do not know if that charge comes from any words of mine.  I never said it.  I said that when the Board guaranteed not to spend more than two and a half millions of money they should not have spent more.  If they found that they could not keep within that sum it was their job to come to me and make the case for more money, so that I could make the case to this House.  Even after I got word from them that they could not keep within the guarantee I wrote and said, &ldquo;give me your view of a reasonable programme on which I can make a case to the Dáil, and guarantee the reasonableness of that programme.&rdquo; I never got satisfaction on that.  That is the reason why there should be hesitation in this House in voting this money to-day, until something approaching a reasonable case is made and until a realisation is had of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  At that time I asked the Board to realise its circumstances and mine, and try and meet the conditions that ordinarily would attach to the granting of the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said that I want this money for the indirect purpose of being able to insist on the Board working as I desire it should work and not as the Board desires.  That raises the general question&mdash;we should know where we stand about this Board. Deputy Briscoe's implication on the question as to what I have cost the country by my attitude towards the <Col N="2122" /> Board is exactly the same as Deputy Lemass's explicit statement.  Deputy Lemass explicitly stated that I am to be held responsible for all that has happened, on this special ground, apart from anything else, that I appointed the members of the Board.  We have this position then with regard to an independent board, that if the Minister or the Executive Council appoints an independent board, and leaves them clearly to act as an independent board, they are nevertheless responsible at the end of the time for what that independent board has done.  They are responsible in so far as they have appointed the men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And re-appointed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reservation which the Deputy can make later. The statement to which he nodded assent was that merely by appointing, the people appointing took responsibility for what happened.  If that is to be the case, where shall we ever get an independent board?  If that is going to be the situation, I want clearly and definitely to be put into the position of guardian, so that I shall be aware of my responsibility.  If you are going to have an independent board, you cannot say that you are going to indict with everything that happens thereafter the people who appointed, simply because they did appoint.  I do not see how the House is going to get out of that dilemma.  It is Deputy de Valera's dilemma and Deputy Lemass'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the position is that I am in the new Bill as the phrase is there about certifying reasonable expenditure, but without that phrase, it appears that as the person who appoints, I am going to be landed with the full responsibility for everything that happens.  I wonder where is the great scheme of the independent board that everybody praised here the other night&mdash;an experiment so useful that &ldquo;it might be applied to other matters affecting the economic life of the country.&rdquo; In any event, somebody must appoint unless we are to leave the appointment to the Dáil generally, which would be merely shirking responsibility.  The Government by the mere fact of appointing is going to be held responsible <Col N="2123" /> afterwards for everything that happens. Under this present Bill, I must certify that moneys are reasonably and properly required before they are granted.  If I am to be held responsible for everything done merely because I appoint, I am going to take very good care that I shall supervise every act the Board does.  I do not think that the situation here is the proper situation. It is not the one I want to see hereafter, but there are circumstances at this moment which require a better guardianship than there has been.  But I disclaim all responsibility for things the Board has done since the date of its appointment until this particular Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has several amendments down to this Bill.  He wants to insert &ldquo;for the purposes mentioned in sub-section (3)&rdquo; in Section 3.  He has made clear in his speech that he wants to prevent two things.  In the first place, he wants to ensure that none of this money will be expended in meeting, say, extra charges made upon me in respect of the construction works. That is not possible under the Bill. He says, further, that he wants to prevent extra money being advanced for the provision of additional generation. I said that, under the Bill, I did not think that that was possible.  I made a reservation on that.  But the Deputy's amendment does not save the position at all, because anything that was possible in the way of additional generation work would occur under the particular sub-section to which he attaches his amendment. What that power is under that sub-section I do not clearly know, but I want to refer to one matter to show the doubts that may arise.  Section 28 gives the Board power to &ldquo;conduct such investigations, experiments and trials as the Board thinks fit for the improvement of the methods of transmission, distribution and supply of electricity or of the utilisation of fuel, water power or other means of generating electricity and may establish and maintain a testing laboratory for the testing and standardisation of electrical instruments.&rdquo; The Board may also &ldquo;take such measures as in the opinion <Col N="2124" /> of the Board are calculated to advance the exploitation of water power in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; The section then goes on to deal with a special point about hydrometric survey work.  There is one other section that has general provisions of that type.  My intention is that if there was any proposition really for additional generating plant, that ought to come before the House on a clearly-stated proposal.  But there may be some proposal which provides extra generation power incidentally. You can almost make a distinction by value.  It is quite clear that nothing could be done by way of experiment or investigation or trial that would really amount to a considerable sum of money &mdash;say, £100,000.  It is quite possible that the Board under that section might do certain things which, in fact, would give extra power &mdash; provide an extra peak load.  That would be possible under the Act and it would be possible under the Deputy's amendment. My general proposition is this: So far as extra Shannon works on any scale are concerned, they are not in the Bill and they cannot be in the Bill.  So far as money for extra generation is concerned, it is the State's business to look after the provision of extra generation.  If there was any proposal for that, it would have to come before the House upon a particular scheme. But there may be things the Board will do by way of stand-by provision in particular places to which that would not apply.  They might so increase stand-by provision as to allow, for instance, three turbines at Ardnacrusha to be used for ordinary purposes instead of two.  That would be within the Board's powers under the Act and under the Bill, and it would be within the Deputy's amendment. I think it is quite right that that should be within their power.  These being the two points, and making that reservation to which I referred, I think the Bill and the amendment are much on the same footing. But the amendment might prevent the money being used for other things which it is clearly right it should be used for.</P>
    <P>Outside those points, there are two points to which I desire now to refer. <Col N="2125" /> One point which was raised dealt with the amount of money to be paid and the other point dealt with control by the Minister.  Deputy Lemass advanced two proposals.  One proposal was that we should set aside a sum of £600,000 for the undischarged liabilities of acquired undertakings.  Nobody need bother now about undischarged liabilities.  They are there and we know what is happening to them. They are being carried on in the way which we always intended they should be.  We always intended that the two and a half million pounds should represent both new capital payments and the capitalised value of the liabilities that we took over.  But nobody has ever advanced any absurd proposition as to paying off these liabilities at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did you want £600,000 docked off the Board's two and a half million pounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wanted that money for other special purposes. You might as well put the case that because I did not vote them three and a half million pounds I docked a million off them.  The whole idea was to get a figure which would represent capital which the Board could remunerate.  On a combination of a great many things, we agreed that that figure would be represented by two and a half million pounds.  We knew that part of that would represent the capital liabilities of these undertakings taken over by the Board, but to say that I was stopping money from them because of that knowledge is equivalent to saying that because I did not give them an extra million, therefore I stopped an extra million from them.  The picture we wanted to get was to consist of a figure which the Board could remunerate on the distribution side.  The picture put up to me as the perfect picture was two and a half million pounds including the undischarged liabilities item. But there was no question of stopping money.  In the course of my letter to the Board, I pointed out that that was the position, and I said later on in August, 1929, that I would make any change with regard to giving them <Col N="2126" /> extra money if they made a case to me.  They have never made a case in a satisfactory way.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that he was prepared to make a new arrangement with the Board.  On one occasion, the Board wanted to be relieved in respect of a certain agreement because the situation was such that they could not allow that sum of £600,000 to be put aside.  That representation was made to the Minister and it appears to me that the Minister said that his action on that was to tell them that he would bring the matter to the Dáil and tell the Dáil that this £600,000 was included in the original sum and that it should not go to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing up two things.  At the time that I said I would go to the Dáil to make clear that the original sum included the £600,000 the Board made no good case that they wanted to be relieved of the agreement. The Board later made a statement to me that a reasonable programme could not be carried out within the limitation laid down.  Our retort was: &ldquo;What is a reasonable programme?&rdquo; We pointed out that it must be shown that it was reasonable. Supposing I had not got that information, as I did not get it, and that I came to this House, what position would I have been in?  The same position as I am in now or, perhaps, a much worse position, because I would have to say: &ldquo;The Board tell me they cannot carry on on this particular sum of money.  They ask for more.  I asked them to make a case, to show me that this money could be remunerated and they cannot do so.&rdquo; Who would vote money under these circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £600,000 is outside this.  The Deputy, I suppose, wants to show that the agreement is not there.  He says there is something like half a million available; add another half million or so and you have £1,100,000 and that ought to be sufficient.  The Deputy put a further point: what is the control, if any?  The Deputies opposite want an independent Board.  The Board is to be independent, but still the point is <Col N="2127" /> made that people are to be held responsible for everything that happens. The suggestion has been made that the Board should draw the undischarged liability money without any check.  What is going to happen to the £600,000 that is still on hands?  The claim made from the opposite side is that it is to be drawn without any check.</P>

      <P>The case put up is that the £600,000 is to go out without any check.  It is to be paid on demand being made to the Minister for Finance.  But while that is so, the £500,000 is to be put under control. If Deputy de Valera has the opinion of the Board that he states, why not give the Board the £1,100,000 without any control whatever?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>People who want an independent Board are surely concerned at seeing that there is some check upon that half million.  The Deputies opposite are not accepting the case I make.  They are in further doubt as to whether there is a case at all.  They are not clear why certain people resigned or whether their resignations ought to have been accepted. They are prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt.  They want, nevertheless to have a check upon the Board by having the Minister to take control, but their position is that the £600,000 ought to go to the Board on demand. That seems to me a rather mixed situation.</P>
      <P>I want to make my position clear with regard to control.  I would ask the Dáil not to accept the position that the Party opposite is taking up with regard to the Board, that if it is appointed in an independent way with all the marks of independence upon it, merely because someone appoints the members of it, he is going to be held responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No man is going to accept responsibility for a board unless he has some say in its movements.  If <Col N="2128" /> he is going to be held responsible simply because he has the power to appoint and the power to dismiss, a power that has never been exercised, then the only decent step to take is to say, &ldquo;We will be fully responsible, and we want that made clear.&rdquo; If we are to go back to an independent board, the case I would make is that if the man appointing has exercised proper judgment, and if the people appointed are men whose reputation is such that a good case could be made for their appointment, he should not be held responsible if they turn out badly in the course of operations.</P>
      <P>If I were to consult my own wishes in this matter of freedom from responsibility and of not having to answer questions I would say take the Ministers out of it.  But if I am to act with any sense of responsibility I would not advise the Dáil to vote one five pound note in the present circumstances without keeping the double check of the two Ministers.  Remember there is more than one Minister.  The Minister for Finance may advance if the Minister for Industry and Commerce certifies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has to certify certain things, and after that it is not compulsory on the Minister for Finance to advance the money.  There are two &ldquo;mays&rdquo; that have to be got over.</P>
      <P>As far as this Vote is concerned, if there is not £2,000,000 granted in the circumstances that I am going to detail I personally will not accept willingly any responsibility for any part of this money.  I do not know what the Minister for Finance may do, but I would recommend him not to accept responsibility for anything less than the £2,000,000.  If that sum is not going to be voted, then take the Ministers out of it altogether.  It must be admitted that I have certain inside information. If the House were to ask me to take responsibility for the running of the Board over a period of time I would not take responsibility for the Board's actions being properly carried out for a less sum than the £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the period of time we are told that we should get in experts. That is the phrase that has been used. <Col N="2129" /> I do not know what type these experts are going to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what sort of work they are going to do.  If you were to bring experts here within the next week I do not know that we could give them an hour's good work so far as the affairs of the Board are concerned.  There is nothing to put before an expert, nothing that you could ask an expert opinion on.  There would be nothing to put before an expert until, at any rate, after the 1929-30 accounts have been produced, and to my mind until the 1930-31 accounts have been produced.  There will be nothing for an expert to give an opinion on until the position revealed, whatever it may be, by the 1930-31 accounts has been examined, to see what, if any, financial readjustments in the whole scheme are necessary, to see whether any increased charges may be necessary to see whether a new charge system of a certain kind should be made, on the revelation that the present charges are too low or too high.  To call in an expert at this moment would be to call in a man on false pretences.  At the moment there is nothing to ask an expert opinion on.  There will be no work that an expert could do until the accounts for the year ended March last have been produced, until after you have had auditors working on them, and until there has been an opportunity given for considering the auditors' report as well as possible readjustment arising out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that even then it will be necessary to call in experts. But if it is necessary at any time that will be the time.  When is that period likely to come?  The accounts for the year 1929-30 are approaching final form.  They are ready to be submitted to audit.  The audit will take some time.  After that I have the right to look into them to make certain proposals with regard to them.  It may be that the accounts will have to go backward and forward between the firm of auditors and myself.  All that will take time.  After that they will be produced to the <Col N="2130" /> House with whatever reports are considered necessary to clarify them.  It may take some time to get the reports necessary to clarify them.  The earliest date that I would put on the accounts of 1929-30 being ready would be October or November of this year.</P>
    <P>The accounts for the year ending the 31st March, 1931, must then be taken up.  They will later have to go to the auditor.  His report will have to be sent to me.  Eventually, with whatever reports are considered necessary the accounts will be laid before the House.  The earliest date, I think, at which the House can have these later accounts is February or March of next year, and if any real consideration is to be given to such readjustments as may be considered necessary arising out of them it may well be that they will not be available before Easter, 1932.  Then there is the possibility that most people envisage, that there will have to be legislation brought in to deal with the readjustment of the Board.  Take that as one thing.  When is that legislation going to be drafted and ready for introduction? During all that time the Board must carry on.  I do not see all that being done before, at the very earliest, this time next year.</P>
    <P>I am asked what moneys will be required.  I gave a certain figure as representing the debts that the Board had already incurred.  I took the sum representing the accrued liabilities as being somewhere between £600,000 and £700,000.  The latest figure that I have got dates back to the end of June. At that date the Board's accrued liabilities amounted to about £720,000. That means that if they had £720,000 in hands at the end of June they would not have had as much as one shilling on the 2nd or 3rd of July.  That is the position with regard to the £720,000. It could have been paid out immediately; it could have been demanded at once.</P>
    <P>They will require a certain amount of money for working capital.  It is a very hard figure to judge.  There is a very bad period in the Board's financial year when moneys are not coming in and when certain expenditure has to be made.  That occurs about the end of <Col N="2131" /> July, or in August and September. Supposing you say that there would be a sum of not less than £53,000 or £54,000 required for that period.  In my opinion it is not enough, but those figures have been put to me.  I talked earlier of the Board's commitments.  I talked of what I called their inextricable commitments at one time.  I tried to get the figure of a quarter of a million then mentioned split up, one item estimated on the basis of work already engaged upon, material ordered, contracts placed, and a second amount referring to work of which it cannot be said that all those things have been actually done.  For networks and substations being erected by outside firms of contractors; for networks and substations being erected by the Board's staff where the material was ordered by the staff, and for the reconstruction of networks, there is a sum of £115,000. That is a deduction, and a very big deduction, from the money I previously set against commitments.  That is money that must be spent.  When I go on to refer to what I am bulking as future requirements an amount of this second item is very nearly in the position of actual commitments. The amount actually committed will be nearly a quarter of a million, but I have sub-divided it into the £115,000 referred to and what I now go on to discuss.</P>
    <P>I have here a statement with regard to certain sub-heads of expenditure, and I want to preface my remarks on these sub-heads by saying that these are not being put forward to the House in the same way as sub-heads in an ordinary estimate would be put forward.  The statement is put forward with the definite understanding that any part of the money not spent on a particular sub-head can be removed and spent on some other sub-head.  The thing is very provisional. It is the best that could be given in a very limited period of time, and it has to be taken subject to the reservation that the Board do not admit themselves as committed to the expenditure of all or any of the money under the sub-heads. They might spend more on some sub-heads than on others, or than is <Col N="2132" /> actually estimated.  The Board say that the expenditure that is absolutely necessary to safeguard supply in Dublin, including Rathmines and Pembroke; in Cork and in Limerick, providing for the normal growth in load, would amount to £133,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to speak about the period in a moment. This is the first statement giving block figures.  The expenditure necessary to safeguard supply in all other areas in the country at present supplied, providing for the normal growth in load, is £77,300.  The reconstruction and connection to the Shannon system of five named towns&mdash;named to me, but I do not propose to name them here&mdash; where economies will be effected by closing down fuel stations at present operated by the Board, will cost £45,000.  Provision for a supply to completely new areas&mdash;this, to my mind, is a very small estimate&mdash; amounts to £37,000.  For the cost of acquisition, reconstruction and connection to the Shannon system of towns which have existing undertakings there is a sum of £270,400. Provision for connecting new individual consumers to the Shannon system, including the cost of meters comes to £224,000.  Public lighting, that is, the erection of both lamps and cables for public lighting, £27,000.  The sum of about £133,000 is roughly divided up between alterations to the main transmission system, to improve supply, and to maintain the present supply in a satisfactory way; improvements at the Pigeon House for stand-by purposes; improvements at Fleet Street and elsewhere to safeguard supply, and improvements at the Pigeon House and Fleet Street to meet an increased load.  For all those items there is a sum of from £133,000 to £135,000.  There is a sum for contingencies amounting to about £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Are those figures which the Minister has read an addition to the first three items?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Additional to the accrued liabilities, the working capital and the inextricable <Col N="2133" /> commitments.  As regards the period, I do not know how this can be divided with regard to period at all.  I am told with regard to certain items that they are absolutely necessary immediately. Part of them are so absolutely necessary that they are tied up in the £250,000 for which I have now substituted a figure of £115,000.  The rest of the £250,000 is contained somewhere in the later list and, therefore, is not merely necessary somewhere in the immediate future, but is possibly contracted for in the peculiar conditions at the moment.  There are certain items that could be picked out and one could say that they spread themselves over a couple of years.  For instance, there is an item in connection with acquiring, reconstruction and connecting to the Shannon system towns that have an existing undertaking, and the amount in that respect is £270,000.  Clearly, that amount will not be spent in the one year.  Then there is provision for connecting new individual consumers to the system. The £224,000 there would not be spent in a twelve months period and quite clearly they do not propose to spend the £27,000 in the next twelve months for lamps and cables for public lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the towns that have existing undertakings, at the moment the Board can only acquire by agreement. There may be a period when some fortunate circumstances may occur in a particular town which would make the Board seek to acquire in that particular town earlier than it normally would.  There may be a town where the present undertaker might say: &ldquo;I am bearing all the load I can.  I have not put any money into reconstruction, and demands are being made by consumers to extend or give a better supply.  If I am not going to be bought out at this period at a particular figure, I must be allowed to sink fresh capital.&rdquo; If he is not bought out then and there the day of his eventual acquisition will be indefinitely postponed.  While one may say that certain sums must be expended in the next twelve months, one does not <Col N="2134" /> know when suitable circumstances may occur and when one may be called upon to expend the money.  A further point on the time question arises.  If this money is going to be under the control of a Minister or under the control of two Ministers and I ask the Dáil to vote this money deliberately knowing this&mdash;it means definitely a slowing up in the Board's operations.  Let me assume that some of the money will be required for works that ought to be operating round about, say, the autumn of 1932. To get the works operating by the autumn of 1932 the order for the particular materials must be placed by a particular time in advance.  Before that has been placed there must be an investigation of the circumstances as to whether they warrant the laying out of the money in that way. There must be added on to this some period also in which the Board will be able to convince the Minister that that expenditure is necessary.  When you take all that, the sum of money, big as it looks, and the purpose for which it is required, and the added fact that there is going to be an additional period, a very long period probably, in which the Board must make its case to two Ministers for the expenditure of any of the money, I think that it is not too big in relation to the circumstances, and I ask that that two millions should be voted here and now for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that they could not do that within the figure but that they could not do a reasonable programme within the particular figure. But, to get on, supposing that this new sum of two millions is spent. If all the Board has to deliver to consumers is the maximum output of the partial development of the Shannon scheme then that money cannot be remunerated?  The Shannon scheme was established as far as the first Act was concerned as a bulk supply system. We then went on to the distribution side.  There were two or three variables in the whole calculation.  One was the amount of power which could be produced at Ardnacrusha.  The second was the amount of power for which there were consumers in this country; and the third the prices at which consumers would buy and at which electricity would be offered to them.  We know that at this moment we are up to the full delivery of all the power that Ardnacrusha can produce in a dry season.  We must get a stand-by, and extra plant.  Part of that money will be for certain stand-by arrangements at the Pigeon House, which will enable Ardnacrusha to produce at its extreme and the money may even go further than Ardnacrusha production. Certainly I would not contemplate the spending of that two millions unless I saw more units possible of delivery to consumers than what the Shannon partial development of itself in a dry year can deliver.  If I am asked will this money be remunerated I say it most probably will and promise that it will not be spent unless an absolutely good case has been made that it is going to be remunerated.  I <Col N="2136" /> want to make a reservation again. Debts have to be met and for these debts I take no responsibility.  They are there and they will have to be paid.  Once it is clear that the debts are there and that the people who are getting the money are the proper recipients of it there is not very much more to be done with that item.  As to the new money certainly my attitude is going to be not to examine into every detail of the constructional work because there is 90 per cent. of it about which I know nothing but I will want a financial statement to be put up establishing with reasonable certainty that the money will be remunerated. I ask for the £2,000,000 under such a check.  Deputy Lemass said that I put a proposal to the House which is merely guess-work.  I described it myself as unsatisfactory. I have given more satisfaction now&mdash;I do not know how much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>By no means.  The two and a half millions would have done a certain amount of work and the two and a half millions applied to certain works undoubtedly would have been remunerated.  Certain money was spent in other directions.  I do not know definitely how well or how wisely it has been spent or how far it is going to be remunerated but nobody ever thought that the Board was going to operate on a particular scale, going to do everything in one gulp as it proceeded to do.  I do not believe anyone would have put up two and a half millions for that.  All the time, in this correspondence, the proposal was put to the Board: &ldquo;You promised to limit your expenditure to a certain sum of money.&rdquo; When they stated that they had not done that I made a case against them on that point.  I said I would not lightly give any new money to people who did not keep an undertaking.  I wanted certain readjustments in their position. I did not make the case that that was the point to close down upon expenditure; I would even have gone on and relived them of the undertaking made <Col N="2137" /> with the Executive Council and come to the Dáil with regard to it.  There are to my mind developments that can go on to another two million pounds in addition to what I now request from the Dáil.</P>

      <P>They are paying it off.  I will now get back to what I started with.  As to guesswork, there is less of guesswork now.  I do not know how far it is satisfactory, but I want to make this clear: From the investigation I have been able to make and the contact I have had with people working very earnestly on the production of these figures I am not going again to be put in the position of having accusations made against me of starving a particularly good development, and I will not take responsibility <Col N="2138" /> for running this thing, in the way that it is in the Bill, for any figure less than the two million pounds provided. We will not quibble about £100,000 or £150,000 or £200,000.  The round figure required is two million pounds, and it is to be given under the check of two Ministers, and these two Ministers are clearly going to be held responsible for the expenditure of that sum.  I limit responsibility to that £2,000,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass gives me an opportunity to refer to a previous quotation of his in a debate in 1929.  The Deputy gave me a quotation the purpose of which, he will admit, was to show that I said the original estimate of £5,200,000 was fixed and binding.  I denied that.  He gave me a quotation earlier and purported to read it to-day. I asked him did he see any difference in the two quotations.  He has not answered that.  What he did in 1929 was to take two sentences of mine.  He quoted the second sentence first, then he quoted the first sentence and stopped at the comma and left out half of it.  Yet he does not realise the object apparently of the part omitted.</P>

      <P>Has the Deputy read and compared the quotation with the original?  Here is the point the Deputy left out.  He read a broken sentence: &ldquo;...but the only scheme that is under consideration at the moment is the scheme entailing a cost of £5,200,000.  Nobody can question that is the amount which we are considering, because for that we have binding estimates, if we care to accept tenders here and now....&rdquo; Full stop in the Deputy's quotation, but in the actual quotation, a comma, and then it continued, &ldquo;with the exception of the item referred to by Deputy Thrift on page 80, limited to civil constructional costs.&rdquo; (Official Debates, Vol. 10, cols. 2019-2020).</P>

He will not verify what that particular item would cover.  What is the item referred to on page 80?  It is this: that these things were subject to an up or down, a plus or minus, ten per cent., and they are fixed and binding within that limit.

If the Deputy goes back he will see that there was nothing dinned into people's heads more than that limitation was.

      <P>Yes, to-day, when he knew he was going to be challenged. In 1929 he distorted what I said.  He took the second sentence and put it first and cut out the remainder of the first sentence.  Nothing in the scheme was more argued about or made so clear as that all these costs we are considering were, on the construction side, subject to 10 per cent. variation.  Whatever the Deputy may say about it from time to time he must go back to these statements made and refer me to any increase over and beyond what I indicated there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy says that we are voting money now to a Board of a particular type.  He takes away from it the three part-time members because he considers they are not really on the Board. He says that the two full-timers were there when these excesses mounted up and when the accounts got into confusion. They were not.  The material whose absence has delayed the production of the accounts had disappeared before these people went on the Board.  These two people went on the Board on a definite statement from me that I could state nothing precisely as to the affairs at that time of that Board, but that I feared there was a bad situation with regard to the accounts, that if they went on the Board, undoubtedly their reputation was going to be blurred by people of an unfeeling type who would say: They are on the Board and the thing is not right yet and therefore they are to be condemned.&rdquo; I spoke earlier of my efforts in connection with the scheme.  That is the Parliamentary formula a Minister has to adopt when he takes responsibility.  But if I am to apportion credit I must say that the greatest part of the effort I had to make with regard to the Shannon scheme in keeping it right depended on the work of Mr. Fay, who has gone on the Board.  Of Mr. Browne, I confine myself at this moment to the statement that no better choice could have been made in the circumstances I feared the Board was in to grip and right those circumstances.  People who are ready to weaken statements from <Col N="2142" /> me by labelling them ex parte simply conclude that because two men who went on this Board not knowing whether a certain situation was good, bad, or indifferent, did not right matters in the interval we cannot have confidence in them.  That is to judge them in as harsh a way as men were ever judged.  They have put in an enormous amount of work to get the situation clear.  Since they went on the Board we began to get letters which announced clearly that the Board had at last begun to realise where they were going.  In June or July, 1930, they were able to tell me that they had got the Board to agree to the calling in of an outside firm of auditors&mdash;the first reassuring thing the Board had done&mdash;to try and get the position clear.</P>

      <P>In their report at the end of the accounts.  There is going to be reorganisation of the Board, we are told.  I have not said all that has been inferred about that, I hope. I have said that the part-timers have got a certain limited term of appointment, that they would have a larger term only I wanted to have discussion with them on what they considered should be their effective power on the Board; what we should associate with that power in the way of complementary responsibility for the Board's affairs.  My view is that there should be a business element of that kind associated with the Board in a part-time capacity.  Procedure may have to be established whereby they would act in particular ways on particular subjects, but they should be there. I have no reason to lose faith in these three people.  I would have recommended the Council to reappoint them if they had recently resigned. Not only did I not lose faith in the two appointed as full-time members in <Col N="2144" /> 1930&mdash;and I have no reason to lose faith in them&mdash;but the faith which I had in them has been increased by their attitude on the Board since they went there in 1930. If there is going to be reorganisation it would only be very limited with regard to personnel.  There may have to be readjustment with regard to the effective power and responsibilities of the part-timers.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Dáil with a sense of responsibility only, and not from any sense of liking power, that I would like to have for a particular period, two Ministers associated with the expenditure of this money, and that period will certainly, in my mind, not be less than this time next year.  While these two Ministers have control two millions should be at their disposal for the Board along the lines stated.  I am making this statement to the Dáil, that while I have responsibility, I am going to make it a condition that they will show the probability or certainty of remunerating any new money to be spent.  For the debts I take no responsibility.  For any less sum than two millions I will have to consider my position and to ask the Minister for Finance to consider whether he or I will take any responsibility for the action of the Board in the next twelve months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment on the paper and I would like to have an opportunity of explaining it.  When I spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill I think I made it clear that I was much more concerned about what was likely to happen in the future than with what had happened in the past.  I complained that in his opening statement the Minister had not told us what steps were being taken to set right the state of affairs that had existed up to that time.  I also indicated my unwillingness to sign what amounts to a blank cheque for two millions.  I am quite ready to admit that in his closing speech on the Second Reading the Minister removed a good many of my doubts, especially in appointing a firm of auditors to examine the affairs of the Board over a period of six or seven months, and when he stated that steps were being <Col N="2145" /> taken to bring order into the affairs of the Board.  That went a considerable distance to ease my objection in that respect.  I will admit again that in making the case for the two millions in the speech which he has just delivered, the Minister has gone a certain distance to remove my objections, but he has not gone the whole way. The sum I have set out in my amendment taken in connection with the sum the Minister has in hands, approximately half a million, would be, I believe, quite sufficient to meet any demands that are likely to be made even within the period which the Minister says would be a reasonable period&mdash; twelve months.  He has pointed out that the sums required in all would approximate to a little over two millions. He pointed out that in several instances the sums he mentioned are not likely to be expended within twelve months.  The Minister has also pointed out that by bringing the Minister for Finance into the matter with himself it undoubtedly will mean a slowing up of the operations of the Board.  I think the Minister would be the last to suggest that as between now and this time twelve months the sum of two millions would be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the statements that have been made that the Dáil would have an early opportunity for reviewing the whole situation, if the Minister comes back in twelve months time and gives a satisfactory account of what has taken place by bringing order into the affairs of the Board, and explaining the manner in which the money voted by the House has been spent, I would have no hesitation in voting another sum to be expended for the purposes of the Board.  I think we should take care that within a reasonable time the Minister would come back to the House.  It is clear that we have no guarantee that we can have the kind of discussion that we thought in 1927 we would have on the working of the Board and of its accounts.  If the Minister had to come back here in twelve months time it would ensure discussion such as we have had during the present week of the affairs of the Board.  I think <Col N="2146" /> we are entitled to have such a discussion from the Minister.  Even taking into account what the Minister has stated the sum mentioned in my amendment would place at his disposal one million in addition to the £500,000 already available.  I think that would be quite adequate to carry him on for twelve months, at least, even taking into account what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>With regard to the control and the independence of the Board as I mentioned when the Bill was going through the Dáil in 1927, we had our doubts as to the wisdom of giving that complete measure of independence which the Minister was then so anxious to stress.  I think our doubts have now become certainties.  While I do not take the view-point of Deputy Lemass in this matter, I believe there ought to be responsibility in this House in some form and in a greater form than was given in 1927.  I look at the matter in this way: The Minister says that he had power to reappoint and power to dismiss.  The power of dismissal invested him with the right to make certain inquiries as to whether or not the Board set up was effectively discharging the duties for which it was set up by the Government. When the Minister proceeded to do that he found operating against him the position he took up when the Act was going through. Time and again he stressed the complete and absolute independence of the Board, independence of the Minister, independence of the Government and independence of the Executive Council.  The Board was not long set up when it was realised that it was necessary for somebody to have some control over a body which had got a very large sum of public money, and to look to some extent into its operations. The Minister then found himself up against his own statements.  I am quite sure the Board was not slow to quote very frequently the statements he made in 1927, so far as the independence of the Board was concerned.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand a body being set up and having a very large measure of independence but certainly <Col N="2147" /> not so much as was claimed for this Board.  I would hesitate very much indeed before ever giving a vote which would mean that we would revert in a year or two years' time to the position which was occupied by the Board since it was set up originally. Experience has shown that it cannot be successfully operated in that way. It is not the same as appointing a judge.  When you appoint a judge he is absolutely independent to administer and interpret laws, but a board of this kind is not at all of that nature.  It is getting very large sums of the taxpayers' money, and there must be a connecting link between the taxpayer and the Board.  It would be intolerable simply to set up a body of men, five, six, or eight men, hand them over two and a half millions and simply say that there is no control of any kind over their activities or over the line they strike out for themselves and that until they have done something that is obviously wrong they cannot be interfered with and then all you can do is to dismiss them.  I think that is an impossible position to take up.  The Executive Council is elected by the House and the Minister is elected by the House.  No matter what we think of them we must admit that they are elected by the members of the House who are representatives of the people.  We would be very slow indeed to give the Executive Council or any Minister the measure of independence that is claimed by this Board or that is suggested for this Board.  I do not see what great virtue there is in a board made up of individuals selected, no matter how carefully selected, that we should give them absolute independence.  I think that there should be as I say a connecting link and I think the Minister should be responsible to the House, not again let me emphasise for small matters of detail or whether a particular person should be appointed to a particular post but for major questions of policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself seems to visualise getting back to the present position, and it seems a rather strange position, that sometime he would <Col N="2148" /> claim, as he does claim and, I think, rightly claim, to intervene, to some extent at any rate, in the affairs of the Board and then shed himself of responsibility altogether to this House. That he would claim a certain amount of responsibility to interfere to a limited extent in the affairs of the Board, and that, on the other hand, he would say to the Dáil, &ldquo;You have no right to question me as far as my interference is concerned.&rdquo; I think that is the position that cannot be maintained. As I say, I not only approve of the provision in this measure which gives the Minister certain rights to say whether or not the money should be available&mdash; to be satisfied at least that the expenditure is necessary in the national interests and that the money should be available&mdash;but also of the suggestion that it should be a permanent feature of legislation in that regard.  That need not mean that questions would have to be answered continually upon small matters of administration.</P>

      <P>I think that is very well provided for.  We have not been able to draw the line even now.  We have not been able to draw the line in regard to our independent Board.  The Minister has had to come in in spite of all his own protestations and his action has been approved by the House.  Coming back to the amount of money again, I believe that by fixing on this sum of one million pounds, it will be the most effective way of affording us in this House an opportunity of having a full statement from the Minister as to what has been done in regard to the particular position that exists at the present time, and an opportunity of explaining the plans and the programme which he has in view for the future. For that reason I think the sum which I have set out is a reasonable sum to give the Minister on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to speak in the absence of the Minister, but I suppose that cannot be helped.  The Minister started by telling us in what sum you could estimate the cost to the community of his interference with the <Col N="2149" /> Board.  He went on to tell you his estimate of his value to the country. The two statements rest upon exactly the same authority as the indictment which he has made of absent men who are in the position&mdash;unless this Dáil does the honest and straight thing, to provide them with a fair trial by competent men&mdash;of not being able to answer that charge.  The idea that this Dáil under the Party Whips and under the threat that the action of the Dáil will be regarded as a vote of censure on two Ministers, that it will involve the resignation of their normal functions by two Minister&mdash;the suggestion that it is a trial to which these people who are indicted in their absence can safely appeal for justice, is a ludicrous and dishonest proposal.  I certainly had thought that the more intimate relations which had existed between the Front Bench and those concerned in this indictment would at least have left them with a claim to justice in their trial.  What we are asked to do to-day is to accept the Minister's estimate of himself and his own value&mdash;yes, the Minister's estimate of his own infallibility, and we are asked to accept that under the test of the Party Whip.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to make certain allusions to myself.  He said that on certain occasions&mdash;I only want to get these little things out of the way before we come to the larger matters with which we will have to deal&mdash;I had made certain statements at cross-roads which I had been asked here to justify. I have no recollection of any such occasion, except an occasion when absent and when I read in the paper that the Minister had said that I had with my usual discretion absented myself from a discussion on the Drumm Battery, on which I had made a vicious and vindictive attack in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I answered that in another place and the Minister is perfectly well aware of it.  At no time and under no circumstances, neither here nor elsewhere, had I ever made any attack, vindictive or otherwise, upon the Drumm Battery.  That was purely a gratuituous falsehood.  Why the Minister should drag that in here to-night I do not know, nor do I know of any <Col N="2150" /> other case in which that can be applied.</P>
    <P>I have to clear up one other point. The other night I described Mr. J.C. Foley as being ex-chairman of the Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping of Cork.  That was a mistake.  Mr. Foley is ex-chairman of the Cork Chamber of Commerce and both Chambers concerned are entitled to that explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he  asked for information from this Board, this Board to which he will not give a trial before competent and impartial people, and he had been refused that information or he had failed to get any intelligible information.  Mr. Browne was appointed to that Board in February, 1930.  I am not saying one word against Mr. Browne.  It was to Mr. Browne those inquiries went, and I ask the House whether they believe that over the whole intervening period Mr. Browne did not attempt, and did not, in fact, give very considerable and very useful information. It may not have been, and presumably was not, information right down to the last trouser button. They did not account in the way in which an auditor would probably account for absolute details but I have not personally the shadowiest doubt that Mr. Browne did give information which the Businessmen and the Independents on the Minister's own benches would, if it were given to them, say was useful information and was a useful basis of calculation.  If that is not so then we ask that the whole of the correspondence which passed between the Minister and the Chairman of the Board, and the material which the Chairman of the Board sent to the Minister and which the Minister said is inadequate, shall be laid before us or before some other tribunal, some tribunal more impartial, so that such a tribunal will be in a position to decide as to whether the general impression gathered from the speeches of the Minister is correct and whether the indictment he has made can be founded upon those facts and the facts in these documents.  Again we ask for a discovery of documents upon which <Col N="2151" /> this charge has been made.  Again we say it is not fair nor right that one man who has possession of documents and who has this Dáil as his pulpit and the Press as his sounding board should be allowed to get out an ex parte statement on one side while the other people are not in the position to divulge any single document.  Is Mr. Browne in the position to divulge a document at the present moment? Assuming that every statement made in the Dáil is false, is Mr. Browne in the position to produce documentary evidence assuming that documentary evidence exists?  Is any one of them in a position to produce that evidence?  Surely the Minister knows they are not.  There is utter unrestraint in the misuse, in the misquotation, in the selective misquotation of documents because they know they are secured by the fact that the other people are in a fiduciary position in so far as they are in possession of documents and cannot produce them.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the Minister, merely because he appoints the personnel of a board, so long as he does it in good faith after proper examination of their qualifications, can be held responsible, except in so far as it can be shown that he is responsible for what they do within the function that is delegated to them by the Dáil.  But what is the history in cases of this kind?  You have one member of that Board, a man who was in a very responsible position in this State, a man very well thought of by the President, a man very well thought of by all responsible people in the City of Dublin, you have such a man as Chairman of that Board.  Now he ceased to be Chairman of the Board by enforced resignation, by a resignation which, according to the statement of the Minister, if it had not been tendered would have been substituted by dismissal. He was the man who was told by the Minister that he had no grasp whatever of finance, and that he must be substituted by someone who had a competent knowledge and responsible function in relation to figures and finance.  He was the man that the <Col N="2152" /> Minister told us here was, in his opinion, responsible for the sort of mess that was brought about, and yet he was being retained in that position in order that he might be held as possible evidence in relation to his mess. That man was reappointed to the Board as a part-time member.  He was reappointed to the Board not merely at the salary of an ordinary part-time member, but he was reappointed with a bonus of £1,250 a year.  That was the man whose resignation was being forced, whose resignation if it had not been given would have been substituted by dismissal, the man who had been declared by the Minister to be responsible for the mess.  He has been declared in this House to be incompetent. Why was he given a bonus of £1,250 on reappointment, when the purpose of his reappointment was to hold him there responsible for the mess which he had created?  He was reappointed for five years.  Why was he reappointed for five years if that is correctly his record according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    <P>Does the House believe that that was his record and that the Minister did so appoint him, believing that to be his record?  Is anyone going to say that for any further default or defect by that man on that Board, for any further default or defect of that man due to the presence of that man and his voting power, that the Minister is not directly responsible for all the calculable consequences of his act in reappointing under these circumstances the man whom he has so described to himself and to us?  The Minister is not responsible for any man whom he appoints in good faith, who performs his functions within the Act unless and in so far as it can be proved in this case that the Minister was responsible for knowingly, as I say, reappointing him as temporary officer for five years with a bonus equal to four years' salary, a man whom he had declared to be incompetent and to be unfit.  The Minister is responsible for Mr. Murphy if Mr. Murphy was what the Minister said he was.</P>

      <P>The Minister went on to tell us of the merits of particular men on the Board, how some of them were satisfactory and how some of them were not, why he was going to reappoint some, and under what conditions he was prepared to reappoint others.  The Minister specifically dealt with what he euphemistically called part-timers.  I hope the Chambers of Commerce who have appointed these men like that method of describing their representatives.  What about the part-timers?  What about the ex-President of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the Irish Free State, Mr. J.C. Foley?  What about the ex-member of the Dáil and I think the ex-Parliamentary Secretary of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, Mr. Patrick Egan, of Tullamore?  What about Dr. Kennedy, Secretary to the I.A.O.S., appointed to look after the industry in which the Government puts most money, the creamery industry? What is the Minister's responsibility for them and for their acts and what is their responsibility as declared by themselves for anything in the nature of a mess which may in fact exist?  These gentlemen were appointed for two years.  They did act independently.  I will go into the history of that to the same degree to which the Minister went into it.  They were appointed for two years.  At the end of that time they became ticket-of-leave men, reappointed from month to month and kept on in that state from month to month by month to month appointments, in which they were told, as they are now told, that it really was not <Col N="2154" /> necessary for them to attend until there was an agitation by the same Chambers of Commerce whose reputation is involved in their success.  The Chambers of Commerce of Cork and Dublin and the Associated Chambers of the Free State demanded that they should be put permanently on the Board.  They were put permanently upon the Board.  They were appointed again I think for a period of a year, and at the end of that time they again became wandering luminaries and it was only when those same Chambers of Commerce again interfered to demand that there should be that representation of outside interests that these men were reappointed.  What do those three men whom the Minister says should be reappointed say to this?</P>

Mind, I do not care a whole lot about any interruptions, but I would advise the Deputy not to interrupt.  I can look after myself without the protection of the Chair.  What is the record?  What do those men whom the Minister says he would reappoint if he had the opportunity say to the mess which the Minister says exists?  What do they say of this bad policy which the Minister says has caused £5,100,000 to be necessary for something which he previously estimated at £2,500,000?  What they have said quite clearly and openly is this: That every question of major policy which was dealt with by that Board was submitted to us for examination.  Every single act of policy of that Board was approved by us.  We are, severally and collectively, responsible for everything that was done. There are men in this House&mdash;Deputy Connolly wants to know how I know. I know because they have told me&mdash; there are men upon the Front Bench of Cumann na nGaedheal who know that, because they told them.</P>

      <P>Again I say the Minister is not responsible if after consideration and proper examination he appoints men to do their function within the Act, but he is responsible if, knowing and believing they were not performing their functions within the Act, that they were unfit and unqualified, he reappoints them and leaves them there to do the job.  It is all very well for the Minister in his usual way to say did you do this?  Are you in favour of that?  How did you get out of that? There is the oldest of all question of that kind.  I will put it to Deputy Connolly: &ldquo;Have you given up beating your wife?&rdquo; Have you?  Yes or no? Call the issue and at once.  That is the method of the Minister.  Give an answer at once.  Yes or no?  Have you or have you not?  It is not any answer to say, I did not dare do it.  It is not any answer to say I never did it.  It is not any answer to say that only in circumstances of extraordinary provocation would I do it.  Questions which the Minister throws over here in hundreds are expected to be met at once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question down to the Minister for Finance to-day, the object of which was to get him to give fair treatment to the people in the districts bordering the Glyde river in the Counties of Louth and Monaghan. Roughly the position is this: that in 1923 the Minister for Finance during an election campaign met several voters in that district on a bridge called Ballyhoe.  He indicated to them that he was going to give them a free grant to drain the River Glyde.  It was quite obvious to the Minister, and <Col N="2156" /> would have been to anybody, that the river wanted draining very badly.  The people wanted drainage and the Minister wanted votes, so he Ballyhoed them for a while on the bridge.  The drainage was carried out.  Five years after the farmers bordering the Glyde river got demands for drainage rates. If the lands had been improved it would be quite fair to ask the farmers to bear a portion of the expense&mdash;that is, if they had been told prior to the incurring of the expense that they would have to pay.  But they were led to understand, first of all, that any drainage done was going to be free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that as a result of the drainage there was no improvement along the lower and the middle reaches of the river.  Instead of an improvement resulting the conditions became very much worse after the drainage works were carried out. Flooding took place on the lower and the middle reaches to an extent that had never been experienced in the years prior to the drainage.  Last winter and the winter before as much as 600 acres of tillage land were flooded. That land was not subject to floods prior to the carrying out of the drainage works.  The Minister to-day, in announcing that an additional 25 per cent. grant was going to be given towards the relief of the drainage rates, admitted that the job was not carried out properly by the Government, and admitted responsibility for the damage.  I cannot take the announcement with regard to the 25 per cent. additional grant in any other way than that.  If they had no responsibility they would not give the grant.  That 25 per cent. does not satisfy me at all. First of all, if the Minister had carried out the promise he made on Ballyhoe Bridge during the election campaign there would have been no cost whatever to the farmers.  As a result of the drainage works the lands of a large number of farmers have been disimproved and worsened, and certainly they should not have to pay anything. Instead, they should be compensated. It is all very well for the Minister to flood their lands in order to get votes, but the people should not have to pay <Col N="2157" /> for that.  The farmers whose lands have been flooded because the Minister wanted votes should be compensated instead of having to pay the drainage rates.</P>
    <P>I know one man, and his case is typical of others, who has to pay £14 in additional drainage rates because of this scheme.  As a result of this 25 per cent. additional grant he will be paying 25 per cent. less, but even allowing for that he will still be paying 75 per cent. too much.  That man should not have to pay anything. In fact he should be compensated. Take the ordinary case where lands have not been improved.  The people concerned should not have to pay any additional drainage rates.  I am not speaking now of the damage done during the recent floods because the floods during May and June were abnormal.  But in the ordinary normal winter weather the position has been worsened as a result of the work done. The floods come more frequently and remain longer on the lower and middle reaches because they were not properly excavated to take the increased flow of water.  Consequently the water came down and flooded land which used not be flooded.  At one or two points along the lower and the middle reaches if proper excavation work had been carried out and the river widened and deepened it would have taken the increased flow of water.  I think the Government should carry out at once and free of charge to the farmers the work that is required to be done.</P>
    <P>In many cases the people affected are small farmers.  In that particular district there are small farmers who make a living from putting plants in the bogs.  Some of them grow thorn quicks.  It takes four years to bring them to the condition when they can be sold in the market.  These quicks have been flooded out so that the farmers have lost not alone the grass on their lands, but their total income over the past four years.  There are other farmers who, this year, have had to replant their oats and potatoes as they were flooded out.  I have seen myself many fields in which potatoes <Col N="2158" /> and turnips were absolutely destroyed. The turnips are not so bad, but as a result of the flooding the potatoes are absolutely destroyed.  In view of that, I think, it is too bad that farmers should be asked to pay additional rates for the supposed benefits they got from this drainage.  They got no benefits.  Their condition has been rendered worse as a result of the work done, and in my opinion they should get compensation for the damage they have suffered.  The works necessary to leave them in at least as good condition as they were in prior to the drainage works being undertaken should, in my opinion, be carried out at once and without any additional expense being put on the farmers concerned.  Ministers are very fond of this game of going around before an election, of meeting people at some particular point and of doing what the Minister for Finance did at Ballyhoe. It is not fair that Minister should carry on like that.  The farmers in this district got no demand for the increased rates for five years.  They got the surprise of their lives when they received a bill for rates for the five years after the Minister had promised them that a scheme was going to be undertaken free of charge to them.  I was speaking to some men who were Ballyhoed by the Minister. They told me that if there was going to be any increased charge because of the drainage works proposed to be carried out, that they did not want them.</P>
    <P>That was quite definite and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that one of the people who got the biggest surprise was the Cumann na nGaedheal Senator who took the Minister to Ballyhoe Bridge that night. When the farmers of Ballyhoe district got the rate demand notes, they took them to the Senator and the Senator bore out their statement that the Minister for Finance had left them under the impression that the total drainage works were to be free.  Under these circumstances, the Ministry should do more than give this additional 25 per cent.  The giving of 25 per cent. is an indication that their <Col N="2159" /> consciences are annoying them.  They should go the whole way and relieve those farmers who got no benefit, but who were rather worsened by the total drainage rate being placed upon them. They should make restitution by undertaking free of charge the works necessary to leave the lands in as good condition as it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Aiken has said in regard to the position of the farmers along the Glyde. There is no doubt that the position there was very bad.  On the last occasion of the flooding I saw&mdash;I am sure Deputy Aiken also saw&mdash;the crops, consisting of oats, potatoes and turnips, covered to a depth of at least four feet.  Some of these flooded lands were at least a quarter of a mile from the river basin.  I do not want to pillory the Government on the failure of its deepening operations.  I am sure the Government acted with the best intentions, but it cannot be denied that the flooding in that district is worse since these operations were carried out than it was previously.  Old men from the district have told me that within their memories, dating back 50 or 60 years, there never have been such floods as were experienced this year.  Even allowing for the abnormal rainfall, there must be something wrong.  The Parliamentary Secretary is, I am sure, aware that the major portion of the money expended on these drainage operations was devoted to works which were not essential to the river at all. I do not want to go into the history of that.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows all about it.  I think it is most inequitable that the farmers on the upper and middle stretches of the river should be compelled to pay rates on supposed additions to their lands as a result of the drainage operations when, as a matter of fact, their position has been worsened.  The farmers in that particular district are not of the type who are always out &ldquo;agin the Government.&rdquo; They are sensible men who do not complain unless they have good reason.  It is a hardship on a farmer who, as Deputy Aiken has said, having ploughed his land and sowed his seed, <Col N="2160" /> sees his crops when they come up covered with water to a depth of four feet and is then served with a demand note for rates, amounting in some cases to fourteen or twenty pounds.  It is utterly impossible for them to pay this rate.  I quite appreciate, and I am sure Deputy Aiken does also, the difficulties of the Parliamentary Secretary. At the same time, if the Minister for Finance promised that these works would be carried out and that there would be no charge, that promise should be fulfilled and I do not think an extra 25 per cent. is at all sufficient to meet the conditions there.</P>
      <P>While the Government must in the near future undertake a new scheme altogether and extend the narrow portions of the river to relieve this flooding, I think they should go to the assistance of these farmers at the present time.  The Louth County Council passed a resolution asking the Minister to send down an engineer to see the position for himself.  Candidly, I was greatly disappointed that his Department did not act on that resolution. There is this to be said for immediate inspection&mdash;that the engineer could, right off, get at the root of the trouble.  Going there after the flooding, he is not in as good a position for obtaining complete knowledge.  I do not want to magnify the conditions, but the lands, when I saw them, could be compared with nothing less than a new Lough Erne.  This district was looked upon as one of the finest tillage districts in County Louth.  It had the reputation of growing the best oats in Louth.  I join with Deputy Aiken in asking the Parliamentary Secretary to take immediate action, either by way of remission of rates or by assuring these farmers that in the immediate future something will be done to rectify what, owing to the flooding, is, in my opinion, an intolerable state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The drainage district about which Deputy Aiken has raised this question, is in the usual position in this respect&mdash;that there was a very great volume of support for the works to be carried out in that area before the works were <Col N="2161" /> started; in this respect also; that we received a great deal of praise for the manner in which the works were carried out, when they were carried out; and in this respect, that since the charge was put upon the people whose lands were affected we have heard complaints on all sides, but not until then. It is an unusual case in this respect, that we have increased the grant from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent.  It is the only case under the 1924 Act in which that has been done.  That has been done not, as Deputy Aiken has said, because we considered the works defective, but because as a result of unforeseen circumstances&mdash;things that the engineers were not aware of at the time, owing particularly to the fact that a syphon which should have been maintained for a long period had not been maintained necessitating a great deal of work&mdash;the cost of carrying out those drainage works greatly exceeded the original estimate.</P>

On the question of the people being deceived, I am not going to join with Deputy Aiken in talking &ldquo;Ballyhoe.&rdquo; There should not have been any misunderstanding on the part of the people down there as to how this scheme was to be financed.  A letter was sent to the County Council on July 4, 1925, explaining in detail how this scheme was to be financed, and stating that the Government was willing to give a 25 per cent. grant.  It was explained in that letter that the charge, on a rough estimate, would amount to about 1s. 6d. per acre on the farmers whose lands were flooded.  That was placed before the County Council, and a copy was sent to the T.D.'s representing the constituency at the time. As well as that, a copy of the 1924 Act was sent down to the secretary of the County Council explaining the whole working of the scheme.</P>

      <P>A great portion of it. As regards the floods, naturally when you clean up the drains in a district the floods come down more quickly. That has occurred in this case, as it has occurred in other cases.  If that did not happen there would be no point in cleaning up the drains.  If the floods come more quickly they are carried away more quickly.  This is a wholly exceptional year, as both Deputies have admitted, and last year was also a very exceptional year from the point of view of floods.  This year has been the worst year for floods, not merely in County Louth, but all over Ireland, during the last quarter of a century.</P>
      <P>As regards sending down an inspector, I have already been approached by other Deputies on this point.  I agreed to examine what the possibilities were, but when we went into the matter we realised that an inspector could do no good.  Under the present Act we have no powers to carry out any additional work, and we have no funds to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's point about surveying the scheme while the flood is actually at its height, it is impossible for an engineer to work under such conditions.  It is very easy for engineers to find out what levels the floods have reached and to make investigations afterwards, but we never carry out any inspections while flooding is actually at its height.  If we were to send an inspector there the only result would be to raise false hopes on the part of the people, and we do not believe in doing that.</P>

      <P>At the present moment if we were to give way on this point of sending down an inspector we would have to do the same all over the country.  I do not know of any part of the Free State from which similar <Col N="2164" /> representations are not being made to send down inspectors.</P>

      <P>den Aire Rialtais Aitiúla agus Sláinte Puiblí an bhfuil fhios aige gur mhol an fo-choiste aitiúil i gCinn Mhara an pinsean (trí huaire) do Bhrighid Ní Dhonnchadha, Raithín, Gort Inse Guaíre (Uimhir Athchomhairc C. 8291), acht nach bhfuair sí an pinsean go fóill toisc gur chuir an Pinsean-Oifigeach ina choinnibh de bharr aoise, gidh go n-abrann na comhursain go bhfuil an bhean sin 74 bliana d'aois, agus go bhfuil móid-scríbhinn curtha isteach ag feilméir creidheamhnach dhá dheimhniú sin, agus an bhfeuchfaidh an tAire chuige go ndeunfaidh cigire eicínt an sceul so d'infhiuchadh.</P>

      <P>Tháining an t-éileamh so os cóir Fo-Choiste Pinsin Chinn Mhara trí huaire. Do nea-lomháladar é ar an 24adh Márta, 1927, ach do lomháladar pinsean deich scilling sa tseachtain ar an 20adh Bealtaine, 1929, agus arís ar an 27adh Mí na Samhna, 1930.  Níor tháining an chéad chás os mo chóir, ach sa dá chás eile do socruíodh ná féadfaí aon phinsean do lomháil, toisc ná rabhas sásta, do réir na fianaise do tugadh, gur cólíonadh an coinnióll reachtúil maidir le haois. Níl aon athchomharc fém bhráid fé láthair, agus, ar an abhar san, níl comhacht agam éinní do dhéanamh sa scéal.</P>
