      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received memorials from farmers in County Cavan giving particulars of losses they have sustained through the destruction of their crops by floods along the River Erne and its tributaries, and requesting that an inspector be sent to see and value the damage done, with a view to the Government rendering assistance; if it is the intention of the Government to accede to the memorialists' requests; and, if so, will prompt action be taken to relieve immediately the prevailing distress, and also secure the afflicted farmers against the consequences of a barren harvest.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners are preparing a detailed drainage scheme for the River Erne and its tributaries, <Col N="1725" /> including the Annalee River up as far as Bellanacargy Bridge.  In connection with the proposed drainage of the Dromore River the Commissioners intend to make a detailed survey of that river, and they also propose to examine the Annalee River from Tullyvin to Bellanacargy Bridge.  The Commissioners have received the memorial referred to in the question, but no petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, has been presented to them in respect of the length of river concerned and, if a drainage scheme is desired, steps should be taken to have such a petition presented to the Cavan County Council without delay.  I may add that it would not be possible to start actual drainage works in the area for a long time.  The Land Commission is being asked for a report on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that the reply he has read is not an answer to the question on the Order Paper. Question 3 deals with the flooding of lands and the consequent damage and destruction of crops.  It has nothing at all to do with drainage.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary state what steps have been taken to meet the situation set out in the memorial sent in by the people whose land has been damaged?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy must be aware that the number of warders cannot of necessity bear a proportion to the number of prisoners. The prisoners require looking after the whole time, and the warders only work a certain number of hours daily.  There are only a certain number of hours during which the warders work&mdash;eight hours daily.  One warder can look after five or six prisoners just as easily as he could look after one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister rearranged the prisoners in the jails, and put them all into one wing where they would, I understand, fit perfectly, would it not make it easier on the staff and save money, instead of saving it on the diet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly, if we herded prisoners of all classes together we could save money. But our idea is to keep the different <Col N="1728" /> classes segregated.  The Deputy's suggestion is the most retrograde one that I have heard made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice to state how much he estimates will be the reduction in the former cost of £11 5s. per head per annum for victualling of prisoners in Saorstát prisons affected by the recent changes in prisoners' diet; and further, to ask the Minister whether it is a fact that by the recent change of diet (a) for breakfast, margarine has been substituted for butter, the ration of gruel has been reduced from one pint to half a pint, and prisoners are deprived of a ration of half a pint of milk; and (b) at supper prisoners have been deprived of half a pint of milk and a ration of butter, for which margaine has been substituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the recent alterations in the prison dietary scales will affect a reduction of approximately £1 10s. in the annual cost per head of victualling of prisoners.  Margarine has been substituted for butter except for prisoners on hospital diet.  The ration of stirabout and milk included in the breakfast for convicts has been reduced to half a pint.  The new breakfast diet for convicts consists of 8 ounces of bread, 1 pint of tea, ¾oz. of margarine, ½ pint of stirabout and milk.  The new supper diet, which formerly included ½ pint of milk, now consists of 1 pint of tea or coffee, 8 ounces of bread, ¾oz. of margarine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe (for Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>Czechoslovakia, Hungary and certain other countries incorporated in their customs administration after the European War a system of prohibiting imports of certain classes of goods except under licence.  The classes of goods brought under this arrangement vary from time to time for many reasons, such as, for instance, political tension with other countries, rupture of or failure to establish commercial treaty relations, the adoption of a quota system under treaty in favour of another specific country, protection of the currency or safeguarding of home industries.  For some years after the conclusion of the European War the lists of goods coming under these special arrangements were lengthy in many countries, but the tendency in recent years has been to reduce the number of classifications of goods to be allowed entry only on the issue of a licence.  This tendency has been strengthened in such countries as have adopted the International Convention for the abolition of import and export prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
      <P>The classes of goods at present subjected to the licence system in Czechoslovakia and Hungary are varied and could not be conveniently specified in this reply.  I can, however, have more detailed information supplied to the Deputy if he desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate is resumed, there is a point of order upon which I want to get information.  We endeavoured, as you know, to get the consent of the Chair to the introduction of a reasoned amendment to the motion for Second Reading.  As that has been ruled out, I would like to move, under Standing Order No. 127, for the suspension of Standing Orders relative to notice in regard to this particular matter.  Standing Order No. 127 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose upon motion made after notice: Provided that in cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any such Order or Orders may with the unanimous consent of the Dáil, be suspended upon motion made without notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am asking here that they be suspended without notice for this reason, that it was only after we heard the Minister's statement last night we were in a position to bring in a reasoned amendment to this Bill.  In speaking upon it we made certain suggestions but they can only be given effect to by bringing a motion before the Dáil.

This particular Standing Order, No. 127, <Col N="1740" /> provides that &ldquo;any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended for the day's sitting and for a particular purpose upon motion made after notice.&rdquo;  That is not the present case. The proviso in the Standing Order is: &ldquo;Provided that in cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be judge, any such Order or Orders may, with the unanimous consent of the Dáil, be suspended upon motion made without notice.&rdquo; Two things are required, both the unanimous consent of the Dáil and a decision from the Ceann Comhairle that the matter is one of urgent necessity. The Deputy desires to move the suspension of Standing Orders for the purpose of moving without notice a reasoned amendment to the motion for the Second Reading of the Bill, the discussion upon which was entered yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I pointed out that the question at issue between the Minister and the Electricity Supply Board narrowed itself down to the manner in which provision was to be made to discharge the liabilities of those municipal undertakings which had been taken over by the Board. Apparently the attitude which the Board at the outset took up, which it in fact took up immediately after its constitution, if the Minister has been correctly reported, was that it was entitled under the Electricity Supply Act to make provision to meet those liabilities from year to year as they fell due, and to meet them out of revenue.  The position, on the other hand, which the Minister appears to have adopted was that these liabilities of the transferred undertakings were to be provided for, immediately provided for, out of hand and provided for out of capital.  I think I am correctly stating the issue which was raised by the Minister with the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third time the Minister has denied that his words bear the plain interpretation which anybody must put upon them.  Let me remind the House of what the Minister did say on the Second Reading of the Bill, so late as yesterday.  He said this:</P>
      <P>The fact emerged that the Board did not consider that the sum of 2½ millions which they got from the Ministry of Finance included any undischarged liabilities which they took over from the municipal undertakings.</P>
      <P>The Minister was stating the position which the Board had taken up in this matter.  Then he went on to say:</P>
      <P>He asked (that is, the Minister asked) that the undischarged liabilities, whatever they might be at the date of vesting of municipal undertakings, should be subtracted from the 2½ millions and that the residue should be what the Board might demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the plain and simple effect of that?  Was it either that the Board, having authority from this House to demand, without reason stated, from the Minister for Finance the sum of £2,500,000, having made that demand, once it was honoured had to hand back £800,000 to the Minister for Finance in order, presumably, that he might discharge the liabilities of the undertakings transferred from local authorities? Is there any other interpretation to be placed on the statement of the Minister than that?  He goes further and states that the only sum which the Board might demand for expenditure upon new capital works was the residue, the difference between the estimated total of the liabilities of the transferred undertakings and the £2,500,000 which the House had placed at the disposal of the Electricity Supply Board, had put at its disposal upon demand.  That meant, if there is anything in the attitude which the Minister took up, in effect that the net <Col N="1742" /> sum which this House placed at the disposal of the Board was not 2½ millions but was £1,700,000.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise again that there is no difference between the Minister and the Board as to the obligation of the Board to discharge the liabilities of the transferred undertakings. The Board, so far as we can gather from the Minister's statement, are prepared to discharge them.  They are prepared to discharge them in the way which is provided for in the Act itself.  That is the difference between the Minister and the Board.  The Minister, in the course of his statement, appeared to rely upon two sections of the Act.  Section 12 provides that, subject to certain limitations, the Minister for Finance shall advance to the Board on demand certain sums.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Act is mandatory upon the Minister.  He has no power to inquire as to the purpose for which these moneys are being required. As a matter of fact I think that at the very inception of the Board when it had been constituted, when it was looking for a place to meet, when it decided that, in order to carry out the multifarious duties cast upon it by this Act, it would be necessary for it to have an office, tables and chairs, the Board presented a demand to the Minister for Finance for a sum of £1,000.  That demand was returned to the Board by the Ministry of Finance, with a request that the Board should furnish a detailed statement to the Minister as to how this £1,000 of the Board's money, provided for the use of the Board by the Oireachtas, was to be spent.  And this was the Board that was to be independent of all ministerial control! It was to be the Board that was to handle 2½ million pounds, and was to be independent not only of ministerial control, but independent even of the control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. And when they asked for £1,000, the first thing that the Ministry of Finance required of them was a detailed statement as to how they proposed to spend that money.  In point of fact, the attitude that the Ministry of Finance took up in regard to this matter at that time showed that, notwith- <Col N="1743" /> standing the promises given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there was a certain element in the Executive Council which was determined to bring this Board under Governmental control and influence so far as they could do it.</P>
    <P>It was because the Board realised what was at stake, and it was because the Board realised that if they were to carry out the duties which were cast upon them by the Act, they must preserve their condition of independence, in order that they could secure the confidence and support of every section of this community, that they refused to furnish that detailed statement as to how they proposed to spend that £1,000 which the Ministry of Finance demanded of them.  It is because of that, that the Board, from the very beginning, has kept itself strictly within the terms of the Act and has kept the Minister strictly within the terms of the Act.  It was because of that, and not really because of the manner in which the Board should meet its liabilities with regard to the transferred undertakings, that the difference and dispute have arisen between the Minister or the Executive Council and the Board.</P>
    <P>I was referring to Section 12, sub-section (3), the section which deals with the advances of £2,500,000.  The words of that section are plain and clear and simple.  They are as follows:</P>
    <P>The total amount of the sums advanced to the Board under this section for any purpose other than to meet the liability and expenses mentioned in the foregoing sub-section shall not exceed the sum of two millions five hundred thousand pounds, and the total amount of the sums so advanced in any one half-year except in the half-year ending on the appointed day for any purpose other than as aforesaid shall not exceed the sum of four hundred thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>Mark, the only provision in that sub-section is as to the amount of money that shall be advanced to the Board for any purpose other than to meet the liability and expenses mentioned in the foregoing sub-section.  The contention <Col N="1744" /> of the Minister is that that section is to be read as if it were that the total amount of the sum advanced to the Board under this section for the purpose of meeting new capital expenditure and providing for the liability of the transferred undertaking shall not exceed two and a half millions. But there is no such condition imposed by that section.  There is nothing in that section to make it conditional upon the Board to discharge the liabilities of the transferred undertakings out of the two and a half millions which were to be provided under this sub-section which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>The Minister not only relied, fallaciously relied, as I think, upon this section, but he relied also upon Section 39.  Section 39, from the point of resolving this difference which has arisen between the Minister and the Board, is a very important section, because it deals with the liabilities not only of those undertakings which have been transferred from the local authorities, but also from those undertakings which have been transferred from private ownership, and it deals with them in two different ways.  The difference in relation to this dispute is a very significant one.  Let us see, first of all, how this section dealt with the liabilities of these undertakings which were transferred from private ownership to the Board.  That is dealt with in sub-section (8) of Section 39, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the former undertaker is not a local authority the new undertaker shall within three months after the date of the vesting order pay to the Board or, if the Board is itself the new undertaker, shall put to a separate account a sum equal to the fair value on the date of the vesting order of the undertaking (with all the property, assets, and liabilities thereof transferred to or imposed on the new undertaker by the vesting order) as a going concern and interest on such fair value from the date of the vesting order at the rate of five per cent. per annum ...</P>
    <P>Mark what was to be done where the Board took over an electricity supply undertaking from a private owner. <Col N="1745" /> Under the sub-section which I have read the Board is bound to put to a separate account a sum equal to the fair value, including all its property, assets and liabilities, of the undertaking as transferred to the Board at the date of the vesting order, and, in addition, to put aside a sum to meet interest at five per cent. upon that capital value.  That is how those undertakings transferred from private ownership were to be dealt with, and that is the obligation which was imposed upon the Board by this section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) of this section, on the other hand, deals with the undertakings which were transferred from local authorities, undertakings like the Dublin Corporation or the undertakings of the Rathmines or Pembroke Urban Councils.  It deals with them, and they are dealt with in quite a different way.  Sub-section (6) of Section 39 of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the former undertaker is a local authority the new undertaker shall, as on and from the date of the vesting order, become and be by virtue of this sub-section liable for and bound to indemnify and keep indemnified the former undertaker against all capital loans (including current bank overdraft) outstanding at the date of the vesting order...</P>
    <P>In this case, the &ldquo;new undertaker&rdquo; is the Board, and the &ldquo;former undertaker&rdquo; is the local authority.  Mark the difference between these two subsections. Sub-section (8) deals with the undertakings transferred from private owners, and there the obligation is imposed upon the Board to put certain sums to separate account in order to meet the liabilities of these transferred undertakings and to provide for the purchase of the properties and assets of these undertakings.  But in the case of undertakings transferred from the public owners there is no obligation imposed on the Board to put any sums to a separate account.  There is no obligation to earmark any portion of that two and a half million pounds to meet the liabilities of these transferred undertakings.  Yet what is the issue raised by the Minister?  It is <Col N="1746" /> this: that the public undertakings, the undertakings transferred from the public ownership, instead of being dealt with by the Board as the Board is permitted to deal with them in sub-section (6) of Section 39, should be dealt with by the Board as if they were undertakings transferred from private ownership, and accordingly dealt with as provided by sub-section (8).  Is not that the difference?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the undischarged liabilities, whatever they might be at the date of the vesting of the municipal undertakings, should be subtracted from the £2,500,000, and that the residue should be what the Board might demand.  What is that, in effect, except to say that the £800,000 should be put to separate account, and that the Board, presumably, if it were to act strictly in accordance with Section 39 (8), should pay additional interest at the rate of five per cent. upon that £800,000?  There is nothing in the Act which compels the Board to do that.  The fact that sub-section (6) has been included in Section 39, and enables the Board to deal with these municipal undertakings in a different way to those which were transferred from private ownership, would seem to indicate that the Minister and the Oireachtas, when this Act was going through, contemplated that the Board, in relation to the undertakings transferred from municipal ownership, would act exactly as the Board has acted, despite the Minister.</P>
    <P>If, however, notwithstanding the opinions of the former Chairman and late Managing Director of the Board and their colleagues who have been on the Board from the start, notwithstanding the advice which the legal advisers to the Board have given as to the proper interpretation of these sections, the House still decides to support the attitude which the Minister has taken up, in what position will these undertakings which have been transferred to the Electricity Supply Board be in, in so far as their undischarged liabilities are concerned? According to the statement which the Minister made yesterday, he does not propose to discharge these liabilities out of hand.  According to <Col N="1747" /> his statement, in so far as we on this side of the House could understand it, he proposes to do what the Board has hitherto done; that is, to provide for the sinking fund and interest, to provide for the capital charges on these transferred liabilities as they fall due from year to year.  Presumably, he proposes to do as the Board had intended to do and was actually doing. He proposes to provide for these charges out of the revenue accruing to the Board, as a result of its operations from year to year.  That is what the Board, has been doing and that is what the Minister proposes to do.  If the Board has been doing that, and the Minister still proposes to do it, what real substance is there in the dispute which the Minister alleges has arisen between him and the Board in regard to an important question of principle?</P>
    <P>If the Minister proposes to do exactly as the Board has been doing&mdash; to provide for these liabilities out of revenue&mdash;what justification is there for him to come to this House and ask it to grant to him&mdash;no longer to grant to the Board&mdash;and to place at his disposal the sum of £800,000 in order to provide for these undischarged liabilities?  It may be said that one of the obligations imposed upon the Board by sub-section (6) is the obligation of keeping the former undertakers indemnified.  Who are to be the judges of the validity of the indemnity which the Board offers? Who, but the former undertakers themselves?  So far as I know, none of the former undertakers, the municipal authorities, the former owners of the undertakings which were taken over by the Board, has objected to the policy which the Board has pursued. If they have objected, the Minister has not disclosed the fact to the House.  They have been, so far as I know, content, knowing the progress which the Board was making, knowing, according to the Minister, that the development of the national electricity supply undertaking had been so phenomenal that in less than two years they succeeded in doing what <Col N="1748" /> the experts originally estimated could scarcely be done in four years.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, and so far as the House has been informed by the Minister, no municipal authority in this country has objected to the manner in which the Electricity Supply Board was providing for capital charges and interest on loans and mortgages connected with the transferred undertakings. If I am incorrect in that statement, it is because the Minister, in his opening address, concealed the fact from the House.  Possibly it is not the only fact which he has concealed in relation to the undertaking.  The point, however, which I am leading up to is that if the Minister is going to do exactly as the Electricity Supply Board was doing in regard to these transferred liabilities; if he is going to provide for them out of the yearly revenue of the Board, then what is the reason, what is the purpose, and what is the need for the House to vote £800,000 to provide for the liabilities of those transferred undertakings?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether at this point I should remind the House of what I said last night.  I said that if there was any question as to the powers of or the rights of the Board as laid down in Section 39 (6) to provide for these liabilities in a particular way, or if there was doubt that the Board had not been directly empowered by the Electricity Supply Act to do what it has done, and if the Minister had been empowered to intervene in the matter and to say that these liabilities should be provided for in the specific way in which he wants it to be done; and if, as against that, the Board had the right to provide for them in the way they have done without being specifically empowered to do that by the Act, as between the two methods of discharging the liabilities, what choice would any business man make?</P>
    <P>Here was £800,000&mdash;not all of it, but certainly a considerable portion of it, advanced to public authorities at a very reasonable rate of interest, advanced possibly at a lower rate of interest and upon easier terms of repayment than either the Board itself, which, as the <Col N="1749" /> Minister said, had no borrowing power, or the Minister for Finance, who might act as the Board's agent, could borrow. £800,000 was there in the Board's hands invested in generating plant and equipment, invested in earning assets, and the Board had that £800,000 at a lower rate of interest and upon more favourable terms as regards repayment than it could raise a similar amount in present-day circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the right thing for the Board to do, the business-like thing for the Board to do, was to take the £800,000 which it would borrow upon very onerous terms, and redeem the £800,000 of capital fruitfully invested, which had been borrowed upon more favourable terms.  He says that because the Board did not do that, did not do what no business man in his senses would have done, the Board, is to be criticised, but the chairman of the Board, a public financier of wide experience, and the managing director of the Board, to whom all credit has been given by the Minister, and everyone in this House for the inception of the Shannon scheme, for the enthusiasm which drove it through, are to be virtually dismissed from their offices because, having the interests of the undertaking at heart, being just as anxious to see that undertaking succeed as the Minister, they had the temerity to differ from him as to the way in which this £800,000 was to be used, and differ from him in exactly the way in which an acute, keen, conscientous, earnest, business man would differ from him if he had to choose between the two propositions, the proposition put up by the Board, and the proposition put up by the Minister. Merely upon business grounds alone, if upon no other, I think the Board is justified in the action which it took so far as this £800,000 of transferred liabilities was concerned.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point before we leave this.  If the Board's contention is correct that it was empowered under the Act to provide for the liabilities of the transferred undertakings out of capital, then the Board has not overspent one penny piece.  The Board has entered into capital commitments to the very limit of its £2,500,000, exclusive <Col N="1750" /> of working capital.  It has entered into commitments for new plant and equipment up to the extent of £2,500,000.  That is what we actually provided.  Not being at all biased in favour of the Board, or against the Minister, having read the Minister's statement and the Act, and listened to the speeches made in this House, I have come to the conclusion that in providing for that expenditure of £2,500,000 the Board was acting within its rights in the matter, and that so acting within its rights in the matter it has not overspent one penny piece. If it has not overspent one penny piece, what is the reason why the Minister virtually demanded the resignation of the former managing director and the former chairman of the Board?  Surely there must be something else behind it.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to bear in mind that the Minister has not challenged the action of the Board in regard to its relations with labour, in regard to the manner in which it has conducted a considerable number of ordinary trading activities outside of and apart from the generation and transmission and local distribution of electricity.  He has not questioned its conduct under any one of these heads, so far as we know.  He dare not question its conduct, because whatever the Board did, either in relation to labour or in its relations with ordinary private traders in this country, the Minister upheld and sustained it on every occasion. Deputy Briscoe, acting, as he was entitled to act and was bound to act, on behalf of a number of his constituents, on many occasions put questions in this House to the Minister as to the manner in which the Board was conducting its business.  I do not think that on a single occasion he got a civil reply from the Minister.  Whenever the various collateral and amending Bills to the main Electricity Supply Act were before the House, whenever a member of the House, whether a member of this party, or of the Labour Party, or an Independent member, endeavoured to get any information from the Minister as to the conduct and affairs of the Board, invariably he was treated by the Minister <Col N="1751" /> with the utmost discourtesy, until it became painful to sit in the House when any business in relation to the Shannon electricity undertaking was under discussion.  Is not that a fact? If, as a result of all this, the Minister has now come to the conclusion that the Electricity Supply Board cannot make a success of the Shannon undertaking, if he has come to the conclusion that things have not been done properly inside the organisation of the Electricity Supply Board, surely he ought to come to the House and put his cards on the table and give to the House at long last the information which he has denied it during the past three years.  Even if the Minister's contention in regard to the £800,000 of transferred liabilities was the correct one, surely the Minister cannot wash his hands of all responsibility for the position in which the Electricity Supply Board and this House now find themselves.  He has stated that this question became an issue between him and the Board in 1928.  He stated that early in December it became clear that the liabilities of the Board had already exceeded the £2,500,000 granted by this House.  In June he had not any doubt about it.</P>

There is no necessity for that.  The Board is not straitened owing to the outgoings to date.  I have no reason for believing that the two and a half million pounds will not be sufficient for all purposes.&rdquo;  The Minister made that statement to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And something else. He made that statement.  He led the Dáil to believe that two and a half million pounds would, according to his information, be ample and sufficient to meet the liabilities of the Board.  He made that statement in the Dáil, but he not only made it then to the Dáil but he also, though speaking here, made it to members of the Seanad, many of whom take a very close and very deep interest in the operations of the Electricity Supply Board.  When the Minister made that statement in the Dáil he unwittingly misled the Dáil, and he also equally unwittingly misled the Seanad.  But after he had misled the Seanad, and after having received the other statement from the Board, according to the Minister, I think the day after he made that statement, or very soon after making that statement and before the Bill went to the Seanad, I say it was incumbent on the Minister, having received the later information, to put before the Seanad the true position and to disclose to them and to this House the full facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have shown that the Minister, before the Electricity Supply Act, 1930, became law, had a definite admission from the Board that their liabilities, including the liabilities of the transferred undertakings, would exceed two and a half million pounds.  The Minister himself, even before he had extracted that admission from the Board, had reason to believe that the Board had already, in fact, exceeded its financial resources, in so far as he envisaged these resources, because they had already in respect of new capital <Col N="1754" /> equipment and in respect of the liabilities of the transferred undertakings, commitments amounting to £2,700,000. He knew already how much the Board received from the Minister for Finance &mdash;I think £1,900,000&mdash;and he knew also what the liabilities of the transferred undertakings were, because he says, and he said yesterday, that in the early part of 1930 he issued a letter stating that, in his opinion, the Board had definitely gone beyond the sum which they agreed was at their disposal.</P>
    <P>In the early part of 1930 the Minister wrote to the Board, stating they had definitely gone beyond the sum which they agreed was at their disposal. That was what the Minister did in the early part of 1930.  But what did he tell the Dáil in June, 1930?  &ldquo;I have no reason to believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the two and a half millions will not be sufficient for all purposes.&rdquo; The Minister, who has told the Board that in his opinion the liabilities had definitely exceeded the two and a half millions, comes to the Dáil and says, dealing with the amendment put down by Deputy Fahy: &ldquo;I have no reason to believe that the two and half million will not be sufficient for all purposes.&rdquo;  I do not think it is necessary to comment on that any further.  There are two statements&mdash;the statement the Minister made yesterday and the statement the Minister made to the House in June, 1930.  And if the Board has not been candid with the Minister and has not been informative, surely there is no person more blameworthy than the Minister, who at the time misled the House and the country as to what the real position between him and the Board was.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Now in addition to providing this £800,000, which I again repeat if the Board's contention is correct is not required, the Minister is asking this House to place at his disposal an additional sum of £1,150,000.  For what purpose?  The Minister has refused to disclose the purpose in any settled scheme or programme to this House. <Col N="1755" /> The sum of £1,150,000 is to be placed at his disposal to be expended by the Board in any way the Minister sees fit to approve of.  There is nothing more concrete than that.  Everything else is vague and shadowy.  The Minister, who relied for the last four years on the Electricity Supply Board, is going to place equal confidence, or at least is asking the House to place the same confidence in him and the new Board as he now tells us was misplaced with him and the old Board. Before this difference of opinion became public we knew the attitude of the Government to the Electricity Supply Board.  The Board could do no wrong.  The Minister and the Government felt they were responsible for it.  So they were.  They selected the members of the Board, they put them in office, and they boosted them.</P>
    <P>They did everything they possibly could to create public confidence in them, and they placed at their untrammelled disposal the sum of 2½ million pounds.  If there is any substance at all in the indictment which the Minister made against that Board it is that of that 2½ million pounds the sum of £800,000 has been extravagantly spent by the Board, and the Minister who constituted the old Board, who had confidence in the old Board, who compelled the Dáil, under the lash of his incivility, to be silent in regard to the old Board, now asks the House to give him £2,000,000 in order that he and the new Board, about which the Dáil knows nothing, may spend it upon proposals which the Minister has not even outlined in his own mind.</P>
    <P>Of this £1,150,000 some portion must be spent on certain constructional works.  What are these constructional works?  Is there going to be further extension of the Shannon generating plant?  Is there going to be enlargement of the water storage and the building and equipment of new distribution networks?  Are these things to be done out of that £1,150,000? Surely, if they are, then in view of what has transpired in this House yesterday and of the statement made by the Minister that he does not know &mdash;I do not know whether I can credit <Col N="1756" /> that statement&mdash;how many units of electricity were sold by the Shannon scheme, that he does not know how much was received in return for these units, that he does not know what the cost of generation and distribution were, this House can have no justification for placing £1,150,000 into the hands of the Minister to play with.  If there is going to be any further capital expenditure on the Shannon, surely that expenditure should only be undertaken after full and searching investigation into the present position of the undertaking and an examination of its future prospects.  That is what we want.  Surely there should be some such investigation as would satisfy this House and the public generally that the expenditure of that £1,150,000 will be an economic proposition and will yield a profitable return.</P>
    <P>The gravamen of the charge against the Electricity Supply Board by the Minister was that they spent money regardless as to whether it would provide an economic return.  We say that the Minister has made that charge against the Board, and I do not know whether the charge is well founded or not.  I say the Minister has not advanced to this House in relation to that charge one iota of evidence.  He has raised what I believe to be a fictitious issue in regard to the transferred undertakings.  I hold that clear proof of the success of this undertaking is the only justification for providing the undertaking, through the Minister, with a further £1,500,000 for capital purposes.  The Minister has not said a word to justify the Bill upon these grounds, and I ask the House to vote against it.</P>

      <P>I waited long last night, and did not intervene in this debate in the hope that some other member of the Government would intervene and throw some more light on this very important question than we had from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am in the unfortunate, or perhaps I should say the fortunate, position of not knowing anything whatever about all these matters that have been discussed here except what I have heard in the House, and <Col N="1757" /> with the exception of some statements that appeared in the newspapers. Nobody has approached me to give me any information as to the happenings we heard so much about yesterday and to-day.  This question is eminently one that must be approached by this House in a different spirit from questions which ordinarily come before us, because I think we all recognise that it is not the credit of a particular Government or of a particular Party, or even of a particular Minister that is at stake, but the credit of the whole country.  This is a national scheme, and it is really in the interests of the whole country that everything should be done to make it a success and to remove anything that tends to prevent its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, too, that of all the speeches that I listened to during this debate, the one that appealed to me most was that delivered by Deputy de Valera yesterday.  I think he approached it in the proper spirit, a spirit in which we should all approach it.  He made it quite clear&mdash;I am glad to hear him say it&mdash;that what he was interested in, as we are all interested, was the ultimate success of the scheme.  I have a considerable amount of sympathy with the Minister.  His name has been very closely associated with this Shannon scheme, and when many of the things for which we criticise or praise him here will be forgotten his name will be linked with the Shannon scheme, and the greater the success of that scheme the greater will be the credit that will come to him.  As I say, I had very great sympathy indeed with him when he had to come to this House yesterday to make the statement which he had to make. But I agree with some of the speakers on the other side who said, that in making that statement he was not only not fair to the House, but not fair to himself, because it was obvious to anybody listening to him that there were many things which he did not tell us.  I can understand and sympathise with his reticence, but I have a feeling that in a matter of this kind reticence begets suspicion, and when partial disclosures of the nature made yesterday are made&mdash;they were obviously partial <Col N="1758" /> disclosures&mdash;they lead to all kinds of rumours, and suspicion of one kind or another.  It is not helpful that that should be the case.  It would be much better when it has come to this stage if everything in connection with the whole business was disclosed, especially to members of the House. What has transpired will undoubtedly create uneasiness in the minds of the public.  They will be wondering whether after all the money that has been spent, and all the great talk we have heard, not only in this country but all over the world, about the Shannon scheme, it is going to be the success we all hoped it would be.  That will be the first question that will arise in the minds of a great many people.</P>
    <P>It would appear as if the debate tended to develop into a question of the Minister versus the Board in regard to this particular matter and arising out of this particular Bill, and it is rather a pity that that should happen.  If I had any prejudice in the matter my prejudice would be with the Minister rather than with the Board, because he is the representative of the Oireachtas, and we are the representatives of the people and this scheme belongs to the people, not to the Board and not to the Government, and he comes into it as the representative of the people.  As I say, if I had any prejudice at all in the matter it would be with him rather than with the Board.  But I have listened carefully to his statements and to other statements, and I cannot conscientiously say who is right and who is wrong in this particular dispute that has arisen.  That is my position, and I believe it is the position of a great many Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>The question of the independence of the Board has been raised in that connection. I should like to refer very briefly to the attitude we took up when this Electricity Supply Bill was going through the House in 1927.  At that time the then Leader of the Labour Party, now Senator Johnson, was absent from the House, and it devolved on me to state our position. Much had been made about the necessity <Col N="1759" /> of having this Board independent, and various Deputies had adverted to the necessity of making it absolutely independent.  Dealing with that point, I said:</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister was overanxious to declare that this Board would be almost absolutely independent. A certain amount of independence as to the way in which it should carry out its work is advisable, and may be necessary; but I do not think the Board should be given the idea that it is entirely independent of criticism by this House. I think there are opportunities of discussing the general policy of the Board; it has, for instance, to furnish a report, which will be laid on the Table.  I think the Board should not, as might be implied or inferred from the Minister's statement yesterday, be given the impression that it will be absolutely free from criticism or interference. I think it is right that the members of the Oireachtas, which represents the nation, should have the opportunity offered them, if and when necessary, of criticising the general policy of the Board&mdash;not, of course, mere details of administration or matters of minor importance, but the general policy in so far as their operations affect the welfare of the community.  (Cols. 1978-9, Vol. 18, Official Debates.)</P>
    <P>Later on, when the Minister was replying, he specially stressed the fact that the Board would be independent, and, as I say, we rather thought that he was over-stressing it.  While we were prepared to give it a very large measure of independence, we felt that there was necessity for some control, but the Minister had a different view.  He stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I did point out, and I would like to point out again, that if this Bill passes as it is at the moment, there will be no discussion on Estimates; there will be no matter of Parliamentary Questions in the House, not even that type of permitted Parliamentary Question which is sometimes indulged in regard to the <Col N="1760" /> railways.  Even that will be done away with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Davin asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And there will be no interference with the Board by the Minister or from his Department?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the attitude very definitely of the Minister, and, as I say, we felt that it was going a little too far in the matter of the independence which was being given to them.  We had this assurance from the Minister, as he mentioned himself yesterday, that we should have an annual statement of accounts from the Board; that we should have an annual report, with accounts, that would be laid on the Table of the House and that any Deputy or Party who wished it could have an opportunity of discussing it in the House, as well as the general policy of the Board.  Nobody, of course, would want to discuss small details of administration, but they would desire to discuss general policy. I do not think the House has been treated fairly in this matter.  We have had no such opportunity afforded to us in the past three years.  We have had no discussion with regard to the general policy of the Board.  It is obvious, from what the Minister himself has stated, that very shortly after the Board was set up there was a question of dispute.  There was a question as to his right to interfere very early after the Board was set up.  Clearly there were differences of opinion within the first year of the Board's working between the Minister and the Board.  That is obvious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As to how a certain amount of that money should be expended. I take it that what the main dispute arose about was whether that sum contained the money that should go to discharge the obligations of the undertakings taken over, and it seems to me that that question arose very early.  It does not matter whether it arose in 1928 or 1929.  The point I wish to make is this: That I feel that when the Minister saw that position developing he should at that time have come to the House and put the whole position before it.  He should have pointed out to the House what the Board's view was, what his view was and what he understood the view of the Oireachtas was when it passed that legislation.  He did not do that, and that is the first criticism that I want to offer of the Minister.  After all, this House was the ultimate court of appeal so far as the Minister was concerned, and I think that in 1929 we should have been made fully aware of the state of affairs that existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things in connection with this whole business that the ordinary Deputy finds it hard to understand. There is the question of the Chairman's position.  The Minister stated yesterday that if the Chairman had not tendered his resignation he <Col N="1762" /> might have found it necessary to come to this House and ask for his dismissal.  Now, obviously there were very great differences on vital issues between the Minister and the Chairman. They were evidently taking totally different points of view so far as policy was concerned, so far as the powers of the Board were concerned, and so far as the general conduct of this undertaking was concerned.  Yet we find that, although the Chairman resigned from his position as Chairman, he continued as a member of the Board.  It seems to me, without knowing any of the details of how they carry on their business, that his influence as a member of the Board would not be very much less than it was when he occupied the position of Chairman.  That is one point in connection with this whole business that seems a mystery to me.  If there was such a gulf between the Minister and the Chairman that if the Chairman had not resigned the Minister was prepared to ask the House to agree to his dismissal, it seems peculiar that when he did resign the Minister put him back as a member of the Board.</P>
    <P>There are many matters that were not touched on at all and that we would have been anxious to discuss if we had the accounts presented to us in the ordinary regular way.  There were matters affecting the working of the Board: its attitude to the workers, for instance; its general attitude to labour and the allegations of all kinds that have been made in that connection. One of the unions catering for electricians here found the position such that none of their men would work for the Board.  Allegations have been made that houses have been wired and electrical work of various kinds done by men who were not fully qualified to do it&mdash;work that was done by amateurs and local handymen. Allegations of that kind have undoubtedly been made.  I merely mention them and do not want to go into details now.  They are matters that we certainly would like to have had an opportunity of discussing and inquiring into.  Allegations have also been made of wasteful expenditure, of the opening of shops, stores, offices, in places that <Col N="1763" /> ordinary business people would not select, and other matters of that kind. I do not want to go into them now, but I want to make it clear that I do not regard for a moment the Board as being free from all fault and deserving of no censure or blame from anybody. It is a pity that immediately the Board was set up and before it began its operations there was not some attempt made&mdash;I do not believe there was from anything the Minister has said&mdash;to have right from the beginning a complete understanding as to the powers and limitations of the Board, and also in regard to general policy.  If that had been done at the beginning all this trouble, I believe, would have been avoided.  I quite see and am prepared to admit that it is very easy to be wise after the event, but, as I have said, it is a pity that was not done in the beginning.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be much use in trying to discover here where the fault lies.  I do not think that we can do it.  The question then for us to consider is what is to be done in view of what we are faced with at the present time?  The Minister asks us to pass this Bill to give him power which he does not hold under the present Act, and to place at his disposal two millions of money.  I feel that we have not sufficient knowledge or evidence before us to justify us on the mere statement of the Minister in doing that without further enquiry. I could understand his position if he came before the House and said &ldquo;Things have not gone as they should have gone, or as this House intended they should go; they have got into&mdash; I do not like using the word&mdash;a mess, but now it has been cleared up.  Those who were responsible have disappeared. A new Board has been formed with new Terms of Reference; so much money is required to pay off commitments, and to meet the kind of work I want to get done.&rdquo;  If the Minister came here with a proposition of that kind, the House would understand it, and would know what it was expected to do.  But the Minister has come along and said: &ldquo;I can get no information. I do not know whether one <Col N="1764" /> million, two millions, or three millions is wanted, but £850,000 is required immediately.  Beyond that I have no information, and I can not get any.&rdquo; The strange thing about it is that practically the same Board with one or two exceptions is there still.</P>

      <P>Five out of seven of those who are responsible and who have failed to produce any accounts to the Minister in a satisfactory way are there still.  The Minister has not stated that he is going to dismiss or to remove them.  He asks the House to give him this amount of money, and says: &ldquo;I will not pay this money unless I am satisfied as to the manner in which it is to be used.&rdquo;  He hopes to use that, I suppose, as a lever to coerce the Board into certain action. But has he any assurance that he can do so?  That is where I find the problem really difficult, that there is no certainty if things were wrong up to this that they are now going to go right.  I have no assurance that they are going to go right, and the Minister has not given us any grounds for believing&mdash;assuming that he gets this Bill through&mdash;that things will, there and then, be put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good told the House what would be done by an ordinary business man or by a board of directors if matters like this turned up.  I believe that Deputy Good made a practical suggestion. As representatives of the people who find the money to finance this great undertaking, and as one of those in whose guardianship the undertaking has been placed by the people, I certainly think that we are entitled to know very much more about this business than we know at present, and I suggest that before we proceed to give the Minister what in effect would be a blank cheque, we ought to have very much fuller knowledge of the whole affair, and not only that, but practical suggestions as to how the state of affairs that has transpired will be cleared up, and what are to be the plans and policies for the future. Within this House I believe we could find a committee of members, men of calm and judicial temperament, devoid <Col N="1765" /> of any desire to make party capital out of this matter, with power to send for persons and papers, who would go into the whole matter fully, hearing not alone the Minister's side of the case, but the Board's side; who would report to the House and give full information as to the real position, as well as suggesting what should be the future course having regard to what has happened.  I suggest very strongly to the Minister that, even if he succeeds in getting his Bill through by a majority, it will not be satisfactory from the national point of view to leave things as they are now without a full inquiry of the kind suggested.</P>
    <P>I believe it is possible to have such an inquiry by members of the House. If the Minister agrees to do that I would be quite prepared to give him whatever sum is immediately required, because I recognise that the undertaking must be carried on, commitments entered into much be honoured, work must proceed, and we cannot afford to leave this great undertaking in the position described by Deputy Flinn, viz., that there is a doubt whether they are able to pay their way or not.  I recognise that something like that must be done, and I am prepared to give the Minister whatever sum he says&mdash;£850,000, or even to the extent of one million&mdash;is immediately required to carry on and keep the undertaking going until the inquiry would be concluded.</P>
    <P>It is the future policy of this Board and of the undertaking I am concerned about.  If the inquiry is set up I believe it will do a national service, because it will remove the suspicions that are growing up and that always tend to grow up around an undertaking of this kind.  I believe, above all, that it will help to dispel any fears that people may have of going further in the way of experimenting in this direction, as the experiment was one that all of us are anxious to see successful. If the Minister cannot see his way to do that I fear there will be nothing left for me but to refuse to give him the blank cheque he has asked for, in the circumstances.  Candidly, I would be very sorry if I was forced into that position, but, on the evidence the <Col N="1766" /> Minister has put before the House, I cannot definitely say that he has been right from the beginning and that the Board has been wrong.  No one in the House, I think, is in a position to say that.  Having regard to what I said, if I have any prejudice at all in this matter, it is with the Minister and not with the Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy O'Connell has said but I disagree entirely with his conclusion. I think Deputy O'Connell struck the nail on the head when he said that what we are here to do to-day is to decide on the best method of setting this Electricity Supply Board on its feet.  To my mind, it has been a pleasing feature of almost every speech which has been made that that has been the primary idea in the speaker's mind.  I think that it was regrettable that many of the speakers got led away from that in thinking that it was necessary, at this stage, to try to apportion the blame for the position which has arisen.  I have no intention whatever of going along that line.  As has been said, we have not got the data.  Like Deputy O'Connell, my sympathies in the matter are very much with the Minister.  The Dáil very deliberately took a line of action which was mainly calculated to keep this Electricity Supply Board an independent body&mdash; independent of Ministerial control. The attacks which have been made on the Minister have been from two entirely different angles&mdash;one that he did not interfere and the other that he interfered too much.  But what the Dáil wanted was an independent body, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out&mdash;a body which could not be challenged here either by motion or question on matters of administration.  The question is not really who is to blame.  The point is, what is the exact position and what are the best measures to take to meet that position?  One of the most important things to remember is that we should not be led into magnifying the position.  What we are determined to do and what we have been determined to do all along is to make a success of the Shannon scheme, not alone in <Col N="1767" /> its production of electrical energy&mdash;I think it is an admitted fact that that has been a tremendous success&mdash;but in the business details which are necessary in order that that electrical energy may be properly distributed and made properly available to potential consumers.  Those are business details, very important business details, I grant, but surely it is not beyond us to devise some scheme which will secure that those business details are carried out efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise the point that, so far as I understand the position, the worst that can be said about it is that what has happened has merely led to some delay in the final success of the scheme which we are all pledged to do our best to secure and which we are all anxious to secure.  If the scheme fails, undoubtedly it will be a damaging blow to the credit of the country.  The Dáil, in dealing with this matter, was in a dilemma.  It did not want to take any step towards Government interference with what was really a public enterprise.  Neither did it want to surrender completely its control of this undertaking, which was given the use of public money for a public purpose&mdash;for the benefit of the people, as Deputy O'Connell has said. If fault does lie&mdash;and this is the only point on which I am going to touch upon the question of blame&mdash;it lies in the Act which the Dáil passed, which was deliberately designed to make the control of the Minister as slight as possible.  I think that we placed the Minister in a most impractical position, because we made it impossible for him to exercise any kind of control unless he was prepared to dismiss the Board.  Dismissing the Board in the middle of its work would have been to leave the helm without a steersman, and it might have been, and probably would have been, a disastrous step to take.  In saying that, I do not wish to be taken as attaching the blame to the Board.  I attach this amount of blame to the Board&mdash;if I may use that form of words&mdash;that we did not get the audited accounts of the undertaking and its proceedings in anything like a <Col N="1768" /> reasonable time after the close of the year.  We should have had the accounts of the undertaking for the year 1929-30 given to us shortly after March, 1930.  I understood the Minister to say yesterday that he has been exerting every pressure to get those accounts and that he has not yet succeeded in getting them.  Those are the accounts for the year 1929-30.  If it is true that the Minister has used every effort to get those accounts&mdash; and I believe he has done so, as he told us himself&mdash;it shows that there is something wrong.  But the fact that they were not produced cannot be attributed to the Minister.  Beyond that, I do not wish to go into the question of blame.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Briscoe gives me a chance, I will bring out what I consider are very good points which he made in the course of his remarks. I am not speaking against Deputy Briscoe.  I am stating what I conceive to be the present position. I am not speaking against anybody.  I want to get at what is best to be done to get the Electricity Supply Board going and to make the undertaking the ultimate success we want it to be. Deputy O'Connell stressed that aspect emphatically, and that is the right thing for us to do.  I think that it is unfortunate that this sum of £850,000, about which there was a dispute as to whether it was included or not in the two and a half million pounds given by the Dáil to the Board for the purpose <Col N="1770" /> of the undertaking, should have been introduced into this discussion at all.  To my mind, it does not affect the matter one iota.  If it is decided that that £850,000 is not included in the two and a half million pounds, it simply means that you are making the Board a present of the £850,000 more than the Dáil thought it was giving. The Dáil will have to vote that £850,000 in order to meet these undischarged liabilities, so that you are really dealing with the matter in a different way.</P>
      <P>It does not affect one iota the question that is before us&mdash;the total amount the Electricity Supply Board is to have for the purpose of bringing into being the lines that are required for the transmission and distribution of the Shannon current.  I think it is a pity that it was even mentioned in the discussion more than to say, as the Minister said yesterday, that he believed and understood that there was enough remaining of that sum to meet the hitherto undischarged liabilities of these undertakings.  I think I understood the Minister to say that yesterday.  It simply means that the Dáil on that view voted £1,650,000 for other purposes.  The difference is that the Board took the view that they had already two and a half millions for these other purposes.  It is all a question of how much more is to be given.  If you say that they have already two and a half million for these other purposes, you would not require the same sum for these other purposes. The amount you would require would be £850,000 less and you would have to vote £850,000 to meet the undischarged liabilities of these other undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Putting that aside, I come to my understanding of the position as it is.  Here I get very near indeed to Deputy Briscoe's concluding remarks. There are debts, if you like to call them so, which must be met immediately in order to keep the Electricity Supply Board on its feet.  The Minister gave a figure yesterday, I think, of £700,000 as the sum of those debts.  If you do not vote that now what will you do?  Bring the Electricity Supply Board to an end?  Wreck the <Col N="1771" /> whole scheme?  Lose the credit of the whole country?  If you do not enable them to meet their liabilities and make payments, the credit of the country must go.  I do not see how anyone can get behind that.  It has been stated that firms are waiting to bring the Electricity Supply Board into court.  They cannot get their accounts paid.  We cannot stand for that.  I think every Deputy will admit that we must provide the money which is required to enable the Board to pay its debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole issue it seems to me is that a sum must be provided.  The debts must be paid. Furthermore, commitments have been undertaken for extensions whatever they may be.  Sums are required for these extensions to enable the Board to keep its promises.  These the Minister told us amounted to a quarter of a million or £300,000.  You cannot expect the Board to carry on even for a limited period without some available cash in hands.  It seems to me to be a reasonable thing to state that you must provide the money that the Board requires to meet its undischarged liabilities.  We must provide about a million and a quarter to re-establish the credit of the Board, to put it on its feet, and enable it to carry on successfully.  So far, I cannot conceive how anybody could vote against the Second Reading of the Bill.  We must give the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the Committee Stage, the amount of the money, how <Col N="1772" /> it is to be allotted, what is to be done with it, what are the purposes for which it is&mdash;there is plenty of scope there for modification.  My view at present is that we should alter the Bill in Committee in such a way as to make perfectly certain that we shall have an opportunity at an early date of rediscussing the matter in this House.  Deputy Briscoe&mdash;I do not want to bring a personal matter into the discussion&mdash;did me the honour to quote various remarks which I made on the Committee Stage of the principal Bill.  I have not had time to read them all.  I looked up some of them and I do not wish to draw back one word of what I said on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am just as keen now as I was then on the complete and absolute necessity for full publication year by year of the working accounts of the Board so that we may be in a position, so far as we have any expert knowledge, to judge for ourselves as to whether the scheme is working economically and whether it is likely to prove the ultimate success which we all hope it will, and more important still, so that those who have that expert knowledge may be in a position to form an opinion.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential that we should get regular publication of these accounts.  But what ought we to do in the actual securing of it?  We left the Minister in the position that if he simply does not get that information he has got to dismiss the Board. There is no other action open to him. That has to be amended.  I think the Minister indicated himself that it was necessary to amend the Bill, because as he said he retained the services of certain members of the Board in order that he might discuss with them a scheme in which the business interests might be retained on the Board in a successful and satisfactory way.  I doubt, however, from a very cursory examination of the Bill, whether it would be possible for him to make that modification without coming back to the House for power to do so. In any case I think there should be an opportunity in the House for discussing the scheme before the House <Col N="1773" /> decides on giving him this power.  I think that is a very important point in connection with the scheme.  The conclusion of the matter to my mind is that we must provide the money and provide it at once because we do not want to pull up the work of the Board.</P>

      <P>In any case Deputy Lemass's point does not meet mine.  I tried to show one and a quarter millions as necessary.  He does not contend that they have got that money. The money must be provided to some amount, and the actual amount can only be got at approximately at present.  I said that I disagreed with Deputy O'Connell's conclusion as I disagreed, though I approve very much of Deputy de Valera's remarks in many ways, with his conclusion that a committee of the House should be appointed to inquire into this.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell obviously did.  It seems to me that would not be the right way to meet the difficulty.  You want experts.  You want, as Deputy Good said yesterday, some firm which is accustomed to dealing with accounts of this magnitude. You want to put the matter in the hands of auditors who are capable of dealing with a scheme of this magnitude. It is only by having men who are experts in dealing with large amounts that you can arrive at a proper estimate of the position.  As has been said, the position is clearly serious.  I believe, however, it is not at all so serious as there is a tendency to believe.  I see nothing in the position which is likely to do more than delay the success of the scheme, to which success we are all looking forward.  I think that the majority of us are anxious to get the complete publication of the accounts which has been insisted upon.  We should take steps to ensure that the matter will come before us again as soon as the Minister is in a position to give us these accounts.  We should then have an opportunity of discussing them and, incidentally, of discussing the general question of policy.  If the Board is going to be changed we should have an opportunity of discussing the new scheme that the Minister proposes for the new Board.  I cannot see how we could refuse to grant money.  We must do it in order to save the Board and in order to save our own credit. The question of the amount and how it is to be allotted is one for the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of reiterating what has been said in this matter.  I do not presume to be an expert on finance or an expert in electrical economics.  As a matter of fact, I am somewhat confused by the millions that have been flung at our heads during this debate.  I am certain <Col N="1775" /> that there are other Deputies on both sides of the House who are in the same predicament, if only they would admit it.  I have attempted to follow the discussion, and there are certain points on which I seek enlightenment. Deputy Thrift referred to the question of apportioning blame.  We are not in a position to apportion blame without the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the Managing Director and the Chairman of the Board who were compulsorily, or otherwise, retired from that Board.  As regards that matter, there were three directors, Mr. Foley, Mr. Egan and Dr. Kennedy, who were reappointed for six months.  They served with the two men who were retired. I have no brief for the two men who were retired.  They are very estimable gentlemen, I believe, and quite able gentlemen, but I have never met either of them. The point that strikes me is: were not all the members of that Board, severally and collectively, responsible for the financial policy of the Board?  If they were, in what respect were those who were dismissed or resigned more incompetent or negligent than those who were reappointed to the Board?  Was any special duty delegated to the Chairman or the Managing Director?  If so, I hope the Minister will tell us what that duty was. The essential factor is this: to whom was the accountant of the Board responsible? Hardly to the Managing Director, whom he might be holding up. Does the Minister know what he was doing?  If he does not, I maintain that he should.  He was certainly responsible to someone and we have not been told to whom.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be in order to advert to other problems arising in connection with the Shannon scheme but, lest I might confuse the issue, I shall refrain from so doing.  We have to clear up the difficulty, call it a mess or call it what you like.  It seems to me that <Col N="1776" /> the Minister, in asking for two millions, has not fixed upon that sum without having a definite plan in mind.  He certainly has formed some estimate, however rough.  It is not characteristic of the Minister to ask arbitrarily for two millions or four millions without knowing upon what he is going to spend the money.  I suggest he should be more frank with the House.  He should tell us what he intends to do with this money.  Deputy Thrift states that one and a quarter millions are immediately required.  I suggest that that is, more or less, an attack on the finances of the scheme.  The Minister has made no case for the one and a quarter millions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the Minister's own figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gave us some information as to why he now demands two millions, we might be in a better position to judge the whole case.  Reference was made to an amendment I moved last year for an extra half a million.  At that time I heard what was common knowledge in business circles in this city&mdash;that there were differences between the Board and the Minister regarding responsibility for the liabilities of the concerns transferred to the Board.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated definitely that he has no intention of amortising that now, even if he gets the money.  Those were going concerns, and there were profits.  I presume the profits are there still.  What is the urgency now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, the Board was entitled to £2,500,000.  The Minister has advanced £1,900,000.  Why not advance the difference if they are in such difficulties?  I think he is bound to do so under the Act, and no agreement the Minister has made with the Board can overrule an Act of the Oireachtas or prevent them getting the money.  If these undertakings are in debt, why not give them money to meet the debt?  That is provided for under Section 12 of the Act.  Does the sum of £3,335,000, which the Minister mentioned in connection with liabilities of the Board, include working capital, and if so, to what extent?  If it does not include working capital, how was <Col N="1777" /> working capital provided?  By the Minister and his Department, this sum of £2,500,000 seems to be regarded merely as expenditure.  It is, in fact, the capital invested in the business, and it would be so regarded by any business man.  We would like some information on that point.</P>
    <P>The actual amount is really irrelevant. The question is whether a return is being made.  Does the Minister suggest that any of that money has been wrongfully or improperly invested by the Board?  Would any sum less than that which they have so invested have been sufficient to have ensured the development which the Minister contends has taken place in the Shannon scheme?  It is possible the Minister under-estimated the scheme at the outset, and it has turned out to be a greater scheme than he anticipated.  The energy put into its development is greater than he hoped for.  If that is the case, and it seems to me it is the case, then the Minister should come to this House and frankly state the fact that that was so; that the scheme had developed beyond his expectations, that the rapidity of the development prevented the Board possibly from keeping the accounts up-to-date, and that more money was required to be invested in this undertaking.  Had the Minister done that I feel sure that he would have had not only the sympathy, but the cordial co-operation of this House in providing the further investment required for funds for even the greater success of this scheme.  We have no desire to imperil this scheme.  We do not think that two million pounds is necessary, or that even one million pounds is necessary.  The Minister should tell us what exactly is necessary to meet the present debts&mdash;to meet the liabilities, and to carry on for the next three months.  The Minister should present us when we meet again in October, with the detailed statement of the accounts before any further monies are granted.  In addition to that, there should be an inquiry as to whether the old Board was a failure, and I am not suggesting it was.  I cannot apportion the blame and I cannot fix the responsibility. <Col N="1778" /> Meantime I suggest that the Board should get the amount of the money required to carry on.  I suggest that this money is much less than one million.  That inquiry would give us a full account here in this House before any more money would be asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to discern what the case that has been made here by the Minister for the million and a quarter pounds referred to. Even as regards the rest of the money sought here I would have liked further evidence.  I share the feeling expressed by the Leader of the Labour Party that there is a lack of evidence. The Minister, in his speech, seemed to me himself not very clearly to advert to the evidence upon which he proposes to act.  The Minister, on a matter so important as the granting of two million pounds, referred to various documents and letters which apparently he considered material.  Apparently he referred to them from memory. That is hardly satisfactory.  Not merely that, but I think it is not too great a claim to make upon the Minister, in a matter of this sort, that if the Minister refers to correspondence passing between him and this Board, refers to memoranda relating to interviews and references to alleged agreements, that these agreements and letters should be here in the House, that they ought to be cited and quoted from by the Minister, and that the House ought not to be asked to accept any paraphrase of the Minister's, or any summary of the Minister's, as to what they contain.  The documents ought to be here, and the documents ought to be made available to the Deputies, so that they may draw their own conclusion from them, and so that they may, if they wish, follow up any <Col N="1779" /> line of inquiry that anything in these letters or memoranda may suggest to them.</P>
      <P>I feel also that the Minister has not given the House the assistance to which it is fairly entitled in regard to seeing precisely what are those major matters of policy that have led to what some people seem to regard as a national humiliation.  What are they? Apparently under Section 12 of the Statute of 1927 the Minister for Finance is bound to pay over to the Board sums of money amounting to £2,500,000 on request.  I do not express any view as to the construction of the section.  I simply take it that that is conceded by the Minister.  If that is so why should the Minister withhold any part of that money in a left-handed attempt to enforce the production of accounts to which he is entitled under Section 7?  Surely that is not the way to do it?</P>
      <P>Surely if the Board have been given by this House a statutory right to that money they ought to get it.  The Board, presumably, had made their plans on the basis of receiving that money.  They have taken steps to make these Shannon generating works remunerative by linking them up with the consumer. They have budgeted on that statutory obligation of the Minister's being carried out.  Why should he refuse to pay?  If the Minister is entitled to those accounts he is, of course, entitled to them.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to suggest that there exists machinery for the compelling of the furnishing of these accounts.  Why has he not resorted to that machinery?  This Board is an independent Board.  The Minister need make no apology for any action he might take duly to compel the Board to carry out their obligations under Section 7 of this Act in regard to the keeping and furnishing of accounts. The way to do that is not to withhold the money to which the statute gives the Board the right, and which seems to be absolutely necessary for the carrying on of the business of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend to be a business <Col N="1780" /> man.  The phrase has been used here pretty freely.  I make no pretence to that, but, so far as I can see, the whole basis of these discussions is that the Board really want money and that really they are short of money.  I gather from the Minister that the Minister had not any confirmed view that on this statute he had any right whatever to withhold any part of these two and a half million pounds, but that, by virtue of some arrangement come to between him and the Chairman of the Board (I cannot recall his exact words), he retains this money. The question has been asked by Deputy Fahy what right has the Minister to enter into any agreement with this Board?  What right has the Board to enter into an agreement with him? The Board was set up by the House to act under the statute.  If under the statute the Board are entitled to get this money for their working expenses, what right have they to waive that money?  I fail to see any.  Apparently owing to a similar difference of opinion arising on Section 39 this trouble that has now arisen may be to a large extent attributed.  It has been suggested here that this £600,000, or whatever the figure is, representing the outstanding capital indebtedness of municipal undertakings taken over by the Electricity Supply Board, ought to be disregarded for the purpose of a discussion on this Bill.  That is not relevant at all.  I cannot see that.  As has been pointed out here, that seems to be the very kernel of the dispute between the Board and the Minister. The Minister speaks of making a present of £600,000 to the Board if he yielded to the Board's interpretation of Section 39 (6) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, and some other Deputy here endorsed that view with great enthusiasm.  He repeated the phrase, &ldquo;making a present to the Board.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  Is not the money going to the Board for the purpose of being expended on the completion of this scheme?  Is it not conceded now by the Minister that a very large sum is required over and above even the two and a half million pounds to do that?  Where does the &ldquo;present&rdquo; to the Board come in?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> The Board, under Section 39 (6), is in this position.  The sub-section says:</P>
    <P>Whenever the former undertaker is a local authority the new undertaker shall as on and from the date of the vesting order become and be by virtue of this sub-section liable for and bound to indemnify and keep indemnified the former undertaker against all capital loans (including current bank overdraft) outstanding at the date of the vesting order and borrowed by the former undertaker for the purpose of the undertaking and all mortgages and charges on the undertaking or the assets thereof outstanding on the date of the vesting order ...</P>
    <P>What force is the House to attribute to the words &ldquo;and keep indemnified&rdquo;? It is not that he is to indemnify, but to keep indemnified.  Surely that contemplated that loans which were being served by means of a sinking fund would continue to be served by means of that sinking fund out of the revenue produced by the undertaker.  Otherwise what is meant by that phrasing, that in respect of the local authority the Board is to be bound to indemnify and keep indemnified against these outstanding capital loans and mortgages? Why not have used plain English and say that the Board is to pay off all capital loans out of the moneys it is to get, if the House meant that?  We have been treated here by certain Deputies to statements about what the intention of the House was.  What I entirely fail to understand is where this intention is to be got.  Is it from certain discussions which seem to be lodged in the bosom of the Minister for Industry as to what the intention was in regard to a certain statute or agreement. Where is it to be found?  The only safe course to take is to administer the statute precisely and exactly as you find it, to play the game according to all the rigour of the rules.  If this House feels now that the better course would be to pay off these capital loans, pay off any stock outstanding, pay off any mortgage made to raise money, let them say so.</P>
    <P>But let that not be made an excuse for giving the Minister under this new <Col N="1782" /> Bill the power of interfering with and controlling the actions of the Electricity Supply Board by doling out money at his sweet will, a power that he was denied by the Act of 1927.  I am not suggesting that the Minister, if the power is conferred upon him, will exercise it unwisely, incompetently, or anything like that.  I merely say that the Legislature, in its wisdom, in 1927 embarked upon a wholly different plan and set up an independent Board.  There is nothing inherently bad in that scheme.  On the contrary, various speakers in the course of the debate seem still to be gratified that such an expedient was adopted.  Why should the House now go back on that?  The only reason that seems to be advanced is that there have been these disputes between the Minister and the Board as to the effect that should be given to the statute and that both as regards the municipal undertakings and the two and a half million pounds the Board, so far as one can see, took their stand on the letter of the statute as they ought to have done.  They occupy a fiduciary position to this House and the people of this State. What right have they to depart from the statute?  If there is any real doubt about the interpretation of the Act, it is hardly necessary to say that there is a cheap and quick method of having the words (if there is any obscurity about them) authoritatively interpreted.</P>

      <P>The cheap method is this: There is no disputed question of fact; therefore the matter can be summarily decided by a judge.  It is not necessary to have a trial; it can be summarily decided on a case stated as a pure question of law without delay, and cheaply decided.  Cheaply decided even if it bore relation to a much smaller sum than £2,000,000.  But, apparently, as has been indicated already by Deputy O'Connell in another connection, the Minister prefers to have these things done in a different way.  It has been said in this <Col N="1783" /> House, from apparently reliable hearsay, that work in connection with this scheme in other directions, as regards fitting and so on, has been entrusted to handymen.  Apparently when you have to interpret the statute also you are to go to handymen.  That is, apparently, the idea of the Minister.  I repeat that if there is any real dispute or difference as regards the interpretation of either Section 12 (3) or Section 39 (6) that could have been very quickly and cheaply set at rest with full authority, and the House would know where it is.  Instead of that we must take everything on trust.  As I said before, documents and letters are referred to from hearsay.  They are not even on the Minister's table. There is no indication that the House will have access to them.  Apparently things are to be done in accordance with what somebody conceived to be the intention, rather than in accordance with the law and the Act.  Apparently all sorts of short cuts are to be taken and we are to risk the consequences.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Opposition has suggested, and the suggestion has met with a certain measure of approval, that this whole matter should be referred to a tribunal of experts.  That is the way to deal with it.  The suggestion I think, came from Deputy Thrift that really what was needed is that this matter should be put into the hands of auditors who are familiar with this question.  I do not know what is meant by that.  Section 7 (2) provides that the accounts are to be audited by duly qualified auditors appointed annually for the purpose by the Minister.  I have enough confidence in the Minister to believe that the Minister selected duly qualified auditors who were capable of dealing with it as far as auditing was concerned. As somebody else has pointed out, what is really necessary is not an auditor, but an electrical economist, somebody who has special knowledge in a big way in regard to electrical undertakings of the magnitude of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to refuse to grant this £2,000,000 asked for by the Minister. <Col N="1784" /> Wholly different considerations arise if the Minister confines himself to asking for three-quarters of a million, but I ask the House to refuse to give the Minister what has been called a blank cheque.  A Deputy has used the phrase that if you do not give this you will wreck the whole scheme and destroy the credit of the country.  Surely such phrases are scarcely worthy of a discussion of this kind and hardly helpful to the House in discussing a matter of this sort.  The House should not hesitate, even if it indicated humiliation to the Minister in this matter, to refuse it. But it does not.  No one is apportioning blame in this, at least no responsible person would dream of apportioning blame in this in the complete absence of data.  Therefore, the only course the House can take in order to prevent any recurrence of what we all regret is to refuse this request of the Minister.  I do not see how that can be done, according to the rules of this House, except by voting against the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one or two questions before I give my vote on this matter.  Not being satisfied that I had correctly followed the Minister, although I took fairly copious notes of his speech, I read the admirable summary of his speech in the Press to-day to assure myself.  I find that the figure of £850,000 has been mentioned so frequently in the Minister's statement, and in the speech as made, that I would like to be quite clear as to how this figure was arrived at.  I understand that in the course of the activities of the Electricity Supply Board a number of municipal undertakings were appropriated and taken over by the Board, such as publicly and municipally-owned undertakings. I know there is an outstanding exception in the case of Cork, where the undertaking was privately-owned, but Dublin, Rathmines, Pembroke, Dun Laoghaire, Clonmel, Enniscorthy, and a number of other undertakings had to be acquired and paid for, and I want to be satisfied upon this.  Is this <Col N="1785" /> £850,000 that the Minister referred to the approximate sum of the liabilities of acquired undertakings at the date of their acquisition?  These loans, I understand, were made repayable out of the revenue of the E.S.B., and I think it is unfair to debit the whole of the £850,000 to the E.S.B. when they were paying for these owned undertakings out of revenue.  I want to know how much of that £850,000 was paid by the E.S.B. by way of compensation for the acquisition of plant, installations, etc., in these municipal undertakings to which I have referred. Did the Minister arrive at this figure in the way that it presents itself to me?  I do not want to misinterpret or misquote the Minister, but I think he suggested that the Electricity Supply Board was by statute entitled to receive £1,650,000, and that it spent £2,500,000.  Taking the £1,650,000 from £2,500,000, I get the sum of £850,000, and that is what I want to be assured of by the Minister.  Am I correct in that calculation, or is that the way the Minister arrived at the figure of £850,000?</P>
      <P>Like Deputies in other parts of the House I feel that this question is one which must be approached in an altogether different way from many questions which come before this House from time to time.  No Deputy so far has found fault with the Minister as a Minister. I must say there is a good deal of logic and reason on the side of those who suggested that things were allowed to develop in a way that they should not be allowed to develop.  The Minister, while exercising control by statute, found at the end of a period, according to his own statement, that he never got any correct returns or statistics or information that he considered necessary.  He never got these returns.  What I am surprised at is that the Minister has not long before now come to the Dáil and asked for any powers he considered necessary.  I feel no Deputy would object to giving him these powers, in view of the fact that this is not a mere local institution, but a great national undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we are all glad that tribute has been paid to the young and gifted man who conceived the scheme and <Col N="1786" /> carried it out, and who, I feel, in all the circumstances has been badly treated.  I may be wrong, but that is my deduction from some of the speeches I have listened to and even from some portion of the Minister's own statement.  I hope his treatment will not be taken as an indication of the Government policy in the future, because if it is we are not going to attract to the State and to the national service young men of brains and ability if they are to be scrapped at the end of a particular period because somebody has bungled.  I also feel it is a reflection on the businessmen who were connected with the Board, men who have made a success of other business enterprises.  I consider it is a reflection upon their ability and, to an extent, on their probity, that they should be, even by inference, held up to be incompetent, as the captions in the daily Press would lead one to expect. Those business men have undoubtedly co-operated very largely in making the scheme a success from one point of view, at any rate.  Perhaps it may be found if, and when, this examination takes place that they may have from time to time resented interference from outside, and when I say from outside I mean from the Civil Service Department.  Nobody has greater appreciation of the value of civil servants to the State in their own sphere than I have.  But I do know that civil servants, particularly in the higher division, have a tendency to develop what is known as the official mind.  They cannot get away from it.  It is part of their training; it is a corollary to the system which builds up and maintains Civil Service.  I may be anticipating what may be adduced or evolved from an inquiry, if and when it takes place. That, of course, depends on whether the Government or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party will vote for this motion.  It will largely, if not altogether, depend on their votes.</P>
    <P>But I do feel that it may evolve from an inquiry, if and when held, that businessmen doing their business in their own way did not want to be subjected to undue interference by highly placed officials in the Civil <Col N="1787" /> Service.  I may be wrong.  I am not even suggesting that I am right, but knowing what I do about the capacity of the businessmen on the Board, they were not all supermen but at least they were men who appreciated their position and their responsibilities and you have to-day, one of the greatest undertakings in the world, a monument to the genius of the young man, Dr. MacLaughlin, whose name is mentioned in this Bill and also to the Minister.  I do not want to take any credit whatever from the Minister, because we all know that at its early stages the Minister was the godfather to that undertaking. Some other Deputy&mdash;I do not know how it was&mdash;suggested that in anything that might occur here, either now or at any future time, to prevent in any way the further development of that great national scheme the Minister would share the discredit that may be brought about, but the Minister would also deserve, equally with Dr. MacLaughlin, any encomiums that could be given if it were a still greater success.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister must appreciate the fact that all the Deputies who have spoken so far&mdash;at least those whom I have heard&mdash;have paid tribute to those who were associated with that scheme in its earlier stages and they have all been most moderate in their criticisms, possibly with one or two exceptions.  It is a healthy sign, and I do hope that the Minister will at least satisfy some of the Deputies who have criticised, not for the sake of criticising or for being carping in any way, but who have done so inspired by the very highest and best motives.  I at least want to be satisfied with regard to this sum of £850,000.  How much of it was expended by way of return of loans or paying off liabilities incurred by the Electricity Supply Board in taking over the municipal undertakings to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all asking for more information, and there is just a little that I want for myself.  I think <Col N="1788" /> that the Minister should tell us what reason the present Chairman of the Board has given for withholding the information he has been asked for. The present Chairman of the Board is a civil servant: he has had a Civil Service training.  We cannot believe that he has simply said: &ldquo;I am not in a position to furnish you with the accounts or with the statistical information you require.&rdquo;  We are sure that he has not made such a reply as that.  It is useless, then, for the Minister to reply, as he did yesterday: &ldquo;I cannot get it from him.&rdquo;  If the Minister says that, I think, in justice to the House, he should go a step further and say what reasons Mr. Browne has put up for not giving this information. It is presumed that when the present Chairman was appointed last October he was told of the fault there was to be found with his predecessor in that respect.  It is presumed that he was told that one of the very important things amongst his duties would be to furnish punctually and correctly all statistical information required, and particularly to concentrate on the annual accounts.  If he has not acted upon that instruction there must be some very good reason for it, and I think we should be told it.  There is no good blinking the fact that in the Dublin streets at present it is being stated that no Chairman could give actual accounts with regard to the Electricity Supply Board, that accurate records are not in existence.  If that is the state of things that has to be faced then we might as well have it here.  It will do no good to let these statements pass, to let them gain more and more unsupported currency. It would be better either to admit them or to deny them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, there is a question that Deputy O'Connell put that I hope the Minister will answer&mdash;why it is that when the late Chairman was practically dismissed from his position as Chairman he was reinstated as a member of the Board.  Apparently he had given no satisfaction whatever as Chairman.  Was it to avoid a possible lawsuit that he was reinstated as an ordinary member of the Board and <Col N="1789" /> given a higher remuneration, I understand, than was given to the two other members of the same class on the Board?  Was it merely to prevent an outcry on the part of the public, or what exactly was the reason for it?  It is a thing the public are asking, why it is that a man who had so quickly fallen out of grace with the Minister was worth continuing on the Board and probably exerting a very big influence there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Board generally, taking into account the numerous protests on the part of the Minister when the 1927 Act was going through, that the Board was to be independent, that he was not going to interfere with it in any way, side by side with his statement yesterday, that at a very early stage he discovered that it would be necessary for him to get reports from the Board and to be in frequent consultation with it, it is impossible to resist the inference that the Minister had really no confidence in the Board at the time it was established, that the Board had probably been forced upon him by influences apart from the technical merits of the particular individuals that he had appointed on the Board.  Certainly I think that an impartial outsider reading the debate will come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>There is just one further question. At present it appears there are at least two civil servants on the Board, and it is not clear as to what their position is.  Are they acting under the Minister's instructions on the Board, or are they independent of him?  It is altogether a mysterious position, I think, for these civil servants.  It is mysterious as far as this House is concerned. We do not know what the relationship of the Minister is to the other members of the Board.  It is certainly remarkable that since they were appointed last October they have not been able to improve things sufficiently to enable the Minister to make a more hopeful statement than the one he made yesterday.  If in his reply he is able to give us more information and more satisfactory information than in his opening speech, I think we will all be glad.  Certainly I think this Bill should not go through in its present <Col N="1790" /> form for the reasons that have been stated by several speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. S.T. O'Kelly Mr. S.T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be any very ardent desire on the part of the general members of the Party opposite to take part in this discussion, and I am not particularly keen on taking part in it myself.  I am not anxious for one reason, and that is that so many of our members here have spoken that the impression may be gained that we desire to make this a Party matter.  That is far from our intention and certainly far from my intention.  We are, as Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Thrift, and perhaps one or two other Deputies said, interested in this matter purely on national grounds.  We are interested in it, of course, on other grounds as well, but our fundamental interest is because this electricity undertaking is a big national institution, and it has at least twelve million pounds of our money sunk in it.  That is an additional reason.  We are anxious to see that scheme made the success that it will be made some day or another.  I believe so far it has been from the technical side a success as far as the production of electricity is concerned. It has not been a success, evidently, from some aspects of the business side. That, of course, will in time be remedied, too, but I believe that it will not be remedied by the want of frankness that the Minister exhibited here in this House.  He has not told &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&rdquo;  He has suppressed facts.  I will give him one instance, one that I nailed him on myself when he told us that he did not call for the resignation of the ex-Chairman.  He had to admit a very few minutes afterwards that not alone did he call for it, but that if the ex-Chairman had not resigned he would have come to the House and asked for his dismissal. There have been more things that the Minister should have told to the House frankly and given the House a fair opportunity of judging the facts.  We have not got the facts.  We have not got the full figures; we have not got all the particulars to enable us to judge.  The Minister puts himself, to <Col N="1791" /> my mind, personally very much in the wrong in coming before the House and suppressing important facts in connection with this matter.  He prejudiced his case in my mind at any rate, and I do not want to be prejudiced in a matter of this kind.  When we are weighing up the pros and cons of such an important national concern as the Electricity Supply Board, and considering the present mess that it is in from certain points of view, and the possibilities of getting it out of that mess and putting it on the high road to success, we are not helped by the Minister's want of frankness.</P>
      <P>I am told that auditors have been in there examining the accounts for, roughly, six months, and that a preliminary report of the auditors is now in the hands of the Minister.  He did not tell us anything about that.  I can give him the name of the firm of auditors.  He ought to have told us that, and if it is correct that there is in his hands a preliminary report he ought to have mentioned that fact; and if the report was of such a preliminary nature that he could not face any facts or figures upon it, he might have told us that he had such a report and that he had auditors in.  I do not know who appointed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board, Deputy Flinn said, had appointed auditors while other people say that a firm of auditors has been working for months investigating the accounts, and if my information is correct, a preliminary report has already been furnished to the Minister's Department.  Let me say, in answer to Deputy Thrift, that we want to be reasonable and helpful in this matter.  We dislike voting against any reasonable proposal made here to give the Electricity Supply Board the money it requires immediately.  We, with every other Party in the House, are prepared to do that, but we are left no option by the Minister.  That is our position.  We want to be reasonable.  We do not want unnecessarily to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill, but the Minister, is leaving us no option.  He will not <Col N="1792" /> meet us.  We would like to give the money immediately needed, and to reserve giving whatever further moneys are required until the enquiry mentioned by Deputy de Valera and several other Deputies has been held. Deputy de Valera indicated that an enquiry was necessary as to what the further necessities of the Board were. We think that enquiry should be held. Deputy de Valera was anxious to move an amendment to-day if the Standing Orders would have allowed it, without notice.  His amendment was to this effect: that while prepared to provide at once in addition to the two and a half millions already voted a further sum of £500,000 to meet the liabilities and immediate needs of the Electricity Supply Board, the Dáil refuses to give a Second Reading to the Bill, providing two millions to be expended at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, until it is satisfied as a result of inquiry by electrical economists and experts as to the necessity for this sum and the specific use to which it is to be applied.  If the Standing Orders allowed, it was the intention of Deputy de Valera and of our Party to have such an amendment moved.  The amendment was not accepted by the Chair.</P>
    <P>The ruling given from the Chair was that it could not be accepted under Standing Orders without notice except by the unanimous agreement of the House.  The amendment embodys what we think ought to be done. We think that the money immediately necessary ought to be voted.  We think that if the sum of £500,000 were voted now, and if that were added to the sum of more than £500,000 belonging to the Board which the Minister has in hands and which has already been voted by the House for the purposes of the Board, these two sums representing more than £1,000,000 would be sufficient to meet the immediate necessities of the Board to enable it to carry on until such time as the committee of experts referred to in the amendment would have been able to examine the situation and report to the House.  When that committee <Col N="1793" /> of experts had reported the House could be called together to take what further steps were necessary to vote the moneys that might be needed.  We would like if that position could be met by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking for a blank cheque for two million pounds.  We do not think that sum is required. The Minister speaking last night said: &ldquo;The moment he heard the point that the undischarged liabilities were supposed not to be in the £2,500,000 he asked the Board to show how the capital sum and the surplus was likely to be remunerative.  He got no satisfaction.&rdquo;  We might now ask the Minister if he can tell us whether the two million pounds, or at least the portion of it that would be left over after paying the immediate debts, will be remunerative or not. He cannot tell us.  Why should we do what the Minister will not do.  The Minister would not give that money to the Board because they could not assure him that it would be remunerative. Why should we give one million and a quarter to the Minister if he is not in a position to tell us whether it will be remunerative or not.  That is our position.  We believe that not more than £500,000, in addition to the sums already voted by the House, is immediately required for the present purposes of the Board, and that sum we are prepared to vote.  If the Minister can show that some sum in addition to that, even another quarter or half a million, is immediately required for the purpose of carrying on the Board then we are prepared to meet him, but we are not prepared to hand over to him two million pounds to be used by him just as he pleases.  We are not prepared to do that judging by the mess that has been made of this, whether by the Minister himself or by the Board we are not going to say, but between them in the last year or two.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the trouble between the Electricity Supply Board and the Minister has been going on for more than a year, perhaps for two years.  There has been reference to it in the newspapers frequently. <Col N="1794" /> There have been big splash headings in the newspapers giving a sensational story, first, as to the resignation of the Chairman, and, later on, of the Managing Director.  Other rumours have been mentioned in the Press from time to time.  Speaking for myself, I have heard rumours of all kinds, sometimes rumours relating to the Shannon scheme in its workings.  These rumours have adversely affected the Shannon Board, but nothing has so adversely affected it as the Minister's statement yesterday.  First of all, I would like to know why it was that the Minister did not come to the House more than a year ago when this trouble first arose with the Board.  I am reliably informed that the trouble between the Board and the Minister arose in practically the first month after the Electricity Supply Board had started to work.</P>
    <P>I am told, on the very best of authority, that the first application made by the Board to the Department of Finance for money was refused by that Department because the Electricity Supply Board would not state the purpose for which the money was to be used.  The Board referred to the section of the Act, which states that the Minister for Finance shall supply money on the demand of the Board. The Department of Finance had to yield eventually.  If that be true, as I believe it is, it shows there was trouble from the very beginning between the Department of Finance and the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister was aware of that.  He has been aware of it since it started and he allowed it to go on.  What I would charge him with is that he allowed that trouble to develop until it got to such a stage that the Chairman of the Board had to go first, and the Managing Director later.  All that arose out of the trouble.  The whole concern was materially damaged in its credit as a result of the Minister not acting, as I think he ought to have acted, by coming early to the House.  Whether he wished to dismiss the Board or not, he could have come to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan suggested that an easier way, and a cheaper way, would be to take the question between <Col N="1795" /> the Board and the Minister and as to the reading of that section of the Act to the court, and to have it decided there.  I do not know whether it would be very cheap.  It might not be so very cheap but probably it would be done very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be cheaper than this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly have cost less to the nation and to the Shannon scheme than the procedure adopted by the Minister, because nothing that has been said by the opponents of the scheme, since it originated, and there were critics of it&mdash;I was one for a time, admittedly, but I had fairly good reasons for criticising from certain aspects some years ago&mdash; but nothing that has been said by anyone criticising it has done one-tenth of the damage that the Minister has done by the procedure he adopted. If this were a limited liability company what value would there be in the shares to-day after the statements made by the Minister yesterday?  They would be worth very little, and the shareholders would have very little to thank the Minister for.  We are all shareholders in this and some of us more deeply interested than if money out of our own pockets had gone into it, because the credit of the nation is at stake, the credit of every citizen is at stake and, in particular, the credit of every member of the Dáil is wrapped up in it.  The Minister has done his damnedest to ruin it by the action he has taken.  There were ways in which the difficulties could be got over without damaging the scheme, I will not say irreparably, but damaging it in a way that it was not in the power of anyone else to damage it.  He has done his worst.  I have often heard Ministers talk of how high our credit stood and about the cheap loans we could get.  Well, if we have many more actions like the action of the Minister on this occasion the credit will not last very long.  The credit of the Shannon scheme has not stood very long, and I am told by a colleague of mine that in Pembroke quite recently an order was given by a certain section <Col N="1796" /> of the Board, valued for £10, but the trader refused to supply the Board unless cash was sent.  That is the result of the unwise action taken by the Minister, destroying the credit of the Shannon Board, and incidentally very materially damaging, financially and economically, the credit of the country and the political reputation of members of the House as a whole.</P>
      <P>One or two matters occurred to me when I heard the Minister speaking yesterday on which I would like to get information.  The Minister suggested, but did not go so far as to say, that the Shannon scheme had not proved a success.  I took it from the Minister's statement yesterday that economically it had not proved a success.  I am not speaking of the technical side of the scheme. I would like the Minister to be more precise in that respect, and when replying, to go into greater detail as to what his views are on the prospects of the Shannon scheme, properly managed.  If the prospects are or are not rosy the money will have to be provided, but it would be a reassurance if he could tell us that he believed the prospects are brighter than they have been since the dispute between himself and the Board commenced. I think the Minister also dealt with the cost of the current. Are we to take it from him that the cost of the current has not been fixed at a price that will be remunerative? Is it a fact that the current is being sold at too low a price?  If that is the case, whatever his views are, we would be glad to hear them.  I do not think he was very definite in that matter, but in his speech he suggested something of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other points I would like to refer to with regard to the responsibility of the Board as a whole, or of individual members of it, as well as the working of the several departments.  The Minister told us that one of his chief complaints against the Board was that they had failed to produce accounts.  The first Chairman of the Board was selected if not by the Minister, by the President, or by the two of them probably, <Col N="1797" /> as the selection would not be made by the President without the Minister's sanction, and from what I know of the President's opinion of Mr. Murphy, I am sure the initiative came from him.  For many years the President was very closely associated with the late Chairman of the Shannon Board.  I heard him, and other members in this House heard him, saying that Mr. Murphy was as great an expert on finance as was to be found in Ireland.  These are not the President's actual words, but he used words about Mr. Murphy of that character. I know that he thought him to be as capable, as energetic, as honest and as experienced an official as was to be found in the country.  I think there was nothing that could be said in praise of a man, certainly of a public servant, that was not said at some time or other by the President, in favour of Mr. Murphy.  When he came to find a Chairman for the Shannon Board he looked around, but he did not look very long because, having a very high opinion of Mr. Murphy, he picked him out and offered him the job.</P>
    <P>I am told that Mr. Murphy did not want to take the position as he was Town Clerk, occupying a very responsible, a very honourable and well-paid position.  He did not wish to take the position, but he was forced out of the position of Town Clerk by the President, and perhaps by the Minister, and put into the position of Chairman of the Shannon Board.  What happened in a short one and a-half years whereby a man who was a genius at finance, if we are to believe the President, who was probably the most capable public official in Ireland, could turn into being the most incompetent Chairman of the Shannon Board, to be kicked out at short notice?  What happened?  From my own long experience of the ex-Chairman of the Shannon Board when he was Assistant City Treasurer, City Treasurer and Town Clerk, I have a prejudice in favour of believing that he was not found incompetent.  It is suggested by the Minister that he was. If he was not incompetent, for what other reason was he fired out?  Another reason has been suggested to me, and <Col N="1798" /> probably there is something in it.  It is because he refused to deviate from the path of independence.  He read the Act, studied his position under it, studied the Minister's speeches, and believed the Minister when he said that he wished the Shannon Board to be an absolutely independent body, and he acted upon that.  Having acted on that, he displeased the Minister, and the Minister fired him out.  I believe that the latter is probably the explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House, he told the Shannon Board and the Chairman of it when he gave him the Act passed in this House, that it was to be the constitution of the Board, that it was to be an independent body, but from the first day that it started out to be independent, acting under the statute founding if, the Minister and the Finance Department did their best to impede them in every way, and when the crash came, of course, the Minister was supreme and the ex-Chairman of the Board had to go, not, I believe, because he was incompetent or because he could not provide accounts, but because he would not do exactly what the Minister and his colleagues wanted him to do.  I know that in some cases &mdash;this is only a small point, but it is indicative of the attitude taken up&mdash; he refused to appoint officials that these gentlemen wanted him to appoint. That was a grievance.  He refused to appoint certain officials that the President and others wanted him to appoint.  That was one of the reasons he was fired out.  So far as I know the man, there could not have been any political difference between the ex-Chairman and the Minister.  So far as I know, he was at all times as loyal and solid a backer of the Free State as there was to be found inside or outside this House.</P>
    <P>It was not for political reasons that he would not appoint those he was asked to appoint, but because he thought the people suggested to him by the President or by the Minister were not competent for their jobs. Possibly that is another reason why he was not allowed to retain his position. Beyond the statement of the Minister yesterday, I do not know why Dr. <Col N="1799" /> MacLaughlin was forced to resign.  The Minister's chief grievance against the Board seemed to be that they failed to provide accounts and that they failed to keep an agreement which, he says, was made between the Board and himself.  I do not know whether there was any division of labour amongst the members of the Board, or whether Dr. MacLaughlin, as Managing Director, was responsible for all departments.  It may be that he was responsible, and that he would be the person to provide the accounts.  But I would like if the Minister would tell us whether Dr. MacLaughlin was responsible, first of all, for breaking through the agreement which the Minister claims was broken, and, secondly, whether he was the person responsible for providing the Minister with accounts.  I imagine that the Board as a whole should share the responsibility in these matters&mdash; that the Chairman, the Managing Director, and all the members of the Board should fully share responsibility for the breaking of an agreement, if such an agreement was entered into, and for the failure to provide accounts. Why was the ex-Chairman, first of all, and later Dr. MacLaughlin, selected and not the others?  I was putting that question to some of my colleagues in the House within the last day or so, and the suggestion was made to me&mdash;I do not know whether there is anything in it or not&mdash;that it is because one member of the Board is a brother-in-law of a very high official in the Finance Department, and another is a brother-in-law of the Minister for Agriculture, they are kept on.  Whether there is anything in that or not I do not know, but it was, perhaps jocosely, mentioned to me by one of my colleagues yesterday when I asked the question.</P>

As we are discussing this question, let us take the case of one of these men who has got on the Board. I wonder why he was ever put there on his qualifications.  What qualifications has he for being a member of such a Board?  If the gentleman referred to were a highly-qualified, first-class electrical engineer, or even a second-class one, I could understand his appointment.  On his qualifications as shown to me, I fail to see why he was ever put on the Board.  I am not adopting the statement that he was put on merely because he was related&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then the Chairman is, at all events, on the Board with a string on him.  He can be pulled back any time he dissatisfies the Minister. He is only allowed there, with high promotion, as long as the Minister is satisfied that he will do his work. That is the position of the Board to-day. I do not want to say one word against the Chairman; I do not know him, but I am sure he is very efficient, a first-class civil servant.  I am sure he is an honest and honourable official, but what experience can he have had to fit him to run a Board of that kind as Chairman?  None in the world. What arrangements have been made to take the place of the technical officer, the Managing Director?  There is nobody there.  There has been nobody there, that I am aware of, since Dr. MacLaughlin was in it.  The Minister may perhaps tell us, in winding up, what arrangements he has made for a fully qualified technical <Col N="1802" /> officer to take the place of the one who has resigned as principal officer.</P>
      <P>I would certainly like to know why the Minister did not ask for the resignation of the Board as a whole instead of selecting these two important officers.  The Chairman is an important officer, and the Managing Director also, but they ought to share equal responsibility.  I take it that these two men were not a majority on the Board. They had others with them.  Probably some of the business men who still remain on the Board shared in the responsibility for passing any resolution or coming to any decision come to, and still they are allowed to remain on. In the case of the ex-Chairman, Murphy, when he was forced to resign by the Minister, he was put back on the Board and given a bigger salary than the other members of the Board who were put on as business representatives by the Minister.  That is the queer part of it.  He was kicked out of the chairmanship.  I do not know what salary he had, but he was put back by the Minister and given an increased salary although he was supposed to be incompetent.</P>
      <P>The very man who the Minister had insisted must go out as Chairman he puts back on the Board and gives him a greater remuneration than was given to Messrs.  Foley or Egan or to the third gentleman, who represented the business element.  That is something that needs explanation.  I believe that whatever else he may have failed in, from the point of view of a public servant with a knowledge of public accounts, furnishing them up to time, Murphy did not fail in these matters.  There was something else between himself and the Minister that obliged the Minister to get rid of him as being unworthy to be Chairman of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are a number of points here upon which we would be glad to have the Minister's answer.  If he can do anything in winding up this debate to undo the damage he has done already to the Electricity Supply Board and the Shannon scheme, to the credit attaching to it, to the credit of this Assembly as a business <Col N="1803" /> assembly, and the financial credit of the State as a whole&mdash;if he can help to undo that damage in winding up&mdash; the sooner he does it the better.</P>

      <P>I said when I was opening the debate that this was a Bill which I introduced with less pleasure and less satisfaction than any other I have had to bring before the House. I cannot say that I have listened to the whole of the debate with a great deal of pleasure, but I have got a considerable amount of satisfaction from the debate because I find on the whole that the attitude which the Dáil takes up, in so far as my relationship with the Board is concerned, is to do exactly what I wanted to do to the Board, to refuse facilities, not to vote money until information is granted, to get inquiries going and so forth.  That is the general tenor of the speeches that have been made, at least of all the serious speeches that have been made.  Most of the speeches have been serious.  I am omitting the little bit of slime in which I am going to let Deputy O'Kelly and his unnamed colleague paddle about to their hearts' content.  Leaving that aside most of the speeches have been serious, some less serious than others. I want first to deal with the minor points, and I only wish before I start on these that Deputy Briscoe would have found out where I had made the statement he twice referred to in regard to the accounts, and produce to me the letter in which he alleged I said to him that I was going to oppose discussion of them.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly has asserted and somebody else has asserted that they are reliably informed that trouble arose as between either myself or the Department of Finance and the Board in the first month that the Board was set up. The Board was set up in August 1927. Deputy O'Kelly was more detailed than the first speaker on this point. He said it was the Department of Finance that was involved&mdash;that the Department had first refused the <Col N="1807" /> money until they got a statement, according to the Deputy's allegation, of what the money was required for and that eventually it had to yield.  That is the sort of thing that I want to have stated in a precise way, because when it is so stated we can get the facts precisely.  An application was made early in September 1927, for the sum of £1,000 and the Department of Finance wrote back, as they were not merely entitled to do but were required to do, to enquire under what section or sub-section of the Act this money was required.  I should not say they wrote back.  It was a verbal intimation that was given, and it was pointed out that separate accounts had to be kept for moneys advanced under the two sub-sections of Section 12, and a form was suggested in which application should be made.  That form was sent in within a week, and the money was paid by the day on which it was said to be required, 26th September.  That is my statement on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There never was a request made by the Electricity Supply Board for money refused by the Department from that day until October last.  I take responsibility for the second refusal.  As it was then clear that the moneys that had been advanced outran the moneys the Board were entitled to have advanced to them under the agreement, we decided to hold up advances.  As far as the Department of Finance was concerned they had always up to October last paid all money that was demanded.  The case the Department of Finance put up in the first instance was that the Board did not state under what sub-section of Section 12 of the Act they were asking for the money.  The very moment the Board put that point right they got the money.  The Deputy says he knows the auditors have been in for some time.  I intend to speak at length on this matter of the auditors.  He says he knows that I have got a preliminary report from those auditors.  I have not.  Some months ago&mdash;in May, I think&mdash;I had a form of accounts sent to me with a <Col N="1808" /> warning statement in a covering letter that the accounts had to be regarded as clearly provisional.  A couple of days afterwards I got a second warning of the provisional nature of these accounts.  Whether a further letter intervened I do not know, but some days ago another letter did come in which the auditors described the accounts as in more final form and a very definite intimation was given at the same time that the material had now been brought into shape for audit and would be put forward to the auditors and that I might expect it in five or six weeks' time.  Deputy O'Kelly has reliable information that I have the accounts, and that I have a preliminary report in regard to them.</P>

      <P>That is the difficulty. The Deputy, with all his experience, does not know the difference between accounts prepared by a Board and accounts submitted to audit and presented after audit by the auditors &mdash;presented to the people who have to receive them.  The accounts have not been before the auditor, though I know of business for which members of the audit staff had been brought in. I was told I had a preliminary report from the auditors.</P>

      <P>We are all apparently proving one another right, which is very satisfactory, except that the accounts have not been audited and that I never said they have been.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly has referred to the resignation of the ex-Chairman, and he said that I made inaccurate statements about that and he nailed me in regard to it.  If the ex-Chairman of the Electricity Supply Board wants to have it that he was dismissed I will agree that he was.  If he wants to have it, as he did at one time want to have it, that he resigned, he can have it in that way.  If the Deputy wants to know the circumstances of that change I will tell him.  I met Mr. Murphy at a particular time in 1930 and in some detail I explained the situation to him, and indicated to him at the first meeting that I thought he had not shown the financial grip in relation to the affairs of the Board that we thought he would have shown.  I saw him a second time, and I told him that I thought it was incumbent on me to have somebody associated with that Board who would exercise proper financial control.  I indicated to him that that person would have to have as much authority as I could give him, irrespective of the title that he was to have.  I saw Mr. Murphy on the third occasion, and I did not get many words with him when he lifted his blotting-paper and produced me his letter of resignation and asked me was that what I wanted. I hope I showed as much tact as was necessary at that point, but I was glad to have that resignation.</P>

The reason was because in my eyes he had been an accessory before the fact of a certain mix-up in the Board, and I was anxious to retain him as <Col N="1810" /> a paid servant until such time as that mess was cleared up.  He made a certain appeal to me about his position and the emoluments he had lost, and explained the arrangements he had with the Dublin Commissioners, and I agreed to make certain payments to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly is afraid of the credit of the Shannon scheme suffering by reason of the statements made here. I spoke in a very restrained way yesterday.  I had to walk a very delicate line in the endeavour to indicate to the House that a serious situation had developed and at the same time avoid causing any great public uneasiness and disquiet.  I think the debate has gone to the point when I am precluded from keeping silent on some matters any longer, and I think public credit will not suffer much by the revelation of things going wrong if the people see that the going wrong has been stopped and the damage checked; but it might suffer considerably if one cloaked matters and allowed the damage to go on until it reached a point when it could not be recovered.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly has asked me two questions as to current being sold too cheaply.  I do not know what the answer to that is.  For three years I have been trying to get a statement from the E.S.B. as to whether, in their opinion, current was being sold to different types of users at such a rate as would remunerate all the money expended on the business.  I could get no proper answer from them.  I got estimates of expenditure and revenue by the dozen.  The disquieting feature of these estimates was that on each occasion on which an examination of the financial position was attempted by me, and the expenses side shown to be higher than the figure represented to me, immediately the revenue return that was made to me jumped almost precisely to the exact amount necessary to meet the increased expenditure.  I could have no confidence in the revenue estimate produced under these conditions. As to whether the Shannon <Col N="1811" /> prospects are bright, I can answer the limited question that the Deputy put to me.  He asked whether the prospects of the Shannon scheme, if properly managed, were brighter than a year ago.  I will answer considerably.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if I have got Deputy Anthony's point correctly.  I think his question was, has any portion of the money proposed to be set aside for undischarged liabilities been paid out as the purchase price for any of the municipal undertakings?  As purchase price, nothing has been paid to municipalities. Municipal undertakings were taken over on the basis of the Board shouldering the liabilities properly incurred in connection with all these things.  A certain amount of the liabilities so incurred has since been paid out of revenue.</P>

      <P>Nobody has made any point in that connection. The Deputy has been wrestling with himself on that particular point for a long period.  Deputy Moore, as I have said, is rather concerned about the accounts.  I am going to deal with them in some detail, and I will refer <Col N="1812" /> later to the point.  The Deputy asked me just the same question as Deputy O'Kelly asked me about the reappointment of the first Chairman of the Electricity Supply Board, and I have answered on that.  The Deputy finds it very hard to resist the inference that I had no confidence whatsoever in the Board, and that the Board had been forced upon me by influence.  I do not know what is contained in the suggestion, or what hidden hand is being hinted at here.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then Deputy Moore leaves Deputy O'Kelly in the lurch in regard to that.  What influence, apart from the actual merits, could there be introduced into appointments to positions which, from the very beginning, I regarded as very onerous and about which, at the beginning, I actually despaired of getting people properly to fill them?  If there was ever a case in which people were chosen completely and entirely on their merits, it was in this case.  I chose them after consideration and comparison of different people who came before me and whose names were suggested by me to the Executive Council.  In the end we came to the conclusion that the Board which was finally decided upon represented a good working team; that it represented most of the interests that we thought should be represented there; that it represented most of the points of view that we <Col N="1813" /> thought should be represented, and that it represented most of the particular types of judgment that we wanted to have brought to bear on the work of the Board, and that we felt should be properly associated with the Board.  The Deputy wanted to know whether &ldquo;these civil servants&rdquo; are under the influence of the Minister. There is one civil servant on the Board&mdash;</P>

      <P>As an expert. Deputy MacEntee vigorously wrestled with two problems.  I was never more reminded of the old comic turns of the artist on the music hall stage wrestling with himself as when Deputy MacEntee was speaking.  He certainly knocked himself flat on the two points he was attempting to make.  If anybody asked the Board to pay off immediately the undischarged liabilities of the transferred undertakings, it certainly was not myself.  There was no question of paying off those undischarged liabilities at once.  The Deputy talked as if I had refused the Board money which it demanded as of right.  I did not. The real position in regard to that is that the Board agreed it would not need the money.  The Board agreed further that it would make no demand for money beyond a certain amount until it could show to the Executive Council that that money was properly required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might refute the Scriptures and add cubits to his financial stature by taking thought if he had only listened to what I said at the opening. I made it precise and clear that we did not ask them to pay off undischarged liabilities.  We could not have asked them to do it.  The Act definitely states that the people who have to pay off liabilities in every case are the original borrowers.  We made that point quite clear to them, and Deputy Geoghegan need not have gone to so much trouble in the rather henpecking sort of statement he made to me in order to satisfy me on two points with regard to the Act, about which I was quite clear.  The Deputy did say that he assumed&mdash;why, I do not know, but possibly it was one of these rushes that the Deputy sometimes gets to his head&mdash;that the Board had budgeted on a two and a half million item.  I may say that he was absurdly wrong in this case.  In August, 1929, the Board said to me that they had decided that, until it was otherwise agreed by the Executive Council, their programme of operations was to be based on the assumption that the sum available under Section <Col N="1815" /> 12 (3) would be £2,500,000, less the amount of all outstanding liabilities on undertakings acquired or to be acquired by the Board.  If they budgeted on two and a half millions free from the undischarged liabilities after writing that letter to me, they were then either trying to deceive me and through me, the House, or else they were acting in a wholly irresponsible manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

His mind turned suddenly to law when he thought of cheap things. I may mention to the Deputy that there is a less expensive way and that is by coming to the House with a Bill. That was what I proposed to do in 1929.  Deputy de Valera mentioned that I put some compulsion upon the members of the Board to make a certain agreement.  The compulsion I used was this: I proposed to come to the Dáil in the full glare of publicity and I proposed to say here what I believed were the original intentions, and these were that the two and a half millions included the undischarged liabilities. I will add that the Board implored me not to come here, and they made the agreement so that I should not come here.</P>

Of course, all the wiseheads, if I may include Deputy Geoghegan in that term, think that they would then have thought that &mdash;that that Bill should have been brought before the House.  But I had the idea that the Board once it made a promise would keep it, that it would at any rate make some arrangements to see that it was more or less kept.

      <P>In front of Deputy Geoghegan?  I have humility, but not so much as that.  Deputy Fahy started off by saying we are not in a position to apportion blame, that we have not the facts.  I would like to associate myself with Deputy Thrift in that matter.  Nobody has been asked to apportion blame.  What is the blame? What is the situation as we have it at present?  There is, to my mind, a certain amount of chaos in the accounts of the Board.  There is a certain doubt with regard to some of the finances of the Board.  Certain people have resigned from the Board, and these resignations have been accepted, and I am asking the House, on what I confess to be very insufficient and inadequate information, to grant a sum of money&mdash;we will leave the question of the amount over for the present.  I do not see any question of apportioning blame.  Apportioning blame about what?  Certain people have resigned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering these circumstances, with the limitations I have spoken of, the part-timers fall for consideration.  If the part-timers knew everything that was going on, if they were fully aware of the details of the organisation, and if they passed certain things with full knowledge of the circumstances, then they would definitely have to be regarded as being as much to blame for what has happened, if blame is going to be assigned, as the Managing Director or the Chairman.  But with three members serving part-time on a Board like <Col N="1820" /> that, with the enormous amount of details that has to be attended to, attending at meetings once a fortnight or once a month, I cannot conceive that anybody, having in mind the consideration that their reputation is at stake, would say, without clear proof, that they are to be regarded as being as completely responsible as the other people for anything which has happened. They did not, at any rate, deem it their business to pass that judgment on themselves.  They did not send in their resignations.  I would not call for their resignations.  If they had been received, I might have accepted them in order to get the situation cleared up, but I certainly would have asked them to accept an offer of reappointment.</P>

This can be regarded as a figure to be discussed in Committee.  It may be cut down or it may be enlarged, according as Deputies desire, and my responsibility with regard to the money may be removed entirely, and I would prefer it so.  If Deputies so desire, we can discuss all this in Committee.  Deputy Fahy also took the point that Deputy MacEntee was on, that the Board are entitled to two and a half million pounds under the Act and that they should get something more.  The Board had to face up to the Act and their undertaking.  The Board knew what the undertaking was, and the Board, in fact, made no attempt to assert what people on the other side would describe as their legal rights. They were bound by their own undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall yield to the Deputy if he wishes to explain.  Deputy Fahy made a point about money being insufficient, and brought this out in connection with what was more or less a surmise that development had proceeded at such a rate.  I do not know what his conclusion was. It was partly tied on to a statement that the money was insufficient.  It was also tied on to a statement with regard <Col N="1822" /> to the accounts.  Does the Deputy seriously suggest that in any development the rate of development can ever be so great that people cannot keep accounts about it or should not be able to keep accounts about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They should.  That is the point I have always held.  I do not think people should be so definitely engaged on spending that they cannot keep accounts of what they have spent. That is apparently what happened. Deputy O'Connell spoke of friction occurring early.  No friction occurred early between myself and the Board. I asked for information and, on that, I said I got little satisfaction. I got no satisfaction on the particular questions I was asking. The questions I was asking were of this type: That I would be glad to learn the Board's opinion upon a particular matter&mdash;on this, whether the Board is of opinion, or is optimistic that distribution will be achieved within the limits of the money advanced for that purpose, and I asked to be supplied with the figures upon which that optimism was based.  In answer to that very natural and proper query, when I say I got no satisfaction I mean simply this that I was told that they were not able to make a statement, and they asked me to postpone the matter for some time, and they told me, further, that any information that they could give me at the particular time would be so unreliable as to be of no practical use to me.  We did get down to a very definite statement, but that was much later.  What the Deputy describes as friction amounted only to this, that in the early stages I thought fit to address that type of question, and that only, to the Board, and could get from them only that sort of reply, &ldquo;The information we have is of no great value to you; we cannot give you any information at present,&rdquo; and so on and so forth.  The dissatisfaction was the absence of information, but not friction on any point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the question of the Chairman resigning.  The Deputy has asked me that and I think I <Col N="1823" /> answered him in anticipation.  He questioned also the differences prior to 1929 and queried why did I not come to the Dáil.  I proposed to come to the Dáil with regard to these things but unfortunately allowed myself to be stayed in my progress because the Board gave me assurance that I thought was necessary in the interests of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Apart from these smaller matters there are two or three big things that have come out of this debate.  It is quite clear I think to everybody even without my saying a word that there must be something wrong when the accounts of that particular undertaking for the year ending 31st March, 1930, are not yet in our hands.  There must be something wrong&mdash;let us put it no higher than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are still wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are still wrong.  It is dissatisfying not to have not merely the accounts, because I think they are a small part of the whole business, but the sort of financial statement which we are entitled to have and which I tried to get under the section of the Act which gives me power to demand it.  I say that I have not got a satisfactory statement of that and cannot produce it consequently to the House.  Again I say that merely to state that is to argue that there is something wrong.  I stated last night that in groping around, in certain ways, in putting all these financial enquiries to the Board I discovered, in fact I had it from themselves, that their policy was to look for revenue as quickly as possible.  Deputy de Valera apparently took that as a sound point of view last night, when he asked was it my desire or not that the maximum number of consumers should be attached to the Shannon wires.  It is not my desire.  If that is the desire we can achieve it at once.  Let us give current away and we can get the whole State connected up.  It is my desire to get profitable consumers in the greatest possible number attached to the Shannon current as speedily as possible, but certainly not the greatest number irrespective of what they are <Col N="1824" /> going to pay.  The people who had the policy of simply going ahead to get in revenue irrespective of what the revenue had to cover were making a complete mistake and to my mind were guilty, if that were their policy, of complete financial recklessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Their attitude was we will get revenue any way we can. Having that attitude I do not know how they fixed their scales of charges. Deputy de Valera conceives a managing director of a scheme like this who need have no touch with accounts&mdash;who is not responsible for accounts.</P>

But as members of the Board as a whole they should be acquainted certainly.</P>

      <P>There are at any rate three things that emerge.  Deputy de Valera lifted them to the rank of the three important points to be discussed here: the question of the agreement which, according to the Deputy, the Minister said was made and which the Minister said was broken; the question of the accounts and the whole question of financial policy.  I will give the gist of the agreement. I got a letter, as I said, from the Board in March this year, and it contained certain statements. It contained an expression of regret from the Board for breaking the agreement with the Executive Council.  It went on to state the reasons for that.  It indicated that information was not available owing to imperfections in <Col N="1825" /> the Board's organisation to enable the Board to ascertain with even approximate accuracy what the real position was.  The recording system had fallen into arrears to such a degree that figures could not be produced. That is March, 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter stating that, more or less.  It went on to indicate this, that from information now available it is clear that the agreement of August, 1929, was broken in December of that year, but up to June, 1930, the Board was not in a position to know what capital expenditure it had incurred.  The records were in arrears and the figures were incomplete and unreliable.  It is clear that they believed there was an agreement. It is also clear they believed they had broken their agreement. Further, it is clear that the records and their whole organisation of accountancy were completely broken up.</P>

      <P>The explanation of the Deputy scarcely clears up what he <Col N="1826" /> did not very clearly say.  His statement was that if they were entitled to the money they were bound to ask for it.  They were not bound, and they did not ask as being entitled. The Board themselves knew their position.  In two or three letters they admitted that they broke the agreement, but said it was not deliberately done.  They went out of their way to make that point.  They did not take up the attitude of Deputy Geoghegan, that they broke the agreement elevating the statute to a superior position over the agreement.</P>

      <P>It is an overdose of mild bitters that the Deputy has served out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had certain correspondence with the Board on this question.  Right through I aimed really at one <Col N="1827" /> point.  I was trying to get from them an assurance that the voted moneys would be sufficient for the purposes of distribution, and that they would be enabled by whatever distribution networks they set up to get such sales at the experts' rates as would secure revenue to make the partial development financially successful. I stuck to that question&mdash;I may have varied the terminology of it &mdash;from October, 1928 until early in this year.  That was the one assurance that I wanted and on that was the special bit of interference that I had with the Board.  I was not at first disposed to look critically into various things that they put up.  I wanted to have it on record that they had faced up to a particular question, and that they had backed their reputation on the answer.  The answer was to be such as to assure me that they would be able to carry out their duties under the Act within the moneys voted, subject to the agreement afterwards, and that they would be enabled to get such sales as would remunerate the capital expenditure on the whole concern.  That was the whole object of my endeavours over two and a half years, to get an assurance with regard to these points.</P>
    <P>I asked about these matters and about the accounts.  I got a letter in December which they said was sent to satisfy me that the Electricity Supply Act moneys would be sufficient for the purposes of the Board under the Act, but they warned me that the capital requirements which they put into the letter were an indication of the limits of the Board's possible capital requirements under any conditions.  Of course when I related that letter to the circumstances of to-day I see that it was not a satisfactory statement or estimate of their capital requirements under present conditions.  They said that to me in December, 1928, and at that point they revealed this item with regard to the undischarged liabilities.  I took that up resolutely with them because I had the feeling that the Oireachtas definitely meant that the two and a half million pounds was to be the <Col N="1828" /> limit of the Board's capital liabilities, however accruing to them.  I said to the Board at one time&mdash;I wrote them a letter on the point&mdash;&ldquo;If it is not clear that the moneys in Section 12 include the undischarged liabilities, I intend to use the amending Act to make it clear.&rdquo;  I am asked by Deputy de Valera who was to arbitrate on this difference between the Board and myself, and he wants to know what compulsion I used to secure the agreement.  The arbitration that Deputy de Valera asked about, and the compulsion that I put upon the Board, was the arbitration and the compulsion of this House.  I said to them: &ldquo;I intend to make this clear and I will go to the House and make my position clear on that.  If the House votes that money to me with this limitation, then you are so bound.&rdquo;  Their answer to me was not that they could not carry on under the straitened circumstances, or that they had budgeted in 1928, or early in 1929, for a programme many years ahead to such a point that the money was clearly insufficient, but they said: &ldquo;No, we will base our expenditure on the assumption that the two and a half million pounds are to include the outstanding liabilities.&rdquo;  That was the definite promise made.</P>
    <P>After that I queried how the arrangement was being carried out. Early in April I got a statement from them to show that the Board had kept the agreement.  I then queried a very definite point.  I said that they had put up to me a particular programme in 1928, and that I had pointed out certain things in regard to it.  I had said to them: &ldquo;If you carry out that programme and add on the undischarged liabilities you would clearly be going outside the money voted.&rdquo;  I asked them in April what modification of the earlier programme had they made, arising out of the agreement.  Late in April, 1930, they sent me a letter to show how the programme had been modified by a sum of £363,000, and so to prove that they had kept the agreement. There was never a word about the <Col N="1829" /> agreement being obnoxious to them, or that they were trying to elevate the statute above the agreement. Their whole point was that they had kept the agreement.  I got letters from them somewhat later in which they said they could not complete what they called a reasonable programme within the limitations imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the 1930 Act.  Deputy Lemass made quotations from that debate and, after he had done so, handed over his quotations to Deputy MacEntee.  I asked Deputy MacEntee was there not something in between what he read, whether it was in his favour or not, but I did not get it.  The paper I presume was not an exact copy.</P>

      <P>I started by saying &ldquo;that I would speak on the section in the light of the amendment that had been ruled out of order.&rdquo;  I went on: &ldquo;The amendment would mean that the sum of two and a half million pounds originally voted for the Board would be increased by half a million pounds.  There is no necessity for that. The Board is not straitened owing to the outgoings to date.&rdquo;  Then comes the point that the Deputy left out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I went on to say: &ldquo;The Board certainly ought to show that the money that is handed over to it is going to be remunerative, and it <Col N="1830" /> has to make a case why it should get more money.  To introduce this casually, simply because the Cork station has been bought out is not justified.  The purchase of the Cork station was always before those who drew up the 1927 Act, and the purchase price was always considered to be included in the two and a half million pounds.  The whole thing was looked to.  I do not say that the exact price was definitely arrived at, but a sum for the purchase of the Cork and other undertakings, and for the purchase by agreement of certain small undertakings, was always in our minds when we were arranging for this two and a half million pounds, and there is no reason to believe that that two and a half million pounds will not be sufficient.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I got a reply on the 7th April in which it was stated: &ldquo;This is to show that the Electricity Supply Board has kept the agreement.&rdquo;  There was a further letter on the 25th April to show that they had modified their programme by £363,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The day after that debate they asked to be released from the agreement.  I believe that appeal was founded on the amendment that was discussed here.  They saw that people here were ready to give them money without any case being made for it, and they asked for release. A request had been made on their behalf for a sum of £500,000.  On the 13th June the Board said that they could not complete a reasonable programme without breaking the agreement. They asked that they should be released from it and said that wastage might occur through a breach or stoppage at this stage.  I asked what they called a reasonable development.  To my mind the test of that was, was it going to remunerate the money spent at some time?  I did not care particularly when.  I have been waiting to get their statement of what reasonable development they had before them at that time, and I am waiting for it still.  Under those conditions it is alleged that I misled the Seanad.  I did not.  Remember again the terms of the agreement: &ldquo;Unless it is otherwise agreed by the Executive Council.&rdquo;  I might easily have asked the Executive Council to agree.  If I had done that I would have come to the House and said: &ldquo;I believe that the Oireachtas intended that sum of money to cover a variety of things.  It seems now as if a good programme is ahead which will entail bigger expenditure.&rdquo;  I would have asked the House to vote the money.  I have waited, and have not yet got a full statement, or adequate evidence upon which I could come to the House and ask for any money. That is the position I am in at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not good reason to believe that.  I had the Board's statement that what they considered a reasonable programme could not be completed without breaking the agreement.  The position that I was in then is the position that I am in now.  It meant, as far as I was concerned, that new money had to be voted.  I held the view that the two and a half millions included the undischarged liabilities.  If I had to come to the House to ask for money for a reasonable programme then I should have evidence to demonstrate the reasonableness of it.  I got no indication from them as to what their reasonable programme was, or what programme there was that could not be carried out inside the sum of money which they had agreed in 1929 to base their requirements upon.  I might have said in the Seanad that the Board, arising out of an amendment moved in the Dáil, had asked for more money.  I would have said that they had reason to think that they were going to get that money from the Dáil, arising out of the casual amendment which Deputy Fahy had put down to give them £500,000, nobody else having asked for it.  That certainly indicated a big laxity in regard to financial procedure.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment.  The Deputy might have said that an accidental result, if the amendment had been discussed, would be a disclosure of certain things by the Minister.  The Deputy is full of parts of speech as well as full of English and should know the meaning of the word &ldquo;purpose.&rdquo;  There was no purpose in Deputy Fahy's amendment except casually and lightly to grant £500,000 to the Board, which the Board had not asked for at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts is the last matter. After that agreement I associated with the Board in a part-time capacity two people.  These two people retired from the Board when their period came to an end in February, 1930.  At that time I reorganised the Board with a view to getting some better arrangement of the whole scheme.  The finances of the Board had at that time become disquieting. I will go no further than to say that.  Accordingly Mr. Brown and Mr. Fay were appointed.  Deputy de Valera and other Deputies have made a great point that we do not appear to be in a much better position since these two were appointed.  But it is to be remembered that it is easy enough to cause a bit of a mess but it is a desperately difficult thing to clear it up.  I indicated to these two people when going on the Board, that there was a very definite possibility that they would find things, as far as accounts and records were concerned, in a state, more or less, of chaos.  I indicated that if that was so that they were undertaking a very difficult and very responsible task, because people would not stop, unless things were pointed out very accurately to them, to consider the point at which they <Col N="1834" /> went in, and the state of things they discovered when they got in.  I pointed out to them there was a likelihood that they would be tarred with any pitch that was going, if an unsatisfactory situation was discovered there.  These two went on the Board in February of that year on my assurance that I would later on make their position clear.</P>
    <P>In July of that year I received an intimation from the Chairman that a particular action had been taken. He gave it to me as a matter of information and I felt relieved when I heard what he had done.  He wrote to me afterwards putting the same thing before me in writing.  He told me that in June, 1930, he had suggested, and the Board had approved of the suggestion, that the auditors&mdash;the auditors in question are the auditors whom I had appointed to investigate the first accounts&mdash;should supply staff to help in bringing the records up-to-date and the auditors' staff was got in.  I can give no better description of the present situation than to say that since July, 1930, five representatives of that outside auditors' firm, and since September, seven have been continuously engaged in making up all the records that were in arrear and that should have been kept in order by the Board.  Those auditors are still engaged in doing what the Board should have been doing&mdash;keeping their ordinary business records and if anybody can tell me that I am to criticise in any way the two new members for not being able to do what an outside firm of experienced auditors with five of a staff from July and seven of a staff from September have not yet been able to do, I think they are asking me to judge them very harshly. That is the situation with regard to the accounts.  Bear in mind these accounts run from the 1st April, 1929, to the 31st March, 1930, and that outside firm of accountants with five of a staff from July and seven from September to date are, you may say, continuously engaged in trying to remake the records which should have been there from the beginning and were not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> What is the point of view with regard to these accounts?  The accounts are not to be had.  The accounts will be had some time.  I am asking the House at this point for money to carry on the activities of a particular organisation, and I am going to pass on to all the members of the Board, and would probably pass it to two people who are not now on it if they were there, all that has been said in this debate, because no better criticism could be spoken of their activities than all the phrases that have been used in the course of this debate.  I am being criticised because I have not certain information.  The House adopts towards me the very line that I adopted towards the Board, and a proper line of conduct.  They are criticising me for what I criticised the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am making explanations; the Board made none.  I have not the material to make a proper statement: the Board should have had the material for me.  We will get that when this outside firm have completed their task.  I do not care what allegations with regard to destroying credit may be made against me afterwards.  It is better to have it known, now that the situation is in hand, that the accounts of the whole recording organisation from different departments were, according to the letters that were sent to me by the Chairman of the Board, in a complete state of disorganisation, and that people have been got in from outside to try and remake them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that, I want to be clear that I am not passing one word of criticism, as Deputy Flinn seemed to imply last night, on the staff.  I know nothing much about the activities of the staff. I know of certain people being in certain positions, but as far as the situation that has developed is concerned, the people who were responsible for it were people at the top and mainly the full-time members of that time. From what I know of the staff they are very good, energetic and capable <Col N="1836" /> people, but there was no direction at the top, and the situation has been allowed to develop to this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked last night what were we to think of a business concern which could not produce at this point the accounts of sixteen months ago.  He said that no business concern could succeed on those lines. Yet for what am I being criticised? For refusing to increase the overdraft that a business concern had with me, when it is in the position that Deputy Murphy described of not being able to produce the accounts of sixteen months ago.  Deputy de Valera alleges that I am destroying the credit of the Board.  If a trader who has an overdraft with a bank finds himself in difficulties and applies to the manager of the bank for an increase in his overdraft, and if the bank manager says: &ldquo;Give me your accounts; let me look at them and I will consider the question of the overdraft,&rdquo; and if the trader will not or cannot produce the accounts, and the bank manager refuses an extension of his overdraft, who is responsible for the destruction of his credit?  Is it the bank?</P>

      <P>Three positions have been taken up on this measure. Deputy de Valera will vote the money once he knows what it is for.  He <Col N="1837" /> demands a statement of the sub-heads under which the allocation of this money will be made.  Deputy Good goes a bit further and says: &ldquo;Let us get in an outside firm of auditors.&rdquo; They have already been called in and have been working for over a year. He does not ask the same thing as Deputy de Valera.  He does not say &ldquo;Let us find out what this money is required for.&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;Ask that expert firm to make out a statement as to the Board's commitments, to give us some idea of the revenue and expenditure position.&rdquo;  I think that should be got, but if you are going to wait until that is got, remember that the 1929-30 accounts are about ready for audit now, and will not be available for six or seven weeks. They will not come into this House until October.  These are the accounts for the year ending 31st March, 1930. The auditors are working to try to re-make all the records that the Board should have kept.  What are we going to ask these auditors to do?  They have got to get the 1930-31 accounts, to get a general picture of the whole position of the Board, its commitments, its estimated revenue, and its expenditure.  We will wait a long time before we get it, but we must get it sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell thinks that we should know more than even this.  I think he agreed with Deputy Good with regard to the outside firm of auditors, but added that we should get the firm to make suggestions as to how anything that is wrong could be rectified. I do not know that auditors are the proper people to do that.  The auditors can get the accounts, they can get a statement of the commitments, of the various types of revenue and of the expenditure position, and they may give certain suggestions of a limited type but there may be other suggestions that would have to be made in relation to the sum of money that is now being asked for.  The House may say that they will vote a sum of money simply to meet the ascertained liabilities of the Board, that they will vote a certain limited sum that will keep the Board going for a couple of months.  They can vote a <Col N="1838" /> sum which the Board says is required for immediate extensions.  They can say that they will confine the money to paying for work done but they have to make up their minds on this: Are they going to wait for that statement, for a report such as Deputy Good wants and the much more detailed report that Deputy O'Connell suggests? The House can vote whatever money it believes is required, and I honestly hope when the House is voting the money that it will take me clean out of the new Bill, that it will have its mind clear when it is voting that money to a particular organisation, that it is going to keep the Board independent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>These are things the House will have to approach on Committee Stage.  At the moment the main thing the House has before it is that certain moneys should be granted for the purposes of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not bring myself into that Bill with any satisfaction. If the Deputy likes I will agree to put down an amendment to take myself out of the Bill.  But the House should know what it is doing. It is going to give money to a Board for certain purposes.  Is it going to have no check or control upon it?  It is inevitable that it is going to have very little statement of a detailed type as to what that money is required for&mdash; nothing is now possible in the nature of the investigation in regard to the money previously voted.  Nobody can certify that the money is properly due. I could not certify it.  If I am to do anything hereafter, I am to certify that the money is properly and reasonably required before it is authorised.  I could not take that burden on myself at the moment.  I could not recommend that £2,000,000.  I do not believe that I could recommend £1,500,000 was <Col N="1839" /> properly due to them at the moment, but there are certain sums of money that one can say they are likely to need, and that there is a great likelihood that they will need within a certain limited period, but the House will have to take either of two points of view.  It can say that it will take full responsibility for so much money; that the Board can make its demand and the Minister for Finance must pay on demand.  Or the House can say &ldquo;No, we want some check in between, and we will have the check in the persons of the Ministers, whom we will hold responsible when the moneys are disbursed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera last night referred to the Shannon scheme.  He used it twice for his own purposes.  First, he said that a certain sum of money was voted, and that that sum was from time to time increased.  That is quite wrong.  It was once increased.  The way it progressed, he believed, was on certain rough calculations that were made. A little later he asked, why do not we act in this case as we acted previously when large sums of money were involved and get the assistance of outside experts?  But apparently the experts never produced anything except rough calculations.  I do not know what we want experts for if that is the case.  We want something more than rough calculations if money is to be voted free of any ministerial check.</P>
      <P>I said before that this was an unsatisfactory situation.  It is not a situation that I would like to have seen happen or develop.  It is one I did my best to prevent.  I have never put more effort into anything than in trying to get the whole Shannon business, in so far as it had any relation to me, on an even keel.  If I have to confess there is a certain failure at this moment I do so in this atmosphere&mdash;that I am trying my best to renew the conditions under which success will be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch) Fionán Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to give me powers to deal with the arrears outstanding on certain fishery loans made by the late Congested Districts Board, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fisheries.  These outstanding obligations have long been weighing on the fishing industry and have resulted in a certain amount of <Col N="1842" /> despondency where, for the development of the industry, we are all desirous of seeing a revival of enterprise and confidence.  It is always a grave matter to propose that debts due to the public should be remitted or substantially reduced.  It would be greatly damaging to the credit of the country if a belief should grow in the public mind that obligations due to the State are not as equally binding as obligations between individuals.  In regarding this matter we should be guided by similar considerations and standards as if these debts were debts due from one individual to another.  I think that in such circumstances the first question which the creditor would ask himself is this: What ought I to do as a pure matter of business?  The second question which he would probably ask himself is: Are there any other circumstances which I ought to take into account bearing in mind that I may desire to do business with my debtor again in the future?  These are not, perhaps, the highest grounds on which one could examine a question of this sort but they generally lead us to pretty sound conclusions.</P>
      <P>There are 449 cases of loans, some for boats, some for engines, and some for nets, which originally stood at a figure of £104,101 9s. 0d., and on which a total sum of £67,850 10s. 5d. remained due and outstanding on 1st June last. In these cases the borrowers are dead, have left the country, or have long since ceased to be fishermen, the boats for which the loans were made no longer exist, the engines also are gone or worn out, and the nets are worn out.  The borrowers, where they are still within reach, are not persons against whom one could either with profit or justice take proceedings to recover any part of the sums due. There is no asset which one could recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, the sureties for some of these loans.  They entered into bonds under which they could be proceeded against for the sums due.  Those bonds are quite good and enforceable. The sureties are not, in the majority of such cases, persons of much substance, but I might succeed in recovering something from them.  Would it be a proper <Col N="1843" /> course to enforce these bonds to the extent to which they are enforceable? I have come to the conclusion after careful thought that it would not.  I do not seek to ignore the liabilities which these sureties undertook.  They sponsored the integrity and industry of the borrowers, and they indemnified the State against any failure by the borrowers to meet their obligations.  I think, however, that we must look to what happened subsequently.  Most of these loans were made between 1917 and 1919 when prices of boats and gear were at their highest point.  Their earning power was equally high.  Then following 1919, when British trawlers were brought again into commission, the earning power of these boats fell away to comparatively negligible proportions. Later transport in this country was seriously interfered with, and conditions which were already bad were rendered worse.  Furthermore, the herring has for some unknown reason forsaken parts of our coast, and both the markets for herring and mackerel have been depressed for reasons beyond our control.  These are the causes which most largely contributed to create the position which we are now facing, and the question which I had to ask myself was whether it would be proper to place upon the shoulders of these sureties the burden resulting from these causes.  The conclusion I came to was that it would not be just nor in the public interest to do so.  I therefore propose to write off the whole of that £67,850 10s. 5d.</P>
    <P>There are 23 cases of loans which originally stood at £19,448 19s. 9d., of which £15,799 14s. 8d. was outstanding and due at 1st June last.  In these cases there are 21 boats which are either laid up and not in use or which, if put to some use, are not in the hands of men who, in my opinion, are ever likely to make proper use of them.  I propose to remit the whole outstanding amounts in these cases on condition that the boats and gear are handed over to me, when I shall transfer them to the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They are mixed up&mdash;from 1914 onward.  Some of them come down to 1922 or 1923.  All the cases I am dealing with come from even prewar days down to comparatively recent times.  The total where the borrowers borrowed from the Department of Fisheries is only £7,846.  The other sum is for cases prior to that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be some.  This leaves 280 cases of loans originally standing at £41,033 19s. 8d., on which £29,370 13s. 5d. was due and outstanding on 1st June last.  I propose on certain conditions to write down this sum by £17,900 13s. 9d., thus reducing the sum due to £11,469 19s. 8d. These are cases in which the borrowers are still engaged in the industry.  The main principle by which I have been guided in these reductions is that the borrower should not be compelled to pay more than he can reasonably be expected to pay from his earnings with the boat, and it has seemed to me to be a fair criterion of this sum to fix it at the present value of the boat. That means that the fisherman will not be liable to pay more than the sum which he would have to pay if he were to-day to buy the boat which he is using at the price which it would fetch in the market as between a willing buyer and a willing seller in its present condition.  I have had the boats inspected and valued on this basis.  That has been the general principle on which I act, but there are certain exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that there had been an earlier proposal to remit the loans made between 1917 and 1923 under which there would have been certain fixed proportions of the original debt written off, based on the estimated excess of the cost of the boat or gear over what might be considered the normal cost.  Certain persons would have benefited more under that scheme than under the arrangements to which I have referred. We are giving to those persons the full benefit of what they would have got under the other proposal. In addition, there are a <Col N="1845" /> number of loans included in those that I have referred to for quite small boats, costing at the outside less than £20, in regard to which it was considered inadvisable to apply the criterion of the present value because of the expense of going around to value them.  These were not at any time so burdensome as the large ones. There were never such inflated prices paid for these, nor were they so seriously affected by the decline in fishing.</P>
    <P>As to the poorer classes of fishermen, I propose to lighten their burdens, having regard to the depressed seasons they have experienced. So far I have been dealing with the cases of fishermen who made an honest attempt to meet the liabilities. There are, I regret to say, a few cases in which men obtained loans for expensive boats either before the European war or in the earlier years of the war, and made very substantial earnings with the boats.  They have notoriously not acted in the way one would expect in the matter of the repayment of their debts.  I am glad to say that there are very few of such cases now.  I think it would be wrong to treat them in such a way as we propose to treat those fishermen who, through no fault of their own, were unable to meet their liabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will probably be able to tell you when replying.  I would not be able to say off-hand now.  One of these cases is for a very considerable sum.  We know that a very large sum was earned by the boats during the war and was invested in property and we are excluding that case entirely from the scope of the Bill.  In other cases where the default was not quite so flagrant I propose to reduce the obligation to a sum not exceeding the present value of the boat and to make it a condition of the reduction that they pay the difference between the present value of the boat and the sum to which we are writing it down immediately.</P>

    <Col N="1846" />
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all except one. In every case in which the reduction is given I propose to make it a condition that the borrower shall become a member of the Sea Fisheries Association and that the boat shall be treated as if taken from the Association under their hire purchase system, and therefore to be paid for out of the catch.  But the borrower will have to sign a contract with the Association and he will be bound by that contract. In this way there will be a better guarantee for the payment of the reduced obligations of the fishermen to the Association.  I trust we will never again be faced with a position such as we are dealing with now.</P>
      <P>This will also be a great relief to the sureties.  I have said that the sureties will not be released from their obligations in respect of the reduced amounts due, but under the arrangement I propose, and assuming that each of the parties in the transaction acts in an honest and straightforward manner, the liability of the sureties should prove to be largely nominal.</P>
      <P>It had been my intention to attach to the Bill a schedule giving particulars of the remissions proposed to be made, but there are some 752 cases involved and I was advised that it would be inappropriate to attach so lengthy a schedule to a Bill of this kind.  I propose, however, to lay on the Table of the House at a later date a statement of the reductions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure which I have mentioned will indicate that the matter is being dealt with in no niggardly fashion.  I am satisfied, however, that it will be in the interests of the industry and in the public interest that the measures taken should not fall short of what is necessary to enable every bona fide fisherman to make a fresh start with no greater burden than he can reasonably be expected to bear.  What I have said covers, I think, every section of the Bill except Section 4.  The object of this section is to give powers to write off any loans outside the particular loans now being dealt with, when it is clear they are irrecoverable.  There has been some doubt whether the Minister for <Col N="1847" /> Finance had power to do this until every legal process for the recovery of the sum due had been exhausted.  This section will in future enable the Department to refrain from setting the law in motion against the fisherman who may be unfortunate in his calling, or otherwise in poor circumstances and unable to meet his liability.  This will save expenses in prosecution and avoid the infliction of unnecessary hardship where the money is irrecoverable.</P>

I do not intend to lay a statement of the particulars of these cases on the Table of the House until the Bill is passed.</P>

I do not think he would ever have taken action if the Sea Fisheries Association had not come up against this problem in their work.  That he has taken action is gratifying.</P>
      <P>The different cases, as he has explained to the House, have been examined over a fairly long period of time by the Department, and we must take it the Minister has gone into the merits of each case, and that the Department of Finance has kept a close eye on the writing down, and have satisfied themselves that no amount will be written off as irrecoverable unless they are quite satisfied that the circumstances of the case do not afford any prospects of recovery.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill, under which the consent of the Minister for Finance is necessary for writing down amounts, and under which certain conditions will be issued by the Minister, seems to have been fairly well explained by the Minister for Fisheries.  There are twenty-three cases in which he expects to recover boats and gear for the Sea Fisheries Association.  I take it these twenty-three individuals are not considered as suitable persons to receive loans in future.  I take it that the Sea Fisheries Association does not intend to keep them on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are twenty-three such cases, and there are twenty-one boats involved.  Most of the boats are not in use.  A few of the boats are in the hands of persons who are not desirable, persons who would never make proper use of them, and I do not believe that they would get loans from the Association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it suggested that, as well as recovering the boats and gear from these twenty-three persons, they would still have to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are wiping out the whole amount in their cases on condition that they hand the boats and gear to me, and I will then hand that property to the Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to 449 cases.  I take it these are all pre-Treaty cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be a few fairly new cases.  About 8 per cent. of the total amount written down has relation to boats borrowed from the Department, and that runs through all the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the sureties, the Minister does not seem to be quite clear whether he will be able to recover from them.  Perhaps he will be able to give the House some further information.  Naturally, we would be quite glad if the Minister could recover all the money, but it seems to me that the sureties are placed in a very invidious position because of the circumstances to which the Minister has pointed.  The depression in the fishing industry and other matters have probably affected the sureties just as much as the fishermen. I wonder what is the exact legal position?  Is the Minister really able to recover, or has he recovered in any such case?  Has he been able to bring the law to bear on these sureties?  It is just as well that we would leave as little as possible hanging over, particularly as the Minister has pointed out that great legal expense and administrative expense would be incurred in trying to recover money, even if the Department believe there is a good prospect of recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the arrangement is a good one in regard to the cases where fishermen are now operating the boats and where the Department propose to leave them these boats and charge them only the present market value. In other words, the Department will depreciate them and will give the fishermen the full benefit of whatever fall in value may have occurred.  I am not quite clear as to the number of cases connected with small boats, or the amount involved.  I take it that that is really a minor matter. With regard to the twelve individuals, the Minister apparently considers one case a very special case and I will not now attempt to deal with it.  The other eleven cases are cases in which he will give an additional reduction, <Col N="1850" /> provided immediate payment of the amount due is made.</P>
    <P>That is a very good principle.  If the principle of maximum reduction in consideration of immediate payment were extended as far as possible, it would be a very good thing.  It is much better to strike a bargain in these cases and try to get rid of the thing than to make any arrangement for paying by instalments.  In the long run, what we would seem to gain by adopting the instalment system we would lose in administrative expenses. Very often we find the individuals who undertake responsibility and sign contracts to pay off by instalments are really not able to pay when the time comes.  I am in favour of getting them to pay up as soon as possible and give them the maximum allowance that the Departments consider they ought to get.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister considers that these cases are not suitable for full discussion here, I suggest he should allow Deputies to meet officials of the Department to discuss those cases. We would all like to be quite clear on these cases and to have this matter closed definitely.  I think the Minister can envisage that Deputies will have cases brought under their notice even after he has taken action.  It will be much better in the long run to have the fullest possible information given by officials to Deputies from the areas affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I am glad that the Minister has faced this problem at last.  There is in the Bill a certain disquieting feature and that is that a Government Department is about to be given the power of remission and reservation of debts.  I think that is a very dangerous precedent and a rather bad principle.  I must confess I do not see any solution except that we make a clean sweep of the lot and decide that we will not grant this power.  Anxious as I am to recover any State moneys that are recoverable, and disliking as I do that anybody who ought to pay should get a chance of evading his responsibility, I think it is unwise to grant such power of reservation or remission <Col N="1851" /> of debts to any Government Department. I would be better pleased if there was a clean sweep made of the whole lot&mdash;if the whole thing were written off as irrecoverable.  To deal with it satisfactorily otherwise would seem to demand some sort of commission or tribunal before which the case from the public point of view could be made and also the case for remission on the part of those who might claim remission.  It is obvious that that would be a cumbersome procedure and it might involve considerable expense.  That is my feeling on looking at this Bill.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much whether, from a public point of view, it would not be much better if we wrote off the whole thing as irrecoverable; that is, excepting cases where we would be in a position to recover the whole amount. Even in that instance the cases should be specifically mentioned.  In my opinion, we should otherwise be doing something fundamentally bad and unsound, because we would be giving powers of remission and reservation of debts to a Government Department. That is a dangerous step, and if there is any way of avoiding it, it should be avoided.  If it is felt this money ought to be recovered for the State, some machinery of a semi-judicial character should be set up.  I confess I do not exactly see how it could be done.  I feel it would be cumbersome, but if some machinery of that kind could be devised I, for one, would prefer it.  The Minister mentioned a sum of £11,000 as being involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>The Minister realises that the moment he begins to operate this measure all sorts of accusations of favouritism will be levelled against the Department.  The Department will have to stand up against acccusations of that kind.  No matter how impartial the Department or the Minister may be, it will be difficult to prevent people feeling that they are being singled out while other people are let off.  That is a situation I would <Col N="1852" /> not like to see develop.  Although I do welcome the Bill from the point of view of writing off this irrecoverable money, I do look with a certain amount of anxiety on the introduction of a procedure of this particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I have been for more than four years in this House advocating the principle of the Bill and during that time, whenever the opportunity arose, I advocated the principle which Deputy de Valera has just preached of making the clean-cut and not the partial cut.  I look back to June, 1927, when this matter was first before the House in my presence&mdash;it may have been discussed previously and I assume it was&mdash;and I ask myself the question, what money has been lost to the State by not doing in June, 1927, what the Minister is now doing?  I feel inclined to say: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; Instead of that, I would rather take a more optimistic view and express to the Minister the gratitude of the fishermen all along my constituency, and I think I can speak for even a larger area.  We have something like 110 miles of seaboard from end to end, and a voice of gratitude and thanks will go forth to the Minister for this Bill, even though it has come a little too late.  I am afraid as regards the salvage of the boats that have been lying rotting on the beach for the last four years because the fishermen had not the means and the opportunity of taking them out to sea, that the Minister cannot look on the salvage as being a very valuable asset.  Such as it is, however, he is quite right in doing what he can to secure the salvage for the State and allow those people to start with a clean slate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig raised the question as to the section referring to sureties and perhaps he will allow me to put his mind at rest about it.  That section is essential in any transaction from a legal standpoint and the Minister may take it from me that it is entirely unobjectionable. The section is necessary and is to prevent a case being made by sureties that they were discharged by reason of an operation between their principal and the State to which they were not a party.  That I <Col N="1853" /> take it is the object of the section, which is fairly and properly drawn and there can be no objection to it.</P>
    <P>I have been looking for the weak spot in the Bill, not in any unfriendly spirit, and the weak spot is this, that during the last nine or ten years there have been cases along the coast of fishermen who, rather than endure the mortification of seeing their boats rotting on the beach, by pledging their own personal credit and time and, such of them as had money, their own money, kept the boats at sea.  I know several such cases.  The boats were kept at sea at a loss and in the best spirit.  I would very much like to see that a fisherman who adopted that course would not find himself in any worse position than the man who abandoned all hope and left his boat rotting on the beach.  I hope that whatever the Minister does he will see that these men who, endured with courage and strength, took all possible risks and went to sea and did what they could to carry their boats and keep themselves clear of the Department and of the debt due to the Department, will not be victimised and find that they are being placed in a worse position than their neighbours who gave up the struggle.  I think we can rely on the Minister doing that.  There is a very real danger of something like that happening.</P>
    <P>There is also another danger.  There are in some cases sureties who are solvent to the extent that the debt can be squeezed out of them through the medium of the sheriff.  If that is done, it will leave the principal as badly off as ever.  I agree that the Department can, in some instances, squeeze some of the debt out of the sureties, but the result will be that the fisherman against whom the balance is outstanding will be as badly off as he ever was, because he will have the surety down on him instead of the Department, and it will be the case of being between the devil and the deep sea.  Of course I do not say that of the Department. I hope when dealing with these cases, where the sureties are perhaps a little better off than in other cases, the Minister will put them on a par with the others, and deal with <Col N="1854" /> the cases on their merits.  I hope he will not victimise the man who by chance has not an absolute pauper as a surety, and, above all, that he will not victimise the man who had the pluck and courage to go to sea when times were bad and when the fish buyers deserted the coast because they were dealing with a decaying trade, and when the fishermen were left on their beam ends.  This only refers to a very few cases, but nothing could be more regrettable than that these men should feel that the reward of their industry and work was to be victimisation.  I join with Deputy de Valera in thinking that if the Minister does not make a clean sweep there will arise in these men's minds the suspicion that they are not properly dealt with.  Our people are somewhat suspicious, and they will, I think, be suspicious enough to say that because they followed one leader rather than another it is being weighed against them.  The clean cut I have been advocating for the last four years is the best way from the economic standing and in the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he was contemplating putting the names of these people into a schedule to the Bill, and I agree that that would be very regrettable.  It would leave it open to the House to discuss these poor men and their misfortunes, and what brought about these misfortunes.  They are very poor, but they have their natural pride, and if we were to discuss whether a man's misfortune was brought about by an individual fish buyer leaving a district or for any other reason, it would be very regrettable, and in the best interests of everybody it should be avoided.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that the best thing for everybody would be what I call the clean cut, and what he calls the clean sweep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies in the House I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I believe it will be beneficial not alone to the fishermen but to the fishing industry generally. However, I feel that it is rather a pity that the Minister and his Department having gone so far did not go a little <Col N="1855" /> further, and, as Deputy de Valera suggested, make a clean sweep of the outstanding debts, so that the mill-stone hanging round the fishermen's necks might be removed.  In speaking in the House when the Sea Fisheries Bill was before us, I pointed out that, in my opinion, two things were essential if the fishing industry was to be rescued from a rapidly decaying position, and if the fishermen with their wives and families were hard put to obtain a better livelihood, I pointed out that a large sum of money would be required to be devoted to the Sea Fisheries Association, and that the outstanding debts should be wiped out so that the Sea Fisheries Association would be made the success that we all desire it should be.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of money has been put at the disposal of the Sea Fisheries Association, but in order to make that Association a complete success, I suggest to the Minister that he should go a little further than he has gone. In my opinion, there is a certain amount of ambiguity in regard to this Bill.  The Minister has power to remit or to reduce certain loans.  As far as these loans are concerned, I understand some of them were made by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, others by the Congested Districts Board, and some by the Minister's own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, did not tell us what the amount of the loans that were made by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, by the Congested Districts Board, or by his own Department.  If he gives us these figures we would find out that, so far as the Minister's own Department is concerned, the figure is comparatively small, compared with the figure outstanding from the Congested Districts Board and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction.  I venture to say that if the old Congested Districts Board were still in existence it would have agreed to wipe out the outstanding loans on boats and gear, as it did in the case of rural industries in regard to spinning-wheels and looms.  I suggest even yet that the <Col N="1856" /> Minister should agree to the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera, that all outstanding loans should be wiped out. I quite agree with the Minister when he says that by far the bigger portion of those debts on boats is not due to dishonest motives on the part of the fishermen, but is due rather to the fact that these loans were obtained when the boats and gear were at their highest price, and the earning capacity of the boats was at the highest.  The debts are also due to the fact that the catches at the present time are in many cases smaller and the price for fish obtained in some districts is not sufficient to pay for the repair of the nets.  The Minister knows that in some parts of Donegal comparatively recently fishermen got only 10/- per cran for herrings.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to the fact that there is a certain amount of outstanding loans less than £20.  It is true that these are comparatively small loans.  I suggest to the Minister, and I think he will agree with me, that the fishermen who received these comparatively small loans obtained them either for the purpose of purchasing nets or open yawls.  Although these debts are comparatively small they were incurred by the poorest of the poor fishermen and I suggest to the Minister even if he is not prepared to wipe out all debts he should, at least, in the interests of the poorer fishermen, who fish with open yawls, wipe out the smaller debts under £20.  I believe if he did that he would be helping to make the Fisheries Association a success and that he would be helping not alone the fishermen but the fishing industry in general.</P>

      <P>There are one or two cases that will crop up in the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Minister said that as a condition of wiping off the loans the fishermen should join the Fisheries Association.  I should like to put the case of a fisherman who has not the opportunity of fishing and who now stays at home.  I would like to know what the Minister would do in his case.  Is that man going to be punished?</P>

      <P>In the case of wiping out of loans these persons, for the most part, have given up fishing; some are dead or have left the country. Naturally you cannot make them join the Association.  What I mentioned was in the case of reduction of arrears is where a man has paid off so much and he would be allowed to pay a reduced amount on condition that he joined the Association.  It is reductions, not remissions, that are dealt with in that case.</P>

      <P>Suppose it is a reduction and that a man intends to give up fishing.  Is he going to get a reduction on his boat?  Then there is the case of a man who in 1918 purchased a boat for £500.  A similar boat could be bought to-day for £300.  He has been paying and has already paid £300 out of the £500.  I should like to know what position that man would be in.  He has paid off £300 and £200 is still due.  I would like to know what the Minister and the Department would do in such a case. Then there is the third suggestion about the clean cut.  Has the Minister considered the suggestion of the clean cut at all on loans obtained before 1925?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the fact that the appeal is endorsed by every Party in the House will induce the devil to accept the pledge tendered to him by Deputy Wolfe for comparing him to the Minister for Fisheries.  I also hope that the Minister will consider favourably the suggestion made by Deputy Wolfe that in taking into account the value that is going to be put upon an existing boat, that that portion of the value which has depended simply upon the effort of the man who used it as distinct from the man who neglected it will be taken into account.  It may be rather difficult for the Minister to estimate it, but I think the principle of it is perfectly sound.  I have one difficulty in connection with the Bill which either the Minister or Deputy Wolfe may be able to resolve, and that is clause 3 in relation to the sureties.  It does seem to prevent, in my rough reading of it, the Minister doing perhaps the very thing <Col N="1858" /> he desires to do.  It says that nothing in this clause will operate to relieve from liability the residue of so-and-so of any amount.  It seems to me that in relation to the other clauses&mdash;I am speaking purely as a layman&mdash;that might prevent him relieving the sureties for the degree of liability which he thought they ought to be relieved.  I hope that that is not so, but it would seem to be.  We are here to help the Minister in the matter.  It is a bit on the Minister's conscience, and it must be on the conscience of everybody when you wipe out an asset of the State, and say that a loan which has been made by the State was not in fact to be paid.  I can speak with a certain amount of knowledge on the subject.  I saw a good many of the best of the boats actually coming out.  They were built during this particular period at very high prices.  They were built very elaborately as compared with the boats to which we were accustomed. I remember the horror-stricken look on the face of an owner of a perfectly new boat which cost about £2,000 and came out for the first time in Baltimore Harbour, when I told him, with absolute knowledge of the fact, that that boat never would and never could go to sea to fish when the war was over, that she was of such a character that she could not pay her working expenses.  In fact, the whole of those special boats that were built at that time were boats utterly unsuitable for the trade as it previously existed, and definitely more unsuitable for the trade which we knew would exist after the war.  Except to the extent that men did make money during that period of inflated prices, and put aside money that they then earned to pay off loans, it was, on the face of it, to any one who knew the facts, impossible for them to pay out of the earnings of that boat.  So the Minister may have no hesitation in wiping out, as far as the first-class boat is concerned, the whole of the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These boats&mdash;Deputy Wolfe and Deputy Sheehy will probably be able to speak with immediate authority&mdash; never did go to sea after the war. They never were able to pay the cost of maintaining their nets and of providing <Col N="1859" /> the petrol which was required to run them.  As far as I know, boats of that special class that were built for the specific purpose of gathering in fish at a time of emergency during the war were derelict in Church Bay or lying dead on the coast.  So the Minister need have no hesitation in removing the whole of that debt.  If he could go to the extent of making a clean cut I think it would be better. There may be cases in which, according to him, it is manifestly wrong. There may be cases within his knowledge, but they must be very special and very few, in which it is manifestly wrong that some payment should not be made.  Except in cases in which it is manifestly wrong then the whole of the thing should not be wiped off, I think both the justice and the economy of the proposition would be met by the clean cut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(West Cork): I endorse what Deputy Flinn said in regard to the larger class of boats that were built immediately after the war. There was no scope for them.  The big prices had disappeared, and the owners were simply facing bankruptcy. Now the Minister has made a great gesture, and I congratulate him upon it.  I have been identified with the fishing industry for over fifty years.  I was identified with the father and brother of Deputy Flinn when they did their work fifty years ago with other excellent citizens of Kinsale and around there.  They established the Baltimore fishing industry.  They got over the Guernsey cutters, the Browns, the Cahills and the Flinns, and they developed the fishing industry without any contribution from any State.  Now these years have passed away, and a period of great depression has come, and this gesture of the Minister for Fisheries will fill the seaboard population along the entire of the County of Cork with hope, consolation and joy.  They realise now with the establishment of the Fisheries Association that there is hope for themselves and their little families to get a living on the Irish seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, for big fishing you must <Col N="1860" /> have big steamers.  In the days that I speak of, forty or fifty years ago, the great spawning beds beyond the Fastnet Lighthouse were all filled with fish. At the time of the war, when there was a cessation of trawling, there was an immense amount of fish taken there, but after the war a number of minesweepers were turned into large trawlers, and they ploughed the western waves, and took the fish that our fishermen were able to eke an existence from.  If there is to be any development in the deep-sea fishing, we must go on the lines of England and Scotland, and get vessels which can go to the ends of Newfoundland.  Our fishermen have the heroism, and they have the knowledge of the trade, but they have not the vessels to carry them.  I must say that the gesture made is an excellent one.  There was a magnificent population of fishermen along our seaboard.  Fifty years ago there were forty or fifty thousand of them, as brave men as you could wish to meet. The Isle of Man boats and the boats from Cornwall and France came in, and our unfortunate people had no Government to help them.  There was only one person who came to their aid, that was the great Baroness Burdette Coutts.  Through the late Father Davis, a distinguished clergyman and a great friend of the fishermen, she advanced thousands of pounds for these fishermen.  To the honour of that lady be it said, that while she got back her capital from the honest Cape Clear fishermen, she never demanded any interest for the loan, and her memory is ever revered there.</P>
    <P>I was down at the opening of the fishing school at Baltimore.  The father of the Land League, Mr. Michael Davitt, was to attend the opening.  Michael Davitt was carried down by the Town Commissioners from Skibbereen.  Archbishop Croke was there, Bishop Fitzgerald.  Father Davis and several others.  There was one thing in connection with this historical celebration.  As a compliment to the Baroness it was decided to toast the health of her Majesty at the banquet to the Baroness, as the Baroness was a generous benefactor to the fishing school.  Mr. Davitt said to <Col N="1861" /> me: &ldquo;Mr. Sheehy, we cannot join in the toast; we will go to Sherkin Island.&rdquo;&ldquo;There is one thing, anyway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she deserves any compliment, because she came forward when no Department did so to help the fishermen of our seaboard here.&rdquo; We went to Sherkin, and spent a very happy day with the islanders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I am not in a position, representing, as I do, a very large fishing constituency, to congratulate the Minister.  I agree with the principle of the Bill, but I would like to refresh the Minister's memory with regard to the promise he made in 1927.  This promise, it given effect to, would give more relief in some cases than what is proposed in the Bill.  According to the Bill it will depend on the Minister or his officials whether the debts of certain people will be remitted or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were listening to my opening statement he would be aware that I said that the promises were going to be honoured; that persons who came within the 1927 scheme would get all the conditions they would have got under that scheme.  That is to say, if they would have got more under that scheme than under this Bill, they will get what they would have got under the former scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>But there are other provisions in the Bill to which I want to draw attention.  Unless a man becomes a member of the Association his case is not going to be considered. Assume for the sake of argument that certain fishermen have a genuine grievance against individual members of the Association.  The Minister may be aware that such things occur.  Will the Minister not favourably consider these men's claims under the Bill, together with the genuine grievance they feel they have against the Association? The Minister knows what I am referring to.  I have in mind certain places where there may be friction because of certain things that took place between the Association and the fishermen.  In these centres a number of the fishermen had to borrow money, and I am sure the Minister <Col N="1862" /> will admit that since doing so they have paid&mdash;in interest and insurance&mdash; more than the actual sum borrowed. Their position is that the principal is still outstanding against them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wolfe spoke of appeals that he made to the Minister to go back to 1927.  I have made appeals on behalf of the Arklow fishermen that the Minister should go back to 1924.  As regards the revaluation of the boats, we know that the price of them at that time was four times the price to be got for them to-day.  The men have a genuine grievance in this way, that they were unable to pay back part of the principal because they were unable to get securities.  Where money had to be borrowed to get gear and nets the securities had to be under 70 years of age.  The result was that the fishermen had to get shopkeepers to go security for them.  Not through any fault of the Minister, I admit, they got no assistance from the Department.  That was due to regulations made by the Department of Finance that if a man was over 70 years of age he would not be taken as security for the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to 21 cases in which he stated the full amount will be remitted if those concerned become members of the Sea Fisheries Association. I can tell the Minister that some of these men will not become members of the Association.  The boats are worthless.  I think the Association should get every assistance for the wiping out of all these arrears.  Under the grant of £750,000 that is being given to the farmers, the Minister for Agriculture did not lay down the condition that a farmer would not get any portion of it if he had not paid his rates.  I appeal to the Minister for Fisheries to take his courage in his hands in the same way as the Minister for Agriculture has done, and as regards these debts to wipe the slate clean from 1924.  I ask him to do that for the fishermen.  That will enable them to become members of the Association. It will remove from around their necks a mill-stone, in the form of boats with a high valuation involving big loans.  I ask the Minister to wipe the slate clean so that these men may be able to get gear and nets and may be encouraged to fish.  The posi- <Col N="1863" /> tion of the fishermen who have the full amount of the principal outstanding against them is very serious.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the Bill, and hope it will encourage the fishermen to become members of the Association.  As I said on the Estimate for the Minister's Department, the Minister is not doing the best thing for the Association by compelling men under this Bill to become members of it.  Some of these men are nervous about certain things in connection with the Association. Even though they do not become members of it, I ask the Minister to give them some assurance that they will get the same rights and privileges as those who join.  I have very definite reasons for making the appeal to the Minister.  If he accedes to it, it will I believe, make for the success of the Association on the one hand, while on the other the fishermen will get good benefits.  If the Minister is going to insist that all must become members of the Association, I do not believe that it will be a success in my constituency, at least, from what I know is taking place.  If the Minister leaves the matter open and agrees to treat each case on its merits, whether the person concerned is a member of the Association or not, I certainly will do my part to influence every fisherman I know of to become a member of the Association.  In that way, the fishermen would in time come to control the Association, and would be in a position to run it for their own benefit, and not in the interests of any individual.</P>

      <P>I have an uneasy feeling that along the coast of Waterford and in other places there are fishermen who have struggled on in spite of very grave difficulties and succeeded in getting into a position in which they will have to pay, whilst their neighbours who have been utterly crushed by conditions will not have to pay anything. I think the Minister should respond to the appeal made from all parts of the House, and make a clean sweep of all these debts.  I feel myself that the Minister is almost as much in favour of that as any member of the House, but his position is that he has to face the Department of Finance, <Col N="1864" /> and, therefore, has to draw the line somewhere.  As the Minister has the support of every Party in the House, I think he should make a clean sweep of all these debts, which only represent a sum of about £11,000.  Having regard to the fact that this section of the community more than any other has to live a life of hardship and danger, that they are the remnant of the Irish-speaking nation, more allowance should be made in their case than in others.  I again suggest to the Minister that he should accept the view expressed by all Parties, and make a clean sweep of the whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig made the point that he was not quite clear as to what I meant about the sureties.  I stated in my opening speech that I felt it would be unfair that these sureties should bear a burden of certain liabilities because of reasons due to depreciation and so on over which they had no control.  They are relieved to the same extent as the borrowers. As regards the 449 cases in which the whole sum has been wiped out, the sureties concerned are being entirely relieved of their liabilities.  In the case of the £15,000 odd, where the boats have been taken up, the sureties are also relieved on condition that the boats and gear are handed over to us. In cases where there is a writing down from the bigger sum to a smaller the condition laid down is that the person for whom the sum is written down will have to become a member of the Association, while the liability of the surety that will remain will be almost nominal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in cases where there is a writing down it is only reasonable that provision should be made that the persons concerned will become members of the Association.  If a person does not become a member of the Association the writing down will take place on condition that he pays the reduced amount in a lump sum.  Normally, the person concerned will join the Association, and in that case, of course, will get the full benefit.  The fact that he does so will practically relieve the surety of any liability, because in the future he will pay out of his catch in the ordinary way.  If <Col N="1865" /> he has a good season he will pay more than in the case of a bad season. There will be a certain percentage deducted by the Association from his earnings.  In that case, the sureties can consider themselves practically relieved.  In order to safeguard the State in cases where people refuse to join the Association there is a special clause in the bill dealing with that, and it is considered necessary.</P>

      <P>Is it necessary that a man should give up his boat and join the Fisheries Association?  If he joins the Association and gives up his boat how is he going to earn anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where you take up a boat from a man you simply look at him as a man who is not a fisherman. There will be no obligation on him to become a member of the Association. In any case, where you wipe out a debt at all there will be no obligation to join the Association.  It is only in cases where you reduce the outstanding arrears in the case of men actively engaged in the fishing industry that the condition is laid down that they will become members of the Association.  I have been asked to make a clean sweep.  I think that what is provided in the Bill is as near a clean sweep as one could be reasonably expected to give.  A clean sweep would mean not merely wiping out the £11,000 odd, but all the existing loans due to the Department.  That would hardly be reasonable.  People who have got loans within the last year or so are paying back in the ordinary way.  The conditions under which they got them were all right.  They have not changed in the meantime, and it would be unreasonable to expect that such loans should be wiped out.  In the cases we are dealing with this sum of £11,000 is due mostly by people who have made pretty substantial earnings out of their boats and who will be well able to meet the remaining liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, through our fishery superintendents.  The conditions prevailing locally were looked into.  We have written down the debts to the amount which could reasonably be expected from those concerned.  Deputy de Valera has expressed doubt as to the principle involved.  It was because there were such doubts that it has taken so long to introduce the Bill.  As I indicated in my opening speech, it sets up a dangerous precedent, one that should not be lightly entered on&mdash; that is the reduction of debts due to the State.  When you do that in one case you may have an appeal from other classes in the community that they should be relieved of their liabilities. The whole question was considered time after time, and that was the cause of the delay in introducing the Bill.  We were fully alive to the dangers involved in doing this, but, at the same time, we felt that it ought to be done.  We are starting now a different scheme of operation.  As to the sureties, they are gone for ever. Except for the fact that the present sureties will be liable for the amounts determined, there will be no sureties under the new system.</P>
      <P>Under the Association they will be able to get loans for boats and gear without the necessity of providing securities.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to the case of a borrower who had paid £500 for a boat, repaid £300 of that, thus leaving £200 due.  If he were a 1918 borrower he would come under the 1927 scheme.  The value of the boat would be written down.  Off the original price of the boat would be taken what might be called the abnormal cost.  If, for instance, the boat that he paid £500 for could be bought to-day for £300 then the original debt would be scaled down to £300, and on Deputy O'Reilly's figures his liability would be wiped out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig made the point that Deputies should be allowed to see the statement which is to be laid on the <Col N="1867" /> Table of the House.  I have no objection to that, but I want to warn Deputies that while they can see it and get information from the Department as to the basis on which we reduced a loan to a particular figure, I would not be prepared to accept any suggestions for a further reduction. I have come to an agreement with the Department of Finance as to the amount by which the loans are to be written down.  If I were to accept any suggestions of the kind indicated it would mean re-opening the whole question and that would put me in an impossible position.  If Deputies wish they can discuss the matter with officials of my Department, and I take it that as the statement will be published in the course of a few weeks it will be available as a public document in the library.</P>
    <P>As to the amounts lent by the old C.D.B. and the D.A.T.I. as against the loans made by my Department, I think the amount in the case of the old C.D.B. and the D.A.T.I. was £93,000 as against £7,800 lent by my Department&mdash;that is of the £101,000 that we are writing down.  Deputy Flinn wanted to know the number of cases in which the debts had not been written down to the value of the boat. There were about one dozen cases. There are, in fact, eight cases but there are eleven separate loans and the total amount outstanding in these is £8,834 8s. 11d., of which it is proposed to write off £5,062 15s. 2d., leaving the balance to be repaid.  The estimated value of the boats is £1,705. In three cases only in which the debts are being written off and the boats taken up were the loans made by the Department&mdash;that is since 1923.  In all other cases the loans were made by the old C.D.B. and the Department of Agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  As this kind of omnibus legislation is in the nature of a general amendment of a whole lot of Acts, it is desirable that the principle should be established that there should be no tampering with any Act <Col N="1870" /> behind the back of the House, and that no alteration should be made in the laws by any body other than the Oireachtas.  The original Adaptation of Enactments Act was passed when we were not here to criticise the method of adaptation and this is the first opportunity we have had of dealing with the matter.  The Minister may argue that in this case the matters dealt with are of a minor nature.  In his reply, I hope he will make perfectly clear that there is no intention of legislating in a substantial way by means of these Orders. At the same time, in changing the wording of an Act, he is doing a thing which nobody but the Oireachtas should do.  For that reason, we think that the House should have an opportunity, before the Order comes into force, of reviewing the action of the Executive Council&mdash;in other words, that instead of the particular changes having the force of law at the beginning of the twenty-one days, the House will have an opportunity of rejecting the changes if they should think fit.  That is only maintaining the principle that the Oireachtas is the one competent body to change an Act of Parliament in any respect whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason on earth for this amendment. Deputy Little talked about legislation. There is no question of legislation here.  Owing to the establishment of the Free State and the setting up of the Oireachtas, certain terms in certain Acts of Parliament are not now applicable.  They have to be changed in order that the law which existed in this country up to the date of the Treaty and the passing of the Constitution, should continue to be the law. That was done with regard to all statutes passed after the Union, but, by some oversight, statutes passed before the Union were not dealt with. This provision is designed to make the procedure for adapting statutes passed by the Irish House of Parliament&mdash; the old pre-Union Parliament&mdash;identical with the procedure for adapting statutes passed by the British House of Parliament.</P>

      <P>We have only the Minister's word for that and we are not quite satisfied.  We believe that it will be possible to interpret this Bill, if it becomes an Act, in a much wider way than it was possible to interpret the previous Act.  The Minister says that that is not the case.  It is a question of being satisfied that it is not the case.  It ought to be possible for the Minister to devise words which would leave no doubt whatever on that point.  These words have not been devised so far.  If the position is as the Minister states, he should have no objection to doing what Deputy Little seeks&mdash;he should have no objection to having the Orders laid on the Table of the House for three weeks before they come into operation. If that amendment is not accepted, immediately the Order is made it will become operative, and it will have the force of law during the period mentioned in the Bill, even though the House were afterwards to reverse it.  We want to be in a position in which, before the Order becomes operative, any member of the Dáil can bring the matter before the House and, if he gets a majority, prevent the Order coming into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If what the Minister says is correct, I do not see why he should object to this amendment.  If the Minister wishes to avoid that procedure, then let him put down in the Bill words which will remove the possibility of doubt&mdash;words which will make clear that the Bill shall apply only to specified things, changes of particular terms, and so on.  He ought to be able to enumerate these terms and define exactly the type of modification and <Col N="1872" /> adaptation that is required.  Instead of that, he takes, in this Bill, wide power to make such changes as may be necessary to enable certain statutes to have full force and effect which otherwise would not have full force and effect, and in so far as they would not have force and effect, would not be operative.  That may be only a lay man's way of looking at the matter, but we are legislating here as laymen, and we ought to insist that whatever terms are included in the Bill, should be in plain English and understandable by laymen.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I want to make quite clear that it must be on the Table of the House before it becomes operative.  I am speaking for myself in this matter.  As I understand the section, here is what we have: &ldquo;The Executive Council may from time to time by order make all such general or specific adaptations of or modifications&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;  If you wanted to get any wider powers than that to do what you liked, I think it would be hard to get words to express it.  &ldquo;To make all such general or specific adaptations of or modifications&rdquo;&mdash;in what?  &ldquo;In any Irish Statute having <Col N="1873" /> the force of law in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; That is, in other words, it has the force of law.

It is this, that there may be certain laws which are not fully operative in Saorstát Eireann but which have to be modified or adapted in order that they may have full force and effect.  We are by this giving the Executive Council power to make all such adaptations and modifications as may be necessary to give full force and effect to any laws they please.</P>

What I am arguing is that if the section gives these wide powers to the Minister it is necessary for the House in order to defend the community against unfair use of that section <Col N="1874" /> by the Ministry, to insist that before any action which the Ministry may take under that section should operate, this House will have an opportunity of saying that we do not agree with the Ministry and that the Order is not to become operative.  If the Minister is able to convince us that Section 2 has not the meaning which I take out of it, then we will approach it in a different frame of mind.  As I say, I have studied and re-read the section.  I admit that I am not satisfied that I see the difference between a law that is in force and a law that has still to get something else to give it effect, but it should be possible for the Minister to make it clear to me.  Until he has made it clear we are going to insist that the Minister should not have such wide powers as are contemplated in Section 3.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with one thing which Deputy de Valera has stated, and that is that I am afraid he doesn't understand the first thing about this Bill.  There were certain statutes in force in this country at the time the Treaty was entered into and the Constitution was drawn up.  Certain of these statutes were passed by the British Parliament and certain other statutes were passed by the Irish Parliament pre-Union. In order that these statutes should have full force and effect it was necessary to make verbal alterations and changes in them.  If, for instance, a certain office was mentioned, or if certain things were specified to be done by the holder of that office if the office were abolished they could not be done now.  They should naturally fall to be done by the holder of the nearest similar office.  These are the small modifications which are necessary. All the British statutes up to date which it was necessary to modify, have been modified and adapted and are now in full force and the provisions for the adaptation of them are the very same as are contained in this Bill.  Deputy de Valera, unconsciously, I am sure, seems to have a sort of idea that while you can do that with a British statute, an Act of the old Irish House has got something so terrible hidden behind it <Col N="1875" /> that you cannot have the same procedure. Personally I do not see why you cannot have similar procedure.</P>

      <P>What the Minister stated just now, he told us when introducing the Act.  We had a discussion here to-day as to the intention of this House in passing another Act. We do not want to have anything interpreted afterwards as to what our intentions were.  We want to have it down in black and white.  If my recollection of the other Act is right the Minister was able to put down in black and white the changes he proposed to make in the British Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes it was proposed to make were mentioned.  Here we find that either the Minister was too lazy or his <Col N="1876" /> Department was too lazy to find out exactly what were the sort of changes which he wants, or else he wants to have wider powers than those that are necessary to meet the circumstances about which he told the House.  We are not willing to meet the Minister in that way.  We are prepared to meet him to the extent to which he says he requires these powers, if he only puts that down in the Bill and does not seek what we regard as wider powers.</P>

      <P>The Tariff Commission Estimate shows a considerable increase over that of last year, the increase being probably due to the fact that in the interval a whole-time Tariff Commission has been appointed.  The appointment of a whole-time Tariff Commission with this increase in its expenses does not, however, appear to have conferred any benefit upon the State.  The reports on applications that have come before the Commission are not being produced at any quicker rate.  In fact, a number of applications have been under consideration for a considerable time, and there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of a report being forthcoming.  I think the Minister should inform us what is the position of these applications, what progress has been made, and when it is likely that the Tariff Commission will conclude its labours upon them.  There are a number of fairly important applications pending.  We do not want to have repeated in respect of these applications the same delay and the same disastrous consequences as attended previous applications already reported on like the application of the coachbuilders and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in the past, repeatedly expressed our opinion that the State would be in a much better position without this Tariff Commission.  We must decline to vote anything for its upkeep, and we think that if the money were put to the assistance of industries which are wasting their time and their funds formulating their cases to be submitted to this body, the money would be much more usefully <Col N="1879" /> expended.  We think also that the Minister might explain what is the reason for the extraordinary delay that has taken place concerning the publication of the report of the Grain Tribunal.  Has the fact that the members of the Grain Tribunal have also duties as members of the Tariff Commission anything to do with the delay in the production of the Report? It was a matter for hilarity here before when I put a question to the President concerning it.  He seemed to consider it a great joke for anyone to be concerned about the Report of that Tribunal.</P>

      <P>It does to this extent, that portion of their time is occupied with the work of the Tariff Commission, and that means that the report of the Tribunal is delayed.  The report was promised in 1930, and it has not yet appeared.  I think that the unusual delay is worthy of comment.  Of course it is nothing to the delay on the part of the Tariff Commission. There were applications made to them in 1926 or thereabouts, and they were not reported upon for four years.  Is there any possibility that the cases now before the Tariff Commission will be reported on within four or even five years?  Has the whole-time Tariff Commission inherited the bad habits of its predecessors?  I suppose the members are at present visiting factories in England or on the Continent, examining conditions there, so that they will be able to lecture us on our inefficiency when they return.  The taxpayers' money should not be spent providing them with <Col N="1880" /> amusement, and therefore we will vote against this proposal.</P>

      <P>I understand the Tariff Commission has completed the hearing of evidence on the application for a tariff on certain qualities of leather. A great many people are interested in that inquiry and are looking forward to a favourable report.  Since the Minister has no proposal to make, notwithstanding that it was expected the Dáil would adjourn this week, it would seem that the report is unfavourable to the applicants.  Perhaps the Minister will announce whether the report has been received and whether it is unfavourable; further, whether the Government have decided to accept an unfavourable report on the application?</P>

      <P>The inquiry to which Deputy Moore referred has, I think, been practically, if not entirely, completed by the Tariff Commission.  I hope that we will have a report very soon.  The Grain Tribunal Report which has been referred to is also practically completed and I think the report will be available at a very early date indeed.  I do not know that there is any other report likely to be available very soon, but the Tariff Commission have the other matters that are before them actually in hands and they are dealing with them as rapidly as they can be dealt with.  Whether it is a whole-time or a part-time Tariff Commission, it is impossible to deal with the various applications as quickly as Deputy Lemass would seem to expect.  If the Commission is to give the service it ought to give and acquire the information it ought to acquire, there must be a considerable lapse of time.  There certainly has to be an interval both for the applicants and opponents and it is absolutely necessary that the Commission should visit factories and observe the various processes of industries. It would be impossible for the members of the Tariff Commission to appreciate the value of evidence if these inquiries were not to take <Col N="1881" /> place.  It would be impossible satisfactorily to hear a process described which they had not seen, or to have evidence given about qualities of goods which were not actually before them.  I know Deputy Lemass does not like the Commission and I think the only thing that would cause him to like it would be if the Commission only pretended to examine things and did not really do so.  They will not do that.</P>

Otherwise the matter will be in suspense for a very long period.  The protection which the applicants desire and which may be recommended could not be imposed until later in the year if the report is not now submitted.  In view of the fact that an early adjournment is anticipated, will the Minister get in touch with the Commission so as to get the report in time to enable action to be taken on it, say next week?</P>

The provision which is made is often very unsatisfactory, and whichever Department is responsible&mdash;I think it is the Department of Local Government&mdash; they ought to ensure that returning officers will, at times of election when there is great public interest aroused in the result, make such arrangements as will ensure that the votes will be expeditiously and correctly counted, and that facilities will be provided for the agents of the candidates and others interested to witness the counting.

      <P>In connection with this matter I have been asked to raise the position of the National Theatre <Col N="1885" /> Society, Limited, to which a grant of £1,000 is made under Sub-head B. A considerable number of people are dissatisfied with the theatrical fare which is provided in the Abbey Theatre during certain periods of the year.  For instance, during Horse Show Week the standing dish on the menu is &ldquo;John Bull's Other Island,&rdquo; or some other play of that sort. Then there are Mr. O'Casey's plays. I confess in regard to them I have no criticism to offer.  I regard them as a legitimate interpretation of one aspect of Irish life, and I do not wish in anything I may say to be taken as criticising his merits as a dramatist, or as protesting against the themes which he chooses.  That is my personal and private opinion. I do know, however, that there is a considerable section of public opinion in the city which does not regard his plays as a fair presentation of Irish life.  It would seem that the Abbey Theatre does, on certain occasions, when there is an influx of visitors into the country, particularly from Great Britain and elsewhere, take the opportunity of staging plays of that type which give offence to a certain section of our people.  It would be better if the Abbey Theatre, in view of the fact that it receives a subsidy from the community as a whole, would not continuously adopt that policy, and if they would, on these occasions, stage other plays which would give what is, in the minds of most of us, a fairer all-round presentation of life in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I desire to direct attention to an item under Sub-head C that appears in this year's account which has been appearing for a number of years, that is the item for £1,000 to the Royal Zoological Society.  For a number of years I have been protesting against that.  I reiterate that protest now.  I think it is a scandalous state of affairs that the House should vote this sum of £1,000 for feeding animals in the Zoological Gardens when there are so many hungry unemployed men and women in the country.  I certainly protest against that Vote.  Representations have been made by Deputy MacEntee with regard to the sum of <Col N="1886" /> £1,000 for the Abbey Theatre.  I quite appreciate a certain educational value to be derived from the Abbey Theatre. I agree, however, that occasionally Irishmen and their customs are held up to ridicule in some or other of the Abbey plays.  I believe if the directors of the Abbey showed more foresight and more business initiative, they would be able to provide a much better theatre and to get better patronage, so that it would not be necessary for us to vote this sum annually.  I desire to register an emphatic protest against this particular sum of £1,000 for the Zoological Gardens.</P>
      <P>Some people can hardly realise that we are paying £1,000 per annum to subsidise the Zoo, while there are so many hungry men and women and children in the country.  I quite recognise that there is some educational value to be derived from these places, but the country is not rich enough at present to be able to afford the expenditure of £2,000 in this manner, when it could be spent in a much better way.</P>

      <P>I think that good educational value is derived from the Zoo.  With regard to the Abbey Theatre, I would like if it got more plays, as I suppose most people would, but I would not like to take the line of objection to any plays that the directors considered a good draw and otherwise suitable.  People may be so thin skinned as to object to O'Casey's plays, but you would prevent any development if you took a line that anything anybody could object to should never be produced. Everything wears out after a time, and those who object to these plays will find their objections wearing out in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed the following question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he proposes to introduce proposals for legislation extending the provisions of the Railway (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, for a further period, with a view to ensuring that railway employees dismissed as a direct result of amalgamation, shall receive compensation for disturbance as provided in the Act; whether he was requested by the Railway Trade Unions on 28th April, 1931, and subsequent dates, to receive a deputation for the purpose of discussing the question; whether he declined to receive this deputation; and, if so, for what reason; whether he has been in correspondence with the Great Southern Railways Company on the matter, and has accepted their point of view without hearing a statement on behalf of the employees through the deputation asked for.</P>
      <P>In reply the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I have been asked by the Railway Trade Unions to receive a deputation which would represent that railway employees would be discharged after the 23rd July as a direct result of amalgamation and would not then be entitled to compensation. The Great Southern Railways Company has informed me that there would not be discharges after that date as a direct result of amalgamation.  I saw no useful purpose in receiving the deputation to discuss a situation which has not yet arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have reason to believe that discharges do take place without compensation after the 23rd July as a direct result of amalgamation I will introduce retrospective legislation to secure that the employees concerned do not lose their right to compensation.  But I, and, I have no doubt, the public, would expect <Col N="1888" /> that seven years after amalgamation was effected the responsible parties should have been able to dispose of reorganisation questions without further recourse to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I think I am putting it very mildly when I say that the reply given by the Minister has caused consternation in the ranks of all grades of railwaymen, particularly that part of the reply which pretends to justify the refusal to hear the views of representatives of the railwaymen in support of the extension of the existing compensation clauses in the Railway (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926.  The Minister was approached in this matter by correspondence as far back as the 28th of April last.  After repeated communications had been addressed to him during which time presumably he was in communication with the Great Southern Railways, he finally replied on 3rd July.  Surely it should not take the Minister from 28th April to 3rd July to make up his mind as to what should be done.  I think it is only right that the reply which the Minister forwarded to Senator O'Farrell, Secretary of the Railway Clerks' Association, should be placed on the records of the House in order that the Minister or his successor may see as time goes on to what extent his action in this matter was justified. The following is the reply from the Minister, dated 3rd July, 1931, and it is signed by Lord Glenavy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of the 26th June on the subject of the Railways Act, 1924-26, and to enclose for your information copy of a letter dated 27th June received from the Great Southern Railways Company on the question of the relation between the amalgamation scheme and the reorganisation of the Company's staff.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with that letter the Company have been notified by the Minister that if hereafter he were satisfied that any reductions in the establishment which were in fact a consequence of amalgamation and not due to the fall in the Company's revenue, had been deferred until the expiration of the seven years' period <Col N="1889" /> within which the right to compensation arises it would be necessary for him to consider such legislative readjustment as to secure that the intention of the Railways Act was not defeated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that letter was enclosed copy of reply forwarded to the Minister for Industry and Commerce dated 27th June and it is of greater importance for future reference than the letter I have read.  The letter is from the Secretary of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>My Directors have considered the subject of your letter of the 18th instant (T.S.58) concerning the Railway Clerks' Association's request for extension of provisions, in Railways Acts of 1924 and 1926, governing compensation for loss of office.</P>
    <P>The allegation that existing and pending re-organisations of the Company's establishments are only now arising out of amalgamation, and that such reorganisations should have taken place some years ago, is unfounded, and it is, therefore, needless to add that the Company would resist to the utmost any extension of the Acts based on that allegation.  The urgent and vital necessity of reduction in expenditure because of the alarming and persistent fall of the Company's revenue is the sole cause of present and pending economies, which must necessarily result in reduction in staff, and which have no connection whatever with the amalgamation of 1925.</P>
    <P>In this connection my Directors desire to say that for a considerable time past they have felt intensely the heavy burden thrown on the Company by the extent to which, and the manner in which, the compensation provisions of the Acts of 1924 and 1926 have operated against the Company.  They would have long ago made representations to the Ministry of their sense of grievance in this matter, but for the fact that redress could only be secured by legislation, and that opportunity for addition to the burden <Col N="1890" /> would automatically expire in 1931.</P>
    <P>The evidence adduced by Senator O'Farrell of necessity for extension of the Act is fallacious.  Many of the decisions of the arbitrator and of the principles underlying them would have been appealed against by the Company.  No appeal having been provided for in the Act, the Company&mdash;however aggrieved it felt&mdash;had no option but to accept the judgments and act on them.  As a result the Company had been obliged to discuss with the Unions, on a purely monetary basis, questions of compensation which in the view of the Company was not fairly due.  To represent such a discussion at the present time as justifying prolongation of the Compensation Acts is to ignore the real condition of affairs.  Indeed if any such argument is admitted it is difficult to see how any limit at all could be fixed to the future period, in which reduction in staff could not be attributed to amalgamation now seven years old.</P>
    <P>I quote that letter and leave it to be put on the records of the House to prove to all concerned that the Minister has taken his cue and has acted upon representations made to him in that letter by the Great Southern Railways Company.  Even though the Minister might have reason, looking at it from his personal point of view, and particularly his responsibility for the railway amalgamation policy, I think there is not a good case for his refusal to meet a deputation appointed by the members of the men's unions in order to state their position to the Minister. This action on the part of the Minister in refusing to meet a deputation is unprecedented.  In my opinion the Minister refused to receive the deputation because he was aware from previous experience of dealing with some of the men concerned that a good case could be put forward for an extension of the existing compensation legislation. The original Act came into operation in 1925, and made provision for the payment of compensation to all railway servants likely to lose their employment as a result of amalgamation. <Col N="1891" /> Shortly after that Act came into operation the Great Southern Railways Company retired certain servants of the company, and denied to some of them who were compulsorily retired compensation to which they and their unions considered they were entitled.</P>
    <P>In one test case that was brought before the arbitrator the company lost, notwithstanding the fact that they had employed the ablest counsel to represent their point of view.  Following that unfavourable decision from the company's point of view, they made certain representations to the Minister, with the result that the Minister at that period, 1926, accepted their point of view and introduced the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act.  It is commonly stated in railway circles that the Bill that was introduced by the Minister on that occasion was actually drafted by the company's solicitor.  It was made practically impossible for railway servants, even though dismissed as a direct result of amalgamation, to obtain compensation.  It stated that the compensation under the terms of the amending Act can only be paid to those who lose their employment &ldquo;in consequence of changes of administration due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of companies affected by or under the principal Act, and not shown by the amalgamated company to have been caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods of working (other than methods which would not have been feasible for the amalgamated or absorbed company by which the officer or servant was formerly employed) or other economic causes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The railway servant who was dismissed from his employment following the passing of that amending Act was actually sent before the arbitrator, if he thought fit to appear before him, to make a case which the company in the ordinary way would have been obliged to make.  It was left to the railway servant who believed he was dismissed as a direct result of amalgamation to prove that he was actually dismissed as a direct result of amalgamation, <Col N="1892" /> instead of as under the original Act, the company being obliged to defend such a claim.  The individual who was dismissed from the service following the passing of the amending Act was put into the box to defend a charge which was not stated by the railway company.  That was the actual position.</P>
    <P>In the amending Act, and this is the most important part of the complaint I have to make, the Minister laid it down that the reorganisation of the railways arising out of the amalgamation scheme should be completed inside a period of seven years.  That particular portion of the amending Bill was strenuously opposed by members of the Labour Party at the time, because they were aware that no such time limit was laid down in the British Act of 1921.  I work for one of the biggest British railway companies, and I can tell the House that although the British Amalgamation Act was passed in 1921, the reorganisation of the British railways is not yet complete, and men are being retired from them and given the full compensation rights which were laid down under the Act.  That is over ten years ago, and the Minister apparently thought&mdash;and I believe he is wrong in still thinking &mdash;that the reorganisation of the Irish railways could have been completed in a seven-years' period.  The seven-years' period laid down in the Act of 1926 will expire on 23rd of this month, and the Minister contends both in communications addressed to responsible officials of the trade unions and verbally that he is satisfied that no further dismissals will take place as a direct result of the amalgamation of the Irish railways.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has changed his mind within the last few days, whether he is aware that 63 men have been dismissed within the last week in the Limerick works, 42 in the city of Cork, 17 in Bray, and that a number of other dismissals have taken place and that larger numbers are likely to be dismissed after the 23rd of this month when the time limit will have expired. What does the Minister propose to do. He proposes to appoint himself as <Col N="1893" /> arbitrator to decide the merits of any claims which railway servants may have for compensation arising out of dismissals which will take place after the 23rd of this month.  I think the Minister is going to place himself and his successor in a most unfortunate position unless the law is altered and he is also going to be quite unfair to those who feel that they may have claims for compensation for disturbance or dismissal.  It has taken the Minister from April, 1928, to 3rd July, 1931, to decide whether he would extend the existing compensation section of the Act of 1926.  How long, I wonder, will it take the officials of his Department and himself finally to decide in all the individual cases that are bound to come before him for consideration after the 23rd of this month, and after he has allowed the compensation clause of the existing Railway Act to expire.</P>
    <P>I am reliably informed and the Minister can have fairly reliable information if he wants to go the right way about getting it, that at a recent meeting of the Board of Directors of the Great Southern Railways departmental officers were brought in and were told that the Board was not satisfied that the reorganisation scheme which was intended under the Act of 1925 had been carried out and these departmental officers have got instructions to proceed to draft a real reorganisation scheme and that is now to be done and possibly will be put into operation after the 23rd of this month.</P>
    <P>Certain dismissals which have already been agreed upon by the Board are held up pending the expiration of this particular clause in the Act and the Minister's Department will, I believe, be flooded with applications after the Act expires from men whose dismissals should have taken place before the 23rd of this month, but whose dismissals are held up until this clause expires and when the company will be left without any obligation to pay compensation or gratuity to the men concerned.  Speaking for myself only in this matter, I would be prepared to submit any case on its merits to the <Col N="1894" /> Minister.  I believe such cases if he were free from his responsibility for the amalgamation policy would get fair and impartial consideration.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that the Minister is so alarmed with the failure of his amalgamation policy and the reduction in the revenue of the Great Southern Railways Company that he is prepared to go any length to relieve that Company from any further financial obligation to servants who may be dismissed after the 23rd of this month. The Minister is not a free agent, and cannot consider these cases on their merits, and I say that it is unfair for this House, if it can prevent it, to allow him to set himself up as an arbitrator to decide on the merits of any cases submitted to him after the 23rd of this month.  There is a general impression that all the railway men who have been dismissed since the amalgamation of the railways came into operation have received compensation. Might I tell the Minister, if he does not know it, that 500 men on the Great Southern Railways were dismissed one day last November and not one of them has got compensation? Very few of those who have been dismissed since the amalgamation came into operation have received compensation. I have before me particulars of the last 63 cases that were before the arbitrator.  What happened in these cases?  Out of the 63 only 19 were successful, 36 were unsuccessful, and the remainder of the cases were deferred for further consideration, and they will probably be held over until the compensation clause has expired on the 23rd of this month.  The Company say they are not in a position to pay any further compensation.  That is the main case which the Company has made to the Minister.  The net receipts of the Great Southern Railways Company in 1925 were £466,493, while the net receipts in 1930 amounted to £825,085, showing quite clearly that the poverty-stricken attitude the directors have taken up in this matter is not verified by these figures.</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister, and I am not making the statement without provocation, that the directors of the Great Southern Railways are for some time <Col N="1895" /> past doing their level best to provoke trouble with railwaymen by dismissing and changing them, and adopting the kind of attitude which ordinary men would not adopt towards human beings.  They are treated as part of a machine and not as human beings, and I want to say this to the Minister &mdash;and time will tell whether my prophecy will turn out to be true&mdash; that by allowing the compensation clauses to expire on the 23rd of this month he is assisting the directors in their attempt to provoke trouble with the railwaymen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was asked the question yesterday by Deputy Davin I replied: &ldquo;If I have reason to believe that discharges do take place without compensation after the 23rd July, as a direct result of amalgamation, I will introduce retrospective legislation to secure that the employees concerned do not lose their right to compensation.&rdquo;  I made that reply and I stick to it.  Previously I had been approached by railway employees, under the leadership of trade union officials, as regards a number of cases where it was alleged to me that there was a likelihood of compensation being refused.  I think the circumstances were such as Deputy Davin would re present them&mdash;he was reliably informed that compensation would be refused.  On that occasion, we came to something amounting to an agreement. We did not reduce it to writing but we understood each other's point of view, that if certain cases were put forward and if compensation did not follow, I would regard the Railway Act as having definitely broken down and there would have to be a change in the compensation clause.  I did not let out any information of that to the railway company.  Cases were decided on as being suitable for compensation, cases in which it was clearly the intention of the Oireachtas that compensation should be paid, and compensation was declared in favour of the applicants by the arbitrator.  As far as I am concerned, this particular series of cases justified me in the attitude I had adopted with regard to the Railway <Col N="1896" /> Act.  Deputy Davin has alleged now that the whole amending Act was weighted definitely against the railway employees, that it was so heavily weighted that no employee could hope to establish a case.  In fact I cannot remember having got put to me any case that I considered a clear case in which a man due for compensation was refused compensation.  I had that rather valuable test.  I made a certain promise to the railway unions and I make exactly the same promise now. If I have reason to believe, and I will only get reason to believe when actual cases are put to me, that discharges do take place without compensation after the 23rd July, as a direct result of amalgamation, I will introduce retrospective legislation to see that the employees concerned do not lose their compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mainly because the Deputy objected.  The Deputy will be on the other side this time.  The Deputy led the opposition against the retrospective clause.  He will be able to change the little principle he adopted then in the new circumstances. At any rate, I rely on him for his support.  The Deputy said that I am taking up the position of an arbitrator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot introduce legislation merely on Deputy Davin's well-founded belief, on merely hypothetical cases.  He is in the position of the man crying wolf.  These well-founded beliefs of the Deputy do not convince.  Even the letters I got did not convince.  If cases are made they will be very definitely received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of what I was going to have put to me?  Fears, statements as to what would happen, hypothetical illustrations.  On the <Col N="1897" /> other hand, I had a very definite guarantee from the railway company. If there is a sufficient block of cases of unjustified dismissals directly due to amalgamation and no compensation flowing, I am not merely in the position but public opinion will coerce me into bringing in amending legislation and it will be very difficult in that amending legislation to put in any limitation as far as time is concerned. We will have the railway company's guarantee and a situation in which that guarantee will have been found to be useless.  From my point of view there is quite a good situation facing these people.  I can understand the apprehensions of men who feel they have a good case and who have no great trust in the railway company.  I am sure that there is a lack of trust as far as the men are concerned, but there are other <Col N="1898" /> people as between them and the railway company.  The Deputy has said that I have taken my cue from the railway company.  I have said &ldquo;If I have reason to believe that discharges do take place without compensation after the 23rd of July as a direct result of amalgamation I will introduce retrospective legislation.&rdquo; I think the Deputy should wait until cases have occurred.  The Deputy can go back to the Trade Unions concerned and ask them were the cases that were secured as test cases proper ones?  Did the proper results follow and were they satisfied with my attitude in those cases?  Then he may be able to give some heartening advice to the people who are now naturally apprehensive of what might happen after the 23rd of July.</P>
