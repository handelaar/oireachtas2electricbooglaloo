      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works cannot carry out any drainage works in the Clonown area as it is not in an existing drainage district and the cost of the necessary works would be too small to warrant the application of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  They have already received a report on the matter from their Engineer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that serious flooding, causing enormous damage to crops, occurs in the Cross River area near Athlone; and if he will take immediate steps to have the work of draining this district proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are preparing a detailed drainage scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, for submission to the votes of the occupiers of affected lands on the Cross River.  It is hoped to exhibit the scheme shortly, but even if the occupiers accept the scheme, a considerable time must elapse before actual drainage works could be commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why it is that a considerable time must elapse before the actual drainage works will commence? This is an urgent matter and I want to tell him there is considerable flooding there every year.  In the present year the people in that area had to sow their crops twice at considerable loss.  In this district there was a thriving potato seed industry and surely the farmers will not be asked to wait the convenience of the staff of the Board of Works.  It is not good enough to tell the people that they must wait for perhaps five or six years in view of the calamitous flooding occurring there from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain precedure has to be gone through.  I am not saying five or six years will elapse.  Probably we cannot start until next Spring. If we cannot begin early in the year it is uneconomic to start at all.  There are bound to be certain objections even though the majority may agree to the scheme and we must inquire into these objections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that thousands of acres around Lough Gara, particularly in the Boyle-Ballaghadereen areas, are flooded every year, and as a result of the present flooding enormous damage has been done to the people's crops; and if he will take immediate steps to have drainage relief work started in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The lands referred to by the Deputy appear to be included in the existing Lough Gara and Mantua Drainage district, for the proper maintenance of which the local drainage trustees are at present responsible.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have recently received petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, for the formation of a new drainage district in this area and are proceeding with investigations in the matter but some time must elapse before a decision can be reached in connection with the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter again I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary about a considerable time elapsing.  This is also a very serious affair.  The whole district is flooded at present and it has been flooded every year.  There is a suspicion locally that there is a vested interest in that Lough which is preventing the work from being proceeded with.  It is stated locally that a person who is a prominent Civil Service pensioner has held up the work.  That is the view that is prevalent in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  The reason for the interference with the ceremony was that a parade of an organisation purporting to be a military force not established and maintained by law was about to take place, and that the holding of such a parade is contrary to law.</P>

In proper cases the Gárda Síochána institute proceedings under Section 1 of the Motor Car Act, 1903, for the offence of driving a motor <Col N="797" /> car on a public road recklessly or negligently or in a manner which is dangerous to the public.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was under discussion when the Dáil adjourned on the last day.  As Deputies remember, the amendments were made to the section of the Bill which defines the manner in which the rent to be reserved under a new tenancy granted under the Bill to a tenant with forty years' occupation and entitled to a new tenancy, is to be calculated.  The proposal in the Bill is that such rent shall be calculated by the court on the basis of the rent which the landlord might reasonably expect to get under circumstances of normal competition and on the basis of vacant possession, less any allowance that is to be made for improvements effected by the tenant which may increase the letting value of the dwelling.  The amendment which I have proposed is designed to vary that method of calculation.  In discussing this, I think it is well that Deputies should bear in mind a remark made by the Minister for Justice on the Second Reading that there are two separate questions relating to town tenants which should not be confused.  The first is the manner in which the relationship of landlord and tenant can best be put on a permanently satisfactory basis, and the second is the manner of dealing with the abnormal situation now existing arising out of the shortage of houses.  It is very hard, of course, when discussing this particular section to keep these two questions separate.  Although the Bill we are discussing is intended to be a permanent Act, and may be in operation twenty or thirty years hence, under circumstances that we cannot foresee, at the same time we must face the fact that certain conditions operate now and are likely to operate for some <Col N="813" /> years to come when this Bill will be in operation and which will considerably affect the manner of its operation. These circumstances are that houses are scarce, and because they are scarce the rents demanded are very high.  A number of tenants are at present protected by the Increase of Rents Act. That protection will be removed this year, and therefore the tenancies as defined under this Bill will cease with the coming into operation of this Act.</P>
      <P>In the case of such of these tenants as will have then a statutory right to a new tenancy, a considerable increase in rent is to be anticipated; in other words, the rent as calculated in the definition contained in paragraph (f) of this section will be probably very considerably higher than the rent which these tenants are now paying.  The question is, is it fair that that considerable increase in rent should be permitted?  The proposal which I am submitting to the Dáil is that where the rent, as calculated in accordance with the section, exceeds the old rent then the rent to be reserved under the new tenancy should not exceed the old rent by more than half the difference between the old rent and the rent as calculated under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to satisfy ourselves that that is a fair proposal, it is necessary to discuss how the increased letting value of the dwelling arises.  It may be that the increase in the letting value arises out of some action of the landlord in respect of which the landlord should be entitled to some additional remuneration. It may be, although it is most unlikely, that the additional letting value arises out of some action of the tenant.  I say that is most unlikely, because if the increased letting value were due to improvements as defined under the Bill, the tenant would get an allowance for that.  In the majority of cases the increased letting value will have resulted from actions neither of the landlord nor of the tenant.  They will have resulted from the activities of the local authorities or public service companies.  Is it fair, as the Bill proposes, that the entire increase in the letting value arising from such causes should be given to the <Col N="814" /> landlord?  On the other hand, is it fair that the increase in letting value should be given to the tenant?  The Bill proposes that it should be given to the landlord.  One of the effects of that will be that the value of this Bill, restricted as it is in its scope, to tenants who are fortunate enough to come within its scope will be very limited.  They are given the right to a new tenancy undoubtedly under very limited circumstances, but for that new tenancy they will have to pay the highest rent the landlord could expect to get if he was letting the premises to a new tenant on the basis of vacant possession.  Apart from whatever improvements they may have effected, they are getting no consideration from the fact that they have had the long period of occupation required by the Bill, namely, forty years.</P>
    <P>The proposal submitted by Deputy O'Connell, that where the dwellings concerned were let in 1914, the rent under the new tenancy should not exceed the 1914 rent by more than the amount permitted by the Increase of Rents Act, has our sympathy.  That proposal has our sympathy.  The difficulty, however, is that it does not distinguish between the two questions to which I have referred.  It relates to the particular difficulty now existing, and not to the permanent problem, and in permanent legislation it seems particularly undesirable that any special year should be taken as a standard, particularly one so far away as 1914. The ideal solution would be to get this Bill amended on the lines I have suggested, and to deal with the special problem arising out of the shortage of houses by separate legislation, either by continuing the Increase of Rent Acts for another period or by substituting for them similar legislation providing safeguards against profiteering in rent.  The proposal I am submitting means that the increased letting value of the dwelling in any particular case shall be divided equally between the landlord and the tenant.  I have already explained that, if possible, I should like to have found means of giving that increased letting value, or some part of it, to the local authority whose expenditure has probably <Col N="815" /> created it, but I have not been able to find a means.  This amendment is, in my opinion, the next best alternative, and I submit it to the House as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident from the speech of Deputy Lemass that he is not a very enthusiastic supporter of the amendment.  He has made a statement in his opening remarks which I must take the opportunity of contradicting in its entirety.  He has stated, when dealing with increased letting values, that it is most unlikely that these increased letting values arose from the action either of the landlord or of the tenant.  I understood that Deputy Lemass had some experience of business. I understand that when a business man gets an empty business premises, if there is no trade or connection attached to these premises, they are an entirely different entity when he first gets them from what they are after they have been in the hands of a successful business man for a term of years.  I maintain, as far as the increased value of business premises is concerned, that it is due only in a very small way to the action of the public authorities, and that it is due in no way whatever to the action of the landlord.</P>
      <P>The action of the landlord is confined to one thing, the investment of his capital.  It ceases to function otherwise than in the purchase of a house.  The increased letting value of the premises is due to the establishment of a business, the establishment of a trade turn-over, and the establishment of a trader's good-will.  I submit, and I challenge contradiction, that if it were not for the capital that a business man puts into a house, the initiative and enterprise of the businessman, and the money he spends upon advertising and in other ways, the increased letting value of the premises would be entirely negligible as far as public authorities are concerned, and certainly would not be due to the owner of the property.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that Deputy Lemass's statement <Col N="816" /> is contradicted by the report of the Town Tenants' Commission.  The Commission has laid down in its report very clearly one very definite proposition, that in the case of business men there is what they term a compelling equity, which should entitle business men to get different treatment from the treatment which should be meted out to people who occupy ordinary dwelling-houses.  I cannot understand any business man submitting to this House that there is any analogy between the enterprise of a business man and the action of a person living in an ordinary dwelling-house. It is self-evident that a person living in any ordinary dwelling-house does nothing that causes an increase in its value.  It is equally self-evident that the value of a business premises is absolutely due to the enterprise and skill of the business man.  Under this Bill the business man will be entitled to obtain a lease.  The court will be empowered to grant the lease.  I would remind the House that since 1906 and before business town tenants have been suffering from grievous hardships. That fact was recognised as long ago as 1906, and it has been admitted by the Town Tenants' Commission that the 1906 Act has lamentably broken down.  We are proposing under this section of the Bill to remedy wrongs that existed, as far as business tenants are concerned, as long ago as 1906. The question I want to ask the House is this: does this section as it stands in the Bill remove the existing wrongs under which business tenants are at present suffering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make certain submissions in asking the House to consider this sub-section.  The first submission I make is that this sub-section completely ignores the compelling equity to fix a fair rent that has been recommended for business tenants in the report of the Town Tenants' Commission. The next submission I make is that the rent which will be fixed by the court will not be a fair rent, but will be the full competitive letting value of the premises, which will be entirely worthless to any business man.  If a lease is granted by the court at the full competitive letting value of a business premises, so far as the <Col N="817" /> business man is concerned' that lease is entirely valueless.  I want the House to realise one thing which it is very prone to forget, that under the Act of 1906 a business man was entitled to compensation for loss of good-will and disturbance, and that under this Bill that compensation is removed, that he is entitled to nothing but the right to obtain a new lease.  If that lease is valueless, will the position of the business man under this Bill be better or worse than it was under the Act of 1906?  I make another submission: that under the section as it now stands the door will be open to unscrupulous landlords to bring bogus offers of rent into court and to compel the court automatically to fix what I can only term as rack rents.</P>
    <P>I have made these submissions to the Minister inside and outside the House. I want to inform the House that the submissions which I now make are not my own personal submissions alone, are not my own personal interpretation of the existing sub-section.  I have had the advantage of consulting the legal members who sit on this side of the House, and each of these members whom I have consulted has confirmed in every particular the submissions which I now make.  I say, without hesitation, that if this section of the Bill is forced through the House unamended it will have dangerous repercussion upon the permanency of the Government and upon the stability of the Government Party.  Some people may think I am going very far. I think I know my Dublin as well as anybody else and what the business people of Dublin are thinking.  I happen to be a businessman who understands this question from the practical view-point and the practical angle, and I know what I am speaking about.  The Press has even appealed to the Minister to improve this section of the Bill in a reasonable way, but up to the moment he has remained admant and the Party machine will be brought into play if the position of the Minister remains unchanged to force this section through the House.  The Minister is in control of the Bill and perhaps he is the better judge of the two, but there will be no Party machine in <Col N="818" /> operation when the Government goes to the country.</P>
    <P>In the section we are now discussing we have reached the kernel of the Bill, namely, the fixation of a fair rent.  If the lease granted by the court fixes such an annual rent that it does not constitute a fair rent, then this is a worthless Bill.  Coming to the section as it stands, and speaking as a practical businessman with some little knowledge of the law, I have no hesitation in stating that this sub-section is entirely worthless to the businessmen of Dublin.  Upon the definition of a fair rent this whole Bill depends; the rest is merely details and a filling in of the whole, and on the definition of a fair rent in this section the court will be bound to act.  What are the fundamental principles embodied in this section of the Bill on which the court will find what is to be a fair rent?  The first is that the court will be bound to conclude that a fair rent is that particular rent which is in the opinion of the court what &ldquo;a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for such tenement, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given.&rdquo;  In the original section the words &ldquo;normal competition&rdquo; are incorporated.  The criticism these two words have received in the House evidently forced the Minister to change his mind, and I think he has an amendment on the Paper to remove these words from the Bill.  But the first question we ask with regard to this very important section of the Bill is this: What does an incoming tenant pay, and what pay does he obtain on the basis of vacant possession of a business premises where goodwill and trade turnover have been established?  He obtains (1) vacant possession of those premises for which he pays; (2) an established business or trade turnover of the occupying tenant, for which he does not pay a single halfpenny, and (3) the trade fixtures which are useless to the tenant dispossessed, and for which he pays nothing.  This section as it now stands will operate in such a way that the trade turnover of the existing tenant will be placed in the hands of the landlord as a whip to extract a high rack <Col N="819" /> rent from the tenant in occupation. And if the tenant in occupation wishes to retain possession of these premises upon which his livelihood depends he will be forced to pay that rent or give up possession.  I want the House again to mark that if the lease is worthless to the tenant, he will not obtain under this Bill the thing he obtained, however inadequately, under the Act of 1906, that is, compensation for disturbance or loss of goodwill.  He gets nothing under this Bill for these.</P>

      <P>Has the Deputy read the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes: I know he will get nothing except in a very uncertain or reserved way&mdash;in a certain set of conditions, but in normal conditions he will get nothing under this Bill.  What is the position there as far as a business man in occupation of premises with a trade turnover to-day is concerned? He is tied to the one business premises, while the landlord has all the competition of the Irish Free State behind him, and not alone has he the competition of the Irish Free State behind him, and not alone has potential tenant he may require for these premises, and he has the competition of the English invaders who are competing for the retail trade in this country, and the tenant is confined to this one premises where he has established his good-will and which is the main source of his living.  In my opinion, the words in the Bill, &ldquo;on the basis of vacant possession&rdquo; can only be described as outrageous.  They defeat every equitable principle of law and they coerce the court to fix the annual rent at such a figure that if they had reasonable freedom they would never fix it.  That is so much for the rent that the incoming tenant will be prepared to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is self evident that if a tenant is after a valuable premises in an important street in the City of Dublin he can afford to offer a much higher rent for it than the tenant in occupation. Now let us inquire, under this valuable section of the Bill the Meredith definition of what is a fair rent&mdash;what a willing lessor will accept. There can be no hesitation in stating that we know what a willing lessor <Col N="820" /> will accept.  We know what they have been accepting for business premises in Dublin for the past three or four years.  We know that the moment a lease expires, and a business premises falls into the hands of the landlord his first act is to double, and in some cases to treble, and, in many cases, quadruple the existing rent.  I wonder how any farmer listening to me would feel if the rent of his holding were doubled, trebled or quadrupled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known in the City of Dublin business premises which have been kept idle for a period of four or five years, and for what reason?  Was it that there were not tenants available?  That is not the reason.  The reason was because the landlord could not obtain an exorbitant rent.  I can state another fact that cannot be contradicted by any member of this House, and that is for the last four or five years the ratepayers of Dublin have been losing annually a sum of £15,000 per annum by way of rates on vacant premises in the city. And this is the section introduced by the Minister to remedy the existing evil under which business men suffer. I now come to what, in my opinion, is the most harmful characteristic of the whole section, and that is the opportunity for a bogus offer of rent by an unscrupulous tenant.  Under the Bill as the section now stands, if the landlord goes into court and submits an offer in writing stating that a person is willing to pay an amount stated in that particular document then, in my opinion, and in the opinion of other legal men of this House, the court will be almost bound to fix the fair rent on the figure stated by the landlord in court.  Let us assume a tenant is paying £100 a year and one of those bogus offers is placed before the court by the landlord for £300 or £350 a year, what position in the interpretation of the section as it now stands will the court be in in the fixation of a fair rent?  The terms of the section are perfectly mandatory.  The court is bound in the mandatory words: &ldquo;What a willing lessee not in occupation will give ... on the basis of vacant possession and what a willing lessor will accept.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> All I can say, as far as the section is concerned, is that it is utterly worthless and absolutely unacceptable to the business men of this city. Under the section, as it now stands, what will the business men receive under the terms of their new leases? They will receive a letting at the full competitive letting value of the premises. Is there any need to introduce a Bill for them to obtain that?  Is it necessary to come to the Dáil for an Act for a business man to obtain a lease from his landlord at the increased letting value to-day?  If that is the Minister's solution he will never go down in history as the man who solved that particular problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister that the Chamber of Commerce a short time ago drew serious attention to the decline in the trade turnover of the City of Dublin.  The published dividends of firms engaged in business in Dublin are available to members of this House.  The serious economic condition of traders is reflected in these dividends.  How many firms to-day are able to pay 10 per cent.?  I venture to say that you can count them on certainly the fingers of two hands.  How many are paying five per cent.?  How many are paying dividends by drawing money from reserve, and how many have completely exhausted their reserve? I do not want to draw any incorrect picture of the economic position of business men in the country at present.  What I say is if the same rents under this Bill are going to be inflicted on them, then it would be better if this Bill were never introduced.</P>
    <P>A short time ago this House introduced the Dublin Poor Relief Bill. What was the effect on the business men of the passage of that Bill?  What proportion of the Dublin Poor Relief Bill was paid by people engaged in trade and commerce, and how does that compare with professional men or men in other walks of life?  Any one conversant with Dublin knows that for the one pound paid by the rest of the community the Dublin men engaged in industry are paying four to five pounds.  I want the Minister to be <Col N="822" /> fair in dealing with the business men of the city.  We want no confiscation of the rights of the landlord.  We want him to obtain a reasonable return on his invested capital, and we want the business man to obtain a fair rent, a rent that is fair to the tenant and fair to the landlord.</P>
    <P>The sub-section I asked the Minister to introduce is entirely free from the pitfalls I have submitted to the consideration of this House.  Due regard is paid to the interests of the landlord on the one hand, and of the tenant on the other.  The court must pay due regard to the lettings in the immediate vicinity and to the other terms of the tenancy.  There is a clear recognition of the rights of the owners of property. The only safeguarding of the tenants' interest is in the words &ldquo;without regard to good-will.&rdquo;  That is a perfectly simple and unambiguous section, the interpretation of which only needs common sense, for the section set out in the original Bill is a section that I do not think the courts or anyone in the land can say what its logical meaning amounts to.  I ask the Minister with the greatest possible deference and respect, to give the business tenants in this city, and the country generally, a reasonable chance under this Bill.  If this section of the Bill is forced through the House as it stands, I for one, although I sit on the Government Benches, will go into the division lobby to vote against its passage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne is taking full advantage of a very difficult problem to make political capital out of it.  I cannot see that there is an enormous amount of difference between his amendment and the original terms of the Bill, for this reason&mdash;that houses in the ordinary course fall vacant and will be subject to the vicissitudes of gambling conditions of shops in the City of Dublin.  We know that people will take shops at a very high rent.  If in a particular vicinity two or three shops fall vacant and are taken at high rents then the judge must take up exactly the same position in forming a judgment, according to the amendment of Deputy Byrne, as he would if the terms of the Bill remained the same, because the thing which conditions the general <Col N="823" /> price of shops in the ordinary course falling vacant is what a willing lessee would give.  We all agree with Deputy Byrne that the present situation is bad from the point of view of the shopkeeper and the trader and our attitude is that the only thing to do under present circumstances, unless you can pass very radical legislation, which Deputy Byrne has not advocated or shown any sign of it in his amendment, is to try to split the difference and check competition on the trader so that at least fifty per cent. will be taken off the increase and the trader will get the benefit.</P>
      <P>It is a small point.  It might be better to leave the matter of the willing lessor and the willing lessee out of the original Act and make it the price which is given in the vicinity.  There is not much difference in it.  I admit that would be better, and even if that is done we contend we should go a step further, that the increase in the old rent should be split by half and that the trader should get the benefit. Most of the opinions of Deputy Byrne have the full support of a large volume of opinion and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the limitation as we have put it for him.</P>

      <P>When we approached this problem of dealing with fair rents it seemed to us that the main difficulty that would face the court would be the phrase in paragraph (f) &ldquo;in circumstances of normal competition.&rdquo; Having regard to the circumstances that exist in regard to the housing problem, and the abnormal shortage which, so far as one can see, will exist for a considerable time, it seemed necessary to have some standard to fall back upon.  The standard which we thought would be fair is the standard laid down in the Increase of Rent (Restrictions) Act.  At first I thought that the position in August, 1914, should be the standard, but I quite agree that other considerations have to be taken into account, so we put down an amendment that the standard should be that set up under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  As far as I can follow the amendment moved <Col N="824" /> by Deputy Lemass there is not much difference between his suggestion and mine, because he is prepared to give a certain proportion of the letting value to the landlord and a certain proportion to the tenant.  I think that is inherent in my amendment, because the landlord gets a certain increase under the Increase of Rent Act.  There is not a vital difference between us.  There is a good deal in the objection that Deputy Lemass raised, that this is a permanent measure while the Increase of Rent Act is a temporary one.  The objection raised in other quarters is that anything tending to perpetuate the Increase of Rent Act would be a great discouragement to the speculative builder.  I wonder if anyone in this House or any substantial body of opinion outside sees any future in this country for the speculative builder. Candidly I do not.  I do not believe, no matter what legislation is passed here, that there will be any big development by what were known before the war as speculative builders.  I do not think we need pay too much attention to that aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass stated that the amendment took no regard of houses built after 1914.  As far as my information goes, the greater number of houses affected would be those built before 1914.  The number of houses built and rented, and liable to be built and rented in future, will, in my opinion, be comparatively small compared with the number of houses built before 1914.  I do not pretend to have made a close examination of the matter, but the information I have is that the vast majority of the houses now rented were built before 1914.  It seemed to us that that would be the way to approach the question in order to get some reliable standard.  I agree with the other Deputies that the proposal in the Bill will lead to a great deal of difficulty and to any amount of litigation.  If the section is left as it is I feel certain that in the vast majority of cases it is going to work out to the detriment of the tenant and that the landlord will profit by the abnormal conditions and the shortage of houses, conditions with which he had nothing to do.  A landlord is entitled to a fair return for the capital <Col N="825" /> he has invested, but he is entitled to no more.  If the section is left as it is he will get a much bigger return because of the shortage of houses. My amendment and that of Deputy Lemass are the same in principle, and I do not propose to press mine if the Deputy's is accepted, or if something along the same lines is put into the Bill.  I am definitely opposed to this paragraph in the section.  It is so vague that it will lead to endless litigation and, from its construction and implication, it seems to me that a tenant will be made to pay for the artificial shortage that has been created owing to the drop in the number of houses built or available since the war years.  Perhaps the amendment moved by Deputy Lemass would be more applicable to general legislation. If I thought that amendment was acceptable I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>Might I point out a defect in Deputy O'Connell's amendment? All it does is to fix a maximum rent with regard to houses built prior to the 4th August, 1914, and it gives the court no standard on which to base a rent, except merely the maximum. The system of fixing rents laid down in this section is not to be applicable under the amendment to houses built prior to the 4th August, 1914.  Does the Deputy follow me?</P>

      <P>I think a very considerable amount of this discussion has been due to the fact that the definition of gross rent contained in paragraph (f) has not been very <Col N="826" /> carefully or fully examined by the Deputies who spoke, or, if fully examined, full value has not been given to every word contained in the definition. Let us take it as it stands.  &ldquo;The gross rent shall be the rent which in the opinion of the court a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and the willing lessor would take for such tenement, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and in circumstances of normal competition, and having regard to the other terms of such tenancy and to the letting values...&rdquo; I have an amendment to leave out the words &ldquo;in circumstances of normal competition&rdquo; because they crept in there in error; and then it runs on &ldquo;...of tenements of a similar character to and situate in the vicinity of such tenement but without regard to any goodwill which may exist in respect of such tenement.&rdquo; In the first place the court decides what a willing lessee not already in occupation would give.  It is not what a tenant in occupation at the present moment would be willing to give rather than to be put out.  It is what a willing lessee not already in occupation would be willing to give and what a willing lessor, that is, an ordinary person who is anxious to let his house and who is not looking for the last penny, would be willing to take.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne got very strong on those words &ldquo;on the basis of vacant possession being given.&rdquo;  Of course you can only assess a rent on the basis of vacant possession being given.  What is the alternative to vacant possession?  I cannot see any alternative to vacant possession. It means that the tenant is going into possession.  If you leave out those words or put in words to the contrary it would mean that he would be a tenant who was not in occupation, and that is not a basis to which you would look forward.  You must have either the basis of vacant possession, or somebody else in occupation. Obviously the rent is to be the rent which a person is going to pay <Col N="827" /> when going into occupation.  This is not a letting to a middleman, it is a letting to a tenant who is in occupation. &ldquo;In circumstances of normal competition.&rdquo;  Those words are the very words which deal with the present circumstances.  The court must make every allowance under these words &ldquo;for any shortage that exists at the present moment.&rdquo;  If there is any abnormal shortage now, and everybody admits there is, in reference to houses the court will take that into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be assumed that it was for houses in general.  Circumstances of normal competition must mean for houses in general.  If the Deputy has any difficulty about the words being open to that meaning actually, I possibly might expand the words &ldquo;normal competition.&rdquo;  But normal competition is precisely what I think the plain meaning is.  If there was a reasonable supply of houses to go round, and a reasonable supply of tenants looking for them what is the rent that you would fix?  That is what is meant by it.  The Deputy is aware that the words are taken from the Report of the Town Tenants Commission. It is perfectly obvious what the Town Tenants Commission means, and I think this does convey this meaning accurately.  I would be perfectly willing to expand the words, so that that meaning would be more clearly conveyed, but I am standing on the general principle that it should be, if there was not an abnormal shortage, what a reasonable landlord would be willing to take, and what a reasonable tenant would be willing to give, if <Col N="828" /> there were a fair number of houses to be let, and a fair number of tenants looking for them.  By fair I mean a reasonable number.</P>
      <P>I submit to the House that that is probably the real basis.  I have expanded the definition, however, by saying &ldquo;and to the letting value of tenements of a similar character in the same vicinity&rdquo;; that is to give the court a little further help in fixing the rent.  The court will look to two things &mdash;first, what is actually happening, and second, how much the rent given for houses in the neighbourhood is due to abnormal competition.  I come now to examine the first of the amendments which have been put forward. Deputy Byrne's amendment would be rather cruel to the tenants.  His speech was entirely to the effect that he is afraid that there should be lettings at full competitive letting value.  There will not be under the section as it stands, because the full competitive letting value would be what the house goes to now.  The Deputy spoke about what is happening at the present moment in Dublin&mdash;that rents have been quadrupled.  I will not go into that now, but I say that rents which are being fixed now are, in the first place, as high as the landlords can possibly get.  But there may be rents fixed now where the landlord is getting the very maximum that he can get owing to the fact of abnormal competition, and at the same time he is getting the letting value.  That would be full competitive value.  But under this Bill he will get nothing of the kind.  He can only get what a willing lessee would give in circumstances of normal competition and without any regard to the goodwill of the tenant.  Deputy Byrne's amendment says &ldquo;the gross rent shall be the rent which may be fixed by the court, having regard to the letting value of tenements of a similar character in the immediate vicinity.&rdquo;  That allows the whole competitive value of the house, apart from goodwill.  If a landlord is letting a house he is getting the maximum rent he can.  What is the letting value of one house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking amendment 71 first.  I am going to deal with the others afterwards.  Take that amendment 71 which, instead of being helpful to the tenant, would actually, by deleting the words &ldquo;in circumstances of normal competition,&rdquo; force the court to fix the rent at the very maximum rent which houses would carry in the neighbourhood. Take the next amendment, which is Deputy O'Connell's.  I could not dream of accepting Deputy O'Connell's amendment because this is a permanent measure, and to take the artificial standard say like that of 4th August, 1914, would, I think, be terribly unfair to everybody.  You must look at what are the values of the premises now.</P>
      <P>Some houses are let at a very high rent, and others at a low rent. Circumstances have altered enormously since then.  To say that for all time the rent shall be what it was on a particular day, whether it is August, 1914 or any other time, would be an unfair basis, and would not do justice as between landlord and tenant. It is purely an artificial fixing.  I have got this much sympathy with Deputy O'Connell; if we could have some sort of rule of thumb by which these rents could be fixed I would like it very much; if there would be no necessity for going into court I would like it very much.  But I do not see any rule of thumb by which you can fix ordinary rents of ordinary premises. I think you must consider every single case on its own merits, and decide the value of each premises taken by itself as a single unit, having some regard to the letting value of similar houses in the same neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>Of course, I might point out, in passing, as far as Deputy Byrne's amendment is concerned it might be no standard at all, because there might not be a house of a similar character in the immediate vicinity.  It is quite likely that you would be letting a particularly large premises, and that there would be nothing except very small premises within a half a mile of it.  You may not be able to apply that standard at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to make argument in favour of his amendment I am sure we will all listen to him with great pleasure. I will take Deputy Lemass's amendment, No. 75.  I think here Deputy Lemass goes very much upon a false issue, because he assumes, as far as I can gather, that in every case there would be an increase of rent.  I do not agree with him there at all.  I think there are houses at the present time that are let at too high rents. It is quite possible in a neighbourhood where rents are falling.  I know that this is met by the second part of Deputy Lemass's amendment.  He visualises that.  But there are other cases in which the rents will rise, and it does not follow that they will rise owing to the action of the Urban Council or the Dublin Corporation, or anything of that nature.  It may be purely adventitious.  More people may be coming into a particular country town and it may raise the value of the premises very much, while people going out might lessen the value very much. There is another circumstance which depends neither upon the landlord nor the tenant.  This is a positive example. Suppose you have premises let in the year 1890 for £50 a year.  You come into court, and let me say that the rent is fixed at £60, giving a substantial increase.  The Deputy would say it ought only to be £55.  The rent in 1890 may have been very low, and some houses might be let more cheaply than others.  Also there is a very big difference in monetary value now compared <Col N="831" /> with 1890.  As everybody knows, there was a distinct alteration in money value immediately after the Boer War.  There was a small decrease in money value after the Boer War, and it has become enormous since the Great War.</P>
      <P>Nobody, for instance, would say that an income of £30 a year in 1890 was in any way equal to an income of £30 now.  It was a far greater income in 1890 than now.  The purchasing power of money has fallen enormously, and it does seem to me in fixing rent it is only fair that the alteration in the value of money should be taken into account.  There are a great number of other circumstances, and therefore I cannot see why, if the court give due regard to the present shortage of houses in fixing rents, it could not allow any value because there is a scarcity of houses.  I think we have taken a perfectly safe and fair line, but you might be very unfair in certain cases if you accepted Deputy Lemass's amendment.  It would mean that where, owing to the alteration in the value of money or other circumstances, a small increase is given, the landlord is not to get the full value of the increase.  That does not appear to be fair and, after all, I venture to think that the whole House is endeavouring to do justice between the landlord and the tenant.  We have been putting our heads together as well as we can to achieve that end, and I do not think it would be just in all circumstances that the landlord would only get half of the increased value when actually he might be entitled to the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that point I would like to say a few words. It is undoubtedly true that the value of money has decreased since the rent of £50 was fixed, but the Minister's proposal is based on the assumption that the value of money is going to remain at the present level.  The tendency is in the opposite direction.  The value of money is increasing.  It would be unfair and a hardship on the tenant to fix a rent when the value of money <Col N="832" /> was increasing, so that it is not really possible to legislate with any fluctuations in the value of money in view.</P>
      <P>As to whether it is fair or not to the landlord that this increase should be halved, the Minister made reference to various causes which might create an increase.  I only mentioned an increase due to the activities of a local authority as an example.  The other possible causes of that increase to which the Minister referred might also be taken into account.  Should the entire increase be given to the landlord if more people are coming into a country town or for some other reason arising out of the community as a whole, but not arising out of any action of the landlord?  Why should the entire increase be given to the landlord? Why should the benefit not be given the tenant?  That question might be asked.  We propose to split the difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you had two houses some distance away belonging to the same landlord; one house has gone up in value and the other has gone down.  You would allow the landlord to bear the whole loss in the case of the house that is gone down, but he would not be allowed to get the whole value in the case of the house that has gone up.  That does not seem to be quite fair.  One tenant would be paying a higher rent than the other.</P>

Another tenant enters a house that has increased by £10 a year in value and he only pays £5 of the increase.

      <P>The real value of the words, as they stand, lies in this, that in a very short time a fair rent would be fixed in a town and what the court has fixed as a fair rent in one premises will be a guide for the landlord and the tenant for every other premises.  If it is known that the letting value will be, in a very short time, the rent fixed by the court, I think that will guide landlord and tenant and guide them so much that it will help very much to keep them out of court.  I think that is the real value of these words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 76:</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (h) to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where allowances for improvements have been duly made in the determination of the gross rent by the court, and the rent so determined exceeds the rent payable under the terms of the previous tenancy, the rent payable under the terms of the new tenancy by the occupying tenant shall not exceed by more than half the rental which such occupying tenant paid under the terms of the previous tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to limit the amount of the increase of rent that can, under the power of the court, be imposed upon a tenant.  A moment or two ago the Minister referred to the factors which would operate in the fixation of <Col N="837" /> a fair rent, and one particular factor to which he referred was the reduced value of money.  I am in complete agreement that that factor is going to operate in a very important way in the view of the court in whatever particular rent it may fix.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that money has been steadily appreciating in value for some considerable time.  That appreciation in the value of money is likely to increase. Another aspect of the question that has to be taken into consideration is that the rents now being paid by most of the traders are being paid with the greatest possible difficulty. Rates and taxes have gone up considerably and this imposition represents to the business man almost a second rent.  What the business men are anxious to obtain is not confiscation of the property rights of the landlord. They have capital invested themselves and they recognise that where capital is invested there must be a reasonable return upon that investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in dealing with the present section of the Bill, referred to the fact that under the Act there may be considerable rent reduction. A business man in this House who is running a business premises and expects a reduction of rent under this Act can only be termed either a cheerful optimist or a cheerful idiot.  With one solitary exception I do not know of a street in this city where letting values have depreciated.  I know only of one single street in which that has occurred and I have no hesitation whatever in saying that in 97 per cent. of the cases of rent fixation that will take place under this Bill there will be a substantial increase of rent.  That will be granted under the new leases in court.  Business men are perfectly willing to pay a reasonable rent.  They are perfectly willing to take into consideration the depreciated value of money.  They recognise that the depreciated value of money affects landlords in just the same way as it affects business men.</P>
    <P>Under this section there is no limitation to the amount of the increase of rent which a tenant may be forced to pay.  My amendment limits the increase <Col N="838" /> of rent to fifty per cent.  The Minister referred to one fact, and that was that a letting that was made, say, in 1890, may have been a letting made when the rent was exceedingly low.  If the Minister is willing to accept the principle of a limitation to the increased rent that will be fixed as a fair rent by the court I am willing to meet him in every conceivable way&mdash;if he will only accept the principle that there must be some limitation as to where this increase begins and where it will end.  I submit that if a tenant is paying £100 per year by way of rental and power is given to the court to increase that by 50 per cent., that means £150 per year, and that is a reasonable allowance on the one hand for the depreciated value of money, and to the business man on the other hand.  But, under the section, business men do not know where they are and what rent they will be asked to pay.  That is a very serious position for them, and one that they face with very grave doubt and misgivings.</P>
    <P>I may be told that the incorporation in the Bill of a limitation to the amount of the increase of rent that the court could impose may more or less be looked upon by the court as a direction for a general all round increase of rent.  But business men have had such sad experience in the past, that they look forward to no limitation in the amount of the increase of future rents with the very greatest possible misgiving. As I pointed out, 97 per cent. of the business premises in the city are going to have their rents increased under this Bill.  I submit to the Minister the difficulty which a business man will be under to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the rents in his immediate vicinity have so steeply climbed, taken in conjunction with depreciation in the value of money, that he will be entitled not to receive a lease with an increase of rent, but a lease with a large decrease of rent.  In my opinion, it is almost a thing that one with common sense cannot possibly visualise.  One has got to take into account certain factors existing to-day. The competition that the retail trade has now to face in Dublin is just as <Col N="839" /> keen as it was previously in what is termed the wholesale trade.  We have now an invasion of English retailers and English multiple shops, and every one of these shops has sent up rents rapidly.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment there would be a limitation to the increase of rent which a tenant will be forced to pay. The business man has two alternatives. He has either to take this permitted increase of fifty per cent. as a limit to the power of the court or the section as it stands without limitation.  In my opinion the greatest possibility exists that the rent fixed by the court may be fixed at a figure that would render the granting of a lease entirely valueless to a business man.  That is a very serious danger, and I ask the consideration and help of the Minister to guard against it.</P>
    <P>There are certain sections in the community who do not regard business men as useful members of society.  A common term for business men is &ldquo;profiteeers,&rdquo; but, speaking with inside knowledge, I can assure the House that business men have the greatest possible difficulty in meeting existing rents.  Although they are willing to pay a reasonable increase of rent, they cannot regard with equanimity the power of the court to double or treble the rent, if the court so thinks fit.  I would also draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, in addition to the powers for increasing the rent under the Bill that the court possesses, the court may require the expenditure of a capital sum by way of improvement or permanent repairs or something in the nature of a fine. Is the Minister taking into consideration that very important concession to the property owners?  The court may also order the postponement of a new tenancy until the repairs are carried out.  Is that not a very valuable concession to the property owner?  What concession is given to the tenant?  The business tenant actually does not know where he is.  I want the Minister to bear in mind that the granting of a new lease to a business tenant is the only concession under this Bill, while under the Act of 1906 there was compensation for disturbance and loss of <Col N="840" /> good-will.  There is no such compensation under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I also ask the House to remember that most business men have been in occupation of their premises for an exceedingly long period.  Take a business man in possession of a house for twenty or twenty-five years, which is no uncommon thing in Dublin. What return by way of rental will that business man have made to the landlord?  Will he not have paid the landlord back more than twice the original price of the premises?  There ought to be some limit to the amount of the increase the business man will be asked to pay.  I have already submitted that the increased value of business premises is due to the investment of the capital of the business man, to the enterprise of the business man, who may have spent considerable sums of money in advertising, and in other ways to create a trade turnover in the premises.  All these factors should be taken into consideration by the Minister.  I submit that it is equitable that there should be some limitation to the increase of rent the business tenant will have to pay. If the Minister is willing to accept the principle, I shall not boggle about words.  I have put down fifty per cent.  If there are exceptional cases where exceedingly old rentals prevail, if the Minister is willing to accept the principle of the amendment, he can easily insert certain words so that complete justice will be done to the landlord in exceptional cases.  I ask the Minister to give some help to the business men of this city.  I am not painting any untrue picture when I say that at present most of the business men have the greatest possible difficulty in paying the existing rents and when they are asked, under this Bill, as they will undoubtedly be asked, to pay an increased rent, it will mean that the greater proportion of them will certainly be put out of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons which I stated a few moments ago when dealing with Deputy Lemass's amendment, I cannot accept this amendment.  Deputy Byrne has said a great deal about what an advantage <Col N="841" /> the landlord gets under this Bill by necessity of the tenant having to put the place in repair, but surely the person who gains by putting the place in repair is the tenant.  He is the occupier of the premises; no doubt these repairs give greater security to the landlord.  It is better security to the landlord than if the house was not in a good state of repair, but surely the person who has gained most is the tenant, who has the full advantage of these repairs.  However, that does not seem to be completely relevant to this particular amendment.  What happens here is the court calls upon the Commissioner for Valuation to make a valuation of the house.  That is one of the guiding principles on which the court goes, and that rents, as Deputy Byrne seems to be afraid, are going to jump up by half or anything like that is a situation that I do not visualise at all, and I am perfectly certain it will not happen.  The general principle on which I stand is that the court, dealing fairly as between landlord and tenant, should not be restricted in its fair dealing between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the action of the Minister in associating this amendment with mine.  I do not think there is any similarity between them at all.  Mine is a sensible amendment. Deputy Byrne apparently thinks that where a tenant was paying £50 a year, and the gross rent, as calculated under paragraph (f), minus the allowance in respect of improvements, is fixed at £60, because there has been that increase of £10 the court should be permitted to fix an increase of £25.  That is the purpose of his amendment.  If the old rent was £50, the gross rent, minus allowance for improvement, is £60, the court is given discretion to fix the rent at £75.  That is an amendment apparently brought in in the interests of the tenants, according to Deputy Byrne.  I do not think the tenants will be the least bit obliged to Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (h) to insert after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; line 20, the words &ldquo;save where the landlord was, under the conditions of the previous tenancy, liable for repairs and failed to execute them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (h) provides that the court may, as one of the terms of the new tenancy under the Act, require the tenant to expend specified sums on repairs, including painting and decorating. It is possible that the necessity for that expenditure may arise out of the default of the landlord if the landlord is liable under the terms of the old tenancy for such repairs.  The amendment is designed to protect the <Col N="843" /> tenant in such a case and to provide that the court may not require him to expend the sum if the landlord is responsible for the repair of the premises under the old tenancy.  It is quite possible that the landlord may default and that the tenement may not be in fit repair on the day the new tenancy is granted, and that the court may put upon the tenant the responsibility of expending a certain sum of money to meet the default of the landlord.  I do not think that that is fair and the purpose of my amendment is to prevent that.  I ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept it in the form I propose it, at least to agree that there is something there to be safeguarded. I ask him to undertake to consider the matter, and to devise an amendment of his own to meet the position.</P>

      <P>Certain representations have been made to me which I think are well-founded, that in the case of certain tenants landlords do not execute repairs that they have covenanted to do, that the only thing they could do is to go to the court and get an order compelling the landlord to carry out his repairs. That is an expensive and difficult procedure for the tenant to adopt.  On representations made to me I have ready, for the Report Stage, an amendment which will enable the tenant, where the landlord after notice does not carry out the repairs, to carry out the repairs himself and to charge the landlord for them.  I need not go into the actual wording of the amendment now.  Deputies will see it on the Report Stage.  It is not quite the same as Deputy Lemass's amendment, but I think it really carries out what appears to me to be the real grievances which the tenants have where the landlord does not keep his part of the bargain.</P>

      <P>The tenant will have to serve notice on the landlord pointing out the condition of the premises.  Of course, repairs are different from improvements.  He will have to point out to the landlord, for instance, that the roof is leaking, and the landlord has covenanted to keep it in repair.  If the landlord does not do anything, at present as a remedy he would have to get an injunction to compel the landlord to put the roof into repair.  My amendment simply proposes that he will serve notice on the landlord to the effect maybe that the roof is in a hopeless state and request him to repair it.  If the landlord does not carry out the repairs the tenant can carry them out himself, but we can debate the actual words when we come to them later on.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5), line 55, to delete the words &ldquo;at the request of a party.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think what the Deputy had in mind in putting down this amendment had relation in sub-section (1) of that section. It states that the court may and if so requested by either party shall cause to be sent to the Commissioner of Valuation a request for valuation; that is, the court, of its own volition, must ask for a valuation if so requested by either party.  Section 5 would seem to imply that where the request is sent to the court itself, as it is entitled to do by sub-section (1), it need have no regard whatsoever to the valuation furnished by the Commissioner. In Section 24, where something of the same kind of principle is involved with regard to the valuation by the Commissioner in regard to compensation, it seems to be very much stronger.  The court shall be bound by the several estimates and statements contained in the valuation unless the court for reasons shall declare such valuation to be erroneous <Col N="847" /> in law and fact.  It does not seem to be clear on the face of this why it is only when the valuation is made at the request of a party that the court is even expected to have regard to the valuation submitted. It may ask for a valuation, but then it may disregard it completely without giving any reason.</P>

      <P>I am willing to accept this amendment.  I do not think that it makes any real alteration in the meaning of the section.  As the section stood, the court might send for and receive a report from the Commissioner of Valuation; in that case the court might send for it, but the court need not have regard to it.  In the other cases where the parties or either of them wish to have a report it is then that the court should have regard to it.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where a tenancy in a tenement is terminated and the estate or interest of the tenant of such tenement under such tenancy was immediately before such termination subject to a mortgage or charge for securing money, such mortgage or charge shall extend and attach to any compensation under this Act which shall become payable to such tenant in respect of such termination.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where compensation under this Act is payable to a tenant and the landlord or superior landlord by whom such compensation is so payable has notice of a mortgage or charge which by virtue of this section or otherwise affects such compensation, such landlord or superior landlord shall either&mdash;</P>

    <P>(4)  Where compensation under this Act is paid into court under this section the court may, on the application of any person interested, make such order in regard to such compensation as justice may require.</P>
    <P>This deals with the question where a tenancy was mortgaged and any compensation under this Act is payable. It makes provision that where the tenant consents such compensation shall be paid to the mortgagee; where the mortgagee consents he will pay such compensation to the tenant; where the mortgagee and such tenant so direct, pay such compensation to the mortgagee and such tenant in such manner as is so directed; or where no such consent or direction as is mentioned in this sub-section is given, pay such compensation into court.  It is obvious that if premises are mortgaged the really substantial beneficial interest in the premises belongs very largely to the mortgagee, and it is only right that he should receive the moneys which are due to him by the tenant on the holding.  The tenant receives compensation for his interests in the holding and it shall be payable to the mortgagee.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In this Part of this Act, the expression Proprietary Lease or Proprietary Agreement, means a lease complying with all the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such lease is a sub-lease (whether mediate or immediate) under a building lease, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the land demised by such lease is the whole or part of the land comprised in such building lease, and</P>
      <P>(c)  such lease is made for a term expiring at the same time as, or not more than one year before the expiration of such building lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment to a very important section.  As the section stands it seems to me that on the expiration of a building lease the ground landlord will be bound to grant a reversionary lease to the holder of the sub-lease, except in certain cases on what would be found in practice to be the old rent.  That is not done at the moment.  He will be bound to grant a lease to the holder of the building lease except a sub-lease called in this section a proprietary lease.  That <Col N="856" /> is made with certain conditions.  Two of these conditions are specified in the Bill, that the sub-lease must have been made for a period of 31 years, and accompanied by a fine of at least 25 times the ground rent.  I contend that will mean in practice that in almost all cases the occupying tenant will not be the person who will get the lease, but it will be someone that I might call the middleman who will be entitled to get that lease although he had made a contract perhaps with the occupying tenant to the effect that the occupying tenant on payment of a considerable sum of money should be entitled to what we take it to be all the rights of the middleman at the time.  I mean to the rights of the middleman in many cases.  I do not say that this applies in all cases; but it seems to me in these sections we are trying to meet a variety of cases by one enactment and in so doing we are bound to decide unjustly for certain types of those cases.  A few cases will be those where the original builder, the owner of the bricks and mortar, is still in possession of the building lease and this section is probably drafted with special attention to his rights, but they are a comparatively small proportion of the actual cases.  In most cases the owner of the bricks and mortar will have sold to someone else and that someone else will have sold to someone else and that may have gone on for a variety of times before you can come down to the actual owner of the building lease at the time that lease falls in.</P>
    <P>Each of those sales was recognised at the time as the sale of what was virtually a profit rent for a certain number of years.  The seller knew what he was selling and the buyer knew what he was buying.  He paid a price determined by the value of what he was to get out of it.  In England, I understand that in such cases insurance is effected, so that the time the rent falls in a corresponding sum of money will be available, or else the owner of the rents sets aside as a sinking fund a certain portion of the profits each year to meet the amount of his expenditure.  If he does that or if he spends all his money, that is his look-out.  A bargain was made, a definite <Col N="857" /> thing is sold for a definite price with, presumably, the full knowledge of both parties.</P>
    <P>What is now proposed is that unless the person in possession at the time when the reversionary lease is proposed to be given has been in occupation for 31 years and has paid this fine of twenty-five times the profit rent, then instead of his getting what he thought he was getting, the right to the reversion of the lease, that right goes back to the original seller, the seller to him; and instead of this being a Bill to benefit the tenant it will be a measure to establish the middleman in unchallenged possession. The ground landlord is not concerned with this particular section at all.  It is a question between the middleman and the occupying tenant in most cases.  If the section stands as it does at present it is giving to the middleman a greater proportion and it gives him the right to the reversion of the lease instead of giving it to the occupying tenant.  I think we should be doing something which would be a grave injustice to most of the tenants if we were to do that.  I hope we shall find some way before we leave this section to arrive at a just and fair solution as far as the possible difficulties go.</P>
    <P>There are various rights to be considered&mdash;the right of the tenant, the right of the middleman in certain cases and the rights of the ground landlord.  The Bill seems to me to include in the greater proportion of the cases most of those rights for the benefit of the middleman.  To meet those cases or to meet certain cases of the middleman the Bill is drafted, but in order to give the middleman his rights in a small proportion of cases, surely it is not reasonable that we should do what is unjust and unfair and against all reason in the greater proportion of cases.  I contend that that is what the Bill does in its present form.  I will not say any more at the moment until I see precisely the way in which it is met in various parts of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself inclined to support Deputy Thrift in this amendment.  Amendment 89 on the <Col N="858" /> Order Paper embodies our proposal concerning these reversionary leases, but the amendment embodies a common-sense proposal and, therefore, I suppose, will be rejected by the House.  The question for us is to find the next best line of action to take. The question which the Dáil has got to decide is whether it is right the reversionary lease is to be given to the occupying tenant or to the middle-man. The proposal in the Bill is that it be given to the middle-man except in certain conditions.  The proposal in Deputy Thrift's amendment is to give it to the occupying tenant.  As between these two we will come down on the side of the occupying tenant.  I take it that Deputy Thrift's purpose is to eliminate the middle-man in so far as it is possible to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the adoption of this amendment which Deputy Thrift has proposed would mean that this right to the reversion of the lease would go, not to the middle-man, but to the tenant in occupation. We should endeavour, and I think the Minister has expressed his intention of endeavouring, to get as near to the person in occupation as it is possible to get.  The proposal here is to give to the occupying tenant the right of a reversionary lease, if he has a sub-lease for more than 31 years and if he has paid a fine exceeding 25 times the annual rent.  As Deputy Thrift has pointed out, there are quite a number of people who have purchased subleases for a shorter duration than 31 years and for a smaller amount than 25 times the annual rent.  These people thought they were purchasing the middleman's entire interest in the premises concerned, and also purchasing his right to a reversionary lease.  The Bill proposes to deprive them of what they bought and paid for and to restore to the middleman what he had sold.  That seems unfair and unreasonable.  I can find it hard to believe that that was the Minister's intention.  Yet if the Bill goes through unamended that is what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view which I expressed upon the Second Reading, that in the great majority of cases the middleman has <Col N="859" /> no right to a reversionary interest at all, still stands.  In the majority of cases he is a person who has bought a profit rent for a number of years, gets exactly what he paid for, and at the end of a certain number of years he has a right to nothing.  He bought an annuity, he got an annuity, and that leaves him out.</P>
    <P>The ground landlord, as Deputy Thrift pointed out, is not concerned in this.  It is mainly a matter between the middleman and the tenant.  If the Dáil is not prepared to accept our proposal to give that profit to the community to whom it belongs, at least it should give the advantage of the new lease in the terms to be fixed by the Bill to the occupying tenant as against the middleman.  As Deputy Thrift's is the first amendment on the Order Paper and, therefore, will be put first in the Dáil, in anticipation of the defeat of our own amendment, we will support it.</P>

He has told us, and Deputy Lemass has supported the view, that what the buyer of the house bought in fact was merely 25 years', or so many years', profit rent.  That is portion, but only a portion, of what a person purchasing a house has bought in the past.  He has bought so many years' profit rent, but he has also purchased the sporting chance in some cases, and with the definite knowledge in others, that he will, as the owner of the house, get a renewal of the lease.</P>

If I am wrong in that I have nothing further to say.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not, in any circumstances, accept an amendment which will have the effect of confiscating an interest which was created in the property by the original builder, the owner of the bricks and mortar.  There is a great danger in looking at this question from the viewpoint of middlemen and so on, of creating confusion of thought. The term &ldquo;middleman&rdquo; as I understand it, means the owner of the bricks and mortar&mdash;that is, the middleman who has invested his money.  When the lease runs out, I hope this Bill will have the effect of refusing the landlord the right to take over the property as his own creation, or to take the major interest in the property by fixing a new ground rent at a very much higher figure.  I would like the term &ldquo;middleman&rdquo; to be left out. What we have to protect really, and what this amendment would undermine, is that the successor in title to <Col N="861" /> the bricks and mortar who has invested money in the property is obviously the persons who is entitled to a renewal of the lease on fair terms and not at the option of any landlord. The person who has bought a thousand pounds house, a fifteen hundred pounds house, or a two thousand pounds house is the successor in title to the original owner, or the house may have come down from father to son or grandfather to grandson, or even further than that.  The owner of the title is the person who in equity is entitled to a renewal of the title and to a continuation of the enjoyment of the capital which has been invested, and which capital is his property. Deputy Thrift seems to have some other person called by that vague term &ldquo;middleman&rdquo; in his mind.  If there is some difficulty I think a new clause should be put in to meet it, but I hope the Minister will not accept, under any conditions, an amendment which undermines the rights of the property owner.</P>

      <P>This is the first amendment Deputy Thrift ever introduced that I stood up in this House to support. I agree with every word that Deputy Thrift has said.  The House has a choice under this Bill of giving a reversionary lease to one or two people.  Deputy Thrift advocates that those who have a sub-lease should be entitled to a reversionary lease, while on the other hand Deputy Beckett advocates that the successor in title to the purchaser should be in equity and justice entitled to the lease.  If for a moment we would just look at the position as it stands, we have four classes of interests involved.  We have a ground landlord to whom the ground will come back again when the lease has expired, and who under the Act will be bound to grant something up to 150 years of a lease, as Deputy Thrift has said, at a nominal rent, either to the building or the proprietary lease holder.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the intermediate lessees, who are wiped out entirely without any consideration.  These are what <Col N="862" /> are rightly termed &ldquo;middlemen.&rdquo;  We have then the owner of the bricks and mortar, and we have the tenant in occupation. You have four classes&mdash;the owner of the land, the intermediate lessee, the builder of the property, and the tenant in occupation.  Which of these classes is in equity entitled to the reversionary lease?  Under the Bill, one class of middleman will be set up, while another class, the intermediate lessee, will be removed.  Except under the Bill, the term &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; be applied to any person who holds a sub-lease, no matter what sum of money it involved, such persons would be entirely wiped out and the reversionary lease would be given, as Deputy Beckett holds it should be, to the successor of the man who erects the bricks and mortar. Unless the proprietary lessee pays twenty-five times the amount of his annual reserve rent he is wiped out without consideration, or, unless under the Bill he has an interest in the lease for a term of 31 years, expiring at the same time as or not more than two years before the expiration of such lease, he is wiped out without consideration. You are setting up a new middleman.  Is the man who has erected the bricks and mortar entitled to more consideration than the occupying tenant?  Which of the two has the greater equity in the reversionary lease?</P>
    <P>If a builder develops an estate he acquires the land on a building lease generally for a long period&mdash;99 years would be very short and probably it would be 999 years&mdash;and he knows what he is buying.  He gets it at a particularly low rent and develops it by the erection of houses.  At the end of that period the builder of the house, who has undoubtedly performed useful functions, has been amply repaid by the 99 or 999 years' income, as the case may be.  What happens to the occupying tenant?  He is to be placed absolutely at the mercy of the builder. I think that, as the section stands, it can only be regarded as being flagrantly unjust to the occupying tenant.</P>
    <P>If it is not amended the builder will <Col N="863" /> be set up as a new middleman, and I say that the title of the Bill would really be a misnomer.  It is not a Town Tenants Bill, but might rightly be termed &ldquo;The Middleman's Charter.&rdquo; What will happen if the section passes as it stands is that you are going to set up a new middleman as the lord of the manor for 150 years simply because he has erected a house.  I hold that the one vital thing that is necessary for fixity of tenure is the complete elimination of the middleman.  When I appeared before the Town Tenants Commission I stated that the middlemen were a curse on the progress and prosperity of the State.  I said that they had received their pound of flesh and that immediately their interest expired they should automatically disappear, and that there should, as far as possible, be direct relationship between the landlord and the occupying tenant.  I had good reason to make that statement.  I had in mind the case of a middleman who wanted to confiscate the interest in important business premises in the City of Dublin and to evict a tenant without regard to his established trade or good-will. What should be done under the Bill is that there should be a fair division of the appreciable value.  Between whom &mdash;between the man who built the house, the owner of the bricks and mortar, or between the tenant and the landlord?</P>
    <P>The first step, in my opinion, in the amelioration of the town tenants' condition is the complete elimination of the middleman.  Under the Bill, however, we are setting up a new middle-man and giving him a reversionary lease for 150 years.  There has been a certain practice growing in well-managed estates.  It has been dealt with in the Report of the Town Tenants Commission; that is, the practice of eliminating the middleman and to grant the reversionary lease wherever possible direct to the tenant, the only stipulation being that the occupying tenant would acquire the interest of the middleman.  Knowing this practice, many tenants, especially around the outskirts of Dublin, have spent substantial sums of money in acquiring the interests of the middleman, who is <Col N="864" /> frequently the man who built the house. These middlemen sold their interest to the occupying tenants.</P>
    <P>If the Bill passes without Deputy Thrift's amendment these sums of money which the occupying tenants have paid will be gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be unless these interests amounted to two things, a lease of 31 years or 25 times the annual rental reserved on the property. I challenge the Minister to contradict that.  These are the only two persons, called proprietary lessees, who will be entitled to the lease&mdash;the proprietary lessee on the one hand and the owner of the bricks and mortar on the other. If the Minister goes carefully into the Bill he will find that the contention which we are making is right.  That is what will happen and those occupying tenants who bought out the interests of the middleman will get nothing unless they comply with the conditions regarding the proprietary lease, namely, have a 31 years' term or paid by way of fine 25 times the annual rent reserved.  I would like to look at the position of the owner of the bricks and mortar.  I would like everyone to get equity and justice but I suggest that under the Bill the owner of the bricks and mortar is receiving much more consideration than he is entitled to.  I want Deputies to remember that the house has changed proprietors a great number of times since the granting of the original lease, and the price paid in each transfer of ownership will be found to be the present value of the profit rent over a term of years.  It means that the present owner has paid a sum which represents the full value of the property.  The practice in regard to building land has been a very cute one.  They generally retain interest in the holdings for a couple of years longer because, if they do, they are entitled to the benefit of a reversionary lease, but in the case of well-managed estates when the question of a reversionary lease arose the <Col N="865" /> owner of the property, finding that these middlemen would only get a short reversion for a couple of years, declined to grant a reversionary lease to them.</P>
      <P>In that practice I think they were prefectly justified, for I submit to the House that the middleman, whether he be the builder of the bricks and mortar or another person who is a party interested in the occupying tenant, should not be entitled to obtain the benefit of the reversionary lease.  That being the practice on well-managed estates, that the middleman was refused a lease, there was no difficulty in enabling the tenant to purchase the interest of the years that remained outstanding. If, however, this Bill is passed you are going to set up what I have already termed a lord of the manor in the person of the owner of the bricks and mortar and give him a reversionary lease of 150 years.  For what?  Because he erected the house, because he spent £300 in the erection of the house at a time when the cost of building was very much lower than it is at present.  I contend that in the interests of equity, it is not the owner of the bricks and mortar who should get the lease.  I contend that the occupying tenant is the person who is entitled to the reversionary lease.  If this is a Bill for the amelioration of town tenants in general this House should take proper care to see that the occupying tenant will get the benefit of this particular section.  I have been advised that the greatest possible difficulty exists with middlemen, building lessees and otherwise, who get these leases for a long term of years&mdash;99 or 999 years&mdash;to get them to keep the house in repair, and that in fact it has been found that the only parties who can satisfactorily get these repairs carried out are the tenants in occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to paragraph 40 of the Report of the Town Tenants Commission.  In that report it is stated: &ldquo;We attach considerable importance to the last suggested exception, that exception being in cases of good estate management. There are undoubtedly carefully and excellently-managed estates with <Col N="866" /> which it would be inadvisable to interfere in any way, but the aim of our recommendation is to secure that the settled practice of such estates should determine the general law.&rdquo; Is this Bill carrying out that recommendation? Is that recommendation embodied in this section of the Bill? I submit to the House it is not, that it is the opposite of the recommendation you have actually embodied in the measure.  I ask the Minister carefully to consider the amendment which Deputy Thrift has moved.  I think it is a reasonable and an equitable amendment.  I think the granting of a reversionary lease approximately of 150 years places the occupying tenant completely at the mercy of that man and is certainly doing nothing to ameliorate the town tenants' lot.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody speaking on this amendment seems actuated by a desire that equity should be meted out to every person interested in houses, but apparently there is some confusion of thought in arriving exactly at a conclusion as to what is Deputy Thrift's amendment.  Deputy Byrne, who has just spoken, has spoken a good deal of the person known as the middleman, and in the case of ordinary lettings he, for the purpose of his argument, has divided the class of people interested in these holdings into four distinct categories or characters.  There is first the owner of the soil who is receiving the ground rent.  He then accepts the position of the building owner or the successor in title of the building owner, and then he comes along to the person against whom he directs the great weight of his argument, namely, the middleman, and under him the occupying tenant.  If Section 41 of the Bill stood exactly as it is, there would be no protection whatever in the ordinary way for the middleman, to whom Deputy Byrne has such a decided objection, because, as I conceive it, the position of the middleman is this: We will suppose that a building lease is made for 99 years and that the person entitled to the lessee's interest carries out the covenant of building, and having carried out <Col N="867" /> that covenant lets to another person, simply makes a letting to a person who then becomes the owner of the interest, and that other person becomes the middleman who makes the letting to the person in occupation. Unless there was a fine reserved or leased to the middleman, or unless he was obliged to carry out the duties of the covenant which the building owner had carried out under his lease, that is, in other words, unless the owner of the building lease had thrown over on the middleman, or the person whom Deputy Byrne described as the middleman, all the obligations under the building lease, that middleman would not be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Thrift's amendment is this.  It is not concerned with the middleman, but I do suggest that it is concerned purely and simply with the owner of the soil, because what Deputy Thrift's amendment attempts to do is to wipe out all intervening interests, no matter how much equity or how many equities any of these intervening interests will have, and to bring into immediate contact with one another the actual occupying tenant and the owner of the soil.  I do not know whether Deputy Thrift is moving that in the interest of the occupying tenant, but I suggest it is not in the interests of the occupying tenant, because the occupying tenant is already protected in so far as he has a right to obtain a new lease under Part III of the Bill.  I suggest that the only purpose of the amendment is to bring these parties into immediate contact, and thereby secure for the owner of the soil a greater rent than that to which he might be entitled in the ordinary way.  Suppose the occupying tenant has cast over on him any of the obligations which were formerly cast on the person called in this debate the building owner, that is, the lessee under the building lease, if the building lessee has either, by way of premium given over to any person the interest which he may have in his lease; if he has cast certain obligations over on another person, the occupying tenant by asking him to carry out certain repairs or improvements, which the <Col N="868" /> building lessee would be obliged to do under the lease, then that occupying tenant, if he complies with sub-section (2) of Section 41 would be entitled to a reversionary lease.  The building owner who had thrown over his obligations, and who had, in fact, taken a premium for his interest in the building lease, should not be entitled to a reversionary lease.  Deputy Thrift's amendment goes a good deal further than that because the definition of the proprietary lease given in Deputy Thrift's amendment is simply this, that it is a sub-lease under the building lease.  The position if Deputy Thrift's amendment were carried would be this.  I understand that on certain estates there was a recognised practice of granting renewals to the owners of building leases.  Undoubtedly in a number of cases the owners of building leases erected quite a number of houses.  They let them out to various occupying tenants.  They had this expectation of a renewal of interest in the building lease.  They carried out, and are carrying out to the conclusion of their building lease, the obligations cast upon them by that lease towards the owner of the soil.  They have never accepted from a tenant a premium so that it cannot be said that they have sold for any valuable consideration their interest in the building lease.  They never cast upon the tenant the necessity to make improvements, so that it cannot be said they threw on him the obligations under the building lease.  Yet Deputy Thrift's amendment would wipe out entirely either the original lessee under such a lease, or his successors in title, and would confer on a tenant, who had not paid any premium for his sub-lease, who had not expended any money on repairs or improvements, an equity which I think practically everybody here recognises, if the purpose of this section be to establish equities, as far as possible should be vested in the building owner.  For these reasons I suggest that the amendment should not be accepted.</P>

I do not profess to understand fully the intricacies of this section, but I think Deputy Beckett is confused over the term &ldquo;the owner of the bricks and mortar.&rdquo;  What I am trying to do is to get the real and proper owner of the bricks and mortar, at the time the lease falls in, the right to the reversionary lease.</P>

      <P>As I take it the reversionary lease must be given to the holder of the building lease, unless there is a proprietary lease, and the proprietary lease must be that twenty-five times the rent reserved has been paid and that it is for a term of thirty-one years.  If a person bought a house which was going to fall in under a building lease in 1932, if he bought that house in 1905, and became the purchaser, as he thought, of that house for that period of years, twenty-six years ago, I take that man to be the real owner of the bricks and mortar. But, under this Bill, he has only got a proprietary lease which has not run for thirty-one years.</P>

I admit that the matter is very complicated.  It is so complicated that I do not think we ought to pass a section which, I am convinced and am assured, will do a great injustice in very many cases, without going into the matter most carefully in a way in which I do not think we really as a body are capable of doing in this House. It is quite impossible to separate, as Deputy Finlay says, Section 43 from Section 41 altogether. I think the whole matter ought to be investigated by a conference between the different interests. What we want to get is justice and equity to meet, as far as we can, a variety of interests.  I maintain that it is fundamentally impossible by a section like this of a general kind to meet the various types of cases which arise.  I believe that this section will be just in a small number of cases, but that it will be most unjust in the great majority of cases.</P>

      <P>I am a mere layman in this matter, but as the section has been explained to me it seems to me that the Minister, whether inadvertently or not, is trying to benefit this wonderful middleman at the expense both of the ground landlord and of the occupying tenant. I do not believe in Deputies repeating what others have said, and Deputies Byrne and Thrift have said all that I can possibly say.  In regard to Deputy Finlay's remarks, I think he said that the amendment, if carried, would have the effect of bringing the actual occupier directly into contact with the ground landlord.  I do not know what the objection to that is, if it is true.  In fact, I think it would be rather an advantage, because, from what I have heard of estates in Dublin, the actual occupying tenant does better when brought into contact direct with the ground landlord rather than with the middleman.  I hope the Minister will consider the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that there has been very considerable misunderstanding of this section by Deputy Thrift and other Deputies who have spoken.  As Deputy Finlay pointed out, the main error into which Deputy Thrift and other Deputies have fallen is that they have considered Section 41.  Section 41 is not an operative section; it is merely an interpretative section. It simply describes what building lease and proprietary lease means. The actual section which is of importance is Section 42, which states to whom the reversionary lease is to be granted.  Deputies obviously are greatly mistaken as to whom the reversionary lease is to be granted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thrift, for example, put forward a case of a person who had purchased the interest of a building lessee.  In that case he stands in the shoes of the building lessee and he is the person to whom the lease will be granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">

      <P>Perhaps I did not state my case fully.  What I intended was that he had purchased that lease up to 1931, not for the whole term, leaving one year over.  Therefore, he came into the position of a proprietary leaseholder instead of the holder of the building lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us make it perfectly clear.  There is, first, the building lease.  The building lessee, that is, the person who has held under the building lease, does not of necessity hold by an hereditary title, as there seems to be some idea here.  Any person who has purchased the interest of the building lessee under the building lease becomes the owner of that lease and will be entitled to the reversionary lease. In a great number of cases, as has been pointed out, the occupying tenant has bought the interest of the building lessee and he is then in contact with the ground landlord, and it is to him that the reversionary lease will be made.  In other cases he has not done so.  The owner of the building lease, that is, as has been put again and again here, the owner of the bricks and mortar, because he is the person who actually built the house, has made either a sub-lease or a letting from year to <Col N="872" /> year of the premises comprised in this building lease. He is the person who has done everything for the improvement of the property.  He has taken his lease and in a great number of instances he has made the necessary roads and built the house; he has invested his capital.  The bricks and mortar have been put there by him. He is what everybody, in rough parlance, calls the owner of the house. He lets it for a short or long term.  He maintains, I submit to the House, still the same rights which he had before. He is the person who has done the improvement.</P>
      <P>Now let us consider what Deputy Thrift's amendment is.  Deputy Byrne seems to consider that Deputy Thrift's amendment gives to the occupier a right to the proprietary lease.  It does not.  For instance, if an occupier holds under a tenancy from year to year he does not get any right to a proprietary lease under this amendment.  The only persons who get any rights under Deputy Thrift's amendment are persons who hold under a lease, be it for a long or short term.  Supposing I have a house and have expended a considerable amount of money upon it and sub-let it under a lease for three or four years.  What equity has a person who has only been there for three or four years to cut me out and get a building lease for 99 years from the ground landlord?  I cannot see any equity.  I could see it, possibly, if a person had been there for a very long time, but I can see no equity when a person has only been there for five or ten years as against the person who has paid the hard cash, possibly a very large sum in hard cash, for the interest in the lease.  But if you pay a large sum in cash for the interest in the lease and you make a short lease then you lose everything under the amendment. Your lessee under the short-term lease becomes entitled to a reversionary lease and you are cut out entirely.  If you were wise enough to make a letting for ten years from year to year you would not be cut out under the amendment. It is only if you have been foolish enough to make a lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have been endeavouring to do is to discover in whom the real <Col N="873" /> interest in the bricks and mortar part of the premises lies.  I think it lies primarily in the person who has erected the premises and made the improvements around it, but you must go on further.  He may have sold his interest out and out.  If he did, it goes to his successor in title and then no question arises&mdash;the person who purchased from him is there.  He may, on the other hand, not have sold the entire of his interest; he may have sold it in part.  You have the case in which there is a tenant who is paying a substantial rent for premises, but who, in addition, paid a fine.  If the fine was a very substantial fine, the tenant has become certainly part-owner with the lessee in the building lease; part-owner with his immediate landlord in the premises.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to get at is who has really got the major interest. If the tenant has paid a small fine then I think the landlord's interest in the premises as against a head landlord is greater than his.  On the other hand if the tenant paid a very substantial fine then I think he is really more the owner than the person to whom he paid the fine.  For that reason we have put in this figure of 25 times the amount of the annual rent.  If a person has paid a larger sum than would produce the annual rent he certainly is the owner of the premises.</P>

      <P>I do not think so because we must bear in mind that as well as paying a fine he is also paying a very large and substantial rent and you do not consider the person as owner of the house who is paying a very large and substantial rent.  You get the two things merged together.  There is a joint interest in the house.  If I have a house and let it at a substantial rent I undoubtedly have an interest.  If the person who purchased from me paid a very substantial fine he undoubtedly has an interest but what we must try and do is to decide who has the larger interest and define the border-line.  If it goes more on the one side it is the landlord's and if goes more on the other side it is the tenant's.  According as the rent is larger in proportion to the fine it is the landlord's, and according as the fine is larger in proportion to the rent it is the tenant's.  That seems to me to be endeavouring to get what is the real substantial justice of the matter, and whether a fine is paid or not paid would have nothing to do with Deputy Thrift's amendment at all. It would mean that anybody who got a lease for no matter what short term would be entitled to this reversionary lease, cutting out the person who possibly ten years ago paid a very large and substantial sum for the premises. I do not think that would be fair and equitable.  I do not think in practice the tenant will ever have paid a substantial fine unless he is going to have a very long lease.  All these matters must be regulated by what is fairest in the greatest majority of cases.  I would listen to any argument or specific instance that could be put forward which would show that in the majority of cases that would not work out right. But I have heard no such arguments at all and I cannot therefore accept Deputy Thrift's amendment.  I am not going to discuss Deputy Lemass's amendment.</P>

      <P>As I stated when I moved this amendment, I was quite clear in my mind that it might operate harshly in certain cases.  The Minister has principally answered me by drawing attention to the cases in which my amendment would work unfairly. I grant that there are such, but my contention is that in the great majority of cases that occur it is the Minister's own section that would work unfairly.  I ask the Minister this question, and not being familiar with technicalities, I do not want to be defeated on a technicality.</P>
      <P>I am trying to use the right technical term.  Supposing 20 or 25 years ago a building lease was made to run until 1932, and a sub-lease was made which was to expire in the year 1931, what kind of a price did the man who took that sub-lease pay?  What did he think he was buying, and what did the seller think he was selling?  The purchaser thought he was buying a house; the seller thought he was selling a house. What was to happen in '32 was that they would both lose, and as far as getting a reversionary lease is concerned, they had very little concern with it, because they thought they would get the reversionary lease at a proper price.  What we are doing to-day is making the reversionary lease a gift.  Therefore it is of the highest importance to know who is to get the reversionary lease.  Thirty years ago it was not so, but by 1933 we are going to do something of which neither of the parties had any thought 30 years ago.  I ask the Minister what the seller thought he was selling, and what the purchaser thought he was buying, and what was the price paid.</P>

      <P>On sub-clause (2) of Section 41 of the Bill, would the Minister consider a class of people whom I think, on the definition as it stands, would not come within it? There are two ways of exacting a payment of money by a person to whom a sub-lease is made.  One is the payment of a premium by the sub-lessee to the sub-lessor; another way, which I am informed a number of people have resorted to, is they are lessees of premises more or less dilapidated, and they make a sub-lease of those premises on the condition that the sub-lessee expends a substantial sum of money in carrying out improvements on those premises.  Paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 41 says: &ldquo;Such lease was made partly in consideration of the payment of a sum of money (other than rent) by the lessee to the lessor.&rdquo;  I would suggest for the Minister's consideration that such lease was made partly in consideration of the payment or expenditure of a sum of money.  I think there are <Col N="877" /> cases where the sum of money expended is so substantial as to show an intention on the part of the person making the sub-lease, in those cases either a building lessee or a successor in title of the lessee, to deprive himself of any further interest in the property which might have been given to him in the original lease.</P>

      <P>What I want to protect is that the successor in title gets the reversionary lease.  People come in and buy ground rents with a year or so to run, and complicate the issues. We seem to be working as if they were the main issue.  The main issue is that the successors in title should have their rights.  They used to be called gerry-builders in my young days.  I call them the goose that laid the golden egg.  Builders in the past who created houses for people to live in were an asset to the State; they are a disappearing asset now.  Anything in this Bill which makes it more difficult for them to carry on the business which they know best will be a disaster to the State.  It is an absurdity that laws should be passed on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the occupying tenant.  Occupying tenants make a contract for services and get the benefit of that contract.  They never for a moment consider, when making that contract, that they are staking a claim to something else that might come in the future.  I do not think an honest tenant would accept a condition that such a person should step into the building owner's shoes.  It is absurd to my, perhaps, weak intellect, and I do not think that that contention should for a moment be put forward. Deputy Byrne suggested that the builder knew what he was getting in his lease when making it.  If the builder makes and gets a good lease, and the property is kept up by him. his successors in title, it is an investment which has been built up by him. deputy Byrne suggests that the <Col N="878" /> middleman should be completely eliminated and that he is a curse to the country.  Such wild talk will not help us in coming to a decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>The middleman, if you call him such, creates property for the benefit of the State.  He should be encouraged in every possible way and his interests so protected that it will be possible for new middlemen&mdash;I call them building owners&mdash;to rise and carry on those services which at the moment are at a very low ebb.</P>
    <P>Property has changed hands many times.  When Deputies make that statement I think they have lost sight of a very important fact.  How many times has a property that has changed hands paid toll to the State?  Each time a property changes hands it pays tolls to the State either on the part of the lessor or of other interests according to the relationship to the property. Anything that would confiscate that property when it has got to the third, fourth or fifth generation would be a crime, the State having always taken toll before it was transferred to other hands.  I think the position must be looked at from the main point of view.  If it is necessary to introduce a clause to prevent the exploiters of property getting some benefit I have no objection, but on the main issue I have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not given the House the impression that I indulge in wild talk as Deputy Beckett stated I did.  The impression I intended to convey to the House was that under the Bill a wrong was being done to the occupying tenant. Although we had an assurance from the Minister, who dealt very ably with the case put forward by Deputy Thrift, that certain statements which were made were not correct, still we must say that so far as we are concerned these tenants are labouring under a considerable amount of difficulty.  On the section defining a lease, we have come to two conclusions: (1) that unless a tenant has acquired a thirty-one years' term by way of interest in the property he will not be entitled to a reversionary lease; and (2) that <Col N="879" /> unless the tenant has paid twenty-five times the annual rent he will not be entitled to a reversionary lease.  We submit that where tenants have purchased holdings for a term of fifteen or twenty years and have paid substantial sums, as we know tenants have paid in many instances, it appears most inequitable that they should be wiped out and that the interest in the reversionary lease should go, as Deputy Beckett stated, into the hands of the man with the goose which laid the golden eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always thought that builders in this country were well able to look after themselves.  While I recognise that they perform a very useful function, still, there is a limit to their utility.  What happens in actual practice is that these building lessees take a few years' interest in a holding. In cases like this we maintain that if a tenant has fifteen, twenty or twenty-five years' interest in a sub-lease it is most inequitable to eliminate him, and place him at the mercy of a new man whether he is a man who erected the bricks and mortar or not.  I would draw the attention of Deputies to the section in the Town Tenants Report dealing with well-managed estates where it is pointed out that they viewed that practice with considerable satisfaction, and that there was no intention of interfering with the continuance of that practice.  In fact, as far as I can see, this section of the Bill interferes with a practice that has met with commendation in the Report of the Town Tenants Commission, because, unless you comply with that condition I do not see how the reversionary lease can go to the sub-lessee. I do not want to stress this point unduly. If the Minister thinks there are conflicting interests concerned of a substantial character, I would ask him to give some undertaking that the various speakers would have an opportunity of consulting him, so that there should be a reasonable compromise on the question.  Viewing the section as it stands we cannot get away from the fact that in practice, in well-managed estates, tenants have expended very substantial sums in the <Col N="880" /> acquisition of various interests for terms of years, but now, unless they are there 31 years they are out of consideration. I do not think if this is a Town Tenants Bill, that that could be considered equitable in any way. We do not want to do the builders any injustice, or the people who have paid substantial sums to acquire leases.  We think the interests of both parties should be reconciled, and we ask the Minister to give the people concerned an opportunity of meeting him, so as to get some undertaking to meet the various objections put up on behalf of occupying tenants, as well as on behalf of building lessees.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take it from Deputy Beckett or anyone else that occupying tenants have no right, simply because at some time in the career of a builder's family, maybe 999 years ago, they built a house that they are entitled to the full right and title to it secula saeculorum.  I want a fair and reasonable drafting of the section that will do justice to the interests of the occupying tenants and the building lessees.  I would ask the Minister to see if the conflicting interests could have a chance of consultation before he accepts the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is exactly the same as the one I introduced last year, with the necessary change of date.  The change is shown in Section 2 of the Bill, which allows for guarantees to be given up to 31st July, 1932, under both sections of the original Act, with the precise limitation which was in the measure of last year, that at any time in that interval there may be published a notice in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; stating that no applications for guarantees under Section 1 of the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, or for loans or guarantees under Section 2 of the Principal Act, as so amended, would be entertained by the Minister after the particular date.  I had no intention this time last <Col N="882" /> year of having any measure of this type this time, but I am in exactly the same position as last year, except that the applications which are pending are even more numerous than this time last year.  There are five applications. Some of them have advanced to a certain point.  One of them is with the Minister for Finance, the application having been granted, while others have only been notified to me as coming forward. There are three rather large applications, and there is one relatively small but still of a considerable amount.  It would be quite unfair to people who made application on the strength of an Act in existence to close down this system of guarantee until these applications have been disposed of.</P>

      <P>The Minister has repeatedly, in this House and outside, expressed his view that this Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act has exceeded the period of its usefulness and that he intended to let it expire.  Statements have appeared in the Press that he was contemplating a new measure on different lines, but that is denied and he has expressed the view that when assistance is to be given to a particular industry it can be done in the manner in which sugar beet was assisted, by special legislation or special vote of the Dáil.  We are not opposed to the continuation of the Act for another year, although I must say that we have the idea that its continuation is very largely due to the fact that the Minister has not given the problem of finding an alternative method the attention which it requires.  A great deal can be done to foster industry in this State and it is necessary that it should be done.  If this particular method of doing so is not going to produce the results, and it has not produced the results heretofore, then some other means has to be found.</P>

    <P>We passed a Bill like this last year on information that certain applications were pending.  A year has passed and not one of these applications has come to maturity.  No guarantees have been given.

Is there any reason to anticipate that the applications which have occasioned this Bill are likely to get any further than the applications which were referred to twelve months ago?  I would like also if the Minister would tell us what progress has been made in the disposal of the assets of the companies which failed.  No definite arrangement has been made for submitting that information to the Dáil.  The Minister stated that when the assets had been disposed of the information could be got by question.  Has the disposal of the assets in any one of the six cases concerned been completed?  If so, to what extent has the State been recouped for the loss involved?  Further, I would like to get some information from the Minister as to the nature of the applications which are now pending and which he expects to have considered during the next twelve months.</P>

In the case of the Allihies Mines the property was realised but I have not the actual figures.  The sale has actually been carried out.

It will probably be necessary to fill in details of the amounts received.  When previously a return was presented that was a blank column, because there had been nothing received up to that time.

      <P>This is a very simple Bill. It is in two parts.  The first is to give power to the Minister to make regulations providing for the method of keeping records of what is held over in cold stores or in the premises of manufacturers or exporters, and also to provide for making returns to the Minister of butter in cold stores.  The underlying idea is to enable the Minister for Agriculture to publish, periodically, figures as to the amount of butter in cold stores, so that butter manufacturers will have some data to enable them to see what the provision will be.  The second is a matter of form. Under the Dairy Produce Act there is power to license certain manufacturers who are collecting cream instead of collecting milk, and to enable them to call their butter creamery butter. These powers were renewed under a subsequent Act, and expired on the 17th December, 1930.  This Bill provides that these powers shall be continued until March, 1933.  I move the Second Reading.</P>

I think it is the case that we never know at any time what amount of wheat or what amount of flour or coal is in the country.  Could the present Bill not be so extended <Col N="886" /> that power would be given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to collect statistics of that kind?</P>

      <P>What I want to say on this Bill is in connection with Section 6.  I would like to know if the Minister in introducing this Bill, appreciates that the information which will be collected under it will be very useful to the butter traders?  Would the Minister think it advisable that they should have access to that information as a matter of right?  I notice that Section 6 says that the Minister may from time to time publish this information. I think it might be well that traders would feel that they could be supplied with information on occasions. If a man had a certain quantity of butter to sell, and if he were in doubt as to whether he ought to get rid of it or not, it would be well that he would have the right to the knowledge as to the quantity of butter in the country.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that Section 10 has been inserted in connection with the licensing of these creameries.  I think that a particular creamery, with the condition of which I am familiar, will be glad to see that it is getting a further lease of life.  I think that the creamery industry in general will be very glad to see this Bill.  As a matter of fact, two or three creamery managers to whom I have been speaking on occasions during the last month, told me that if they had such information at their disposal about the 1st March last the fall in prices would not have come nearly so quickly as it did come.  Undercutting and underselling this year commenced four to six weeks sooner than it might have commenced if there had been a knowledge of the quantity of butter in the country.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill last week was welcomed by a conference of creamery managers, which I had an opportunity of attending.  I agree with what Deputy Ryan has said. This Bill is welcomed as a necessity at the moment, for it gives the Department power to collect those statistics. It is absolutely necessary for us to get reliable statistics in this matter.  As the Deputy has mentioned, the position <Col N="887" /> is apparent to anyone.  The creameries suffered a very severe loss this year through an unnecessary fall in prices brought about by the undercutting which took place.  There were, of course, other reasons as well.  I hope that eventually the individual creameries in the country will come to see reason and come to understand what the word co-operation means in fact as well as in name.  Meanwhile it is very desirable that the Department of Agriculture should have this power to collect those statistics, because if we are to be faced with a very large amount of hoarding and cold-storing of butter in a disorderly fashion the benefits derived from the tariff on butter will be nullified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time the creamery industry is going through what might be called a crisis and farmers are going away from the creameries or withholding supplies.  This Bill will help to stabilise the industry.  It will help the creameries to avail of the temporary benefits we have from the tariff in the spring time.  The benefits of that tariff can be continued for five or six weeks longer.  I am sure that the large creameries in this country will see the common sense of not undercutting each other.  But that is hardly relevant to this measure.  This Bill tightens up the regulations and gives the Department power to collect those statistics.  It is going to be of great benefit to the industry.  There are, unfortunately, some people who think that they should be privileged to carry on any sort of trade or industry no matter what injury it does to the country as a whole.  The creamery industry of this country is an important one.  A very large amount of capital is locked up in this industry which is so valuable to the country that it is right that the Department of Agriculture should have this power that is sought for in the Bill.  At a conference of seven or eight creameries last Saturday it was agreed that this Bill was necessary, and they welcomed it.  They expressed the hope that the returns will be available in as quick a time as possible.  On behalf of the creameries that I represent, <Col N="888" /> I wish to state that they are anxious that this Bill would go through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Dr. Ryan's point, I do not think that he is quite correct.  He stated that if information had been available as to what stocks of butter were in the country the fall in price would not have occurred as quickly as it did at the beginning of the season.  My recollection is that butter was about four-pence above the world's price up to the middle of March, and the fall took place between the middle of March and the last week of that month.  If that is so it shows that the rise in price remained to the extent of the full four-pence while there was no shortage. During the last week of March there was a surplus.  The position here in regard to butter is that in March we produce about 20,000 cwts, whereas our requirements are 27,000.  On the basis of 27,000 a month our weekly requirements would be about 7,000 cwts.  We produce most of the 20,000&mdash;I should say about two-thirds&mdash;in the last week of March. We produced in that week about 15,000 cwts., and the requirements for that week would be only about 7,000.  The position is that there was a jump from a shortage in the middle of March to a surplus in the last week of March, and down came the price.  Any information that we might have had would not have altered that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of &ldquo;may and shall,&rdquo; the intention is to publish these returns fortnightly.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; is inserted for obvious reasons.  If it read &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time publish,&rdquo; I could publish the information to-day and again this time five years.  Once you put in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; you must say how often the information is to be published.  It would be very difficult to settle that. It would be a contentious point.  It might be that as a result of experience it would be better to publish the information not fortnightly but monthly or two monthly.  We cannot foresee all possible contingencies.  If you put in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to make it different you must insert some particular time. <Col N="889" /> If you say &ldquo;shall publish information with respect to the amount of butter from time to time held in cold storage in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; I could very easily, if I did not wish to publish the full information, publish very meagre details.  I need not publish the full amount.  If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was inserted the Minister could evade it.  If you want to make the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; operative the section would have to be redrafted and we would have to say specifically when the information should be published and what information exactly is required.  The intention is to publish information that would be useful to the creameries so as to keep them informed of the amount of butter in cold storage and to publish the information fortnightly. I think that Deputy Dr. Ryan will agree that in all the circumstances &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the better word.</P>

      <P>On Section 6, I would like to know whether there is any use in appealing to the Minister to reconsider his attitude in regard to the number of members to constitute the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The Minister has stated that nine persons shall constitute the Board.  I understand that he has had representations made to him since the last day to the effect that a larger number would be desirable.  While I had my mind on 25 I have since come to the conclusion that 15 would be a suitable number&mdash; ten from the Corporation and five from the County Council&mdash;thus maintaining in proportion the present representation, with an increased number.  Would the Minister be prepared to reconsider <Col N="890" /> his attitude on that question and meet the wishes of some representatives of the Corporation and also of the County Council who feel that, owing to the tremendous amount of responsibility thrown on their shoulders to follow up every aspect of the lives of people who seek assistance, as well as to protect the ratepayers, the Minister should agree to change the number, if not to fifteen, then to some number above nine?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to recommend a greater number than that provided in the Bill, namely, nine members from the city and county, with two co-opted members.  The committee of nine would have power to co-opt two members.  The matter was fully discussed between the Dublin Committee, the officials of my Department and myself, and, after every consideration and a full review of the particulars, the Committee made a recommendation to me to the effect that the number, nine, might be put into operation, but that from their point of view it was the minimum that they required.  From my point of view I consider that even eleven is unnecessarily high, but, as they suggested nine as a minimum, I am strongly of opinion that we should not have a committee greater than nine members, who may co-opt two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that the Union Committee stated that as a minimum nine would be acceptable. Would he say whether they were agreeable to a slightly higher figure? My information is that a slightly higher figure would facilitate the work of the Committee and would prevent it falling on a few shoulders.  With regard to the representation from the Council area, apart from that covered by the Balrothery Board of Assistance, the Minister probably knows that the members who represent that area have a considerable district to cover, not only in population, but in size, and find it difficult to keep in touch with individuals applying for assistance.  If they are to carry out their work in a desirable way it is advisable that they should not have an area beyond their reasonable control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> If further representations are made to the Minister will he reconsider the question of increasing the number? With regard to co-option, I think that that principle is a bad one.  It is going to lead back to a revival of the old system of ex-officio guardians who, as the Minister knows, did not fill the position properly.  I think that if you have a properly selected body of representatives from the Corporation and County Council, without co-opted members it would meet the case far better. Will the Minister agree to reconsider his attitude between this and the Report Stage if representations are made from quarters acceptable to himself to have the number increased from 11 to 15?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At a time when the Deputy took upon himself to run along thinking of numbers, of 25, 15 and other numbers, at a time when he took upon himself to introduce legislation without consulting the Union Committee and over the heads of the Minister and the Department responsible, at a time when he must have known that we were in communication with the Committee about the matter, at a time when the Deputy thought about doing all these matters, he thought very little of what was thought by the Committee dealing with the work or what was thought by the Department who were fully co-operating with the Committee about the matter. The Committee has fully discussed the matter with the Department.  They have recommended after carefully considering the question that a Committee consisting of eleven members, six from the City and three from the County with two co-opted members, would be acceptable.  The Committee consider eleven the minimum required.  I presented my judgment on that minimum and I am certainly not prepared to go further than that.  I suggest too that the Deputy is simply tossing about in a wild way about numbers without knowing what they are required for and he has not thought fit to put down an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching the matter in a non-contentious way.  The <Col N="892" /> Minister is making a misstatement when he says that I took upon myself, over the heads of members of the Committee, to introduce legislation in this House, whereas, as a matter of fact, I consulted the Chairman of the Committee about this particular question. I further ask the Minister to read the debates of the House and find out if he himself in reply to a question of mine stated that he would refuse to increase the numbers.  Then, I introduced this private Bill, for the purpose of trying to get done earlier something which the Minister is now trying to do in a manner which will have to be again amended at a later stage.  The Minister says that I do not know what I am talking about, that I am floundering about without any knowledge of what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister deny that the County Councils themselves have discussed this question of whether the number of representatives given to them was sufficient?  Has it not come to his knowledge that the County Council was desirous of increasing the number from the number selected by the Minister himself?  The Minister stated that I did not put down an amendment to this section.  I could have put it down, but it would have met with the same results as my appeal to him now. I have to oppose the passing of this section because the Minister is sticking to his own number, and secondly, I want to place on record my opposition to the idea of co-opted members as against public representatives.</P>

I do not know what transpired between the Union Committee <Col N="893" /> and the Minister.  I am not a member of the Committee, but a member of the Corporation, and I heard that representations were made that the number was not sufficient, and on that basis I acted in the matter. I did discuss the matter with the lady who is chairman of the Committee who came on a deputation to ask the Minister for an increased membership.</P>

I would say that the Committee themselves do not know whether the work will be discharged more satisfactorily with eleven than it is being carried out by five, or that it would be carried out with nine, and I do not think they will undertake to say at this particular stage that the work would be better done with fifteen than with eleven.</P>

      <P>In fairness to Deputy Murphy, I think the Minister should be a little more frank.  The question does not arise as to whether they are doing their work well or not.  The question is whether the work placed on their shoulders is too great.  It is in order to facilitate the work and to have these people feel that they will not be allowed to become tired by being over-burdened with work that the increase in numbers is sought.  I would like to point out that these people give their services voluntarily. The present Union Committee sat for a whole day every week, but they were only able to deal with the routine office work.  They had no time to visit the Union itself for the purpose of inspecting it or doing any outside work in connection with applications for outdoor relief.  It is in order that they might be able to split up the work that they desire to increase the numbers.  The Minister did not dispute the fact that they said that eleven was the minimum number.  I am asking him that if representations come to him, from quarters acceptable to himself, will he be prepared to increase the number to fifteen?  In the absence of a satisfactory answer I shall have to oppose the section.</P>

Under this Bill the Committee will consist of nine persons, which I consider is out of all proportion from the point of view of representation. These persons are to have power to co-opt two other members.  As I pointed out before, the old system of ex-officio guardian is revived.  I want to ask the Minister if he would reconsider his attitude with regard to the co-opted members and allow elected representatives to form the eleven members of the Committee rather than nine and two co-opted, or if he can give any reason why he wants co-opted members?</P>

Does the Minister not consider that the representatives who selected these people are entitled to some say in the matter?

      <P>I have not suggested in any way that the Dublin City Council has not a right, if it wishes or desires, to express its opinion on this subject.  But I have yet to learn that the City Council has neglected to express its opinions on anything that it desires to express an opinion.  I have yet also to learn, considering the time that this has been under discussion, and the publicity given to it, that the Dublin City Council was not aware that the present proposal was on foot.  In view of these circumstances, and in view of the fact that I have received no representation from the Dublin City Council on the matter, I think it is too late now.  In the first place I believe the necessity must not have arisen, or else I would have heard from them.  It is too late now to hear from them, so I do not think that any expression of opinion from the City Council on the matter would be of any use at the present time.</P>

      <P>It seems a very curious thing that on the principle of co-option on an elected body the Minister should not be able to make any positive statement as to his reason for introducing that element into the Bill.  The Bill proposes to replace a nominated body for an elected body.  The Minister modified that principle, yet he cannot say why he proposes to modify it.  Surely there must be some reason in his mind when he brought in the idea of having something less 25 per cent. of the members co-opted.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary to employ some extra staff.  Take Donegal, where we employ inspectors for the farmers' houses and for railway stations.  That will give rise to a considerable amount of inspection.  The custom there has been for the farmers to export from their premises in order to save cartage and to bring them to the railway station.  We will inspect the potatoes there.  That is quite common in the North of Ireland.  That will cause a certain amount of expenditure and will mean extra staff. There are other cases where potatoes are bought from the farmers and delivered at the railway station.  We estimate that we shall have to employ three additional inspectors.</P>

I would ask the House to consider also sub-section (3) of the same section, to which I have an amendment reducing the sum of £22 to £13 10s.  That means that the deposit will be £1 10s., and taken with the £13 10s. the total will be £15; thus the exporter's licence will be reduced from £25 to £15.  I hope the Minister will consider the advisability of accepting the amendments, because if the licence duty is left at the sum of £25, it will mean hardship for some of the smaller exporters.  I would ask the Minister to make the following matter clear, because some misapprehension arises in my part of the country, some people contend that the amended licence of £15 would mean an annual sum.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell the House how the sub-head C.C.&mdash;Repayment to the British Government on cost of audit, Royal Irish Constabulary pensions, Civil Superannuation, etc., amounting to £575, arises?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years a sum of £600 has been provided for this purpose.  The reason for the expenditure on the agency service at the British Audit Office is that the payment of the Royal Irish Constabulary pensions and civil superannuation by the British Government is in a sense agency service because ultimately the cost falls on us.  The payment of the pensions is made by the British Paymaster-General in the first instance and repayment is made by the Saorstát Government of seventy-five per cent. of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and seventy-one and a half per cent. of the civil pensions.  The payment in respect of civil pensions is on a provisional basis without prejudice to subsequent adjustment.</P>
      <P>The generally accepted principle as between the British Government and the Saorstát Government is that each shall accept the Comptroller and Auditor-General's certificate.  We have expressly reserved the right to audit the payments made in respect of pensions and full facilities for enabling this to be done will be placed at our disposal by the British Government.  As a matter of fact audits of the Royal Irish Constabulary pensions and civil pensions were carried out in 1930 by our Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

      <P>In relation to the audit work, one of the points that I would like to raise is as to how this £1,152,000 is paid over to the British. I do not want to misstate the position, but I think it is the case that the British Paymaster-General requisitions <Col N="911" /> this sum in the first instance.  If that is the position then I think it is a rather extraordinary thing that the party to this transaction who makes the requisition in the first instance and who spends the money should also audit the expenditure.  It would seem to me that that affords very little protection to the people of this State.  I think that £575 is very ill-spent money. It really affords us no protection.  I say, at any rate, that in an ordinary commercial transaction no person would dream of permitting a man who requisitions money in the first instance and expends it in the second to audit it in the third.  There does not seem to be any real check throughout the whole of that system.  I am glad to learn that last year there was actually an audit of these pensions carried out by independent Irish auditors who are responsible to this House.  I hope that the audit was satisfactory.  I do not think, in view of the fact that we have the right to audit these accounts and in view of the fact that, in my opinion, an audit by the British Government gives no real protection, we would be justified in spending this £575.  The Minister has made the case that in relation to sums disbursed in this country by his Department on behalf of the British Government they accept the certificate of our Comptroller and Auditor-General, but there is no comparison between the two sums.  We do not spend £1,000,000 for the British Government in this country. I do not believe that we disburse anything with the exception of the amount that is voted for war graves under Miscellaneous Services. The only person who can audit these accounts on behalf of the Free State is the Comptroller and Auditor-General appointed by this House and responsible to this House.  To justify the unaudited expenditure of £1,150,000 of the people's money&mdash;and that is what it amounts to&mdash;by saying that we disburse a comparatively trivial sum of something like £10,000 and that the British accept the certificate of our Comptroller and Auditor-General is, to my mind, no justification for the procedure that has grown up in regard <Col N="912" /> to this matter.  We are entirely suspicious of the whole way in which these R.I.C. pensions are disbursed. It seems to be a most extraordinary position that the Government have taken up in the matter.  I could understand if they were to come here and say, &ldquo;We feel that we are under no obligation in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact that this money is handed over to the British Government to distribute and that we accept the certificate of the British Government auditors for its proper expenditure is, as I say, extraordinary. We have absolutely no control over that expenditure.  The money may be used, as far as this State is concerned, by the British Government to subsidise a secret service organisation in this country, to build up a body of opinion in this country in favour of the British Government or to provide a striking force, if necessary, in case the British should come back, as the Minister, every time he gets on a political platform, tells us they are going to come back if Fianna Fáil gets into power.  The whole circumstances in connection with the matter are so extraordinary and so unjustifiable that I really think we shall have to divide the House, if necessary, on the question of this expenditure.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy has come to the point and I do not think I need say any more.  The suggestion that the Comptroller and Auditor-General in Great Britain is going to be a party to some sort of indefinite embezzlement of money is, to my mind, entirely absurd.  For all ordinary purposes we may be perfectly satisfied with the audit of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General. However, in case there might be some point of principle in which their viewpoint would be different from ours, it is fair enough to have an occasional check audit, but so far as the expenditure <Col N="913" /> of the money in accordance with law and regulation goes we may be sure that the check of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General is as good as any check that we can impose.</P>

      <P>The chief source of my complaint regarding this Estimate is based on the fact that it does not contemplate restoring to the old age pensioners the moneys that have been taken from them since the Free State Government took over the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts.  We have been told from time to time by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that a generous interpretation is being given to the Old Age Pensions Acts, and we have been asked to believe that old age pensioners are being treated more generously by the present administration than they were by the British Government when that Government administered those Acts in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> The actual facts are that the Estimate for 1922-23 was £3,320,000, and that the Estimate for 1931-32 is £2,756,500, showing a reduction since 1922 of £563,500.  It is an easy matter to show that that reduction of almost £600,000 in the amount of money expended on old age pensions was not brought about in its entirety by the legislation that was passed in this House.  The greater portion of that reduction has been brought about by the rigid interpretation of the Old Age Pensions Acts.  In 1924 the Minister for Finance set out definitely to secure a saving of £500,000 on this item of expenditure.  The plea put forward at that time was the necessity for economy.  The Minister for Finance, as reported in column 1262, volume 6, in 1924 stated: &ldquo;Our view is that getting in this way £500,000 from this particular service we have got all that we are entitled to take or to look for.&rdquo; The figure of £500,000 was definitely fixed in 1924 by the Minister for Finance, as being all that the State was entitled to take on the urgent plea of economy and all that that particular service could afford.  It was definitely undertaken at that time that an early opportunity would be availed of to restore this £500,000 to the old-age pensioners.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have sufficient patience to allow me to proceed and I think I would have satisfied you that my argument was not based on an amendment of the the law in 1924, and not on any proposed amendment of the law, but upon the administration of <Col N="915" /> the law.  In 1924 an undertaking was given that as soon as the country would be in a position to afford the restoration of the conditions existing under the British regime, the money would be restored to the old age pensioners.  In February, 1928, the Minister for Finance had apparently made up his mind that that time had arrived.  Speaking in the House on the 29th February, 1928 (volume 22, column 496), the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;We have now at least reached the position where we have actually turned the corner and where, although the improvement is not very great, there is a definite and real improvement. It is that improvement that, in my opinion, gives justification at present for some improvement in the conditions of the old-age pensioners.&rdquo;  In the following April £150,000 was restored to the old-age pensioners, to people whose income did not exceed £15 12s. 0d.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We find that since 1922-1923, even with the restoration made from time to time in this House, and with the generous interpretation of the Old Age Pensions Acts, of which the Minister has told us about, that a sum of £563,500 is owing to the old age pensioners in 1931-1932 that was available to them in 1922-1923.  I think it is a reasonable proposition, and that it should have the support of every Deputy of this House that every possible facility should be given to a claimant for an old age pension to establish his claim.  It has been suggested very earnestly from this side of the House that the Minister for Local Government should issue instructions to the officers administering those Acts that a copy of the pension officer's estimate of means should be served on the claimants.  That very reasonable demand has been persistently resisted, and I am at a loss to know why that reasonable demand has <Col N="916" /> not been complied with.  It seems to me that the pensions officer's estimate of the means of the claimant to an old age pension ought to be an estimate that can be defended, and that the pension officer and the appeals officer could stand over.  It appears to me, if that is so, that there would be nothing wrong in supplying a copy of that estimate that goes to constitute the lump sum attributable to the person claiming the pension and that it ought to be before the claimant.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has argued that there is no necessity for that, on the grounds that the claimant has an opportunity of being present before the sub-committee when they are dealing with the case. It ought not be necessary to point out to the Minister or to any Deputy that while, in theory, it is possible for the claimant who is physically fit to be present at the sub-committee meetings when these cases are under consideration, it ought not be necessary to labour the fact that the average old age pensioner is not capable of adequately presenting his case, and in 99 cases out of 100 is utterly incapable of arguing his legal rights against the pension officer.  Apart altogether from the fact that the average claimant cannot properly defend his rights before the sub-committee, a very big percentage of the claimants are not physically fit to be present when the claim is being heard.  I think the Minister will agree that it is not of much advantage to a deaf claimant to be present while his case is being heard by the Old Age Pensions Committee.  If these people were furnished with a copy of the pensions officer's report regarding the means of livelihood, and that the fourteen days that are available for presenting additional evidence to the Local Government Department could be availed of to supply additional evidence, there would be much less likelihood of a miscarriage of justice than under the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of means, the pensions officer's estimate is usually made as a lump sum.  The claimant is <Col N="917" /> informed, say, that the officer estimates his means at £26 a year, but he does not say how the £26 is arrived at.  Let us suppose that a claimant has two cows.  We are given to understand a pension officer is instructed to value a cow at so much a year.  That system appears to me to be liable to lead to grave abuses and to a grave miscarriage of justice.  You might have a mountainy cow in the northern end of my constituency valued at the same amount as a cow in Kerry, or even in different parts of my county.  These old quadrupeds, classified largely as cows, have generally to live by their wits in the northern end of Monaghan, and the pension officer would more accurately described them if he put them down as an actual loss to the claimant rather than as being worth so much a year.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the estimate of income attributable to crops. The pension officer seems to have a uniform formula to solve all these difficulties. When that formula is given a uniform application, it is just as liable to err as the officer himself is liable to err in calculating the amount of butter fat in the milk of one cow as compared with another.  In many parts of Monaghan the crops have not been got in this year, and where they have, the seeds have rotted in the ground.  If the pension officer happens to make his estimate this year, it would be all right for the claimant.  If the officer calls during a good season and puts the estimate at its highest, that estimate will be binding for the rest of the pensioner's life, and an injustice is done in that way.  If a detailed statement were given as to how the estimate was arrived at, none of these errors would be likely to arise.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I have had reason to complain from time to time, namely, the system of notification adopted in the Appeals Department whereby it seems to be possible that when a person is notified that the officer has appealed on a particular statutory ground the pension is, in fact, subsequently disallowed on another statutory ground.  Some time ago I raised the matter here and the Minister <Col N="918" /> for Local Government appeared to be under the impression that such a thing would be impossible.  I have here before me particulars of two such cases.  One is the case of John Cusker, Appeal No. D. 703.  He received notification from the Appeals Department that the pension officer had appealed on grounds affecting the statutory qualification as to age against the decision of the sub-committee.  The claimant took steps to satisfy the Appeals Department as to his age.  These steps were successful and the Appeals Department were satisfied that he was of the required age.  Without further notification to the claimant the award of the sub-committee was reduced from 6s. to 4s.  When the claimant was notified that the pension officer had appealed on the grounds of statutory qualification as to age the claimant was entitled to assume, as any sensible or reasonably-minded man would assume, that the only statutory qualification that was being questioned was his age. The claimant appealed subsequently and applied for an increase in his pension and, in the course of a few months, it was increased by the sub-committee to 8s.  This time he was in a position to fight on the question of means and the pension officer again appealed.  He was notified that the statutory qualification as to means was to be brought in question.  He made all the representations that possibly could be made and he was awarded a pension of 7s.</P>
    <P>I submit that by reason of the manner in which that claimant was treated by the Appeals Department and had been notified that the only statutory qualification that was being questioned was one of age, he was deprived of 3/- a week for the period intervening between the original award and the subsequent one of 7/-.  I have details of another case in same district. The claimant's name is Matthew Skinneder, and the circumstances are exactly parallel with those of the case of John Cusker.  There is something radically wrong with a system that allows the possibility of such occurrences as I have mentioned.  These cases came under my personal notice during the past six months, and it is reasonable to assume that there must <Col N="919" /> be many other cases like them.  I hope that it will not be necessary to draw the Minister's attention to this matter in future, and I trust that the necessary instructions will be given to officers of the Appeals Department so that gross injustice will not be inflicted on old age pension claimants in future. The reasons advanced from time to time for not giving a more liberal interpretation of the Old Age Pensions Act have been the necessity for economy. I suggest to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Local Government that they should turn their attention in other directions.  There are many directions that have been pointed to from these benches in which necessary economies could be secured to permit of a more liberal interpretation being given to the Old Age Pensions Act.  It appears to me that a country that can afford to give pensions as high as £4,000 a year to ex-judges, that can afford to pay the amount to the Governor-General that was discussed in this House a few days back, something like £70 a day for the Governor-General and his establishment, can surely afford a more reasonable and generous interpretation to be given to this Act.</P>
    <P>Repeated complaint has been made in this House regarding paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911.  The majority of this House declared some time ago that it did not agree with the Minister's interpretation of that particular section.  We were given to understand in the debate of that particular section, the section which declares that in estimating the means of the claimant to an old age pension, account shall be taken of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant, that it would not be interpreted in the rigid sense in which it had been interpreted heretofore.  In order to make assurance doubly sure, the majority decided that it should be repealed altogether.  I submit that it should not be necessary to repeal that section at all.  The obvious interpretation and the obvious meaning of that section was that account should be taken of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by a claimant as a legal right. <Col N="920" /> The Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance insist upon interpreting that in the light of a meaning that was obviously never intended.  They claim that any benefit or privilege whatsoever must be taken into account, and that even charitable donations must be put down as income in estimating the claimant's means. That is entirely unfair and unjust.  It is a flagrant violation of the judgment of the majority in this House, after a very detailed debate on the matter.  It is a flagrant violation of the demand that a reasonable Irish interpretation be put on that section.</P>
    <P>I stated before in this House that that section was not interpreted in the sense in which it is now being interpreted when the British administered the Old Age Pension Act here.  I repeat that, and I have personal knowledge of the fact that only such privileges as were enjoyed as of legal right were taken into account in estimating the means of a claimant under the British régime in this country.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Department of Finance to withdraw the rigid instructions they have issued to pension officers and surveyors, the rigid instructions which makes it necessary to take into consideration the coppers that poor people get when going from door to door and even the loaves of bread which they get from the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  The law never intended that.  The British law never intended that, and injustices that were not inflicted by the British law and British administration should not be inflicted by a native administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very considerably restricted in the scope of our discussion on the Estimate inasmuch as we must confine ourselves entirely to the question of administration. As Deputy Ward stated it is not the question of administration to which most objection is taken in regard to old age pensions.  Contention has centred most on the question of appeals.  I think the Minister ought to know that there is a general feeling abroad amongst old age pensioners and those who have anything to do with the administration of the Act in the <Col N="921" /> country&mdash;I mean members of the sub-committees&mdash;that practically all cases are appealed almost as a matter of course and without any very definite or specific reason on the part of the pension officer.  One can quite recognise that on the part of many officers there is at least a temptation to take this line.  It might be deemed by them the line of least resistance. In any case it would be deemed to be the safe line, the line which is most likely to prevent criticism of their actions in case they did happen to misjudge a case and fail to appeal it when, in the opinion of their superior officers, they should have appealed.  As I say there is a grievance that they put the responsibility off their own shoulders by taking appeals in practically all cases.  I am not saying, and I am not in a position to say, because I have no figures before me, whether there is any justification for that statement or not, but it is a view and a belief that is very generally held. Perhaps some observations from the Minister when he is winding up this debate will help to explain what the position is and may enable his officers to know, if they do not already know as clearly as they should, that appeals should not be entered upon as a matter of course and in order to transfer responsibility to some higher authority. One effect that that would have, if there was an inordinate number of appeals, would be to clog the machinery at the headquarters of the Old Age Pensions Branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is complaint in some quarters regarding the delays that take place in deciding cases.  It is quite evident of course that delays in many cases are due to unavoidable reasons, where enquiries have to be made, but there is a feeling that delays are taking place which are not at all warranted.  Two points upon which appeals are most often taken are the question of age and the question of means.  In the matter of age, it is my experience that too much attention seems to be paid by both the pensions officers and the final deciding officer in the Local Government Department to old marriage certificates.  I do not know <Col N="922" /> whether anybody outside the Pension Office would have any regard for the age entered in old marriage certificates. I am sure we all know that 50 or 60 years ago there was not any desire on the part of people getting married to be absolutely truthful in regard to their ages any more than perhaps there is now.  In any case the woman getting married at that time, at the age of 25 or 30, did not scruple over age.  She made herself a few years younger in her marriage certificate. She never thought that 40 or 50 years afterwards her entry would be there to prevent her benefiting from the old age pension.  There are quite a number of these cases and while I do not suggest that they should not be taken into account and that regard should not be had to them I do feel that too much importance is attached to them and that when a document of that kind is produced evidence to rebut that requires to be very strong indeed and usually has to be in the nature of documentary evidence, strong and convincing documentary evidence too. That is one of the things I found in my experience of the working of the Act.  That is one thing in any case that seems to me to get more attention than it deserves in deciding these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ward has called attention to the manner of estimating means. Most of the cases I come in contact with are cases of people living on very small holdings of land.  The question of estimating means is no doubt a difficult one in these cases, but the number of appeals on the question of means has increased.  One can say that, I think, on the number of cases that have passed through the hands of Deputies. I wonder has the Minister or the Department taken into consideration that there ought to be a decided change in the estimate of means, in view of the wave of depression that is passing over the small farming community and the very much decreased value of the goods produced on these little holdings?  I do not know there is full account taken of that in estimating means.  As far as <Col N="923" /> my experience goes, it would appear to me that the same value is placed on whatever little stock or crops an applicant may have as was placed on them some time ago when prices were better.  I should like to know if that aspect of that question has been fully adverted to and instructions issued to the pensions officers accordingly.</P>
    <P>In regard to blind pensions, complaint is made at times of the delay in dealing with these cases.  It appears that it is necessary for the Department's inspector to investigate each case.  That being so, and the number of inspectors being limited, I am afraid a good deal of delay takes place.  I should like to urge upon the Minister that these are cases where no avoidable delay should take place in having the applicants examined and their cases decided.</P>
    <P>There is another small point with reference to cases in my own constituency. These are what the Minister knows as the Louisburgh cases, where certain irregularities occurred some years ago which nobody could defend. The old age pensioners, however, were not entirely to blame in the matter.  Attempts were made to recover the over-payments, but I think it would be found on investigation that had these claimants made application later on for pensions they would have been able to repay their debts, and now be in the enjoyment of their old age pensions.  Owing to a flaw or technicality, or whatever was the reason, they did not make their applications at the time they were entitled to get their pensions. They were not quite sure that they were entitled to the pensions, and they allowed the time to lapse.  Owing to a provision of the Act, pensions could not be granted for an earlier period than the date of application, and they did not get the pensions as from the time they had really reached the age of 70.  I should like the Minister to look into these cases which have been brought to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners and examine them again, with a view to seeing if it would be possible to write <Col N="924" /> off the amounts outstanding against them, and to allow them to get their pension, and enjoy it for the short time they can enjoy it, because in equity, apart from the Act itself, they would have been entitled to it at a much earlier period than they actually got it.</P>
    <P>I support the view of Deputy Ward in the matter of means, that the applicant ought to know the grounds on which the estimate of his means is made.  Instead of the total means being merely stated he ought to have some means of knowing the basis on which his means are estimated to be of a particular value.  Most of these people depend on others to put forward their claims, on local people, or on their representative on the county council, or their Deputy, or somebody of that kind.  The grounds on which the estimate of means is made ought to be available to whoever is representing them, so that it could be checked and the applicant directed as to what was his position and what were his chances and the best way of putting forward his claim.  I think that as we have, through legislation here, cut down the amounts available to the old age pensioners, we should at least see that the Act is administered as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been stated by two previous Deputies, the question of the administration of this Act arises largely on the matter of appeals. Perhaps the Minister would give us the figures as to what percentage of cases are appealed, and what number of these appeals is decided in favour of the Revenue Commissioners rather than the applicant.  We had before us recently an Auctioneers and Valuers Bill.  Many of us had interviews with interested parties regarding that measure who tried to impress upon us the need for having expert training in the valuation of different kinds of property and stock and crops.  I wonder what special training pensions officers have got in valuing stock and crops and other things which are taken into account in reckoning the income of applicants for old age pensions?  As <Col N="925" /> Deputies Ward and O'Connell have said, stock may have different values in different places.  The value of crops varies from locality to locality and from year to year.  The basis of estimating means should be supplied to the applicants when objection is raised. Regarding the statutory age, in many cases of course no birth or baptismal certificate is available and marriage certificates are practically worthless, as people interested in statistics will see that even up to a few years ago remarkably few ladies got married, say between the ages of 25 and 32.  There were obvious reasons for suspecting that the figures were not quite correct. In fact, the figures are notoriously unreliable. It is very difficult to discover what principles are followed in fixing the means, or in requiring proof, in the absence of birth or baptismal certificates, that a person had reached the statutory age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall quote just two cases from many which have come before me during the year, one to exemplify each of these points.  As regards means this is the application of Bernard Ward, of Ballinasloe.  He writes: &ldquo;I am in very bad circumstances. Owing to the Government tax on us, I had to give up my trade as a dealer.  In any case I am beyond work, being 73 years of age and under the doctor's care for rheumatism and kidney trouble.  My wife and six children live with me here. Two of my girls are earning six shillings and seven shillings a week respectively. My wife earns an occasional shilling selling delph in exchange for bottles.  Only for the St. Vincent de Paul Society we would die of hunger and want.  The local committee granted me the full old-age pension, but the pensions officer appealed against it.  I got 2s. a week for two years and last December it was raised to 5s.  There is now no sale for old feathers, rabbit skins, or anything that I used to make a living out of. Then again we poor dealers were taxed as travelling shops.  In the summer my wife used to go to a few race meetings with a little stall of fruit and sweets, but she cannot go since the <Col N="926" /> new tax was put on.  The `means' put against my claim for full pension is a small pony and car.  That was valued at £4 a year.  It is true the farmers used to give me an armful of hay for the pony or an hour's grazing when I was on the road, but is it not a shame to count that as means? The poor farmers have more heart than the pensions officer or the Government.&rdquo; I do not think it was fair to put £4 per year as the value of the pony and cart.  He had nothing to feed the pony on, and owing to the tax they could make nothing out of the travelling shop.  It seemed more of a liability than an asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has 5s. a week, but I think he should get the 10s.  Now, with regard to the statutory age, there was a case of appeal No. D. 2730, Michael Moloney, Abbey, Loughrea. His father's name was Thomas Moloney, and his mother's maiden name was Bridget Conway, and these are their children: Michael, applicant, no written record of age; Mary, died in infancy, no written record; Pat, born March, 1865&mdash;he would be 66 now &mdash;and Thomas, the fourth child, no written record of age.  Evidence of age was supplied in Michael's case for the pension by a statutory declaration made by Patrick Lynch.  I mention these two cases because I investigated them.  I have asked the clergy and other responsible people were the facts as stated, and I am told that they were.  Now the statutory declaration by Patrick Lynch, Abbey, who was born on March 1st, 1850&mdash;he is not an old age pensioner nor any relative of the applicant, and he is what is called in Galway a strong farmer&mdash; declares that he was nine years of age when Michael was born, that he heard of Mary but did not remember ever having seen her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the statutory declaration made by John Nevin, also a strong farmer, and no relative of the applicant, he says: &ldquo;The applicant's parents worked for his people up to the time of Michael's birth, and that Nevin's parents often told him that the applicant was three <Col N="927" /> years younger than he, Nevin, was. That he heard of Mary, but did not remember ever having seen her, and that the applicant was now 72 years of age.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is the statutory declaration by Thomas Larkin, nephew of applicant, and 43 years of age.  He states that his grandmother, the applicant's mother, often spoke to him of his Aunt Mary, applicant's sister, and that when he was about thirteen years of age his grandmother took him one day to the Abbey graveyard and there pointed out to him the grave in which Mary was buried.</P>
    <P>The pensions officer apparently would not take the statutory declaration of these two independent farmers, and denies the existence of Mary.  He believed apparently that, following classical mythology, she sprang from the brain of this applicant or his nephew.  If those two affidavits are not sufficient proof of this man's age I wonder what proof of age the Minister and his Department would require in a case like that?  The weight of evidence is certainly in favour of the applicant.  There is no objection raised by the pensions officer on the head of means, and in such a case like that the weight of evidence should apply in favour of the applicant, and he should get the full pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the appeal put forward by other Deputies in regard to this question of means of old age pensioners.  I know definitely where the regulations on the question of means are unfair.  Yet appeals against the decisions of the pensions committee have been upheld by the Department. Persons conversant with how their neighbours are living, particularly in country districts where they have for years been acquainted with the old people, who are probably the very best citizens in the State, working hard all their lives, must feel aggrieved when they see the Government Department turning down their claims or disallowing their pensions or giving only part pensions of 2/- or 3/- weekly, particularly when they consider that men in the prime of life and capable of earning <Col N="928" /> more than is adequate for their needs and their families are receiving very substantial pensions from the Government.  I appeal to the Minister and to those in charge of this Department to have the whole regulations scrapped.  The time is ripe when it would be good policy for the State to grant to the old people when they come to 70 years of age not merely a part but the full pension.  I know cases where families have to receive home assistance, while at the same time members of the family are only receiving part pensions of 6/- or 7/- a week, the difference between that and the full pension being in dispute.  I think that is a mistake.  I recently called the attention of the Department to two or three cases without any result.  The Department upheld the objections raised by the pensions officer.  I know that although the pensions officer based his calculation probably on his visits of a couple of years ago, these calculations are still upheld by the pensions department.  Circumstances change very quickly in rural districts. In the present position of things in the country, there is certainly a wave of depression, and though many homesteads and families try to keep the best side out, they are very badly depressed at times.  I have two or three instances in mind of old people who have made fresh applications to have their claims reconsidered and be granted full pension, but still they are turned down and their claims disallowed. I submit to the Minister and his Department that this method of calculating means which other Deputies have referred to and which I have personal knowledge of is unfair.  I admit in a couple of cases I was satisfied that the pensions department were right in their calculation. I will admit that, but in the generality of cases that are turned down I think the calculation is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy has mentioned a case which is typical of others.  I know of one case where a man has been working all his lifetime on a farm.  He applied for a pension.  Naturally in the present state of affairs a farmer, who has a family of his own to look <Col N="929" /> after, cannot afford to be overgenerous with an old employee.  He has to replace him with an efficient worker.  Still as he has given faithful service he likes to help him in his declining years.  He helps him to apply for the pension.  The old person has a wish to remain with him.  He is capable of doing simple jobs around the farmstead.  I think it is not fair that those little perquisites which such a man would receive should be taken so closely into consideration.  If the poor old man leaves the farm and goes into the County Home or becomes destitute on the road, he can qualify for a pension.  Simply because he desires to remain on there, and the farmer is generous enough to let him remain for the rest of his life in the place, he cannot. I think exceptional cases like that should be considered on their merits, and that a hard and fast regulation should not be imposed to debar such applicants from a pension.</P>
    <P>After all, in this country there has been a sense of hospitality.  We are often told that Government Departments have to do things in a businesslike way.  I think in the long run a little bit of hospitality, if you like, should be extended in those cases.  It would be all to the good, and no taxpayer would grumble if a little extra money had to be found to meet these cases.</P>
    <P>I therefore strongly support the plea put forward that this regulation governing the question of means should be recast and should receive absolutely new consideration in the Department. Something should be done to wipe away the unnecessary regulations which are preventing a lot of people who are the best of citizens, who have worked all their lives as farm workers and given the best services they could give as good citizens, from getting pensions. For the two or three or even eight or nine years they have to live the State should not penalise them in their old age, and I would add my appeal to other Deputies' that this regulation should be looked into and recast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. J. White Mr. J. White">

      <P>May I draw the attention of the Minister to a complaint <Col N="930" /> made to me as to the calculation of the value of a stack of turf as part of the means of a pensioner in reckoning up his statutory means?  Everyone knows that an applicant for an old age pension is not in a position to go to a mountain and save turf.  The turf is saved by the grandchildren of the pensioner or by their father and mother. I do not think that it is fair or equitable that a pensions officer should measure up the value of a stack of turf in calculating the means of an old age pensioner.  Another thing is that affidavits and declarations as to the ages of old age pensioners made by very respectable, humble people have often been turned down.  These matters I would like to bring to the Minister's attention, particularly the calculation of the value of a stack of turf which the old age pensioner had no hand in saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any subject we might discuss in this House so popular or that there is any work a person does that brings so much satisfaction to the individual as helping a deserving applicant to get a pension. Most of the objections arise on two heads&mdash;age and means.  I would like to ask the Minister would the 1871 census not be available now so that comparison might be made in the matter.</P>
      <P>My experience is that the friends of a lot of the applicants will not take the trouble to assist them in presenting their claims.  I was amongst those aggrieved at being turned down at the Custom House, but while I, perhaps, said some very hard things, still it does not prevent my looking at the other side.  I found that, with a bit of care in building up a case, you can get evidence for the applicant.  When people come to Deputies to ask them to do something for them in their own business they find they are the very last persons themselves to move in the matter.  I think that if the friends of the applicants were just as energetic as the Deputies have to be they could give the pensions officer a great deal of help in the matter of finding out the age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> While I have every sympathy with and belief in the affidavits that people send in on behalf of applicants, I see, too, that the pensions officer and the Pensions Department must be careful. Last year, in my own experience, a lady applicant who was turned down applied to me to see if anything could be done.  I examined her case.  She was a great-grandmother, and by a fair calculation one would have thought that she surely would have got the pension.  We made further search and discovered in the end a certificate showing that she would be entitled to the pension this coming September.  I mention that merely to show that we must not take up the attitude that the pensions officer is necessarily always down on the claimant.</P>
    <P>Other cases could be mentioned, but I suppose there will be always cases on the border-line as far as means goes.  I always think it a pity that in the matter of old age pensions, as well as outdoor relief, the hardship should be put on the thrifty.  There are numbers of people through the country who have been hard-working and industrious, who kept their homes clean and tidy, and who always put up a good front, and it is that class which has made a brave fight that is turned down, whilst others who, perhaps, had better opportunities and who do not keep their homes tidy got the pension.  I suppose that will be always a difficult question.</P>
    <P>It was refreshing a moment ago to hear the tribute Deputy Ward and, I think, Deputy O'Connell, paid to the good old British days, when a liberal interpretation was put on all these claims.  There are cases where it is very hard to understand how the amount granted is arrived at.  A case was brought to my notice last year where the applicant could not find proof of her age.  Everyone believed that she was 70 years of age.  I wrote to the Department asking them to send down an inspector.  The inspector came and was not satisfied that the applicant was the age.  A month later another Deputy moved in the matter, <Col N="932" /> and the pension was granted.  While one might feel jealous about that, the point I want to make is that this old woman, who was penniless, living in a cottier house, was only granted 6/- weekly.  My contention is that she was entitled to 10/- or to nothing.  I cannot understand how 6/- was arrived at considering her circumstances.  She satisfied the authorities that she was the age, so she was entitled to the full pension or nothing.  When these things crop up one cannot understand them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other matter and the complaints that have been made about not being able to have personal representations, I have no ambition to be a trouble to anyone about pensions. I have plenty to do during my free time in Dublin without that.  I think the officers doing this work ought to be able to do it without the personal intervention of Deputies.  I found that when I put a straight case before them on paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the interpretation of the Old Age Pensions Act in a general way is that it is most unfair to the applicant.  If I instance a case where applicants <Col N="933" /> are refused pensions on the grounds of means I will then have to investigate upon what justification. In order to do so I will have to deal first with the application which must of necessity be made by the applicant. That application is sent to the local pension officer, who in most cases&mdash;I am not exaggerating when I say this&mdash; is a person with no practical knowledge of conditions in the country. The pension officers I have met are largely taken from the cities and towns, and they have no local knowledge of conditions in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes they are mere boys and they are asked to go and investigate claims for pensions.  Their practical knowledge of the conditions in the rural areas is nil.  I cannot understand on what basis they make calculations of means.  I have been over ten years a member of a pensions sub-committee and I have never heard that basis explained. These officers are instructed from headquarters, either by the Minister for Finance or by his Department, to calculate the means of applicants for the old age pensions.  They calculate the means on some basis and they are instructed not to disclose that basis to the sub-committee before which the claims are heard.  Leaving aside the ordinary qualifications of these officers, who attain the standard of 100 per cent. in their civil service examinations, in the great majority of cases they are men with no practical knowledge of conditions in the country. Their sole basis of calculation is determined by some figure submitted to them by the Department under which they work.  That shows how incapable these men are to calculate the actual income of applicants for the pension in rural districts.  I was told some time ago about a pension officer who had to return the apparent means of an applicant and who mentioned that the person had two pigs.  The supervisor, anxious to elucidate further information as to the possible value of the pigs, sent a memorandum back to the officer asking what class of pigs they were, whether bonhams, cows, or boars.  The officer in his reply stated that he had not very much <Col N="934" /> knowledge of pigs but that from appearance he believed they were between five and six years old.</P>
    <P>That would be an ordinary answer to expect from most of the pension officers who are sent out to investigate the means of the farmer, including his pig stock, poultry stock, and farm stock generally; because these men, some of them boys, have no practical knowledge whatever af the conditions that exist in rural areas.  To send these chaps around with definite instructions from headquarters here in Dublin, with no knowledge whatever of the rural conditions that exist in this country and their prejudice against those living in the rural areas &mdash;the city man's prejudice against the unfortunate person living in the country, regarding him as a person who has everything at his disposal, with all his advantages to contrast as against the conditions of the city man&mdash;is, I say, an unfair way of calculating the means of claimants.  The pension officer is in most cases a city man or a townsman. Along these lines, I do assert that no justice or fair play has been extended to the applicants for old age pensions in rural areas.  It is too much under present conditions to expect.  One of the most extraordinary things that I have always protested against in connection with the appointment to the position of Excise officer of a boy from the city or town is that he is debarred from taking education from those who could give it to him on this important question of calculating the means.  The pension officer is not permitted to give or discuss the basis of the calculation of means of the applicant before the only tribunal before which the applicant can come.  He is prevented from discussing the question of means with the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, it is not necessary for the pension officer at all to attend that sub-committee.  He goes to the applicant's home without giving notice of his visit.  The applicant is quite unaware of the time when he is to visit and quite unprepared to meet him.  Having investigated the question of means in his own way, the pension officer calculates the total sum of the <Col N="935" /> applicant's income.  Not alone does he take down the statement of the applicant, but he goes over the farm and sees for himself.  He checks what he sees, by what he has heard from the applicant on the question of means.</P>
    <P>Having done that, then there is the sub-committee which is composed of people from the locality, people who are not old age pensioners themselves, but people who are responsible to the extent that they are public representatives. It is only public representatives who can sit on that committee.  These people have full local knowledge as to the value of the means of the farmer. But they sit bewildered because the pension officer, after his assessment of the calculation of means, gives in round figures what he estimates these at.  If he is there&mdash;and he may not necessarily be there&mdash;when they ask how he has calculated certain items of stock set out his memorandum, and what value he puts on two cows, four cows, or one cow, or on a certain number of pigs, or on a certain number of poultry, he will refuse to answer.</P>
    <P>I ask the House is that an honest attempt to enable a fair calculation of means to be estimated?  You have a pension officer with no knowledge whatever of local conditions, but only instructions from the Minister for Finance or his Department upon the calculation of means.  You have his sum total set down in round figures. That is submitted to the committee of representative people who know all about the business of their own locality, people who sit by right of statute in their position as a sub-committee to investigate pension claims. Yet the pension officer will refuse to discuss details as to how he estimates the means.</P>
    <P>We then come to the next stage.  The sub-committee having discussed or heard the case put forward by the applicant, and using their own commonsense judgment and practical experience as to the value in full of the applicant's income, estimate what they consider within the law should be the fair pension given to that person. I am speaking of this matter as one <Col N="936" /> who has had ten years' experience at least.  I do assert, subject of course to contradiction, that in most cases the amount submitted by the pension officer is doubted very much by the sub-committee and refuted by them, and in the majority of cases their calculation or estimate of the means is very much less.</P>
    <P>We then come to the next stage.  Regardless of what decision the sub-committee may come to, the pension officer's estimate will stand.  The case is then submitted to the Appeals Board.  There the most extraordinary injustice of all occurs.  You have on the one hand the expert whose duty it is to examine the claimant's case, to write up all details of his case and furnish it according to the technical requirements of his training and of his office.  You have on the other hand the unfortunate applicant whose only appeal consists of going before a collection of men sitting as a sub-committee. After that the sub-committee hears the evidence.  The position is that that evidence is not taken down. They are not supplied with a secretary, whose duty it is to furnish a report, or with a stenographer who would take notes of the applicant's evidence. The decision come to by that committee as to the applicant's means is generally in contradiction to the decision or evidence of the pension officer.  I want to have detailed information furnished according to the technique of his office by the pension officer who prepared that information at the dictation or request to the office of which he is a servant.  On the other hand, there is merely the submission of the contradictory information of the subsidiary committee.  The Department in this matter sit behind closed doors until the case is finally decided.  The pension officer sits behind closed doors and the decision is given.</P>
    <P>There you have a fair outline of the conditions under which the old age pension applicants labour from start to finish.  I do not think that a more unfair or a more unjust application of any order of Government could exist than exits in the particular case of the old age pensioner.  I listened to Deputy White.  He referred to the injustice <Col N="937" /> that existed in calculating as part of the income the stack of turf owned by the applicant.  If that were the only injustice that existed I think it would be a very small detail.  I have no doubt Deputy White is sincere in his objection and he has before his mind some cases in which a stack of turf did operate unjustly against the applicant. But I have in mind a series of cases accumulated that would justify me in making a considered statement from my ten years' experience as a member of a sub-committee of pensions.  I submit that the whole administration of old age pensions is biassed and unjust as far as the applicants are concerned.</P>
    <P>If my objection consisted as Deputy White's of minor cases such as the value of a stack of turf I might consider that it would be sufficient to raise my voice and mention these matters to have them corrected, but I am afraid that Deputy White in confining himself to that minor objection lacked the experience of one or two years which would be necessary on an old age pension committee, to show him that the objection did not consist in the unjust valuation of a stack of turf but in the unjust administration of the whole Act by the State.  I do not like to go into the whole matter.  Probably it would be wearisome, but there is just this one other item to which I would like to refer and it is this, that again the bias of officialism towards old age pension applicants is very evident. When we come to deal with the case of the claimant and his difficulties, I can show legitimate difficulties in procuring the requisite evidence of age.</P>
    <P>Recently there was an instance&mdash;one of a number&mdash;where an applicant could not find his age in the official records. At the time of his application he was resident in County Leitrim, but he was born in an adjoining county, and any reference to his age could only be found in the parish register or possibly in the school.  The man was an invalid, and his wife was comparatively aged like himself.  They were people without means.  The onus of proof as to age rested on them.  I know that applicant's wife had to borrow that from her neighbours, a sum of money <Col N="938" /> not very large, to enable her to pay the bus fare to a place within ten miles of the district in which alone she could find evidence as to the age of her husband.  Having borrowed the money she walked the remainder of the journey.  Having found some evidence of age, she started on her return journey, and she found herself deposited by the bus at eleven o'clock at night eleven miles from her own home, under conditions that some people would consider to be inhuman if applied to people of more vigorous years.  I do assert that where cases of that sort arise that the machinery of the State, at not so much expense to the State, should be sufficient to enable investigations as to age in such cases to be carried out and undertaken by the pension officer or by some official method, rather than inflict undue hardship upon applicants.  I refer to it as one item of a number of items of hardship that my experience of pension work for a number of years has given me.  This whole question of the administration of old age pensions is worked in a biassed way by the Department to secure, as far as can be secured, regardless of what a man's means may be, the safeguarding, I suppose, the Minister for Finance would say of the general taxpayer.  I do not think that the methods are right, and I hope the House will express itself in that direction when the vote is being taken.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult for a Minister who has any responsibility to pay much attention to a debate if there are a great many speeches made in that debate like the speech made by the Deputy who has just sat down. The Deputy summed up his remarks, I think, in the middle by saying that the whole administration was biassed and unjust, so far as the applicants were concerned.  I have not the least hesitation in saying that that statement is not alone without foundation, but that it is entirely a ridiculous statement, and that the Deputy knows it to be so. Deputy Haslett, on the other hand, made what I think was a reasonable speech.  If, in these old age pension <Col N="939" /> debates, we had more speeches like that delivered by Deputy Haslett, the debates would be much more effective and much more useful both to the Department which is administering the Act and to the old age pensioners themselves.  There are something like 118,000 old age pensioners.  There are something like 20,000 claims investigated every year.  The work is done by officers who have all sorts of individual views on political and other matters, by officers who do not owe their appointments to any favouritism or to any sort of jobbery, officers who are in the posts they hold as a result of competitive examination; officers who are under no obligation to the administration, and who could not, if the Government wished to do it, be instructed or compelled to do anything else than administer the Acts fairly and impartially.</P>
      <P>If there was a suggestion that an officer would gain credit with his Department by having a pension refused when in law and in justice the pension ought to be granted, that fact could not be concealed for a week.  That fact would be bound to become public. Deputies, no matter what they say or what they may do politically from the point of view of vote-catching in these debates, know perfectly well that the pension officers are not interfered with, and they know perfectly well that the object of the officers is to give fair play to the pensioners without, at the same time so far as they can avoid it, granting pensions to people who are not entitled to them by law.  No system dealing with such large numbers of cases can be so perfect that an error will never occur, or that there can be no instances of any injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would venture to say that out of 20,000 cases examined in the courts of law, with counsel on both sides, and with every assistance given to the tribunal, no mistakes were made and that no injustice occurred.  In fact, if we were to judge by the frequency with which appeals are heard, one would be inclined to say that out of 20,000 cases decided there <Col N="940" /> must have been a considerable number of errors.  I have no doubt that out of 20,000 cases decided annually in connection with applications for old age pensions, there must be a number of decisions which are not correct.  If that is so, however, there are at least as many cases in which either a pension is granted that should not be granted or a pension is given greater than that which should be given. There are cases in which a pension is refused when it should not be refused, just as there are cases in which a pension is fixed at an amount less than ought to be given.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made an appeal in connection with the Louisburgh cases.  The Deputy is aware that in Louisburgh and neighbouring districts there was some years ago a huge conspiracy to defraud the Exchequer, from which a sum, as far as I can remember, of about £15,000 was drawn over a period of years by people who were not entitled to old age pensions but who procured them by giving bribes to a couple of parish clerks who prepared false certificates which were carelessly signed by clergymen when the parish clerks put them up for signature. That is an illustration of the sort of difficulty that has to be contended with.  It is an illustration of the fact that, in spite of every care being taken, pensions will be granted which should not be granted.  The fact that a man or woman is an applicant for a pension does not prove that everything they say is absolutely true and that the pension officer who casts doubt upon the matter is a hardhearted ruffian trying to administer the law in a biassed way against the poor of the country.  Cases are frequently turning up of people who allege that they can get no birth certificate and who try to prove their age by means of affidavits but who, a year or two later, when they reach the prescribed age, discover that they are able to get certificates. Many such cases have been brought to my notice.</P>
    <P>That illustrates the fact that some care has to be exercised in accepting affidavits.  If a clear affidavit is made by somebody who has good ground for <Col N="941" /> knowing the age of the applicant, and who will state his views directly and clearly and who is a person who is known to be respectable and in full possession of his faculties, such affidavit will be accepted, but care has to be exercised.  As regards the question of means, we are often up against cases where something brings to light the fact that the means of the pensioner were greater than the amount stated when his pension was granted.  When legislation was before the House some years ago in regard to changing the amount of the pension, a large number of Deputies stated that in numerous parts of the country there were well-off people receiving the pension.  No details, however, were put forward.  I do not think that any Deputy ever put his finger on an individual case&mdash;if it happened I do not recollect it&mdash;and said that so-and-so was receiving a pension to which he was not entitled.  Deputies would be unwilling to do that even if they were aware of such cases, but we would hear them loud and long if pensions were refused in such cases.  Nevertheless, there was a great deal of talk about large numbers of people being in receipt of pensions who, by reason of means, were not entitled to them.  As I have said, an occasional occurrence and subsequent events will enable us to get at the true facts, showing that, despite the care taken in administering the Act, there are undoubtedly people with substantial means which they manage to conceal from the knowledge of the committee and so obtain the pension.</P>
    <P>The pension officer has to bear all these facts in mind, and has also to bear in mind the fact that there are relatively few people on pension committees&mdash;people who will take part in public affairs or engage in any activity in connection with old age pensions&mdash; who will definitely in all cases state what their real views are.  They are quite willing to state their views and make a plea when asking that a pension should be granted, but few people are willing to give the pensions officer any assistance when it is a case in which a pension should not be granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> The pensions officers labour under very considerable difficulties in that respect, and also in their dealings with pension committees.  There are some committees in the country which really take their work seriously and try to do it in a conscientious way.  The majority of committees do not take their work seriously, and do not regard themselves as being called on to act in a judicial spirit; they are out definitely to get pensions almost for all claimants. Deputy Maguire said that old age pension officers are mere boys, and his suggestion was that these mere boys should be subjected to browbeating by the committee in order that more people should get pensions.  I do not think that the sort of discussion which Deputy Maguire would like to see would do anything towards getting the Act fairly and reasonably administered.</P>

      <P>A good number of the pension officers are relatively young, but the pension officers always work in close touch with the Surveyor, who is always an officer of many years' experience, an officer of long service, and is an officer who has had a great deal of experience of this work.  I have already stated to the House that, in connection with the estimation of means, the Departments concerned in the matter, the Department of Local Government and the Revenue Officers, work in close harmony with the Department of Agriculture, and that at intervals representatives of these Departments have had conferences with representatives of the Department of Agriculture with a view to seeing that as far as possible the estimates that are put on various kinds of farm produce are in accordance with the current market rate, and that in all other respects the value of the farm produce of any sort is correctly estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haslett talked about penalising thrift.  Undoubtedly that is one of the defects of the system of old age pensions that we have.  It does mean the penalising of thrift.  It does mean, if Deputies like to put it that way, the penalising of industry, but, on the other hand, if we were not prepared to do that, then we must be prepared to go the whole hog.  We must be prepared to grant old age pensions to all persons who reach the age of 70 irrespective of their means. If we were to do that the result would be something like doubling our Old Age Pensions Bill.  I speak from memory, and I have not the exact <Col N="944" /> figures, but we would increase the Old Age Pensions Bill to something like that extent.  We cannot afford to do that.  No social advantages would accrue which would justify such a very great increase in expenditure.  If we are not going to do that, and if we are going to have a means limit, then we cannot avoid penalising thrift to some degree.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the question of benefits or privileges to which the applicant is not legally entitled. I say, as I said in this House before, that there has been no change in the practice in regard to dealing with benefits or privileges of that sort. Deputy Ward and other Deputies have positively asserted that there has been a change, that means arising out of benefits or privileges to which the applicant was not legally entitled were not taken into account during the time of the British administration.  That statement is incorrect.  The Act provides that such things shall be taken into account.  The Act in that respect was administered here by the British authorities exactly in the way in which it is being administered now.  If we were not to have regard to benefits and privileges of that sort, we would again increase the Old Age Pensions Bill without, in many cases, doing anything of any advantage to the people who would receive pensions.  There is a great number of people being supported by relatives on whom they have no legal claim, being supported even in homes of relative luxury.  There is no reason at all why the old age pension should be paid in such cases.  It would perhaps be welcome to the old people as pocket money of their own, but it is not a necessity by any means.  If we were to increase the Old Age Pensions Bill by paying pensions in such cases we would simply increase the burden on people who are deprived of all luxury already, people who cannot bear any increased burden.  All these claims that we hear for giving pensions &mdash;and higher pensions&mdash;to people who have means are all proposals to throw additional burdens on people who have no means or people who are depending on the old age pension alone, people <Col N="945" /> who are less well off than many who are depending on the old age pension alone.</P>
    <P>I think I need say no more than this, that the Act is fairly and sympathetically administered, that while there may be, and undoubtedly are, cases where mistakes occur against applicants, just as there are cases in which mistakes occur in favour of applicants, there is no desire that anybody that has a just claim to a pension should be refused a pension.  The desire is to give a pension to such person.  There is nothing to be gained in any personal way by an officer as a result of refusing a pension.  In fact if an officer were found to be refusing pensions which he should not refuse, to be exceeding his duty in that way, it would be bad for that particular officer.  It would be a form of misconduct for an officer to do such a thing.  The officers, taking them as a body, are just as humane as other people and I think, taking them on the average, that officers do everything they can to give pensions to those who are entitled to them.  On the other hand, an officer is an official and he is not out looking for votes or for electoral popularity.  He has regard for both sides of the case. I agree with Deputy Haslett that it is undesirable that an old age pensioner should have to apply to any Deputy in order to get his case fully heard.  A lot of old age pensioners may not have a ready means of approaching a Deputy and it would certainly to an injustice that such people should not get what they are entitled to, while those who had means of approaching a Deputy were going to get it.  It is most undesirable that Deputies should come into the matter at all or that there should be any reason for their coming into the matter.  The Act should be administered in such a way that every person should get what he is entitled to and that he should be under no obligation to anybody in respect of that.</P>
    <P>I am desirous of having the Act administered in that way.  I think that the difficulties which occur very often are due to the negligence of friends and neighbours to take a little care in the matter.  If those who are able to <Col N="946" /> get affidavits would just take a little trouble about them no difficulties would arise.  I do not know that it is possible to give any greater help to pensioners than is given at present. We are certainly not going to employ officers to go all over the country looking for evidence which might not be there.  I think a great deal of the intervention of Deputies ought not to be and is not necessary and that a great many cases would be decided just as they are being decided if Deputies did not write any letters about them. These debates interest me very little, because I believe there is a tremendous lot of electioneering connected with the whole of the discussion we have had here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Defence which, on looking at the Order Paper, I found had been altered to the Minister for Justice.  The question was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If he is aware that considerable uneasiness exists in the minds of the people throughout the country as a consequence of his action in ordering the Great Southern Railway Company to cancel all trains scheduled to run to Bodenstown for the Wolfe Tone Commemoration on Sunday, June 21st, and of the appearance in the streets on that day of a large body of troops with <Col N="948" /> full war-kit; and if he will state the reasons for his action in so interfering with a ceremony of this nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer to the question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  The reason for the interference with the ceremony was that a parade of an organisation purporting to be a military force not established and maintained by law was about to take place, and that the holding of such a parade is contrary to law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such an unprecedented action and unwarranted interference with a peaceful demonstration of the adherence of the people of this country to the principles of the father of Republicanism certainly calls for more than usual comment in the Parliament which controls the destinies of the Twentysix counties.  I asked the President to-day whether it would be possible to give more than the ordinary half-hour that is allowed on the adjournment for a discussion on this matter, because I believed there would be other Deputies sufficiently interested who would want to enter their protest, together with mine, against this unconstitutional interference with a peaceful demonstration, and it is regrettable to note that nobody else seemed to have sufficient interest in the matter to take any notice of the reply which the President gave to my question.</P>
    <P>Coming back to Sunday, 21st June, the clearest way in which I can convey to Deputies the occurrence which took place will be to quote from various newspapers in regard to the answer given to the first part of the question.  The Minister denied that there was any uneasiness in the minds of the public in regard to the action taken on that day.  The following is an extract from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of 22nd June:&mdash;&ldquo;The cancelling of the special trains to Sallins in connection with the celebration had led many people to expect excitement and Sallins itself was on tiptoe.&rdquo;  Further on the same paper says:&mdash;&ldquo;Outside <Col N="949" /> the station (that is, Kingsbridge) a detachment of troops in full service kit were stationed, and with them was Commandant Smith, O.C. of the Signalling Corps, who had one of the new Army motor wireless cars with him, and was in direct communication with Command Headquarters at the Curragh.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; of the same day, we had the following report:&mdash;&ldquo;The news of the cancellation of the special trains, which was made known at an early hour on Sunday morning caused something of a sensation.&rdquo; Further on the same paper says:&mdash;&ldquo;As a Republican muster at Tone's grave, it was expected to have been the largest held for many years, and preparations on a large scale had been made at Sallins to cater for the wants of the thousands of excursionists to Bodenstown.&rdquo;  Making inquiries afterwards from a reliable source, I was able to form an estimate of the number of people who had purchased tickets, and who would, through the Railway Company's service, have availed of the excursion fares to Bodenstown, and that number stands at 17,000.  Further on, in the same account, &ldquo;The Cork Examiner&rdquo; of the 22nd June, we find it stated:&mdash;&ldquo;Special trains were to run from Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Dublin, Belfast and other places. At the several points large crowds had prepared to avail of the railway facilities.&rdquo; We find it stated in the same issue of the same paper: &ldquo;It must be mentioned that the anniversary celebrations of Wolfe Tone have, for the last eight years, been observed by at least three distinct bodies of public opinion.  There has never been any clash, and it, therefore, came in the nature of a sensation this morning, when it was learned that the authorities had issued orders to the Railway Company to cancel all the special trains that had been scheduled for the event.&rdquo;  Further on, we find this bald statement:&mdash;&ldquo;Wild rumours spread throughout the city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his reply stated that there was no uneasiness in the minds of the public.  Yet responsible papers such as &ldquo;The Cork <Col N="950" /> Examiner,&rdquo; which is a consistent and unadulterated supporter of the Government, states on the authority of its correspondent, that &ldquo;wild rumours spread throughout the city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At 9 a.m. on Sunday morning, Mr. Floyd, Manager of the Great Southern Railways, informed Mr. MacBride, Acting Secretary to the Committee, that they had received instructions from the Government, late on Saturday night, to cancel all special trains scheduled to run from all parts of the Free State to Bodenstown.  Mr. Floyd, at that time, refused to accept any responsibility for doing that, and informed the Government that it would leave him open to legal proceedings. At 11 o'clock that night he received a written order, signed by the Minister for Defence, ordering him to obey the order which was issued before that over the telephone.  For three weeks prior to the issue of the order by the Minister for Defence, full details of the celebration that was proposed to be held in Bodenstown were printed in the weekly Press in Dublin.  A map, giving full details of the points of assembly of the different contingents expected to take part, was printed in at least two weekly papers in Dublin. Although they realised, quite as keenly as they did on the night before the celebrations, that such a large concourse of people would assemble at Bodenstown no action whatever was taken.</P>
    <P>People were allowed to purchase tickets and all arrangements were permitted to continue.  No arrests were made and a feeling of confidence in the achievement of the event was allowed to permeate the minds of the people throughout the country.  Then came this sensation.  According to the Press we further find that the cancellation of the special trains, it appears, was the result of conferences between the Gárda Síochána authorities and the Government.  But strange to say no such notification of this cancellation of trains was received by members, or by the Secretary of the Wolfe Tone Commemoration Committee, until 9 a.m. on the following morning, Sunday, June 21st.  The first notification that was received <Col N="951" /> by the people in the city, generally, was in the issue of &ldquo;The Sunday Independent&rdquo; of that morning, which contained in a small square in the front page a notice that all special trains to Sallins were cancelled.  The Honorary Secretary, Michael Price, and Seán Russell, who was to deliver the oration, were arrested on Saturday night and the charge, as we are given to understand by the Press report, of being about to commit or being suspected of being about to commit a felony was preferred against them.</P>
    <P>Other Press accounts stated that no charge was made against them.  The &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; on 22nd June contained the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Outside the station at Kingsbridge were thirty I.O.C. buses which took on board numbers of people with railway tickets and conveyed them to Bodenstown.&rdquo; The Government by orders issued by the Minister for Defence banned the running of trains to Bodenstown and at the same time, at 1 o'clock on Sunday, 21st June, stultified themselves and contradicted their own order and held themselves up to ridicule by permitting a fleet of buses run by the very same company whose trains they had banned, to transport the people from the city of Dublin to the celebrations at Bodenstown.  Surely the Minister in charge of these comic opera operations sees something ridiculous, if he is not lost to all sense of humour, in the situation in attempting to interfere with the success of the commemoration in Bodenstown by banning trains but eventually forgot that there was such a thing as motor transport. Thirty-five buses run by the Great Southern Railways accepted tickets issued by the railway company and transported over 1,000 people to Bodenstown at 1 o'clock on Sunday, the trains for 1 o'clock and 1.15 having been previously banned by the authorities.  The Minister denies there was any uneasiness in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>I went to Kingsbridge on Sunday morning at 11 a.m. and the first thing I discovered was that all troops had <Col N="952" /> been confined to barracks in the city of Dublin since Saturday night.  About five minutes after I arrived at Kingsbridge some sixty police with batons arrived and took up positions in sections at different points at the station. Shortly after the arrival of the Gárda Síochána something like 100 troops equipped with full war outfit and wearing trench helmets, which I have never seen in the Free State before, arrived.</P>
    <P>They made a pretty impressive display. Troops lined the streets on one side and police lined the streets on the other.  A very strange thing occurred which it would be interesting for the Minister to know.  A religious pilgrimage, consisting of about 1,000 people, arrived from Waterford under the charge of a priest.  As this pilgrimage reached the gate at Kingsbridge Station about 1 p.m., 100 troops with steel helmets, with machine-guns in front and machine-guns in the rear, arrived at the same gate.  On the orders of the military officer the pilgrimage, which was under the charge of a priest, was put aside, and told to get over until the troops took over the station.  Certainly it was a very fine reception for a pilgrimage coming up to the Grotto at Dublin to honour Christ, their King, to be met with a war-like array of the Irish Free State Army.</P>
    <P>Another extraordinary thing which bears out the uneasiness which existed in the minds of the people was that this parade of troops, composed of 100 soldiers with trench helmets and all the other accoutrements of war, arrived at Kingsbridge and reported to Superintendent O'Connell, of the Gárda Síochána.  Superintendent O'Connell advanced to the front of the parade.  The military officer in charge of the parade saluted.  Superintendent O'Connell returned the salute, and the parade of troops with steel helmets and machine-guns placed itself at the disposal of the officer in charge of the non-political police force of the Irish Free State.  Superintendent O'Connell did not find any use for the troops, since the only people at Kingsbridge were a few men and a small collection of women.  He decided that the troops <Col N="953" /> would serve a better purpose, so they went to the other gate, and took up position in the interior of the station. I have yet to learn that this non-political police force of ours can receive from the military authorities of this Free State the honours accorded to a military officer.  Yet these same honours in the nature of salutes and placing themselves at the disposal of the police were accorded to the officer in charge of the police at Kingsbridge on Sunday.  Superintendent O'Connell, of the Gárda Síochána, Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They occupied the cemetery, but thinking better of it, or having received alternative instructions, they evacuated the cemetery and occupied a position in or around the very same place, and occupied the field of assembly which was scheduled for the parade which was to advance to the graveyard to honour Wolfe Tone.</P>

      <P>We have been asked the reason as to why trains to Bodenstown were stopped.  The Deputy says there was great uneasiness amongst the people, and concludes from that that there were wild rumours and sensations here and there.  I can tell the Deputy that he has been entirely misinformed, and that nothing can comfort the mind of the people more than to know that illegal assemblies cannot take place.  The Deputy is entirely misinformed when he states that anything was done by order of the Minister for Defence.  I am responsible for the proceedings that have taken place, and I say that that was obviously and clearly an illegal association.  It was meant to be a military parade. That is shown by the advertisements which the Deputy has alluded to.  I have here in &ldquo;An Phoblacht,&rdquo; dated Saturday, 20th June, a plan of the proceedings. It includes the Cork battalion, Louth, Wexford, and other counties. I find the order of the procession from Sallins to Bodenstown was to consist of an advance guard (Company, 1st Battalion, Dublin Brigade), Workers' Union of Ireland Brass and Reed Band, I.R.A. contingents and camp followers, including Fianna Fáil and I presume if the Deputy had got a train he would be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is also a gentleman who is associated with these people, and then, winding up the rearguard is a company of 1st Battalion, Dublin Brigade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was clearly an assembly of a body calling itself an army, a body which has no right to exist in this country, because there is and there will be only one army here, and that is the army which is established and maintained according to law.  This army at its meeting on this particular date wished to have a military parade and wished to get up followers and admirers from all over the country.  I <Col N="956" /> will read an extract from the same edition of this paper:</P>
    <P>The sober truth is that one small dump has been captured by the forces of British Imperialism&mdash;and that dump contained 26 rifles, 2 revolvers, 2 automatic pistols, 1 Lewis machine gun, some bombs, explosives and spare parts for firearms.  Taking into consideration that there are at least some hundreds of such dumps in Ireland and that the various departments of our &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; organisations receive and dispatch a large amount of correspondence daily&mdash; taking into consideration also the difficulties of concealment&mdash;such captures are almost inevitable from time to time.  It is indeed a high indication of the efficiency of these organisations that they occur so rarely.  The capture certainly constitutes a heavy loss for one unit.</P>
    <P>There, though they have minimised the number of arms captured, they clearly admit that these arms were there and that it was &ldquo;a heavy loss for one unit,&rdquo; to lose these arms.  Why? Because, we know this is a body that has arms, is a body which uses arms and this is the body which was having the demonstration.  We know that quite recently two very horrible crimes were committed in this country.  We know that a young man named Carroll was murdered and that a particular association has never hidden its responsibility for that murder.  We know that Superintendent Curtin was murdered in Tipperary.  Here, again and again, all through &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; you can find the clear admission that the officer was murdered by that particular unlawful association, and when the other paper to which the Deputy referred, &ldquo;The Nation,&rdquo; had for once the courage to denounce that particular crime, an attack was immediately made on &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; by this particular paper.  It quoted the leading article from &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; and said:</P>
    <P>We commented on this strange editorial when it appeared and we pointed out that we had assurances that it did not represent the views of many of the readers of &ldquo;The <Col N="957" /> Nation&rdquo; or of the Fianna Fáil Party itself.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>On the morning of the 13th instant it was found that the residence of Mr. Moynihan, editor of &ldquo;The Nation,&rdquo; had been covered with copies of &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; featuring &ldquo;The Tipperary Murder,&rdquo; and that the pavement in front bore the inscription in large lettering: &ldquo; `The Nation&rdquo; Felon-Sets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore we have that particular association which in its own paper approved of the murder of Superintendent Curtin, and then we have a demonstration of that so-called army in Bodenstown.  There is clear proof that &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; when it denounced the assassination of Superintendent Curtin did not express the views of the Fíanna Fáil Party or evidently the view of Deputy Mullins, because we find following the association which was guilty of those horrible crimes, not merely Deputy Mullins but his ex-friends in Fíanna Fáil.</P>

      <P>This was a parade of that particular illegal association at Bodenstown.  What was the object of that parade at Bodenstown? I can tell pretty well what the object was.  I have in my hand a very interesting document issued by Deputy Aiken, the so-called chief of staff of the army in which Deputy Lemass was Minister for Defence.  Deputy Aiken, in that document, wrote to Commandant Seán MacBride:</P>
      <P>I think the best and quickest way to prove to you the wisdom of the decision to have a military parade at Bodenstown is to state the standpoint from which we should judge it.</P>
      <P>He goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must always go forward to our objective in a straight manner, and it should not matter to an individual member of Sinn Fein or a Volunteer whether it means peace, war or unrest, or whether it means a peaceful <Col N="958" /> victory or a victory by use of arms, or whether victory will come in his day or not.  A military parade at Bodenstown is, I consider, the best answer we can give at the moment to the Free Staters' decree that we must only strive for freedom in a way which would dishonour the nation.</P>
    <P>In other words what does that demonstration in Deputy Aiken's view mean?  It means that what he says is dishonouring the nation&mdash;our policy. No change shall be made in the Government or the Constitution of this State except according to law, and that there shall be no violence and no crime.  That might be considered by him to be dishonourable. It is to keep that particular spirit alive, the spirit of war in this country, to have men urged to endeavour to upset the established State by force, that the meeting at Bodenstown was to be held.  Does the Deputy suggest that we would not be false to our duty to this State if we had not taken every step that we took to see that that assembly did not take place?</P>

      <P>(a) Under the Irish Church Act, 1869, the property of the Church of Ireland was appropriated by Parliament, and after payment of compensation for vested interests under the Act the surplus of the proceeds of the property was placed at the disposition of Parliament by Section 68 of that Act, and constituted what has been known as the &ldquo;Church Surplus Fund;&rdquo; (b) it is not possible to state the amount of the surplus, as the property consisted mainly of tithe rent charges and other revenue from lands, but shortly after the passing of the Act of 1869 it was estimated that the capital value of the surplus was approximately six-and-a-half million pounds.  Subsequently, however, the capital value was reduced as a result of legislation; (c) for very many years money had to be borrowed from the National Debt Commissioners to finance the obligations imposed on the surplus by various Acts of Parliament, and no moneys were available for investment until 1912.  Any moneys available for investment since that date have been invested in Government securities; (d) the income from invested funds amounted to £77,909 7s. 5d. in 1929-30, and to £79,465 15s. 4d. in 1930-31, and (e) this income was applied towards the payment of the annual statutory charges on the surplus.</P>
