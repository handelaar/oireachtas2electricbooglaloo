      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 109 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, as amended by the 3rd Schedule of the National Health Insurance Act, 1920, provides that &ldquo;in granting outdoor relief to a person in receipt of, or entitled to receive, any benefit under these Acts, a board of guardians shall not take into consideration any such benefit, except so far as such benefit exceeds seven shillings and sixpence a week.&rdquo;  The local authority is the sole authority for the granting of outdoor relief, and is the proper authority to which representations may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter, as the Minister is aware, was brought to his notice before both in this House and in the Seanad.  The Minister is not now taking up the attitude that he took up in a previous debate, that <Col N="157" /> such was not the case.  Will the Minister say whether he will use his good offices in seeing that the Act is enforced or properly interpreted by local authorities and, if they refuse, administer it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy means by saying that I am not taking up the attitude now which I took up on some other occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that I accused him or his Department in this House previously of not seeing that the Act was carried out.  The Minister at that time did not know whether or not National Health benefit counted as income in the case of the administration of poor relief.  If the Minister looks up the records he will see that that is so.  I am asking him, now that he does know the interpretation of the Act, if it is brought to his notice that local authorities will not fulfil their obligation under the Act, will he see that they carry it out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority has a function to deal with the question of outdoor relief.  There are statutes there.  In so far as they affect the local authority, the local authority no doubt take these Acts into consideration.  But I have no function to indicate to any local authority that they should give outdoor relief in any other way than is dictated by their own discretion, after the examination of all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way: The Minister's auditors would surcharge Commissioners or other local authorities if they gave relief in cases where there was an income in excess of that prescribed by the Act.  If it is now brought to his notice that the local authorities or poor law commissioners will not administer the Act as laid down, will he intimate to them that they must carry it out, or does he intend to force applicants for poor law relief when not administered according to the Act to bring the commissioners into court?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

The file relating to proceedings initiated by the late Congested Districts Board for the purchase of the estate of the late Mrs. Hannah Lewis, Co.

      <P>It is true it was temporarily mislaid at the time that I answered a previous question by the Deputy in regard to this estate on 26th March, 1930&mdash;it is not an easy matter to lay hands at short notice on particular documents amongst the mass of old papers relative to the Board's estates, and therefore I informed the Deputy at that time that the Land Commission were not aware of the contents of the Board's letter of 10th June, 1914, referred to by him.  I find now that this letter, which was written by the Board to the solicitors acting for the owner of the estate, stated that the Board had decided not to issue an offer for the estate &ldquo;unless the owners included in the sale freed and discharged from all tenancies,&rdquo; certain specified lands, some of which, I understand, were held by Messrs. J.A. Lewis and H.H. Lewis.  It is incorrect to say (as the Deputy asserted in his previous question of 26th March, 1930) that the Board &ldquo;refused to recognise&rdquo; these tenancies.  What the Board desired was the acquisition of such lands in the owner's occupation as well as those in the occupation of J.A. Lewis and H.H. Lewis as would be necessary for the relief of congestion in the neighbourhood.  The owner refused to comply, and the Board accordingly decided not to make an offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo; The Midwives (Ireland) Act of 1918 had for its purpose the arrangement for the better training and better regulation of the practice, general supervision and control of midwives.  It arranged for the setting up of a Central Midwives Board consisting of three persons nominated by the Minister, one of them being a medical practitioner, four representatives elected by the doctors resident in the Saorstát, and four representatives of the midwives appointed by the Minister after consultation with the nurses' associations.  The Act transferred to that Board the control of midwives generally and the making of regulations in regard to their training, practice and general control.  It forbade the use by any person other than a person certified by the Board of the name &ldquo;midwife&rdquo; after the 1st of January, 1919, and after the 1st of January, 1924, it forbade the practice of midwifery by uncertified persons.  The provisions of the Act of 1918 provided that a person who did not habitually and for gain practise midwifery could do so on odd <Col N="165" /> occasions.  There was a loophole in that and, as a result of the experience of the Central Midwives Board, this Bill is brought before the House on their advice and at their request for the purpose of tightening up the description of persons entitled to practise midwifery and, in the second place, to extend the powers to them under their regulations by which they can prescribe a type of badge which midwives, desiring to wear a badge for identification purposes, shall be able to wear.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1918 made it possible that so long as a person did not practise midwifery habitually or for gain she could, though unqualified, attend cases.  In practice it has been found that midwifery work is carried on habitually and for gain by persons who are not fully qualified.  The amendment proposed in the Bill as well as reiterating the types of qualified persons who may practise midwifery, stipulates that any person attending a woman in childbirth, she being unqualified, shall be guilty of an offence unless she can satisfy the Court that such attention was given in a case of sudden or urgent necessity. It also has a provision by which persons, being persons undergoing training with a view to becoming duly qualified midwives, can give such attention as part of a course of practical instruction in midwifery recognised by the Medical Registration Council or the Board.  Such persons may also practise midwifery in these circumstances though not qualified. Recent statistics in regard to mortality amongst women directly attributable to childbirth in 1929 are the lowest recorded in this country.  The death rate per thousand in 1927 was 4.51, in 1928 4.93 and in 1929 4.14. The average rate for the decennial period up to 1928 was 4.88.  The downward tendency is due to the better control of midwives under the Central Midwives Board and to the additional supervision provided by the county councils by the presence of the county medical officer of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister, when speaking about a loophole in the Principal Act, did not <Col N="166" /> point out how it arose.  I think that this Bill, like the Principal Act, is likely to lead to unqualified persons practising midwifery.  As the Minister said, after January 1st, 1924, no person could habitually and for gain attend a woman in childbirth unless she was qualified.  That was the wording of the Principal Act.  If the law could not be enforced in that case and if it could not prevent unqualified women from practising habitually and for gain I do not see how it can prevent them practising under paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 2.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) says that any person who satisfies the Court that such attention was given in a case of sudden or urgent necessity will not be guilty of an offence under the Bill even though she is not a qualified midwife.  I think it will be very difficult for any one who is prosecuting in a case to prove that a woman was not called in a case of sudden or urgent necessity.  It could be arranged in such a way that if an unqualified woman wants to establish a practice, she would be called in in cases of sudden or urgent necessity.  Paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) says that a person shall not be guilty of an offence if she gives such attention under the direction and personal supervision of a duly qualified medical practitioner.  As we know, there are some very soft-hearted medical practitioners in this country and they have a certain amount of sympathy for those women who have made their living up to the present out of the practice of midwifery but who are not qualified.  I am inclined to think that such practitioners in some cases will be found to lend their name to these women who can say, if they are taken up in any particular case, that they are under the supervision of a certain doctor.  They will thus be able to evade the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the complaint of some of the midwifery organisations, that doctors are not as particular as they should be about the qualifications of midwives.  If they have not been particular in the past there is no reason why they should be particular <Col N="167" /> under this Bill.  They need only say, if any question is raised, that the woman was working under their personal supervision.  I do not know how you are going to define &ldquo;personal supervision.&rdquo;  I do not think that it is necessary that the doctor should be present all the time during which the midwife, or supposed midwife, is present.  If she is able to get the sympathy of a qualified medical practitioner she will be able to practise.  In that way I do not think that the Bill is an improvement on the Principal Act which it sets out to amend.  I also doubt whether the regulation and control of midwifery have had the effect on mortality to the extent mentioned by the Minister.  Surely neither the Minister nor any one else should make such a sweeping statement as to say that the decrease in mortality is altogether due to the control of midwifery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;altogether.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was due to that.  At the same time we have been improving hygiene and other things in this country, and the lying-in hospitals here in Dublin have been claiming that they are turning out better medical practitioners for the country.  I am sure that the young medical practitioners would claim that they are better than the old practitioners, and that the decrease in mortality is due to them and not altogether due to the midwives.  I do not deny that there may have been a certain improvement as a result of the control of midwives, but it is not altogether perhaps due to that.  We should not give all the credit to the midwives and none to the young medical practitioners who are claiming that they are practising the art of midwifery better than it was practised some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states also that this Bill is going to effect the elimination of handywomen from midwifery practice, so that henceforward we shall have none but qualified midwives.  Is the Minister sure that there are sufficient qualified midwives to carry on <Col N="168" /> the profession satisfactorily?  I know that in certain parts of the country, as a result of my own experience when I was in practice there, and as a result of complaints which I have received since from particular districts in my own county, that midwives can only afford to spend a minimum amount of time with women in childbirth, and that then they have to go on to other cases.  Afterwards they are unable to visit each case more than twice in the following week.  That is not sufficient attention, and the reason is that we have not got sufficient midwives in the country.  If this Bill is going to have the effect which the Minister hopes, and which we all hope it will have, I think there are not sufficient midwives to cope with the work.</P>
    <P>Another reason why there is not such competition for the position of midwife in dispensary districts is the very small salary offered and the great disparity in the salaries offered in different places.  I got a list some time ago of the salaries paid to midwives in the different areas.  In some cases the salaries go down as low as £32 per annum.  That is the lowest I saw, though I am informed that as low as £25 is paid in some districts.  In no case does the salary exceed £68 per annum.  I think even the maximum figure is a poor salary for a midwife, who has to spend a certain amount of time in qualifying for the profession. She has to give all her time to the profession, and has to incur a considerable amount of expense in the way of travelling, purchasing uniform, instruments, and so on which she requires.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister and of the Local Government Department in regard to midwives is not at all in keeping with their attitude in regard to other classes.  For a position such as medical officer of health of a county, they insist on a good salary being paid.  They insist also on a good salary being paid for civilian jobs such as secretaries of county councils.  The Local Government Department or the Minister have not in any way helped to get these midwives, who have nobody to take their part, a decent living. I would agree with the object which the Minister has in view, but I <Col N="169" /> do not believe that the Bill as worded is going to do what the Minister expects it will do&mdash;namely, the elimination of unqualified women from the practice of midwifery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill and with Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I want to point out to the Minister and to the House that there is no provision to cope with the amount of extra work which will fall on the already overworked maternity nurses in the country districts.  Of course, towns and cities are well catered for by the outdoor staffs of the maternity hospitals.  In the dispensary districts in congested areas, however, the general rule is that there is only one maternity nurse appointed. I do not see how one nurse can travel thirty or forty miles per day, as I have seen them, and succeed in attending all the maternity cases throughout these wide, scattered areas.  The Minister should make provision in some way for an extra supply of maternity nurses, because at present the practice is that one nurse is supplied to a district, no matter how extensive the district is or what the population may be.  The county councils apparently are satisfied that one nurse is sufficient. Any dispensary doctor in practice in a county district, in the West of Ireland, at all events, knows that one nurse is not able to cope with the amount of work to be done.  Things are not quite as bad in Co. Galway as they are in Co. Mayo&mdash;the salaries are not as low as they are in Mayo.  If this were a question of dealing with an organised trade union body, and that the members were being treated in this scandalous fashion, I am sure you would have the Labour Party speaking in favour of these people.  I expect the Labour Party now to give some assistance in asking the Minister to remember the conditions under which these nurses have to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is a scandalous thing in Mayo to offer a salary of £35 per annum to a qualified nurse who has to live away from home, supply herself with a bicycle and other necessities, and very often work eighteen hours continuously throughout the day. Even those who are employed on the <Col N="170" /> schemes for the relief of unemployment get 27s. per week, a wage that is little enough to live on, and to expect a maternity nurse with no private practice to live on £35 per annum is absurd.  I think that the Minister should insist that county councils provide a sufficient supply of nurses and that decent wages should be paid to them.  In some areas in the county which I represent the minimum wage paid is £1 per week.  That is about the average, but it is less than that in the counties adjoining.  I think the Minister should insist on increased salaries in districts in which the nurses appointed can have no hope of any private practice, and should also insist, if possible, that these nurses, who spend a certain time in poor districts where no private practice is available, should be transferred to the better districts according as appointments there become available.  Also, in order to get suitable candidates to come forward for these positions, along with giving a decent salary, some pension scheme should be suggested by the Minister.  I think that if that were done you would have a better type of person entering into this profession, and you would get more satisfactory work and the results gained by the Minister would be even better than they are in reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a mistake to suppose that the genus known as Sarah Gamp is extinct.  I am afraid that, far from being extinct, the handywomen does a roaring trade in some districts; in fact, I have heard that they are far more popular than the properly trained nurse that is available.  These people, I am given to understand, are extremely smart. They are quite aware that they may not exact a fee, but there are other ways of getting money besides demanding it.  It is well known what they expect to get in the way of a present, and the present.  I believe, is invariably forthcoming.  I think that is an undesirable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also heard that in a very large number of cases, in certain districts, the doctor is only sent for when there is every probability of the patient going to die.  That is the sort of thing <Col N="171" /> that ought to be stopped.  I do not know whether the Bill makes it strong enough.  I think the Minister said that the person guilty of such a thing is guilty of an offence, but the punishment should be stated; it should be of a nature to prevent anything of the kind. Very deplorable cases have occurred in this instance just as in the case of people who deal with cancer and that sort of thing.  They do not accept money but they get a present.  Moreover, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said, there are not enough qualified midwives in certain districts.  I rather think that is the case.  I think they ought to have sufficient remuneration to enable them to get about their work and to get over the country because the state of affairs in certain districts at present is deplorable. I think it ought to be put in this Bill beyond yea and nay that this handy-woman business, so far as humanly possible, should be stopped and only in very extreme cases should an unqualified person be called in to attend under any circumstances.  I hope the Minister will see the Bill strengthened in that particular before it leaves the draftsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all in agreement as to the necessity of the Bill and we will be all very anxious to see the intention of the Bill effected, but I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Dr. Ryan that the Bill, as it stands, does not effect the intention. Sub-section (3) appears to me to be the most serious part of it.  It sets out that every person who attends a woman in childbirth shall be guilty of an offence unless &ldquo;such person gives such attention under the direction and personal supervision of a duly qualified medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;under the direction and personal supervision of a duly qualified medical practitioner&rdquo; is extremely wide and open to a wide interpretation. To my knowledge it has been interpreted at present as meaning that a man can supervise and personally direct and remain as his own surgeon.  That is the practice under the law as it stands at present and unless there is alternate wording that will continue to be the practice. <Col N="172" /> I have known medical men who authorise the class of woman mentioned here to attend at childbirth without ever having seen the patient at all. There is a possible danger that such a handy-woman may be a particular favourite of a doctor and he may, in certain circumstances, authorise her to attend, but if a crisis arises, and that particular doctor is not available but another doctor is sent for, no other doctor will go in on such a case and the patient's life is lost.  The Minister may be aware that such cases have arisen.  I am personally aware that recently such a case did arise under very unfortunate circumstances. Under this sub-section (c) the onus is really being put on the doctors to put these handy-women out of practice. I do not think that is fair.  They should be put out of practice by legislation and the onus should not be put on the practitioner to accept the responsibility for refusing a case that has not been taken up by a properly qualified midwife.  I cannot see there is any necessity for paragraph (c).  If a doctor is present presumably anybody can attend.  Paragraph (e) reads &ldquo;such person satisfies the Court that such attention was given in a case of sudden or urgent necessity.&rdquo; I think some such paragraph as that will be required and it may be possible to make the wording more rigid in the Committee Stage.  If, in the Committee Stage, the Bill is not amended the entire effect will be nullified.</P>

      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken I, more or less welcome this measure and I hope that the Bill, when it is passed, will have the effect the Minister intends it should have, but it is undoubtedly the desire of the Minister and of every Deputy in this House to improve the practice of midwifery.  If we want to do away with the handy-woman it will be necessary to have a nurse in practically every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice at the present time in many districts is that a neighbouring woman or someone else is called in. She sends for a doctor and when the doctor arrives he has not time to procure a properly qualified nurse.  I am <Col N="173" /> glad to say that I do not know and I never heard of the practice, to which Deputy Ward referred, in the part of the country from which I come, that is, that a medical practitioner would authorise an unqualified person to take a case for him or under his supervision. I am glad to say that I never knew of a case like that in Roscommon.  The Minister should remember, as Deputy Ryan and Deputy Tubridy pointed out, that the work of district nurses will be enormously increased under the Bill. At the present time, on an ordinary bicycle, which she is compelled to use, a nurse cannot possibly do her work satisfactorily.  When the work is increased she will be totally unable to deal with it.  District nurses are now paid a miserable pittance and are compelled to use ordinary bicycles because they cannot afford any other means of transport.  Until the Minister takes some steps to see that midwives are paid a decent wage which will enable them to do their work properly I fear this Bill will defeat his object.  In counties in which there are county medical officers of health the district nurse has to visit each day for nine days every case she attends.  She has to keep a chart for inspection by the county medical officer of health when he calls on her, showing the pulse and the temperature for nine days after confinement.  If she has two such cases in a district concurrently and has to travel say, five miles each way to one, that means that she has to travel over twenty miles.  That is sufficient work for that day but if a third case occurs she will not be able to attend to it unless better transport facilities are made available.  I do not claim that in every district an extra nurse would be wanted but in some areas in the congested districts probably an extra nurse would be required.  Certainly, in every district the district nurse should have a salary that would compensate her for the work she does and that would enable her to provide herself with better transport facilities than she at present enjoys.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but to leave it to the doctors who are present. I want, however, to utter a word <Col N="174" /> of warning with regard to the suggestion that the provisions should be made more rigid than they are.  I do not wish to be taken as being in favour of an unqualified person acting as a nurse, but, in view of what Deputy Ryan and Deputy Tubridy said, we should not make the provisions so absolutely rigid that a neighbour would be afraid even to go to a house on such an occasion, lest she might be committing an offence and be liable to a fine of £10.  There was the suggestion that paragraph (e) should be deleted.  If that were done we know that many occasions would arise when a poor woman in a time of trouble might be left entirely alone and without the help of a neighbour, although that might be an extreme case.  If it was the general opinion that if a neighbour went to the assistance of a woman, she was committing an offence, and was liable to be brought up in order that she might satisfy the Court that it was a case of urgent necessity. I think that would be wrong.</P>
      <P>I know districts where the nurses have too much work to do.  This Bill will have the effect of increasing their work very considerably.  I think it would be well if a close examination was made of the amount of work that a district nurse is called upon to perform. That could be done, and I am sure is being done, in counties where there are county medical officers of health.  I presume that matter will be dealt with, and I suggest that it is worthy of examination.  It is my ex perience that the ordinary working nurse is not able to do efficiently all the work that she is called upon to do. In some places there are Jubilee nurses, and they make the work a little less difficult.  I agree with Deputy Tubridy that the remuneration that these nurses receive is entirely inadequate. They can depend on the support of all parties to help them to get better remuneration.  It is the experience of those who are members of public boards, especially when nurses are looking for better remuneration, that their request is always supported by Labour representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the nurses are not entirely blameless themselves, because <Col N="175" /> if they were better organised they would be able to obtain better conditions and better remuneration.  Some of them, I am sorry to say, do not take kindly to the idea of being trade unionists, even though it might mean that they would secure better remuneration. To expect a person to do the work that is expected from a district nurse for 14/- or 15/- a week is absurd.  I agree with Deputy Tubridy and Deputy Ryan that the Minister for Local Government should not leave the matter entirely in the hands of local authorities, any more than he does in the case of medical officers of health or any other county officials.  I think it is part of the Minister's duty to see that people who have to do very essential work should be adequately remunerated, and I hope, now that the scope of the nurse's work is being extended under this Bill, that that is one of the things the Minister will give attention to.</P>

      <P>I would not like Deputy Ryan to think that by praising the results of the work of the Central Midwives' Board I was eliminating all the others, including the young doctors, who are helping in the matter. I hope the Deputy did not raise the point seriously.  With regard to a tighter drawing of the provisions in the Bill, the Central Midwives' Board consists of four doctors, who are elected by doctors resident in the country, and in addition, of four qualified midwives, representing the Midwives' Association and practitioners in midwifery, as well as three persons, including one medical officer, nominated by the Minister for Local Government.  It is an institution responsible for the training and outlining of the practice of midwifery and controlling midwives in the country. That body has given a very considerable amount of consideration to this matter, both amongst themselves and with the Department.  The matters dealt with in Section 2 of this Bill have been under their close consideration. They, as well as the Department, would, I am quite sure, welcome any changes that would more effectively deal with the work they have in hands. I think, however, that it will be found <Col N="176" /> on further examination that the section may be left as it is.  If we take out paragraph (e), as Deputy Ward suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If (c) goes, then in the circumstances that have been suggested by some Deputies here there will be areas left in which it will be very difficult to get the assistance of any one in certain midwifery cases.  If we take out (c) it would prevent any doctor, no matter how conscientious, making use of the older type of experienced woman in dealing with midwifery cases, and from what I have heard here I think that would be inadvisable. I think it will be necessary to retain (e).  If, however, the wording can be improved, both the Central Midwives' Board and the Department will be only too pleased to welcome help from Deputies with that object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised with regard to the inducements to women to take up the profession, and it has been suggested that the Department does not take the same interest in their remuneration as it does in regard to the position and the remuneration of the county medical officers of health and other positions like that. The circumstances of midwives vary very much in different parts of the country.  When dealing with a pivotal officer like the county medical officer of health or the secretary of a county council, we know the type of material in the market.  We know the type of man we want, and we know the line below which, in the matter of remuneration, the proper man will not <Col N="177" /> be attracted.  Deputy O'Dowd suggested the effect on the general position of midwifery in any county that the county medical officer is likely to have.  He is likely to awaken the conscience of the people as a whole as well as to awaken the conscience of the county board of health as to the number of midwives who are necessary to do the work there from his experience and knowledge.  He would also be better able to awaken the public conscience as to the necessity for having this work done satisfactorily, and therefore paid at a proper remuneration.</P>
    <P>There may not be cases in which the Department has interfered to the extent of actually fixing the remuneration of the midwife in any particular area in the same way as it has done with regard to the county medical officers of health or dispensary medical officers as a class.  But the Departmental policy has been consistent in urging that in these areas where the remuneration is below the average&mdash;and the average lies between £50 and £60 a year&mdash;that their salaries be increased.  The Department has been urging that all along.  Mayo has been mentioned. There the provision with regard to the remuneration is particularly bad.  We had to intervene some time ago and fix by Order a scale of dispensary doctors' salaries.  Representations had been previously made to the Mayo County Council.  Within the limits of our judgment we have done as much as we could up to the present to see that the scale of salaries in Mayo is improved.</P>
    <P>The average number of cases that a midwife in a country district attends is only 25 a year.  So that while there may be districts in which there is difficulty with regard to the small number of the midwives and nurses there must be large areas of the country where the wants are fully satisfied.</P>

      <P>I am only speaking now of the calls on their time that arise to them as employees of the local bodies.  Even that will give a considerable margin to the midwives in most parts of the country for a fair amount of private practice as well.  With regard to the points that have been raised as to the evasion of the present legislative intention, at any rate in the matter of better attention in midwifery cases, I am sure the Central Midwives Board is energetically surveying the whole position and dealing with it.  The local supervisory bodies, perhaps, have not been as energetic as they might have been.  Every midwife practising in the county council areas must notify the county council or the board of health that she is practising in that area within 24 hours after she has begun her practice, and must notify the fact that she is practising in that area annually after that.  With that statutory provision with regard to midwives, with the Central Board doing its work, with the county councils being furnished more with the services of the county medical officers of health, the situation will be much more under review than it has been, in certain places at any rate.</P>
      <P>We have confidence that we may find a proper balance as to the difficulties that exist at the present moment, and that require to be overcome. We have confidence also in the methods that we will take to bring about the idea that we hope to bring about.  I do suggest that some of the irresponsibility in this matter that has been laid at the doors of some of the doctors must be very limited in its extent and that any irresponsibility or carelessness that there may be in that particular way must finish once there is more effective supervision by the county medical officers of health.</P>

    <P>(1)  Whenever a person registered in the register is convicted in Saorstát Eireann of treason or of a felony or a misdemeanour or is convicted outside Saorstát Eireann of a crime or offence which would be a felony or a misdemeanour if committed in Saorstát Eireann, the Council may erase the name of such person from the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 45, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;by a resolution in favour of which not less than five members of the Council shall have voted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the quorum of the body is three.  I notice that a simple majority of the board can erase from the register the name of a person who is convicted of a crime or offence.  I think it is rather unfair that that should be. I was looking up the Principal Act, that is the Act I suppose under which veterinary surgeons have been controlled up to the present, and under that Act to be removed for any crime whatever, even though the person was convicted in a court, it was necessary that there should be at least two-thirds of the members present and that there should be at least three-fourths of those present in favour of removing his name from the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> You will notice also, in another part of this Bill, that for the offence of professional misconduct a name cannot be removed unless there are at least five members of the board in favour of its removal.  For the reason that they have had at least this protection up to the present and also that they are continuing to have that protection in the case of professional misconduct I think the Minister should accept the amendment and allow a veterinary surgeon whose case has been considered at least to have the protection of having at least five members of the board voting for his removal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has stated that this amendment has been put down by him partly by reason of the analogy in Section 36 which demands that there should be a defined majority where there is the question of erasure on account of professional misconduct. In that he is right, but Section 36 has been drafted to meet the particular circumstances that rule. The whole situation here was decided on to enable procedure here to be carried out so as to cause the least trouble to the established institution and to be in accordance with their regulations. Their regulations with regard to professional misconduct ordain that it shall be a particular majority and that that majority shall have to be even of a particular type.  We tried to fit our legislation in with that.  On the other hand, when it came to striking off for reasons other than professional misconduct, such as treason or anything about which there has been a court judgment, we felt we were freer.  Our minds ran this way.  In order to make an erasure for treason a man has to commit something which has to be determined by a court to be a treasonable offence, so that there is the judgment of an independent body outside the professional group and in these circumstances we thought it was not unfair to say that the council by a simple majority should erase the name. In the case of professional misconduct, where it is a matter of taking away a man's livelihood because a certain group of the profession thought some conduct was unprofessional, we <Col N="181" /> thought it was better to have somewhat more rigid conditions.  You would have to fix a majority.  And there were other provisions with regard to putting a person back.  If the Deputy wants to press the amendment I do not think there is much in it.  I wonder how far is he going to go by analogy with the other conditions, and as the situation that rules in the Principal Act is for professional misconduct and nothing else there has to be a fixed number of votes, and when it comes afterwards to an amendment of that judgment or the withdrawal of the previous erasure and the re-establishment of the man upon the register, there has to be a similar majority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy only moves one step forward.  He says for the striking off let there be a resolution in favour of which not less than five members of the council shall have voted.  He does not say in the next sub-section, when it comes to re-establishing the man whose name has been erased, that it cannot be done unless there is a resolution in favour of which not less than five members of the council shall have voted.  However, I do not attach very much importance to this.  I do not think it is a very serious point, but I do think that the same argument could not apply to this question of striking off because of conviction for crime as could be raised on a question of professional misconduct, because with regard to professional misconduct the entire judgment is in the hands of the Veterinary Council, and one may say they are apt to err, and that one group of the profession should not be given the power, by a simple majority, to strike off a man's name.  In this case there is a condition precedent, the condition being that there must have been a conviction for crime.  That is a safeguard.  On the other hand, if the Deputy wants that amendment, and if the House thinks it is a reasonable one, I have no great objection to it, but I would suggest that the second sub-section of Section 34 must likewise be amended.  If you are to have these more rigid conditions before a man's name is struck off, you should also see that the same conditions are fulfilled before he is entered once more upon the register.</P>

If that is the position, there is no necessity now to move any amendment. The section can be moved and debated. Anything that is relevant as an amendment to this section is relevant to the discussion upon the <Col N="185" /> motion, &ldquo;That the section stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;  What the Minister apparently intends is that the section should be passed without a division, that is to say, without persons having committed themselves to vote for or against it, and that an amendment will be circulated by the Minister in sufficient time before the next stage comes on to enable any Deputy who is not satisfied to put down an amendment to that amendment, or an amendment to the section.</P>

The section as it reads at present is a great departure from and a great advance on the English Act. As far as I know it is the child of the veterinary profession here, and was put in at their instigation.  It goes very much further than the English Act.  Amendment 14 would leave the position pretty much as it is, and give the veterinary profession the status it wants at the same time.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct something that Deputy Gorey said.  He may be right, but I did not get this out of the Veterinary Act.  I got this out of the Medical Act, as I thought that if the veterinary surgeons were as well protected as the medical men it would be fair to them.  I think that amendments 13 and 14 will have to be taken together.  Amendment 13 makes it a condition that no person can hold himself out as a veterinary surgeon unless he is registered.  It simply means that he cannot call himself a veterinary surgeon unless he is one.  Amendment 14 provides that a man who practises veterinary surgery without being registered cannot charge a fee.  These are the two things which are provided in <Col N="187" /> the Medical Act, and I think they protect the medical men to a certain extent.  I believe that there are some medical practitioners who are not satisfied with them, but there is a certain amount of protection in them; in fact there is a good lot of protection.</P>
      <P>As the section stands, I believe it gives a monopoly to the veterinary profession which would not be in the interests of agriculture in general, because it would be absolutely impossible on every occasion that an animal might require veterinary attention for the farmer to send for a veterinary surgeon.  I think something would have to be done by amendment that would enable the farmer himself, or his employees, to attend to animals. I have an amendment that goes that far, but I think we would have to go further than that.  We all know from experience that there are men who have a reputation in an area for doing certain small operations on animals for which it would not pay a farmer to send for a veterinary surgeon.  He could not possibly pay the expenses of the veterinary surgeon to come out and perform these operations. The farmer himself or his employees might not be competent to perform them, but some neighbour might be prepared to do them without fee and without calling himself a veterinary surgeon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he would in nearly all cases.  As a matter of fact, I met one veterinary surgeon who told me he represented a considerable body of the profession.  I put some of these cases to him and he said that the veterinary surgeons generally do not want to bother with these small operations; that they knew that the farmers could not afford to pay them a fee sufficient to enable them to go on and perform these operations, such, for instance, as the castration of four or five pigs. If a veterinary surgeon was paid a fee for that which would cover the travelling expenses, say, for ten miles, <Col N="188" /> there would be no profit left on the pigs.  The veterinary surgeons do not want a monopoly of practice of that sort.  They have no objection to having that practice left to these handy men, as they are known, in the districts.  I would like to see a good deal of protection given to the veterinary surgeons.  I would like that nobody else should get a fee for this work, and that nobody else should be allowed to call himself a veterinary surgeon, but I would not like to see the section as it is in the Bill go through, because that gives them a monopoly which is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see if I could get any common line upon which amendments might be brought in.  There are a variety of amendments down, and there is one line of division as between these different amendments.  One amendment in the name of Dr. Ryan deals with the matter from the point of view of payment that may be legally enforced, not payment which may be taken, but that can be legally enforced.  On the other side, is the application of law, in other words, making certain operations by certain people illegal and punishable by fines.  The amendments divide themselves generally along these two lines. Deputy Ryan sets out on one line, and his main line is somewhat to this point. Let there be operations performed by anyone as long as that person is not given the power legally to enforce payment of a fee, and so long as he does not hold himself out in any way under the title of a veterinary surgeon. Other amendments come along on the second line, and they have to be somewhat sub-divided.  There is an amendment in the names of Deputy Brennan and Deputy Jordan, which says: &ldquo;That it shall not be lawful for any person to represent or hold himself out, whether directly or by implication, as being a veterinary surgeon prepared to practise veterinary surgery or veterinary medicine unless he is for the time being a registered veterinary surgeon.&rdquo; That is really a little rigid in terms, for in order to conflict with that amendment if it became law, a person would have to hold himself out <Col N="189" /> as a veterinary surgeon prepared to practise veterinary surgery.  I do not know whether Deputies Jordan and Brennan had any special point in bringing in that particular phrase &ldquo;as being a veterinary surgeon,&rdquo; but it narrows the extent of the amendment and the extent of the legislation afterwards if the amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>There is a further amendment in the name of Deputy Mathews with alternatives, one of which says: &ldquo;The provisions of the foregoing sub-section shall not apply to any person attending any kind of live-stock,&rdquo; and then there are a certain number of named operations, and the alternative amendment is: &ldquo;The provisions of the foregoing subsections&rdquo;&mdash;that is with regard to registration and which make operations legal&mdash;&ldquo;shall not apply,&rdquo; and then instead of specifying certain operations it says, &ldquo;to such minor operations as the Minister may by order specify after consultation with the various interests concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, there is the amendment in the name of Deputy Haslett which takes in both those ideas.  It deals with the payment, or with the charging rather, of fees, and the type of operation and the type of persons who perform them.  It says: &ldquo;The provisions of the foregoing sub-sections shall not apply to any farmer, stockowner or their employees performing any operation or administering medicines incidental to the usual care and management of live-stock; provided always that such person does not hold himself out as a veterinary practitioner or charge fees for his services.&rdquo; As between the amendments suggested, and after having consultation with the veterinary people, who are quite reasonable in this matter, I feel that the last amendment I have quoted is the amendment that most definitely meets the case.  Remember, if Deputy Ryan's amendment is accepted all that it does is to prohibit persons who are entitled to a fee to recover under any legal proceedings the fee or charge.  It has been put to me by a veterinary surgeon that Deputy Ryan should amend his amendment so as to leave it that if anyone has paid a fee for an operation performed by an unregistered <Col N="190" /> person he can afterwards recover. So to speak, he could plead the Veterinary Act and recover the money, because this does not prevent the passage of money.  But if a man does not pay he cannot be brought to a court and made to pay by legal process.</P>
    <P>I have been querying the amendment put down by Deputy Haslett, and that is why I have asked Deputy Ryan a question by way of interjection. I think it meets the situation. It seems to me that the people that the House desires to protect will be covered by the expression &ldquo;any farmer, stockowner or their employees performing any operation or administering medicine incidental to the usual care and management of live-stock; provided always such person does not hold himself out as a veterinary practitioner or charge fees for his services.&rdquo;  It seems to me that that is a better way of meeting the point than any other, because it still leaves that person liable for an offence if it is proved that a fee has been charged. Deputy Ryan's amendment stops short of that.  It says that if a man does an operation on a credit basis he cannot after recover in a court of law.  Deputy Gorey seems to be under a misapprehension as to the attitude of the veterinary profession.  The veterinary profession's attitude is very much what Deputy Ryan indicated.  They object to people being allowed to bill themselves as members of the profession when they are not, but they have very little objection to the smaller type of operations being performed by other people, and they recognise the necessity for that in the economy of the country.  I think the veterinary profession and Deputies will find themselves in agreement on most of these points.  I suggest that attention should be fixed on Deputy Haslett's amendment rather than on any other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister.  The terms of amendment 14 are taken exactly out of the British Act, word for word, and the British Act is quite a good Act.  It is the thing you are aiming at here.  The amendment of Deputy Haslett is faulty to my mind, because it prevents the farmer or somebody else giving <Col N="191" /> some recompense to a person who comes six or seven miles and performs perhaps a very skilful operation.  That should not be stopped or prevented.</P>

      <P>It does not.  It makes it illegal to recover in Court but it does not prevent money passing.  That is a privilege that people want in the country and will insist on having.  Make no mistake about that at all.  They will insist on having that privilege no matter what people here may think.  I have no hesitation in saying that to my mind amendment 14 stands out in preference to all the rest from the farmer's point of view.  I speak for a great number of farmers that I have met in conference on this matter.  I speak for the farmers of my own county and people in counties outside. The matter has been discussed and I say that you will have a unanimous opinion in favour of amendment 14 in preference to all others.  I would agree with Deputy Haslett's amendment were it not for the fact that the word &ldquo;charge&rdquo; is there at all.  If a nominal fee is charged and the farmers choose to pay it as a just recompense for very valuable service rendered, there is no reason why that should not be done.  There ought to be no word in the Bill to prevent it.</P>

      <P>I took the amendment from the Medical Act.  If it is the same as the British Veterinary Act then it must be a formula common to all these Acts.  I do not know.  If one of these men came to perform a minor operation and if he were offered his <Col N="192" /> expenses or something in lieu of half a day I would not like to see him prohibited by law from accepting that. On the other hand, I would not like to give him power to sue for it.</P>

      <P>It would appear to me that we are considering all these amendments en bloc.  To my mind, Deputy Haslett's amendment with some slight modification would meet the case.  Where the amendment speaks of farmers and their employees I would like to ask would a handyman&mdash;a cow doctor&mdash;be regarded for the time being as a farmer's employee.</P>
      <P>If he would, or if he could, by any misconstruction of the amendment be so regarded it would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  Amendment No. 14 does not appeal to me.  In densely populated areas, such as there are in England, veterinary surgeons are not very well known.  Neither are the handymen nor cow doctors and, of course, there is some need to make provision against misrepresentation by handymen posing as veterinary surgeons.  In Ireland, however, it is quite different.  The handyman is well known.  It appears to me that there is an immoral principle underlying amendment 14.  A farmer who is crooked might employ a handyman knowing that he is not a veterinary surgeon and, when employing him, would have at the back of his mind the fact that he need not pay him, that he could, as it were, plead the Gaming Act.  That, I think, is improper. If the law allows him to employ such a man that man should get his wages.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister's education in regard to this question has progressed a good deal since the previous discussion on this Bill when he contended that any person who dishorned cattle should be liable to prosecution.  In my opinion amendment 14 is the only one that covers the case.  I am a farmer and I have consulted farmers in my constituency on this matter.  I know handymen in my constituency and I can say that if I had a cow about to calve I would prefer the handyman any time to a veterinary surgeon.</P>

      <P>I would be a very good judge.  I have personally taken over the treatment of cows about to calve after veterinary surgeons had given them up in despair and I was successful. A handy man who travels ten or twelve miles a day for four days a week in a particular district has about twenty times more knowledge on such matters than a veterinary surgeon. He is a much safer man and if I brought him to attend to four or five cows I would pay him his fee beforehand and there would be no trouble about it.  Amendment No. 14 is so framed that he will get his fee beforehand and it will prevent him taking legal proceedings afterwards.  I think that the Minister should accept that amendment.  If I were in his boots I would not allow political spleen to interfere with the welfare of the community. The Minister is here to look after the interests of the community at large and not to bring in a bad Bill in order to satisfy party spleen.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we should keep in mind the main purpose for which the Bill was introduced&mdash;namely, to regularise the position of veterinary surgeons, to set up a register, and to have them duly registered. Has any case been made&mdash;I have not heard it so far&mdash;for interfering with the common practice of farmers in regard to the treatment of their stock?  Have there been any abuses or great losses to live stock as a result of the operations of these so-called unqualified people?  I have never heard of them.  No case has been made here for the drastic reform as first set out in Section 45, and it is generally accepted now as being unnecessary. Perhaps some farmer Deputies who are better acquainted with these matters than I will tell us that. Is there any need to do more under this Bill than to regularise the position of veterinary surgeons, to set up a register and to give them a status? Unless a case has been made showing that there have been great abuses with consequent losses of live stock, I suggest that the proper thing to do would <Col N="194" /> be to delete the word &ldquo;practice&rdquo; from the section, so that it would read, &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to hold himself out, either directly or indirectly by implication, as a veterinary surgeon.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically.  You simply leave things as they are, except that you prevent a person, unless he is registered, from holding himself out as a veterinary surgeon.  Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment, No. 13, does that more specifically and definitely.  Coming to Amendment No. 14, there is a point to which none of the speakers so far has adverted&mdash;namely, that as it stands now a druggist or chemist who supplies medicines to farmers in the ordinary way is prevented from recovering the cost of these medicines because he is not supposed to supply any veterinary medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a technical meaning for the word &ldquo;prescribe.&rdquo; Frequently the practice in the country is for a farmer to go to a local chemist who has a general knowledge of veterinary matters and to describe to him what is wrong with his beast.  The chemist will state that there is a good specific for it.  In that case is he prescribing and supplying the medicine?  In that case he would have no right to recover the cost if the amendment stands as it is.  As regards the points made by Deputy Corry, I agree to a considerable extent that there are people who practise minor operations and who go from town to town and farm to farm treating cattle.  Deputy Corry approves of that man, but he has not told us why such a man should not be able to recover his fee.</P>

They both suggested that veterinary surgeons were inferior to the ordinary quack, but I do not know that people generally agree with that.  I do not know that the House would agree with it either.  As regards the amendment to Section 45, I agree with the Minister and with Deputy Dr. Hennessy that Deputy Haslett's amendment would be quite all right, provided there was a little alteration in the wording of it.  I do not know exactly what he means by the word &ldquo;employees.&rdquo;  Suppose a stock-owner or a farmer got a man, a local quack, we will say, and said to him, &ldquo;John, I want you to do a few calves or a few colts, I want you to inoculate a few calves against blackleg: I will give £1.&rdquo;  Can such a man be considered an employee?  If Deputy Haslett's amendment were altered by inserting the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; I think that would meet the case, and I suggest that alteration to the Minister.</P>

      <P>In regard to the amendment standing in my name, I would <Col N="196" /> like to say that I tried to approach the matter from the viewpoint of a commonsense farmer.  I think all Deputies are in agreement that the section as it stands is not a proper one and that we, as Deputies, the great majority of whom are farmers or represent farming communities, could not allow this Bill pass through our hands in its present form and justify it in the country.  We could not take away from the owner of livestock power to do things which are incidental to the management and care of livestock.  At the same time I recognise that the Bill is designed to regularise the veterinary profession.  There is nothing whatever wrong about that.  At this point I think I might say that I cannot understand Deputy O'Connell's viewpoint, because if any Deputy in the House should say that it was desirable that the status of the profession should be defined properly, it should be Deputy O'Connell.  When Deputy O'Connell goes on to say: &ldquo;Let things remain as they are; let whoever likes in the country hold himself out as a veterinary practitioner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to misrepresens Deputy O'Connell, but I took him as saying: &ldquo;Let things stand but have a Veterinary Register.&rdquo;  I think that is what he said.  However, we will let that matter pass.  Deputy O'Connell, I think, would be the last person who would take up the attitude that an unqualified teacher should have the right to teach as a qualified teacher or that a carpenter should have the right to do mason's work. After all members of the veterinary profession spend a considerable amount of money on their education as specialists in a certain branch and they desire certain protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> Speaking as a farmer, I say that the farming community must have the liberty to manage their livestock. Approaching this matter from that view point, I tried in my amendment to provide that the farmer could so attend his livestock.  With all deference to Deputy Corry and Deputy Gorey, who would seem to be in agreement, I do not think we could accept their view that a farmer would employ a handy man in preference to a veterinary surgeon every time.  The handy man has his place and it is a very useful place at times.  Are we not, however, going to take advantage of the advance of veterinary science and of the facilities of which we can get the benefits directly and indirectly?</P>
    <P>It is set out in my amendment that the provisions shall not apply to the farmer or stock owner, the man who owns stock in the first instance, or to his herd or employee.  Farmer Deputies in the House are aware that while they are here looking after the country's business, they have to leave some of their employees to look after their stock.  These employees must be protected in this Bill as well as the farmers themselves.  There is a multitude of things that must be done and done quickly in the treatment of livestock and I believe the veterinary profession have no hankering after these things.  There is the usual attention which cattle receive at calving time.  That attention involves things that must be done quickly. There is also the matter of horses taking colic.  There is the bleeding of various animals and the treatment of horses who take farcy.  Anyone who is familiar with cattle knows that when cattle have been housed all the winter sometimes the blood rushes to their heads when being brought to the market.  They must be attended to in ten minutes or else they die. In that case we could not prevent the farmer, the owner, or anyone else from helping.  Those are the two people, the farmer and his employee.  Then there is the other man, his neighbour. In the country we co-operate in this way.  If anything happens suddenly and we want relief we apply to our <Col N="198" /> neighbour.  If a man were prevented from helping his neighbour it would be against all Irish tradition.  It would be against reason that we should prevent the farmer from helping his neighbour.</P>
    <P>That is the whole structure on which our system, especially of agriculture, is built.  Having those three people in mind, that is what I wanted to protect. I have no desire to set any one else up as a veterinary practitioner except one qualified.  You can draw the pen through the latter clause of my amendment. When I put it down I thought it would explain my amendment.  If the House thinks that should be removed, I am quite willing to remove it. A Deputy asked about employees.  An employee is a person employed by another. If we ask for the services of a doctor for a member of our family we do not call that doctor an employee. We do not call a veterinary surgeon an employee in that sense.  They come to render services and they get their fees, sometimes.  Under no consideration could we call them employees.  What I mean by an employee is one who is habitually employed on a farm.</P>
    <P>Another reason I might advance for this particular view-point is that we would be cutting across, perhaps unduly, some of the good work that the Department of Agriculture have been doing in the country.  Our young people who go to the agricultural colleges get a certain amount of training in rural science and are taught something about the diseases of animals.  They also have lectures in various districts.  We appreciate them very much in our district.  Professor Mason advised us in days gone by and gave us a lot of valuable remedies.  We would not like that this Bill should prevent us from using these simple remedies that we have.  I think this amendment would fairly meet the case. The Minister has put it far better than I can put it.  It meets the case and groups together the two points the other amendments seek to alter.  As farmers we must be allowed to manage our stock and administer such treatment as is necessary for their welfare. Otherwise we might as well go out of business.</P>

We knew that he wanted to preserve as much liberty and right for the farmer as is good for him, but I suggest to Deputy Haslett that the terms of his amendment do not give the farmer as much liberty as he enjoyed under the English Charter. These amendments are taken from the Act or from the Charter of the Royal College of Surgeons.  I do not know if I am using the right word.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry referred to operations.  It requires a considerable amount of physical fitness to perform an operation successfully on a cow calving, and more particularly in the taking of a foal from a mare. It requires considerable strength and stamina to undertake an operation of that sort, especially if the foal is in a contrary place.  Sheep do not require the same strength or muscle.  I happen to know a lot about these matters as I spent years at them.  I never let anyone into my place to help me.  I know what I am talking about. I have often had to do the job with a veterinary surgeon standing on the bank, sometimes acting on his instructions, while at other times these instructions <Col N="201" /> were not worth two pins. There are some diseases better handled by local men than by any veterinary surgeon.  One of them is farcy, and were it not for the cures handed down from generation to generation by local men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They must have a peculiar brand of brain while ordinary people in the country according to the Deputy must be absolute imbeciles although they have had perhaps thirty or forty years' practice.  You can get as much practice with a live animal in the country as you can with a dead carcase in one of the veterinary colleges. What applies to the case of human beings does not apply to animals.  When it comes to animals we insist on our rights.  I say to the Minister in all seriousness that the terms of amendment 14 will meet the situation. The English ideal is what is wanted.  It regularises the position. If it satisfies them in England it ought to satisfy the veterinary profession here.  It will satisfy the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the three amendments I am rather inclined to favour Deputy Haslett's notwithstanding what Deputy Gorey has said against it.  It meets practically all the complaints that farmers had against what I might call the vagueness of the wording of the section.  It permits a farmer or his neighbour or employee to perform any necessary operation and to administer the necessary medicine. Deputy Gorey is afraid that the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; will prevent certain people getting the best help.  I am not afraid of that, because I think the category farmer, stockowner or employee includes everyone that could be conceived as likely to perform an operation or to administer medicine.  I cannot think of anyone outside that. Deputy Gorey did not say who was outside that category, unless it was a man practising as a semi-vet. and who makes a charge.  I think the wording would satisfy most farmers.  It certainly satisfies me.  A point has been <Col N="202" /> made as to charging a fee.  I think it is the general opinion that we should not put down the principle that a man should charge a fee for his services. Deputy Gorey suggested that if we did not put that in we should leave it open to him to get a fee.  I think it would be a rather dangerous if not an immoral principle, to set that out in a Bill.  If Deputy Gorey can read that into Deputy Ryan's amendment he can certainly read the same thing into Deputy Haslett's amendment.  Deputy Haslett says that a fee should not be charged, but he does not say that a person might not be recompensed, which, I think, was the word used by Deputy Gorey.  It would be quite legitimate to give a glass of grog to the man who helped.  Deputy Haslett does not rule it out.  Perhaps a man might be given his dinner.  He says definitely that a fee is not to be charged. But that is not good enough for Deputy Gorey.  I think it would be good enough for Deputy Ryan.  It is quite good enough for me.  In a Bill of this sort we cannot set down the principle that while a farmer does not get permission to perform an operation or to get his neighbour, or his employee to do so, or to administer medicine, the Minister says we should not put anyone in the position to charge a fee for his services. Of all the amendments I think Deputy Haslett's meets the situation better than any of the others, and I will support it.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Bennett could have been in the House when Deputy Haslett dealt with his amendment.  If he had been he would not have made the statement that he has made.  When Deputy Haslett was dealing with the question of an employee he made himself very clear.  For instance, he said he would not consider Deputy Hennessy, nor a veterinary surgeon, an employee.  The Deputy made it clear that anyone who was called in to perform an operation would not be an employee.  That would rule out people who do farmers an amount of good.  A handy man who goes around has ten times as much experience as the veterinary surgeon. He deals with at least forty head of <Col N="203" /> cattle to the one case that the veterinary surgeon would deal with.  I desire to explain that when I mentioned veterinary surgeons I alluded to them when dealing with certain classes of work.  Deputy Gorey alluded to one class of work, taking a calf from a cow, where the handy man has ten times as much experience as the veterinary surgeon.  I would rather have a handy man in a case like that, and also with pigs, because of the experience that man has.  The ordinary veterinary surgeon gets an engagement one day at one sort of work, and he might not get another engagement of a similar kind for four or five months.  Deputy Gorey knows that, and he knows that the other men are working about the country every day.  As to charging a fee for their services, I have no objection to that.  I think they are entitled to a fee.  I think farmers are very glad to pay them fees.  The loss of one calf or pig by a botch of a veterinary surgeon would more than pay for the services of all of them.  That is the information I have, and that is the experience in my constituency.  I think Deputy Ryan's amendment meets the situation.  If I did not I would say so. It meets the case in the only way in which it can be met here.  I think there should not be any more time lost in the matter.  I would ask the Minister to accept Deputy Ryan's amendment. It completely meets the case, and it protects the farming community, who actually want protection at the present time.  We have too many officials and too many Acts hunting them from the time they get up in the morning until they go to bed.  The farmers do not want any more persecution from the Minister who is going to fine them £20 for bottling a cow.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Haslett's amendment meets the situation at all.  Take the case of a farmer who lives 30 miles away from any veterinary surgeon.  One of his cows gets sick or she is on the brink of calving.  What is that man to do? He is to bring in the services of a handy man.  Is it then expected that that handy man is to go and bring the calf from that cow, and leave his <Col N="204" /> home, travel seven or eight miles, and spend his day without any remuneration? Perhaps on the following day somebody else may want that handy-man to perform light operations on young pigs.  Is that man expected to leave his home day after day and go from one farmer to another without any remuneration?  According to Deputy Haslett's amendment he will be breaking an Act of Parliament if this Bill becomes law and he accepts payment for his services.</P>

I know places in South Kerry where farmers live thirty miles from a veterinary surgeon.  A man there, who, acting as a handy-man in such cases, should not be expected to give his services free, and the farmer himself could not be expected to have a veterinary surgeon in every small operation.  Nor in cases of urgency either could the farmer very often have a veterinary surgeon at his command. Deputy Haslett's amendment would never meet the situation.</P>

      <P>In Deputy Haslett's amendment there is a phrase, which if adopted, is likely to give rise to a good deal of discussion as to what it means.  I refer to the phrase &ldquo;incidental to the usual care and management of live stock.&rdquo;  What operation is incidental to the usual care and management of live stock or rather what operation is not incidental to the usual care and management of live stock?  Somebody in the interests of the veterinary surgeon's profession might bring a case into court prosecuting a farmer for carrying out an operation which would be held not to be incidental to the usual care and management of live stock, although my reading of it is that there is hardly any operation that would not come under that definition. There is no operation that would be ruled out under that amendment. That is my reading of the wording at all events.  I cannot conceive of any operation that could not be claimed to be incidental to the usual care and management of live stock.  It would be very hard for any court to draw a distinction between one class of operation and another.</P>

When Deputy Haslett spoke on that I found that he and I were in exact agreement.  He does not want any change&mdash;he does not want to prevent the farmer from doing what he has always done in the past.  That was my original suggestion.  But I would undoubtedly prevent anybody holding himself out as a veterinary surgeon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have this clear&mdash;on the matter of charge there is a difference between Deputy Haslett's amendment and Deputy Ryan's amendment.  Deputy Ryan's amendment says that the amount is not to be recovered by law, and Deputy Haslett says that there is to be no charge.  Deputy Haslett said he did not care very much about that and that it could be amended.  I listened to Deputy O'Reilly.  He concentrated mainly on this question of charge.  Supposing the end of Deputy Haslett's amendment were amended so as to make it read &ldquo;or enforce payment for services rendered,&rdquo; then by putting that part at the foot of Deputy Ryan's amendment it would meet part of the objection made by Deputy O'Reilly to this whole thing.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether that is not opening the whole thing up too much. But supposing that we accepted that, we have one other point raised with regard to Deputy Haslett's amendment, that is to say this question of defining &ldquo;employees.&rdquo;  At any rate if people want the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; so far extended that it will cover any man who is for a particular purpose hired by the farmer or stock owner they may as well have no section because if you are to have an employee for the time being for the purpose of the operation, then the whole Saorstát would be included in the acceptance. I do not expect that Deputy Haslett intends to go to that extent, but it is not fair to go to that extent. Think of the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; as being rather a servant.  I would not like to go to the point that Deputy Crowley reached when he said &ldquo;a servant ordinarily employed by him.&rdquo; That is what Deputy Haslett has in mind.  I have been listening to this debate and I have not yet heard any answer to that point.  There are certain operations done by certain people and these the House desires to exempt from the provisions of Section 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet heard of any concrete illustration of a person likely to perform these operations not covered by the terms farmer, stock owner, farmer's servant or stock owner's servant. So far I have not heard of any. <Col N="207" /> There has not been very much made of it so far.  I would like to have pointed out how many other people it is desired to cover.  If there are any people who are not included in any of these terms let us see what other category they occupy.  If there is some definition by way of limitation of persons, Deputy Haslett's amendment is an easily accepted amendment.  Deputy O'Connell has raised a new point. That is a question of the chemist supplying for the needs of animals. If a person goes into a chemist's shop and asks for a proprietary medicine that is not covered by Deputy Ryan's amendment.  It is not covered to this extent that a chemist supplying a proprietary medicine on credit can afterwards sue for his fee and recover, but he cannot sue if he prescribes and fills his own prescription.  I do not know if that is the intention.  The general line is that prescribing and supplying his own medicine is the thing that is definitely aimed at.  How are we going to aim at it?  Is it a question of exempting from the provisions of the sub-section or simply saying that a person can put on a charge and that the only penalty is the prohibition of legal enforcement of the fee, or is it going to be excepting certain people doing certain things?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell has raised a further point.  If a man can charge, logically, there is no reason why he should not be given the power to enforce the charge.  I do not know whether you could afford to be logical in that matter.  That used to be one of the penalties in regard to unregistered medical or dental practitioners. The situation has changed somewhat. As to those who want to make a comparison between the old situation and the present situation, I want to remind people again of this further change.  In the days in which that section was passed with regard to veterinary practitioners, there was in existence, and was seriously being considered to put into effective operation, a clause relating to the use of anæsthetics.  It was made definitely an offence for any unregistered <Col N="208" /> person to perform any operation which required the use of anæsthetics.  These things have rather fallen into desuetude at the moment, but they are still there.  It is a question of finding what is required in this matter.  There seems to be on another question&mdash;the matter of worn-out horses being exported&mdash;a rather strong humanitarian feeling in the House.  That lapses when it comes to operations performed on livestock in the country.  Is it to be suggested in this case that the Act should be allowed to remain in desuetude, or that they should not be operated on, as in most of these cases persons would have to use anæsthetics for the purpose of certain operations? I suggest, having got to this point in discussion, if Deputy Ryan's amendment goes in, that I should be allowed to incorporate whatever arguments have been used on Deputy Haslett's amendment in a new form, modelled on Deputy Haslett's amendment, and bring forward that as a special amendment in opposition to Deputy Ryan's amendment 14.  Frankly, I do not know what amendment 13 means, because it is already in the Bill.  We could put Deputy Haslett's amendment in such a way that Deputy Ryan's amendment would be to remove the portion which deals with charges or which would allow a substituted amendment.  Instead of saying &ldquo;cannot charge a fee,&rdquo; the phrase would be &ldquo;cannot enforce payment of fees.&rdquo;</P>

A person may come into a chemist and say that there was a certain thing wrong with an animal and would he please give him something for it.  The chemist might prescribe himself and give him the medicine and afterwards he would not be in the position to recover payment for the bottle.  I did not think of that position.  If I were putting down amendment 14 again I might like to alter it, to allow for such a position.  I would like to protect the chemist.  The same thing is in the Medical Act as is in this amendment. Deputy Dr. Hennessy spoke about this amendment and said it was immoral. Deputy Dr. Hennessy should be the last man to talk about amendment 14 being immoral, because I took it out of the Medical Act.  If Deputy Dr. Hennessy was not responsible for that at least he should know something about it.  If it is immoral to have this in the Medical Act he should have brought in an amending Bill here long ago.</P>

      <P>It would be just as well to explain again.

      <P>It is the position of the medical profession and of the veterinary profession.  Deputy Hennessy need not have any heartaches about this at all.  It is a matter that will settle itself in the country without his assistance.  This question of whether fees are charged or not will automatically settle itself.  It has settled itself before now without any reference to law courts and it will continue to do it. Anything that will not give the farmer the privilege of calling in any man he needs, whether he is an employee or not, or whether he is a stockowner or not, will not be accepted by me and will not be accepted by a considerable number of the farmers on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches.  This is too small to be made a Party matter.  I do not believe it is a Party matter and Deputy Ryan has no more claim to this amendment than I have, because it is taken entirely from the English Act. I am astonished that a man with intelligence, like Deputy Dr. Hennessy, describes it as immoral.  It was also described by Deputy Bennett as immoral.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As these amendments have been ruled out of order, I should like to say a few words on the Schedule. There was considerable discussion here before about the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; in the First Schedule, and the Minister gave the impression that it was inserted by him in the Schedule. Speaking on Section 2, which refers to the Schedule, on the Committee Stage the Minister wound up his speech by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>With regard to the famous point about treason, some Deputy spoke on the Second Reading about striking off every person being in the agreement.  I said it was not in the agreement, and neither is it, and I say so still.  What is in the agreement is that if a person is adjudged guilty of treason in this country, and is after that put off our register by our Council, he will not be able to go to England and say he is a member of the General Council, and then come back here by virtue of that channel.  That is my clause in the agreement, and nobody else's.  I am not going to have people adjudged guilty of treason in this country being shoved back on us as veterinary surgeons because an English authority did not think them guilty of treason.  I would like the Deputy to ponder over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> I took the Minister's advice and did ponder over it, and the only thing I can make out is that the Minister thought it necessary to put this clause about treason into the agreement so as to prevent those who were put off the register here for treason going across to England and getting on the General Register, and by that means coming back to the Free State Register again.  That was the Minister's reason for putting treason into the agreement.  That may be all right &mdash;probably it is.  But the strange thing is, if we go back to the discussion on the Dentists Act we will see that I raised precisely that point, that there was no use in talking about treason in the Dentists Act, because if a person were put off the dentists' register here he could go across to England, get on the General Register, and come back to the Free State Register. The Minister then said I was wrong.  There was no mention of treason in the agreement on the question of the dentists, so that if the Minister is right in his contention here, that it was necessary for him to put that clause about treason into the veterinary surgeons' agreement in order to prevent the veterinary surgeon who was put off for treason here going and getting on the General Register in Great Britain, and by that means coming back here on to the Free State Register, he must, I believe, have been wrong when, on the 9th November, 1927, when I made that very point about the dentists' register, he told me that I was wrong.  I held that I was not wrong, and he resorted to his usual impertinence by telling me to read the agreement and, when I said I had read it, he then said it was a matter of understanding.  I should like to ask the Minister if I am right in saying that his reason for putting treason into this agreement was to prevent a veterinary surgeon who was put off the register here for treason getting on the register in England, and by that means getting back on the Free State Register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to enter a protest on behalf of the rural areas against the manner in which they are treated as regards the delivery of letters and the postal service generally. Deliveries two or three times a week in some of the outlying areas may be good enough as far as the requirements of those districts are concerned, but to be fair to those people there should be similar deliveries applicable to the whole of the country.  One would imagine that when we had a farmer's representative in charge of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the farming community and the rural areas generally, would receive, if not preferential <Col N="215" /> treatment to which in my opinion they are entitled, at least receive ordinary and fair treatment. The very opposite is the fact.  We have in what is known as the economic arrangement of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs very severe curtailments in the facilities available.  There have been but two or three deliveries per week and there have been drastic cuts in the salaries and allowances of those engaged in the postal service in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for imposing as a public service the cost of that service on the whole of the community and giving preferential treatment to the towns and cities as against the rural areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary may argue that the towns and cities having a bigger volume of business are entitled to better service.  But if you remove the rural areas you will find that you could dispense with the whole of the posts and telegraph service because without the rural areas the towns and the cities could not survive. And it is entirely wrong from the national point of view not to extend the same treatment and social service to those living in the rural areas as is extended to those living in the towns and cities.  It is quite contrary to any national outlook that any responsible officer in charge of any Department of the State should take up that attitude.  I hold that not alone are the rural areas very badly treated in that respect but that the Parliamentary Secretary or whatever persons are responsible to him have not exercised even ordinary intelligence in allotting the areas for the purposes of facilitating the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made reports and representations to the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department over a year ago in reference to a district in which the delivery service takes place from two post offices.  One post office is six miles distant and another two and a half or three miles.  The postman from the three miles distant post office passes through two townlands in which he delivers no letters, and then passes to townlands further on and delivers letters there.  The postman from the six-mile <Col N="216" /> distant post office comes back and delivers his letters in these two or three townlands through which the other postman has already passed. That would require some explanation, and so grave is the inconvenience in this district that people resident in these townlands have made representations to the Department that their letters should be sent to the post office nearest them, and that they would collect deliveries themselves, thus further assisting the Parliamentary Secretary in his economy drive in this matter.</P>
    <P>Let me take the question of telegraph delivery, and here again we find the rural areas are victimised and scandalously victimised.  I know a district where if a person receives a telegram he has to pay 2/6 on receiving it, although 1/6 has been paid by the sender, so that there is a charge of 4/- for that telegram.  How can that be justified?  Why should a person have to pay 4/- for what a man in a town or city can obtain for 1/6?  It is simply victimisation of the man living in rural districts as against those living in towns and cities.  I can understand the Parliamentary Secretary has taken all necessary precautions to reduce expenditure and to bring it down to the very minimum, but if he is to be consistent, and if he is to act as a man who represents himself as a farmers' representative, why he should have gone deliberately out of his way to show preference to the town and city dwellers as against the farmers it is very difficult to understand.  I do not care where the man comes from or whether he represents the farmer or the city man, so long as he is fair and just from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has reduced the rates of our rural postmen down to the poverty-line.  I am not able to say what he has done in this respect in regard to the towns and the cities, but I know that in the rural district that these men cannot possibly afford the cut to the extent to which it was applied.  I know men working from seven o'clock in the morning until five o'clock in the evening for little over a pound a week. That is not in accordance with what <Col N="217" /> an efficient service would pay such men.  I say that the postal service as at present controlled and managed is from the point of view of efficiency a complete failure and deserves censure from those representing the rural districts in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement yesterday afternoon drew attention to the fact that the postal services and telegraph services were practically now on a self-supporting basis.  May I remind him that that achievement is as a result of placing a heavy burden on the users of the service in the Free State, and that it is a very heavy burden on trade and commerce in this country.  Of course it is quite obvious to Deputies that the great mass of the correspondence passing through this country and passing out of this country into the adjoining country is in connection with trade and commerce.  Might I remind him that at present we are burdened in connection with postal services to the extent of 30 per cent. over Northern Ireland and in connection with telegraphic services to the extent of 50 per cent. over the North?  These are heavy burdens and they fall particularly heavily on the commercial community who, as I have said, use these services very largely.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary some statement as to whether there is any likelihood of relief being given to that section of our community from these two heavy additional burdens.  Deputy Maguire seems to think that the rural areas are sacrificed for the cities, but if he makes inquiry into the problem I think he will find that the reverse is true and that the cities are being burdened to help the rural areas.  I think it will be the view of the House and very largely the view of the country, that if the Parliamentary Secretary could achieve economics in the rural areas without curtailing services too much he would be acting in the interests of the State. Unless economies of that kind are effected at the expense of services we cannot hope to get rid of these crushing burdens.  So far as we, on this side of the House, are concerned, we will <Col N="218" /> be prepared to support the Parliamentary Secretary in his efforts to achieve economics in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy inquires into the matter he will find that I am correct.  As to the improvement in the telephone services mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, we on this side of the House have urged on many occasions that that was a line of policy that would have our strong support. We hold that future development will largely be through the telephone services, and that if those services are properly developed it will mean easing the burden in regard to both the telegraphic and postal services.  I am not at all satisfied that that efficiency is being achieved in connection with the telephonic service which we were led by the Parliamentary Secretary to believe was taking place.  I would be glad to hear from other Deputies whether I personally have been unfortunate in my experience in my constituency in regard to the telephone service.  The facts which I have brought before the House on previous occasions do not show that there is that efficiency in that service in my particular area which we were led to believe exists.  As Deputies will remember, I have had to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that in a large area in Dublin, Rathmines, applicants for telephone connections have had to wait in many cases for eighteen months before they could get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been discussing this afternoon the question of medical services for some hours.  Take the position of medical men moving into that area.  I <Col N="219" /> know the case of at least one doctor who had to wait eighteen months before getting a telephone connection, and I know cases of several businessmen in that area who were in a similar plight.  If that is what the Parliamentary Secretary calls efficiency, then I do not know what efficiency is.  It was only yesterday that in another portion of my constituency, Drumcondra, I had a case in which a businessman living away from his premises wanted to get a telephone connection in his house to keep in touch with his business.  Six months ago he applied for a connection but has not yet got it.  He received a letter to say that he will get it in two months, and I got a letter saying that it would be put in within one month.  I do not desire to stress the question of efficiency too much, but I would like to see more efficiency in connection with the telephone service.</P>
    <P>In connection with the estimate I would point out that on Page 261 there is shown a considerable increase amounting to £5,700 for the current year in connection with the packet service, from £20,400 to £26,100.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could give us some particulars in connection with that heavy service I would be obliged. Another considerable increase is shown in a Department which, on the face of it, does not look like increased efficiency. On Page 262 of the Estimates Deputies will see that the losses by default, accident, etc., have increased from £1,200 in the year 1930-31 to £3,600 in the current year.  That is a very alarming increase.  I do not want to say anything about its relation to increased efficiency, about which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke, but one would, at all events, like to have some information as to the reasons for this heavy additional charge in connection with this particular item.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking yesterday in connection with the postal branch of his Department, the Parliamentary Secretary is reported as having stated that for the first time in the history of the postal service the postal branch was on a paying basis.  He is also reported <Col N="220" /> to have stated that the postal branch, according to the estimated commercial accounts for 1930-31, showed an estimated profit of approximately £16,500 compared with a loss of £19,352 last year.  I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that there are approximately in the Saorstát 2,500 auxiliary postmen who, as he knows, are mostly part-time employees and, in addition, there are 1,000 employees known as allowance deliverers. At present some of these men are in receipt of scandalous wages.  Some only receive 11s., 12s., 13s. or 14s. a week, and I understand that quite recently in Buncrana, Co. Donegal, at the request of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department one of the allowance deliverers had his wages reduced to 10s. per week.</P>
      <P>A plea has been made to-day by Deputy Good to the Parliamentary Secretary to achieve further economies in rural areas.  I put it to the House that if economies are going to be effected the axe should be wielded at the top instead of at the bottom.  Why try to bring employees of the Post Office below the starvation level? Deputies have heard of coolie wages, but, after all, though coolies on board ship may have a low rate of wages, they are, at least, maintained and fed. So far as auxiliary postmen and other part-time employees are concerned, they are not able to earn sufficient wages to keep body and soul together. The Parliamentary Secretary told us with a flourish of trumpets yesterday that last year a profit of £16,000 was made by the postal services.  I say that that profit has been made at the expense of the lower paid employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is the duty of the State to provide work for citizens and for the heads of families at a rate of wages sufficient to allow these heads of families and their wives and children to live in a proper state of comfort.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, notwithstanding the demand made by Deputy Good for further economies in rural areas, to consider seriously giving an all-round increase of 5/- per week to auxiliary postmen and to these other carriers. That is not an extravagant demand. <Col N="221" /> Even if he gave an increase of 5/- per week, it would not bring their wages up to a proper level, but they are paid a scandalous rate of wages at present. If economy is to be effected, why not effect it at the top?  Why attack the lowest paid servants of the State?  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider seriously giving these men an all-round increase of 5/- per week.  The rates that are at present being paid are absolutely scandalous.  The wretched scale of wages paid at present will not permit these men and their wives and families to live in a proper state of comfort.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the rates of wages paid in these districts are based on the rates paid to agricultural labourers, but I say that the State should be a model employer.  If, for instance, in certain industries, where trade boards are established, an employer refuses to pay the recognised rate of wages he is prosecuted, and rightly so, and he has got to pay the proper rate of wages. Here we have the State, which should be a model employer, asking men to work for 10s. a week.  It is only right to say that some of these men are only part-time employees but the majority of them are not able to get any other employment and have to subsist with their wives and families on the wages they receive from the Post Office.  Notwithstanding the appeals made by Deputy Good on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, and the people in Rathmines, for further economies in rural districts, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider increasing these men's rates of wages as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the representatives of other rural districts in pointing out what I consider to be the unfair treatment of some of these districts.  It is a common thing to find in some of these districts that there are only two deliveries in the week.  There is no comparison, Deputy Good will realise, between the facilities which exist in the cities and important towns in regard to postal deliveries, telephonic communication, and even telegrams and the treatment meted out to farmers who live 7, 8, <Col N="222" /> 10, or a greater number of miles away from a town and who only receive two deliveries in the week.  There are instances in my own constituency in which there are deliveries only on Mondays and Thursdays.  As one coming from a rural district, the Parliamentary Secretary himself will, I think, realise the disabilities which exist in these areas.  Last year, and on other occasions, I tried to rectify the position in certain instances in which people have over and over again approached me on this issue.  I think it is false economy, and it is unfair to the rural taxpayer, to reduce services to their detriment.  I am sorry to hear Deputy Good, as representing the City of Dublin, calling for further economies at the expense of rural districts, particularly when Dublin is so very well provided with postal and telephonic facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass yesterday pointed out a matter which might possibly be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;namely, the matter of improving the telegraphic facilities by allowing an increased number of words.  For instance, a person living in my district lives only 60 miles from here, but if a telegram of 12 words is sent to him, it costs 3/6 before it is delivered, while a telegram of 18 words costs 4/-.  On that question, I think the Deputies would unanimously agree that if greater facilities were given without any additional cost it would possibly make the telegraphic section of the Post Office a more paying proposition, because it would facilitate those people particularly who have bad postal services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would further appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage to give his earnest consideration to the question of increasing, at least by an additional day, the deliveries in those districts which at present have only a two-day delivery in the week.  I think Deputies will agree that these people have not the amenities of life which residents of the cities and towns enjoy, and that they should be allowed better <Col N="223" /> facilities than a delivery on Mondays and Thursdays.  If an additional day were added it would be all to the good. I think it is very bad policy to cut down the wages of rural postmen unduly. Perhaps if their wages were increased and they were asked to carry out an additional day's delivery in the week in the districts which I have indicated it would meet the situation. You would then be getting something in return for the extra expenditure.  I hope that Deputies will agree that the time is ripe for making these changes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal, namely the system of delivery in the town of Mountmellick. One part of the town gets an early delivery and the other part does not. The Town Commissioners have been recently discussing this matter.  I think the whole town should get equal facilities as regards delivery.  It has been a bone of contention for quite a number of years.  I do not see why one particular end of the town should get better facilities than another.  I think all the people of the town should get equal treatment.  It is not such a large town and it would be easy to arrange it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary from time to time has told us of the wonderful progress which the Post Office is making, and how the deficit has been reduced.  We, on these benches, have complained that we have not been in a position to deal with the statements of the Parliamentary Secretary adequately because of the delay in publishing the ordinary commercial accounts of the Post Office. The seriousness of the disadvantage which we have been placed under by that delay would be instanced by this statement which is appended to these commercial accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in reference to the pension liability which has to be borne by the Post Office.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As will be seen from the General Expenditure and Income Account the provision for pension liability was £118,731, whereas the pensions <Col N="224" /> paid during the year amounted to £178,831.  The pension payments during the seven years ended 31st March, 1929 (£1,181,365) exceed the total provision for pension liability during the period (£931,985) by £249,380.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a clear indication that so far as the pension liability is concerned the Post Office is not making sufficient provision, and with that fact in mind it is quite easy for us to see how it is that the Parliamentary Secretary is reducing the deficit.  He is reducing the deficit by not meeting his liabilities, by leaving them to his successors to shoulder the burden.  I think that, as I said last night, it would be much better if the Parliamentary Secretary were candid in this matter, came to the Dáil, and made full disclosure of the position of the Post Office and did not try to fool the Dáil and the public into the belief that economies were being made and efficiency secured, which were reducing the loss of the Post Office when, in fact, as the commercial accounts show, he is doing nothing of the sort.</P>
    <P>I said also last night that, as far as telegraphs are concerned, the measures the Parliamentary Secretary has taken to deal with the deficit were not only fatuous, but even positively injurious. The Parliamentary Secretary devised these measures in order to reduce that deficit.  Instead of reducing it he has, as Deputy Lemass clearly proved last night, increased it by no less a sum, I think, in eight months, than almost over £6,000.  I think that the increase in the cost of telegrams, when it was not accompanied by an effort to make the telegrams more attractive to the business people, was wrongly conceived. Apparently the whole attitude of the Post Office in this matter is founded on the belief that the telegraph is an obsolete service, that it must eventually fall into disuse, and that in course of time it will be superseded by the telephone.  I suppose that is one of the disadvantages from which public services which are not under the control of people who have actual experience of business and the requirements of business must always suffer. Apparently the Parliamentary <Col N="225" /> Secretary is not aware that the telegraph, so far from being an obsolete service, is in many respects, in certain circumstances, superior to the telephone service from the point of view of the business man.  There are many transactions, and transactions generally of the highest importance, where it is desirable that there should be a written record, not only of the message as handed in by the sender, but of the message as it is received by the addressee, instructions relating to important construction of works, acceptance of offers to buy and sell, and instructions concerning the delivery of certain goods.  In every one of those cases the telegraph has the advantage over the telephone that a written record is made, not only by the sender, but by the addressee.  It has also another advantage.  The telephone, it has been said is a great saver of the time of many of us who use it constantly, but also it may be a great waste of time.  There are many cases where a valuable 15 or 20 minutes has been wasted trying to get into communication with a subscriber over the telephone.  I suppose that applies particularly to messages which have to be sent over the trunk line.  In the busy main centres much time has to be wasted in trying to get into communication by telephone.  A man may wish to send a message by a service which will not require so much of his personal attention and time, and in that case the telegraph does offer to him an advantage that the telephone does not possess.  The moment the need for the message arises he has not to wait for an hour and a half until some other matter engages his attention and the matter which first engaged it has gone out of his mind.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the telegraph has very striking advantages which possibly would be widely used if they were made available upon reasonable terms.  The disadvantage of the twelve-word message for eighteen pence is that in very few circumstances is it of real practical utility. If, instead of fixing a limit of 12 words to the message, we were to fix a limit of 30 words, in which a detailed message could be sent for eighteen pence, then the telegraph would have very <Col N="226" /> practical advantages over the telephone, and would, as I have said, be generally used by the business community in a number of cases.  For instance, I believe that is the experience in America, that the telegraphic letter is for many purposes superseding the telephone altogether.  The basis of costing in relation to telegrams is altogether wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other question that I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, and that is in relation to statements which appeared in some of the civil service journals as to the conditions which prevailed in the Post Office at Christmas time.  There were very definite and categorical statements published in, I think, &ldquo;An Peann,&rdquo; that owing to the under-staffing at Christmas, and the inefficiency of some of the supervisory officials, a great deal of valuable time was lost.  There was a delay of several days in the delivery of mails, and there was altogether such a state of disorganisation in the central sorting offices in Dublin that a great deal of loss must have been occasioned, <Col N="227" /> not only to the State but to the community as a whole.  When he is replying I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to state whether he has seen these statements in the Press; whether he has taken any action with regard to them; whether he is going to allow matters next Christmas to be as they were last year; and whether there is again to be disorganisation, loss of time in the delivery of mails as well as loss to the State and to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, yesterday, and Deputy MacEntee, to-day, referred to what they style delay in the publication of the commercial accounts.  As Deputies know, the commercial accounts are not the only Post Office accounts.  The Post Office accounts are dealt with in the ordinary way in the Government accounts, in the Estimates, the Appropriation Accounts and the Revenue Accounts. It would be quite possible to conceive a situation where we simply relied on these accounts.  But it has been the custom of the Post Office to prepare supplementary accounts, called commercial accounts, based on the idea that the Post Office is to be regarded as being in a similar position to a commercial firm.  These accounts are prepared by the Post Office following the close of the financial year.  For reasons involving certain questions, such as international payments between this and other countries, the accounts cannot be completed by the Post Office until about the month of October. When completed they are sent to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to be audited and are passed on by him to the Department of Finance.  As far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is concerned, its function is finished when the commercial accounts are passed on to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I believe the accounts are published and are made available for the Dáil about 15 months after the close of each financial year. I want to emphasise that the commercial accounts are only supplementary and additional to the ordinary Government accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Deputy Lemass, in particular, and also Deputy MacEntee, entered into an elaborate analysis of the financial position of the Post Office.  Very wisely I think, Deputy Lemass then delved into one aspect of the Post Office activities, the telegraphic side, ignoring almost completely the other activities of the Post Office, and forgetting to give credit of any kind for the achievements of the Department as a whole.  I think the outstanding points in connection with the Estimates that have been submitted here&mdash;and I have no hesitation in emphasising the point&mdash;is the fact that an initial loss of £1,100,000 in 1922 has been reduced to £160,000, and that the postal side of our activities, which in 1922 was incurring a very considerable loss, is now at least on a paying basis, returning a surplus of something like £16,500 this year.  A loss on the post side of £656,210 has been converted into a profit of £16,500.  On the telephone side a loss of £46,014 in 1922 has now been reduced to nil, and in that section of our service is also included a very considerable reduction in our charges which was made in 1925.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in emphasising the achievements that we have brought about in regard to the general services, and I want to say that I and the other people working in my Department are pardonably proud of the achievement.  On the telegraphic side Deputy Lemass, regarding that evidently as the weak link in the chain, entered into an elaborate analysis of the position.  The Deputy dealt in an intricate fashion with a whole series of figures, going back to the increase of the telegraphic rate in 1928, and referred to the various commercial accounts and to statements made by me on the Estimates.  It is quite evident that Deputy Lemass could not expect me to reply to statements of that kind.  I might have been called upon to reply yesterday.  It would be quite impossible for me to reply to statements of that kind across the House or to deal with a whole series of tabulated figures.  It appears to me Deputy Lemass must have had the idea when he was making the statement that he was making suitable material for another speech down the country on <Col N="229" /> one of his Sunday excursions, on a matter which I had not an opportunity of dealing with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he did not discover for himself in the commercial accounts that the figures he gave to the House were the wrong figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with them. I had the pleasure of dealing in the Seanad to-day with other postal department matters, and a Senator who had the occasion to deal with some intricate matters in connection with the telephone service supplied me beforehand with information as to what he wanted to discuss. Deputy Lemass did not supply me with information of that kind.  He might have had the courtesy to do so, as he knows that it is ordinarily what would be done by a leader or a vice-leader of a Party.  I have not got the figures, but I have a general idea of the statements that were made by the Deputy. I had no means of getting his figures beyond a short summary in the newspapers. However, I think I have got enough to know the basis on which the Deputy made his charges.</P>
      <P>The Deputy says that I supplied him with wrong and with false figures.  I think Deputy MacEntee emphasised that by saying that I deliberately supplied the Dáil with cooked figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Deputy MacEntee made a hash of them.  The House will find that anything supplied to the Dáil purporting to be actual figures are figures over which we can stand.  When Estimates are dealt with here in the Dáil we are anxious to supply the Deputies with all possible information as regards the Post Office and its workings, and so give estimated figures where actual figures are not yet available.  That being so I will deal with the particular figures. I stated in every case in which figures were supplied that they were estimated <Col N="230" /> figures when that was so.  That being so we did not guarantee that these estimated figures might not show some change later, but such changes are usually trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to estimated figures at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will give me a chance of making my statement to the House.  In so far as these figures are concerned I maintain that any figures purporting to be actual figures given to the Dáil by me are accurate.  The Deputy has gone back and he deals in particular with the figures given by me in my statement made in the Dáil on the Estimates during a debate on the 15th May, 1929, Volume 29, column 2010.  I want to state as regards those figures that Deputy Lemass's charges as to supplying inaccurate or incorrect figures seems to arise entirely out of the statement I made on the 15th May, 1929.  I want to tell the House that most of the figures given in that statement were estimated figures, and that they are approximately correct, with one exception, which I will explain later.  In the statement made then I got as close to the actual facts as I could.  I will not at any time commit myself in any estimate of figures to more than that.  The position is this, that, dealing with the telegraph side, the Deputy discovered that in the figures for 1927-28 the revenue figure was given in my statement as £223,733.  That figure will be found in column 2011 on the 15th May, 1929, in my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only figure that was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that that figure did not coincide with the figures as given in the commercial accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy indicated that the figure did not coincide with the figure in the commercial accounts for 1927/28, because that figure was £235,804.  He said that, similarly, the figures given for the loss on the telegraph service for the year 1927/28, £154,283, did not correspond with the <Col N="231" /> figures shown in the actual commercial accounts.  That was £142,212.  I will account for that, and when I have accounted for it I will case the Deputy's mind as to the supposed inaccuracies about which he is speaking. If the Deputy will look up the commercial accounts for 1929, page 16, telegraphs, he will find there, lower down on the page, that there is an item of £12,071 credited to accounts for wireless broadcasting licences.  That item up to the end of 1927/28 was included in the revenue from telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not included in that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  It is included in the item of telegraphs.  Therefore the loss on the Telegraph Branch in 1927/28 is greater by that amount.  In order to show the comparable figures in the statement dealing with that year, 1927/28, and the year 1928/29, we proceed to subtract from the revenue the amount which has been credited for wireless licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the Deputy did not.  If the amount under the head of wireless licences is allowed for, the Deputy will find that most of the basis on which he claimed that our figures are incorrect, goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave us the figure of £223,733, and I say that figure is correct.  Take the same items for the following year and it is £220,219, whereas the figure the Parliamentary Secretary gave us was £223,610.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement was made in May, 1929.  The figures were given for 1928/29, and they were stated to be estimated figures for the reason that they could not be at that stage anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, but I want to point out to him that on these figures the increase on the telegraphic charge was not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal first with the accuracy of the figures.  I take <Col N="232" /> it that the accuracy of the figures is now accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The accuracy of the figures is accepted, I take it.  I am not dealing with the deduction which the Deputy draws.  I am dealing with the accuracy of the figures as supplied to the Dáil.  It is important that we should deal with them and understand that so far as we purported to give correct figures we have given them, and so far as we purported to give estimated figures we are close to the mark.  There was only one altered estimation of any importance.  That was the estimate of expenditure for 1927-28.  We under-estimated the amount of expenditure.  That was a genuine under-estimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For 1927-28 there was an over-estimation, and in the following year an under-estimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a considerable over-estimation of the reduction likely to accrue in 1927-28. That was a genuine mistake.  That arose in this way&mdash;we naturally expected a considerable reduction in the staff due to dealing with a smaller number of telegrams.  We expected that the staff would be largely reduced by the operations of the Committee set up to deal with the application for retirement under Article 10 of the Treaty.  But that Committee did not sit until the following year, and we were left with officials whom we had to provide for, as their retirement did not take place owing to their cases not having been taken up by the Committee that year.  So much for the accuracy of the figures.  I think it will be accepted that the figures are accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation of their inaccuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy possibly could not understand the figures, or probably he did not want to understand them.  I come now to deal with the question of telegraph charges.  Deputy Lemass made many statements and I made statements, and somebody has <Col N="233" /> to judge.  We are satisfied that the effect of the increased charge on telegrams was to reduce the loss suffered by the Post Office, and that the Post Office is now in a better financial position than it would otherwise be, because of the increase in the charges on telegrams.  I definitely maintain that that is so.  I will not go into an elaborate argument to explain that, but I will outline our views.</P>
      <P>The loss on the telegraph side of the Post Office in 1927-28 was £154,283. That loss has been reduced to £127,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the figure in the accounts for 1927-28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, allowing for the £12,000 credited to the account for wireless telegraph revenue, which ought to be added to the loss given in the commercial accounts.  So there is a very definite improvement so far as the loss is concerned.  So far as this Department is concerned, when we decided to increase the telegraph charges we had come to the conclusion that the telegraph expenditure side had reached a static position.  Our expenditure could not come down to any appreciable extent while our revenue was definitely coming down and at an accelerated rate.  The result would be that we would have increased losses.  Instead of that we now have reduced losses. The revenue for 1927-28 was £223,733. That has fallen to £203,400.  If the rate of fall which existed previous to the increase in charges had gone on the loss in revenue this year would have been very much larger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fall in revenue between 1926-27 and 1927-28 was only £3,000.  Then the increased charge went on and the revenue decreased by £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to go back further than that.  At the actual rate of decline of traffic at the time the increased charge was put on, if continued up to the end of the last financial year the loss in revenue would be approximately £25,000, while the actual loss, after the increased charge, is approximately £20,000.  So that there has been a definite advantage there. I believe I have justified the statement <Col N="234" /> that the increase in the charge has definitely improved the financial position of the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, it accelerated the decline in revenue, as the figures show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taking it that the decline in revenue was going to go on at the rate at which it was going on, but we were definitely of the opinion that the decline in revenue would be accelerated without the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the loss would be greater because of the fact that the expenditure could not be reduced. Deputy Lemass thinks that if we go back to the reduced charge of 1/- again it will improve the position without decreasing the actual loss on the telegraph side.  The financial effect of reducing the charge to a shilling at the present rate of telegraphic traffic would amount to £203,400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>In going back to a shilling the loss would be £35,000. That is taking it that the amount of traffic would not increase appreciably. We are satisfied that the amount of traffic would not increase appreciably. We have reasons for being so satisfied. One of the reasons is, and I think it is a fairly convincing reason, at the time the shilling charge was increased there was a continual decline in the amount of traffic.  There was an acceleration of the decline in the first three months of 1927-28.  The decline in traffic in the first three months of 1927-28 was such that in twelve months, at the same rate, it would amount to £17,700.  Is there any indication that if we go back to the shilling rate we would increase the telegraphic traffic? I do not think there is.  We realise <Col N="235" /> that the telegraph side of our activities has got to be carried on, but we realise also that the public have turned definitely from the telegraph side to the telephones, and that the telegraph side is mainly being used as an emergency service.  The fact of the matter is that the decline still continues.  I am convinced that the decline is not mainly due to the effect of the higher charge.  I believe that the full effect of the higher charge was spent within a year or two years of the increase, but the decline still continues, the reason being that people are getting telephone-minded. They are getting used to long-distance telephoning.  The decline is easing off. I think it will reach a state soon where it will remain more or less static.  While the telegraph side is an emergency service, we have got to carry it on as a burden on the other services of the Post Office.  I see no way out of it. I believe that the effect of decreasing the charge would lead to increase in our losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only effect of that would be that we would lose revenue.  I do not see any reason to think that we would get increased traffic.  If the traffic was confined to the 1/6 rate for increased words we would lose revenue.  I do not think there would be any increased traffic, because there are not many people who would want to send telegrams costing more than 1/6 who would be inclined to use the telegraph service.  It would definitely increase our losses.  I am not looking at the effect on the facilities provided to the outside public at all.  Viewing it merely as a commercial proposition or business matter, I am quite satisfied that advantage has been gained and that our accounts are better because of the increased charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn from that to certain criticism by other Deputies, the criticisms which Deputy Good and Deputy Maguire made, to a certain extent, cancel each other.  Deputy Good <Col N="236" /> wants increased facilities for the city, while Deputy Maguire wants increased facilities for the country.  I will leave them to argue it out between themselves. As to the complaint made by Deputy Good about delays in providing telephone facilities, I think the Deputy has been pressing that point a little bit too far.  It has been explained very fully to him on various occasions that we have done everything in our power to meet any applications that have come in, and to give consideration to any special recommendation by Deputy Good.  Where people give urgent reasons for getting telephones we are prepared at the moment to meet any requirements.  You cannot at all times meet every requirement in every exchange.  I do not know that we will ever reach the position where we will be able at all times to meet the full requirements.  There will be exchanges where we can easily meet the requirements, but there will be exchanges where there will be congestion, and it will take some little time to make the extensions.</P>
    <P>In regard to Rathmines, there was congestion there for various reasons which have been explained already mainly owing to the inheritance of an obsolete system.  We are about to build a post office and exchange there.  We had to put down new cables, as you cannot carry lines to people's houses without cables.  In order to meet the emergency which Deputy Good has been pressing so much about, that people were in urgent need of telephones, we have set up a temporary exchange at Terenure and are prepared to meet all the requirements of the Terenure and Rathmines districts, and I do not believe that there will be a demand for a telephone in these areas that cannot be supplied in the next two or three months.  When we have the post office and telephone exchange built at Rathmines we shall be able to meet the requirements of that district for the next fifteen years.  A similar situation obtains in Drumcondra, and it is only in regard to these two areas that any complaint exists.  We are meeting that situation.  There is no question of inefficiency. The inefficiency on the part <Col N="237" /> of the telephone service has altogether been with the people who passed it on to us&mdash;who passed on an inefficient and obsolete system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that when I raised the question of Rathmines three years ago I was told that a new station was then in course of preparation. That new station is not in existence today. Is that inefficiency or otherwise? I want to be quite fair to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to leave it to the House also.  The Deputy wanted some information as to the actual items in the Estimate and referred in particular to item E 5&mdash;the Packet Service&mdash;as to which there is an increase of about £5,000.  That is on account of anticipating an adjustment of the amount to be paid by the Saorstát towards the Dun Laoghaire and Holyhead mail packet service.  We have been paying a certain amount and certain negotiations were going on.  It was anticipated that the amount would be increased.  It has been increased, but not quite to the amount that this item would suggest.  There has been, however, a final settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The future charge has been fixed.  The figure given in the Estimates is not the future charge.  The future charge is a lesser amount than the actual figure given here.  As to losses in default, provision has been made in regard to one special case in Mayo where a considerable loss has been incurred.  We do not accept responsibility for these losses, but in anticipation of possibly having to accept responsibility we have to make provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to enter into a discussion of the inspection system, because that was dealt with by the Public Accounts Committee and there is a certain point of view held by our Department which does not agree with the point of view expressed by the Public Accounts Committee as to the inspectorial system. I think we shall have to thresh it out in some other place and in some other way.  We believe that the expense which would be attached to establishing an inspection system which would guarantee immunity against any loss would be altogether excessive and would take away any advantages which we have in profits in the services which we render.  We believe that the cost of the additional kind of safeguard, if it is possible to have a safeguard against certain offences, would be altogether excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into an elaborate discussion of this, because it cannot be fully discussed here, but the actual average amount lost is not very large.  There may be occasionally a big loss, and this is unfortunately one.  A particularly clever person will succeed in evading all safeguards occasionally. I had better not say anything more, as this case is sub judice.  Various Deputies have raised the question of the position of rural, auxiliary, and part-time postmen.  I should like to say, whether Deputies are aware of it or not, that they are making statements <Col N="239" /> with regard to the rates of wages, which are definitely untrue. There has been no reduction in the rates at all&mdash;none whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary deny that as a result of certain reorganisations or changes which have been made recently some auxiliary postmen and some allowance deliverers are receiving less wages than a year ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to make my case, I will explain. There has been no reduction whatever in rates of pay.  There has, of course, been a reduction in the bonus, just as there has been a reduction in the bonus of every public servant.  As far as the basic rates are concerned, there has been no reduction, so that the statement that there has been a reduction in the rates of pay is not true.  There have been reorganisations and alterations of routes and changes in certain districts, but these alterations and re-adjustments are constantly going on all over the country, and must go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of which some auxiliary postmen are at present receiving a less rate of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might possible happen that a man who was an auxiliary might become an allowance part-time postman.  If that happened in a readjustment it might mean a very slight reduction&mdash;perhaps a 1/2d. an hour.  That would be a trivial thing and would only happen in very exceptional circumstances. We must keep ourselves free to reorganise and readjust our postal routes all over the country generally with the idea of giving better facilities to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very low rate of wages which these men are receiving, will the Parliamentary Secretary give consideration to the suggestion I have put forward, that there should be an all-round increase of 5/- per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may make all the capital he likes out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making no capital out of it.  I am stating a plain fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of wages are exactly as they were.  There has been no reduction.  The basic rates are the same.  The bonus, of course, has decreased.  The 16/- or 20/- or 25/-, or whatever wage the auxiliary postman happens to get, is not a week's pay, and the Deputy knows it well.  That is only the pay for a certain number of hours' service, and when that number of hours' service has been given, the postman is free to take up any work which he likes, and many of them do.  One of the conditions of appointment is that a postman, if he has not already part-time work, will endeavour to secure part-time work, in addition to the work which he may get from the Post Office.  I would ask Deputies from rural areas who are advocating this to realise what the effect of the change would be if these part-time men were converted into fulltime men.  I think Deputy Davin advocated that the auxiliary postmen at present working part-time should be converted into established postmen, or something corresponding to that, doing a full day's work for a full day's pay.  I do not know whether the Deputy actually suggested that, but I think it was suggested.  I want to tell Deputies what the effect of it would be. First of all, it would mean definitely an inferior service in the country.  At present, our policy is, as far as possible, to give early morning deliveries regularly, and, in so far as it is necessary to do so, to have late collections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who receives letters by post wants to get early deliveries, and if you convert your existing part-time postmen into whole-time men, incidentally dispensing with about half of them, it means that people, instead of getting letters at 8, 9, or 10 o'clock in the <Col N="241" /> morning, may get them at 2 o'clock in the day.  I do not think the public would be pleased with that.  I do not think that the people represented by the Deputies who complain would like it.  It would also have the effect of dispensing with the services of a good proportion of our existing auxiliary postmen.  If you convert two four-hours-a-day duty men into one eight-hours-a-day man, it means that one man is dispensed with, and it would mean creating a good deal of unemployment in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Davin did not raise it, the question was raised by somebody else.  Deputy Davin certainly raised the question of the accommodation in the Pearse Street Sorting Office, and complained that there was inadequate accommodation in the Pearse Street office.  That is not so.  We acknowledge that the accommodation there is pretty tight, that there is not much to spare, but at the same time there is sufficient accommodation to carry out the work. The accommodation is temporary.  We intend to improve the accommodation as early as it is possible, and we intend to have a central office for all sorting.  But that is going to take some time; it cannot be done at once. But the present accommodation in Pearse Street is not inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no break down at the Pearse Street office; there was a slight delay.  Only a very slight portion of the mail matter passing through Pearse Street office was delayed. I had the matter very carefully inquired into, and I know what happened. There was no break down; there was certain congestion and a very small proportion of the mail matter was not delivered on Christmas Day but was delivered on the 27th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The greater part of that break down was not due to the Post Office at all, but was due to the public so far as one could blame them. Instructions are always issued to the public that we would not guarantee the delivery of mail matter at Christmas not posted before the 22nd of December. We will always do our best to deliver it, but we will not guarantee delivery. It so happened this year that from the position which Christmas Day occupied in the week an undue proportion of matter was posted on the 22nd and 23rd.  Now, it is almost impossible to make arrangements with regard to a temporary staff and office accommodation for dealing with an unprecedented flood of mail matter all concentrated on one or two days.  We asked the public to co-operate with us, and to a certain extent they did, but not altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary's statement is true that the public are largely to blame, will he state why his Department adopted third degree tactics and court-martialled all the higher officials in the sorting office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no third degree tactics adopted, and there was no courtmartial.  We had to get the facts, and had to inquire pretty closely in order to get the facts, as we always try to get the facts in regard to any complaints that we believe to have any foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> Deputy Davin raised the question with regard to temporary post office assistants.  We have had already two examinations confined to that particular class and we have taken in a good number of those who passed in that class.  The question of having another examination has not, I believe, been given any special consideration, but we have taken probably the best qualified of the temporary post office assistants and we do not know that it would be good policy to hold any further examination.  If the Deputy likes we shall examine that aspect again.  I cannot promise that anything will result, but I am prepared to go into it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of &ldquo;tapping&rdquo; of telephones.  I do not think there is any such thing taking place as tapping of telephones. People believe there is when they hear peculiar noises when they are using the telephone, but that does not necessarily mean tapping.  The question of sub-post office appointments was raised by Deputies Davin and Corry. I think there is very little foundation for any grievance with regard to those appointments, and I think the Deputies that raised it were not very serious in their charges.  I think Deputies know that in making these appointments the policy is to get persons that will run the offices in the most satisfactory way and give the best service.  There are various qualifications to be taken into account such as personality, integrity, intelligence, financial standing and the possession of suitable premises.  The policy of the Department has always been to select the person most likely to give satisfactory service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make charges against the Parliamentary Secretary as far as he is personally concerned, but I would like him to look into the filling of the appointments from the point of view of giving the preference to persons who have personal experience of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact we do give a preference to those persons who have had service.  The most <Col N="244" /> important and lucrative appointments are generally filled by Service candidates&mdash;I say generally, not always.  Service candidates cannot always get suitable premises or their financial standing may be very low, but our general tendency in regard to the more important appointments is to appoint Service candidates, provided we can get good ones.  Recently, I think two or three times we appointed Service candidates.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I am supposed to deal seriously with certain remarks made by Deputy Corry when he said that a candidate must have a recommendation from a Secretary to the Farmers' Union.  In Deputy Corry's county, we realise that the Secretaries of the Farmers' Union are men of intelligence and are men selected for those positions because they were men of integrity.  In connection with the recommendation of men not engaged in the Post Office service in the past, the recommendation from such persons as those would be very carefully considered. I could not say that a similar recommendation from Deputy Corry would be considered.</P>

The question of the status of the staff of the Waterford Post Office was raised by Deputy Little. That question received consideration <Col N="245" /> for a long period, and was decided, but it was reopened on pressure being brought by Deputies from all sides of the House.  It has recently been again examined very fully, and we are quite satisfied departmentally that there is no justification for raising the status of the staff.  We are satisfied on examination of the main aspects of the question&mdash;the amount of work transacted in that office and the cost of living in Waterford compared with other towns which was the basis on which the original status was fixed&mdash;that there is no justification for changing that status.  The Department of Finance concur with us in that decision, and Deputy Little may take it that the decision in that regard is now final.</P>

      <P>No.  A question was also raised as to the provision of stamps in post offices after closing hours.  In so far as Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, and other centres are concerned, we have provided slot machines outside the post offices.  Possibly Deputies have seen them.  It may be thought that they should be placed outside post offices in smaller centres, but in reply to that I would say that it is quite a common practice for small shopkeepers to get licences to sell stamps.  It is not difficult to get such licences.  Many shopkeepers are anxious to get them, and they get them when there is need for them.</P>

      <P>I could not say at the moment, but I will find out for the Deputy.  Deputy Anthony raised the question of redundant officers.  I think he was dealing with a certain class of officers who became redundant in their own class after the reorganisation which followed when the present Government took over affairs.  There are no steps which we could take which would greatly improve the position of these officers, apart from the existing opportunities which they have.  They are being gradually absorbed into the ordinary staff.  So far as their rates of pay are concerned, these officers are taken over and continued on the rates of pay which they enjoyed before reorganisation. We cannot, of course, put two officers to do what one is capable of doing.  These men will be gradually absorbed.  I want to see them absorbed as quickly as possible, because I think it would be a good thing for them.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary give any information concerning the transfer of deposits in the British Post Office to the Post Office Savings Bank here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about the transfer is that in so far as the withdrawal of money from the British Post Office is concerned, our Department acts as agent and will withdraw deposits, but we do not act as agent for the lodging of deposits so that clients have, therefore, to send their deposits by some other means.  The general tendency is to withdraw deposits from the British Post Office and either lodge them in our savings bank or make some other use of them. We have issued leaflets calling the attention of the public to the benefits which we give, and many people have <Col N="247" /> taken advantage of them.  There is, as I say, a gradual withdrawal from the British Post Office, and in due course those deposits will almost disappear. There is a good deal of diversion of savings from the savings bank to savings certificates, so that withdrawal of deposits from the British Post Office does not mean lodgments in our Post Office.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the rate of withdrawal is about £50,000 a month, or £600,000 a year. I take the Deputy's figure of the total Irish deposits in the British Post Office as being correct.  Deputy Little wanted to know how the money held in the Savings Bank is invested.  The Department of Finance has issued a leaflet giving the investments in detail.  I think it is placed on the Table.  It is a considerable list and I need not read it, but I will submit it to the Deputy if he desires to see it.</P>

The case is still sub judice, and we cannot at this stage offer any opinion upon it.  We do not want to be taken as accepting responsibility, but we have made provision to deal with the situation in case we are required to accept responsibility.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £63,784 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1932, for the salaries and other expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The full amount of the Estimate for the Broadcasting Service for the financial year 1931-32 is £78,784, which shows an increase of £3,398 over the Estimate for 1930-31. Last year's Estimate of £75,386 included £48,000 for the high-power station, none of which has been expended, so that the effective Estimate for the Dublin and Cork Stations last year may be taken as £27,381.  Expenditure for the past year is estimated at £23,700, showing a saving on the Vote of £51,686, of which £48,000 is due to the provision for the high-power station not being expended, and £3,686 to savings in expenditure on the Dublin and Cork Stations.  Taking into account expenditure on the Broadcasting Service borne on the Votes for the Post Office, Public Works and Buildings, and the Stationery Office, also provision for depreciation and interest on a commercial account basis, the total expenditure on the Broadcasting Service during the past year is estimated at about £33,000.</P>
      <P>The receipts from wireless licence fees during the year are estimated at £13,500, from Customs tax £34,000, and from advertisement revenue £500, making gross estimated revenue of £48,000, or taking the cost of collection at 10 per cent., net revenue of £43,000, showing a surplus of about £10,000. Against this, however, it must be remembered that the general taxpayer is being asked to provide for a high-power station a large sum of money which is not likely to be recovered from broadcasting revenue for several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated total expenditure on the broadcasting service during the <Col N="249" /> next financial year is £98,561, made up of £78,784 in the Broadcasting Vote and £19,777 in other Votes.  Of this sum of £98,561, the amount provided in all Votes for the erection of the high power station is £65,000 out of a total estimated cost of £175,000, so that an additional sum of £10,000 will be required for the high power station in the following year.  Apart from the provision for the high-power station, the estimated expenditure on the Dublin and Cork stations for next year shows a reduction of about £1,200 as compared with last year.  Revenue for the year 1931-32 is estimated at £14,000 from licence fees, £1,000 from advertisements, and probably about £30,000 from customs duties, making a total gross revenue of £45,000, or net revenue of £40,000.  This revenue, as compared with the total estimated expenditure of £98,561, will leave an estimated deficit of over £58,000, which will be due entirely to the capital cost of erection of the high power station. Surplus revenue over current expenditure during the past few years and in the future will, however, it is anticipated, be quite sufficient on a commercial account basis to provide for depreciation fund and interest on capital expenditure.  It is, of course, necessary that the broadcasting service should be considered as a business undertaking and should pay its way without assistance from general taxation.</P>
    <P>Last year I dealt fully with the finances of the high power station. Our policy in regard to the necessity for a high power station has been confirmed by the trend of development of broadcasting in Europe, which is definitely towards large increases of the power stations.  The Dublin and Cork stations do not give a service throughout the Saorstát, and the only means of effecting the best possible service, having regard to technical and international conditions, is by the erection of a high power station.  The Dáil, last year, approved our proposals in this respect, and the large provision for the high power station in this year's Estimate is due to the delay in the selection of the site. Unforeseen difficulties arose in connection with the acquisition of the site <Col N="250" /> originally chosen near Athlone, but steps are now being taken with a view to acquiring an alternative site in the same neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>The number of current licences at the end of February was 26,000, as compared with 25,269 a year ago, which shows an increase of 731, and it is believed that a steady increase may be expected during the coming year.  The only important staffing change during the past year was the discontinuance of the programme staff at the Cork station.  This has resulted in a saving of nearly £1,000 a year.  Only one weekly programme was given from the Cork station, and the cost of producing this was too heavy, as it was found that the work could be undertaken by the Dublin programme staff without appreciable extra cost.  The studio at Cork has, however, been maintained, and programmes are frequently given there by local artistes.  Programmes during the past year have, it is thought, shown a distinct improvement all round, having regard to the money and material available.  The musical programmes have now reached a high standard, particularly the opera performances and the symphony concerts. The scope of the talks programme has been widened and efforts are being made towards a further improvement in this respect.  Special attention is being paid to extending the use of Irish throughout the general programmes as far as possible, in addition to the special Irish musical programmes, talks and lessons.</P>
    <P>An innovation in programmes has been the recent introduction of sponsored programmes.  It was considered that the possible revenue derivable from broadcasting advertising should not be entirely disregarded, but, at the same time, it was realised that undiluted advertising talks such as had previously been allowed were not a desirable form of broadcasting advertising. Advertising by means of programmes in which the direct advertising is confined to brief introductory and closing announcements does not, however, appear to be open to objection, and a trial series of sponsored programmes is, therefore, at present being given.  The arrangement is that sponsors pay a booking fee per hour <Col N="251" /> and also provide the programme at their own expense.  The gain to the broadcasting service is, therefore, the amount of the booking fee, plus the value of the programme.  Preference is given to Irish advertisers, and advertisements of articles in competition with Irish manufacture are not accepted.  Also, both the programme and the advertising matter must be approved by the Department.  As only a comparatively small part of the total broadcasting time is allotted to sponsored programmes there is no appreciable encroachment upon the ordinary time of the Station.</P>
    <P>There has been a very considerable improvement in the news during the past 12 months, and the weekly market news includes reports from the Stock Exchange, the Trade Commission in Great Britain, weekly bulletin of the Department of Agriculture, reports of the London Provision Market, Salford Cattle Market, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points concerning this Estimate upon which I would like further information. As one not familiar with the working of the Dublin Station it seems to me that the staff required to conduct it is very large.  I do not know what work there possibly could be in connection with that Station which would require the whole-time services of some 20 officials, not counting the members of the Orchestra.  It may be that there is work for each of the officials, but I would like to be convinced of that.  I feel fairly satisfied that if the situation in the Station were overhauled, a considerable reduction in the staff would be found to be possible. We have a Station Director, an Assistant Director, a Musical Director, an Announcer, a Woman Organiser, a News Correspondent and quite a large number of subordinate officials.  The result of the work of all these people is indicated by the programme, and it does not seem that there could be enough work to require the whole time services of all these Directors, sub-Directors and officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also, to have some explanation of the personal allowance which is paid in the case of the Station <Col N="252" /> Director, the Assistant Station Director, and the Announcer, of £50 in each case which is described in the footnote as being personal to the present holders of the office.  How did that personal allowance arise?  Is it that the head of the Department was not satisfied that these officials were being paid sufficiently and that this personal allowance is given as a sort of bonus? Were these individuals in receipt of that allowance from some other Government source before they were appointed to that Department?</P>
    <P>I would like some information as to how that allowance is distinct altogether from the salary fixed originally. The Parliamentary Secretary has informed us that the provision made in the Estimate for last year to provide a high power station has not been utilised.  The only explanation he gave us for the delay was similar to the explanation he gave us some time ago with reference to Rathmines telephone exchange.  Apparently there is some difficulty about the site.  It is over two years since the decision of the Executive Council to establish a high power station was announced and the length of time which has elapsed since then would seem to indicate that the work has not been pushed ahead with any energy.  We know the proposal to establish a station at Athlone was utilised by the spokesmen of Cumann na nGaedheal during the by-election in Longford and Westmeath.  Is it the hope of the Parliamentary Secretary that they can keep that bribe hanging up before the constituency of Longford-Westmeath and Leix-Offaly until the general election is concluded, so that we can take it the station will be located in Athlone?</P>

      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary decided to leave Tipperary? I would like also to have some information concerning those sponsored programmes. I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to state that there is a certain revenue which accrues to the service from these programmes. He told us, however, that the estimated revenue from advertisements last year was £500, and on the face of <Col N="253" /> the estimate it is stated that the estimated revenue from advertisements this year is only £100.  I would like to know how the discrepancy arises.  Is it anticipated that there is going to be a considerable falling off in the use of the station for advertising purposes through sponsored programmes?  I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that it was definitely not their policy to allow the station to be used to advertise foreign goods which are in competition with goods produced in the country.  He then went on to say that it was their intention to give a preference to Irish advertisers. What is the exact significance of that term &ldquo;preference.&rdquo;  Is it the policy of the Department to allow foreign advertisers to avail of the services in any circumstances, or are they merely prohibitive when the goods that they are pushing are goods which can be said to be in competition with goods produced at home?  These are the main points that have occurred to me arising out of this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything concerning the programme.  I am not very familiar with it.  I do not have many opportunities of listening to it, but I must say I have received the impression that there has been a considerable lessening of criticism concerning it.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to state that it was their intention to extend the Irish portion of the programme.  That is something for which there has been a very considerable demand, and it would be welcomed in certain quarters.  Again, however, I would like to express the opinion that the policy of the Department in respect to programmes is too timorous.  They avoid very carefully anything which might be considered controversial in any way.  I think that is a mistake.  I realise that if controversial subjects are included in the programme the Parliamentary Secretary is liable to incur criticism in the House, when the Estimate is before it, from one side or the other alleging that undue preference was given to one point of view.  It seems to me, however, that the danger of that criticism arising could be obviated by having the Advisory Committee selected in such a manner as to ensure <Col N="254" /> that all possible shades of opinion would be represented, and by having the question of such discussions or lectures or the like submitted to that Committee.</P>

      <P>While I do not claim to be an expert in regard to the technicalities or intricacies of wireless broadcasting, I know for a fact that if the members of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce or people in Deputy Heffernan's constituency were asked to pay something for nothing there would be a big outcry.  That is the position as far as wireless broadcasting is concerned in Donegal.  Although the people in the major portion of that county who have valve or crystal sets are called upon to pay duty, I understand they are not able to get Dublin. Whether it is the hills of Donegal in this particular case that create the ills of Donegal, I am not in a position to say.  I know there has been a great number of complaints.  These people, while they are able to get the B.B.C. Station on the valve sets, are not able to get the Dublin Broadcasting Station.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his remarks, did not indicate whether he thought that the high-power station which is to be erected in Athlone, and for which the taxpayers in Donegal are asked to subscribe, will be powerful enough to supply everyone in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a statement on the 26th May, 1927, he stated in connection with this high power station: &ldquo;I am not sure about the technicalities of the matter, but my information is that a high power station will not be able to serve all the rural districts, that even when this station in Athlone is established its radius will not exceed something like 60 miles.&rdquo;  In reply to that allegation by Deputy Heffernan the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. J.J. Walsh, stated: &ldquo;In the absence of a high power station the poorer people who are outside the limited circle covered by the Dublin and Cork Stations would be entirely ostracised. This high power station is their only hope.  They cannot afford valve sets, and a high power station is indispensable to them.&rdquo;  Then take the owners <Col N="255" /> of four-valve sets.  To them he said: &ldquo;But the valve user is the exception, and we must necessarily cater for the majority.  In providing a high power station we are catering for the overwhelming majority.  We are doing a real service to the poor man, and in the absence of it wireless would remain something foreign and unknown to him.&rdquo;  Again, on the 8th July, Mr. Walsh, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, stated: &ldquo;When the high power station is functioning it is anticipated that all citizens of the Saorstát, with the possible exceptions of those resident in Northern Tirconaill and South-West Kerry, will be able to hear and enjoy our programmes on inexpensive crystal sets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At a later period he stated that the people in North Tirconaill would get a good deal of benefit by this station. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at that time gave an assurance that one relay station would be established in Bundoran, in Donegal, and that another relay station would be established some place in Kerry.  That was in addition to the high power station, because it was admitted that even if this high power station were erected in Athlone or Birr it would not be powerful enough to cater for North Tirconaill and parts of Kerry.  While I understand they are going ahead with the high power station they seem to have dropped the project for a relay station for Tirconaill and Kerry.</P>
    <P>I suggest if the Minister is not prepared to go ahead with the relay station at Bundoran so as to cater for the people in North Tirconaill, who may not be able to take advantage of the high power station at Athlone, although they pay licence duty and get the B.B.C. programmes that he should allow them to have the wireless sets without having licences.  In other words, that he should not ask the people of Donegal to pay licence fees when they are not able to get reception from the Dublin, the Cork or the proposed Athlone stations.  I hope the Minister will let us know if he has quite dropped the project advocated by a previous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of building relay stations <Col N="256" /> which would cater for people in Tirconaill and in West Kerry.</P>

      <P>(Clare): Representations have been made to me, and the matter has been discussed by one organisation, that some of these sponsored programmes are not exactly what they might be.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary to state that he was not prepared to allow foreign goods to be advertised. I am told the sponsored programmes do a good deal of advertising of foreign culture, and matters of that kind, and that these programmes are not at all desirable for broadcasting from an Irish station.  I must say I do not know anything about them. I never heard them.  I am taking the word of a responsible organisation where the matter was discussed, and which made representations to me, that if foreign goods were cut out there was also a very good reason for cutting out foreign culture.  I will let Deputies put whatever mark they like around the word &ldquo;culture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has considered the anomalous position of a person who wishes to discard wireless altogether, or to discard it, perhaps, for one or two years.  Take the position of a man who was honest enough in 1929, in 1928 and in 1927, to say that he had a wireless set but who in 1930 decided to dismantle it.  As his name is on the register the postal officials call and ask him to pay his licence on a set that he is not using and that he is not going to use.  According to the present legislation he is told that he must either dispose of the set for whatever trifle he can get for it, or take out a licence.  If he has the set locked up in a box he has to pay a licence or else to dispose of it.  That is an anomalous position.  There are people, of course, who might not indicate that they had a wireless set.  Because a man is honest enough to indicate that he possesses a wireless set, that it is dismantled, and the aerial earthed, he must either dispose of it or pay the licence.  It is not the first time that this matter has been brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and I would like to know <Col N="257" /> now if he has given it any consideration with a view to having the anomaly removed.</P>

People in Athlone have been looking forward to having the work started, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that it is started at an early date.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Flinn, I do not know everything.  As to the inquiry made by Deputy Lemass regarding the staffing of the Department, I think it is pretty evident, as the Deputy indicated, that he has not a deep personal knowledge of the duties involved in attending to the programmes and to the engineering side <Col N="258" /> of the Department.  If there is any complaint with regard to the staffing of the Department, it is that the staff is not sufficient.  Everyone on the staff is fully occupied, and could do more work if there was time to do it. To anyone acquainted with the requirements of a broadcasting station, that is quite evident.  If the Deputy makes any attempt to compare the staff in our broadcasting establishment with, say, one of the provincial establishments of the B.B.C., he will find that our staff is very much smaller.  I believe that if we could afford to increase the staff we could increase the quality of the programmes.  One of the claims made by persons outside who are interested in wireless programmes is that our staff is not adequate to prepare or examine programmes which are to be put before the public.  I am not quite in agreement with the statement, but I think that if we could increase our staff we could improve our programmes. It will be obvious to Deputies that, in addition to those who are actually dealing with the programmes, such as the director, the assistant director, the announcer, and the musical director, that the other officials are necessary for the clerical duties which pertains to that section of the Department, and which involves considerable work.  The same applies to the engineering staff, which is fully occupied in the work in which it is engaged.  The Deputy inquired about the allowance made to the station director, and to the assistant director. He will find, on examination of previous Estimates, that the salaries of the station director and the assistant station director are not increasing, that they are fixed salaries, but that a permanent status has not yet been decided upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their permanent status has not yet been decided upon.  It was considered in view of the conditions appertaining to a new undertaking of this kind that we should wait some time before we decide upon a permanent scale of salaries for these officers. Consequently it was thought desirable to give them a personal allowance of £50 a year, which is not in my opinion <Col N="259" /> at all excessive.  Deputy Lemass is incorrect in his memory as to the time when the decision was arrived at to establish a high power station. The decision was arrived at about a year ago, not two years ago. There had been certain delays as to the site and as to the location.  As soon as we had decided on a location unforeseen difficulties arose as to an ideal site.  An ideal site, which we understood we could get, turned out not to be available.  The person to whom it belonged was unwilling to sell for sentimental reasons.  We have no compulsory powers regarding the acquisition of the site for a high power station.  We cannot acquire land by compulsion.  We are negotiating at the present time for a site, and I can assure the Deputy that we expect to have a site available within the next few weeks.  I am not sure whether the negotiations are quite complete, but I do know that they have been going on for some time.</P>

      <P>In the Estimates last year a sum of £48,300 was passed for the high power station.  It was not built, but in the meantime the figure for the cost has increased by £4,250. Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an estimated cost for the work expected to be done within the year.  The amount included in this year's Estimate is the estimated expenditure to be made on this work within this year.  It is probable that there will be more work done this year than was estimated for in the last financial year.  That is the explanation.  The total cost of the high power station is larger than the figure set out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We may take it, therefore, that the £52,550 is not the total cost of this station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the total cost of this station is about £70,000.  We cannot give the exact figure, but we estimate it at £70,000 to £75,000.  The figure on the Estimate is the amount proposed to be expended this year. Concerning the revenue in connection with this service from the daily programme under the head of advertisements <Col N="260" /> we put down an item of only £100.  That amount was arrived at when we had not settled any definite policy as to the type of the programme to be carried out.  At a later stage it was decided that we are to continue the sponsored programme. That is experimental.  It is estimated that the revenue will be £1,000.  The Estimate last year was only £50, and the revenue about £500.</P>
      <P>As to the type of programme coming under the head of advertisements, the policy is, as stated in my speech, not to allow advertisements in the case of goods manufactured competitively with Saorstát manufacturers. We do not allow advertising by outside firms in regard to goods manufactured in the Saorstát.  In the case of goods not manufactured in the Saorstát we allow advertisements from outside firms, subject to the suitability of the matter in the programme.  That is our policy, and I think it is a policy to which there cannot be any exception taken.  Deputy Lemass raised a matter as to the broadcasting of controversial matters.  That is a question that has received a great deal of consideration. I have given a great deal of consideration to it but I cannot say that we have any definite policy on the matter at the moment.  I do think that such debates would be, perhaps, of more interest than some of the matters at present on the programme, but it would be very difficult to arrange debates and to arrange them in the manner that would give satisfaction to all sections of the community.  But we are open to consider the matter further. Possibly the Deputy may be able to give us some advice in that connection. Looking at it from the political point of view, it is difficult to get controversial matter in this country which is not political, and there would have to be general agreement among all parties before debates could be satisfactorily arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the inquiries made by Deputy Cassidy as to the broadcasting service in Donegal and the remark about a high-power station that he read from the Official Report, I want to say that that is very much out of date.  Since that statement was made in the Dáil considerable technical <Col N="261" /> developments have been made, and it is now anticipated that the high-power station will give a crystal set radius of at least 80 miles from the centre.  It may be greater.  It may be 90 miles or more.  The crystal range is not an even distance from the station, but I would say it would be round about 80 miles.  I do not know how that will affect Donegal, but I should think that a very large portion of Donegal will be covered and within the ambit of the crystal set.  If the radius extends beyond 80 miles it will take in most of Donegal.  In any case that is the best we can do.  It is clear that some people in Donegal will only be able to get a reception from the high-power station with valve sets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the range of the station at Athlone would be 80 to 100 miles, it was recognised by a previous Minister as that would not reach a certain part of Donegal, a relay station would be established at Bundoran.  Is that to be done?  Donegal seems to be unfortunate. Even the Shannon scheme does not reach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so. Donegal is unfortunate in its geographical situation, but I cannot help that.  There have been technical advances since the statement was made. It is not the policy of the Department to establish relay stations in any part of Donegal.</P>

      <P>I am not going to raise any technical points as to whether I should bury my hypothetical set or not. The Parliamentary Secretary did not refer to the matter I raised as to whether any representations have been made to him from any Irish organisation as to the type of programme to be broadcast in his sponsored programmes, and whether a particular foreign culture was being advertised through these sponsored programmes. There have been public statements made that representations have been made to him from certain quarters He ought to let us know whether these have received consideration from him or from some responsible official of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think certain representations have been made to me. I have a hazy memory of seeing some such.  I did not accept such representations as being solidly founded. As I explained to the Deputy in my opening statement, the sponsored programme arrangements are experimental and on a temporary basis.  It is possible that we may not finally agree that the matter broadcast is altogether desirable.  We have not come to a decision on it.  In a general way the matter broadcast so far could not be considered undesirable. I understand that representations of the kind the Deputy refers to were made by people who were interested in a certain type of Gaelic culture. I have indicated that we are looking into that side of the programme. Perhaps it will be developed to a greater extent in the coming year. That will not necessarily interfere with the matter in the sponsored programmes. I do not want to say definitely <Col N="263" /> at this stage whether we regard the sponsored programme as quite satisfactory or not.  It is being weighed at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that he has nobody in his Department who is capable of saying whether the programme is Irish or not or whether it is in line with Irish culture or not?  Do I understand that that is the position: that he does not know whether a programme is in line with Irish ideas?  Do I understand that while they are experimenting all sorts of foreign culture are to be broadcast throughout the country?  Is that the position?  What does he mean when he tells us of people interested in a certain type of Gaelic culture?  I would like him to develop that point and to let us know how many kinds of Gaelic culture there are and what type he stands for, because I only know of one type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this is the place or time for a debate on Gaelic culture.  There is no use pursuing a point of that nature here. The Deputy knows very well that we can come to no conclusion on a matter of that kind.  He knows that on questions of programme there will be thousands of different opinions.  On the question of the quality of any particular programme you will get dozens of different opinions in this country or in any other country, and people who are responsible for the broadcasting undertaking have to take a decision, not necessarily in accordance with majority opinion, but taking into account the general policy of the undertaking and of the Government which is controlling the undertaking. That is all I have to say.  I am not going to argue with the Deputy on the question of Gaelic culture or Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

I am not prepared to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's statement as to where I should <Col N="264" /> raise this matter, or that I should not raise this matter here.  This is the place where the thing is being controlled, and the Deputy who is responsible for the control says it is not the place to answer.  Where, then, is it to be raised?  This station is being paid for and used by the Irish people.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to answer where the question of Gaelic culture is going to be raised, what am I to do?

The Mercantile Marine Services are essential <Col N="265" /> for the administration and control of our own merchant shipping and for the supervising of all merchant shipping visiting and using our ports.  The Coast Life-saving Service works in co-operation with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution is, of course, a voluntary institution.  There are 53 stations.  It is all land work.  They are in telephone communication, and the National Lifeboat Institution use the boats, if necessary, for life-saving purposes.  All the statutory obligations for running the Marine Service have been carried out during the year.  We have the active co-operation of the National Lifeboat Institution in any shipwreeks which occur around the coast.  On the whole, they rendered very useful and efficient service during the year.</P>

      <P>I have been asked to inquire, in relation to sub-head D, whether any inquiries have been made by the Department into the wreck of the steamship &ldquo;Julia&rdquo; at Arklow about two months ago, and, if so, with what result.  I understand that the local people say that the wreck was entirely due to the bad lighting arrangements on the coast.  A lightship which formerly was stationed in that vicinity was taken away by the British Government and was substituted by a buoy, which buoy, however, I am told, does not light in stormy weather.  It is alleged that one wreck has occurred in consequence of this change in the lighting arrangements. Others may occur.  I presume an inquiry has been held.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us the result of that inquiry, and whether any action is going to be taken in consequence of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been engaging our attention since the shipwreck took place off the Arklow coast. We do not, of course, control the Irish lights but we have made representations to the Board of Trade, the responsible body.  They are satisfied that the buoy that is there is really sufficient and that, even if there had been greater lighting facilities, the ship might have been wrecked anyway, owing to the general storm that raged <Col N="266" /> round the coast at that particular time.  Even the provision of better lighting facilities there would not have prevented this unfortunate shipwreck. The matter is still under consideration, and if any representations other than those which have already been put forward can be submitted, we will be prepared to take the case up again.  It was really a shipwreck caused by the storm, and it was an accident which might have happened even with better lighting facilities.</P>

      <P>May we take it that further representations will be made to the British authorities for the restoration of the lightship that was removed, or is the Saorstát Government satisfied that their point of view is justified?  It is a very important question.  The wreck of that steamer has, of course, excited great feeling all along the east coast, and local opinion is unanimously in favour of the restoration of that lightship. There are people there with very wide experience of the sea, and very wide experience of all the technicalities connected with seafaring and coast lighting. They are all very definitely of the opinion that the Arklow coast will not be safe for steamers until that lightship is restored.  It is important to know whether the Saorstát Government will continue to make representations or whether they have accepted the decision of the British authorities as final, and will not pursue the subject further.</P>

      <P>I would like to stress the points that have been made by Deputy Moore.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is treating this matter sufficiently seriously.  The Arklow bank has been looked upon by sailors for years as a very dangerous place.  I have heard Wexford sailors referring to the condition of things that prevails there at the moment.  I remember two Wexford schooners being wrecked on the Arklow bank when there was no storm at all.  I think it is absolutely necessary that the Ministry should make strong representations in this connection.  Prior to the War there was a lighted buoy at the entrance to Wexford harbour, and it was maintained by the Trinity House Corporation&mdash;the Irish Lights people. That has been removed, and various representations have been made by the Wexford Harbour Commissioners in order to have it restored.  The matter has been in the hands of the Ministry for some time, and I would like to know if anything has yet been done in connection with this matter.  It is a very serious matter for Wexford, which is a tidal harbour, and it is militating very much against shipping in that harbour.  If no reply has come from the Trinity House people I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to push the matter forward and make an earnest effort to have the buoy restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has expressed the hope that there will be no point raised in the Vote, but I am sorry to say he will be disappointed.  When the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs was under consideration here some time ago I had cause to complain that the accounts of that Department had not been published for two years.  I now have to complain that the accounts of this Department have not been published for three years.  I would like to have some explanation as to the cause of the delay. The last year for which the accounts of the Unemployment Fund were published was the year which ended on the 31st of March, 1928.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us why the accounts for 1929 and 1930 are not available.  It seems to me that the only possible <Col N="269" /> excuse is laziness.  Surely the accounts were prepared and submitted for audit, and the audit was completed within the period of three years?  It is practically impossible for Deputies in opposition to give intelligent consideration to an Estimate of this kind when the facts that should be at their disposal are withheld from them.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Estimate, I note that the estimated reduction in the State contribution to the Unemployment Fund is somewhat higher than that anticipated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Unemployment Insurance Bill of last year was before the House.  I take that to mean that the Department anticipate a decrease in the number of people in insurable employment during the coming year.  We note from the figures made available that there has been a steady increase in the number of persons registered as unemployed for the past year or two, but hitherto that change in the number of people unemployed did not seem to affect the number of people in insurable employment. It would seem from the figures here, however, that some decrease in the number of people in insurable employment is anticipated in the coming year. I would like to know what is the reason for that anticipation.</P>
    <P>I note also that the point which was argued between myself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1930, seems to be decided in my favour by this Estimate.  The Minister on that occasion argued that the reduction under sub-head G would be the total saving secured by the taxpayer.  It seems, however, that the amount to be paid by the State towards the cost of the administration of the fund, and which the State will not recover from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, will also be reduced by £14,500.  Therefore, the net saving to the taxpayer as a result of the legislative changes made last year will be this £14,500, plus the £56,000 indicated in the Estimate. That, however, is a minor point.</P>
    <P>What I am particularly concerned with now is a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary when this Estimate was under consideration last <Col N="270" /> year.  The statement was that proposals for legislation were under consideration with the idea of reducing the cost of administration.  We have, he said, had a Committee carefully examining the existing Acts relating to Unemployment Insurance, and we intend to introduce legislation which will, I think, secure a reduction in the cost of administration.  There proposals for legislation have not come before the House.  The cost of administration has not been reduced except by a trivial sum.  When the Estimate was under consideration last year I pointed to the very high relation which existed between the cost of administration and the total amount available for benefit.  The changes effected by the Insurance Bill, which we discussed in December last, have increased that proportion, but the cost of administration remains practically the same.  The amount available for benefit and the total revenue of the Fund have both been substantially decreased. The result now is that the costs of administration are more than 25 per cent. of the amount available for benefit, and more than 20 per cent. of the total revenue of the Fund from all sources.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary apparently agreed with me last year that the costs of administration were excessive, and were capable of reduction. He promised that the matter would be attended to, and that legislative proposals to effect these reductions in expenditure would be brought before the Dáil.  Now I know that the Department of which the Parliamentary Secretary is a shining light, has earned, or is striving to earn, the reputation hitherto borne by the Department of Local Government, of being the laziest Department in the State. There is quite a long list of legislative proposals which that Department has promised and has not introduced.  One would have expected that where a Bill of this kind is concerned the Minister for Finance would have applied the necessary spur to make the Department move with a little more rapidity than it has moved in the matter of the Food Prices Tribunal, the transport question, the Mines and Minerals Bill, and other matters of that kind.  The <Col N="271" /> position is that the Fund is being asked to bear a very large annual charge, and in consequence of that the rate of repayment to the Exchequer is being reduced while the possibility of increasing benefit of effecting a further reduction in contributions is being delayed.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us why his anticipated Bill has not appeared, and if there is any chance of it appearing any time during this year.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not, of course, be concerned with it afterwards.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the treatment meted out by this Department to carters employed by the various county councils.  When a carter enters the employment of a county council to do road work his contributions for insurance purposes are stopped by the county council in the ordinary way, but in practically every case, if not in every case, it is decided by the Ministry and by the umpire&mdash;in some cases, the Court of Referees allows the claim&mdash;that these people are not entitled to benefit.  It is hard to follow the reasoning of the Department in these cases.  Because a poor man is thrifty enough to be in a position to buy a horse and car to enable him to do certain work on the roads, the Minister's Department looks upon him as a sort of contractor, and disqualifies him from getting benefit. Cases of this kind have been repeatedly brought to the notice of the Department by Deputies in all Parties, but with, I am sorry to say, very little result.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that in future his Department should give a different interpretation to the law from that which has been given in these cases up to the present. These people are workers in the same sense as the men who work on the roads with pick and shovel.  In a great many instances they are worse off than the latter.  The fact that they have a horse and car should not be taken as any criterion that they are any better off than their fellow-workers who use the pick and shovel.  I believe that the Ministry are not treating them fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> There is another class of case, in which, in my opinion, very harsh treatment is meted out by the Department. I am referring now to road workers who happen to have a couple of acres of land.  I know of one case in my constituency where a man was expected to support a family of twelve children out of the four acres of land that he held.  He got work on the roads under the county council.  When he became unemployed his case went before the Court of Referees, which allowed his claim, but the umpire in Dublin held that the man was not normally unemployed. If to deprive a man in that position of benefit to which I hold he is entitled is the only means the Minstry can find of saving money for the State, then the course pursued in these cases does not speak very well for the State.  In the case of men who hold a few acres of land, no effort, good, bad, or indifferent, is made by the representatives of the Department to ascertain whether the land is arable or not.  I think that a more careful examination should be made before a man's application is turned down simply because he is stated to hold a few acres.  I hope that during the coming year the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department, in dealing with the two types of cases which I have brought to the notice of the House, will give them more sympathetic consideration than has been the practice hitherto.  I believe that these people are genuinely entitled to unemployment benefit, and that the strictures of the Ministry are altogether too harsh so far as these cases are concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass was very much concerned to show that his figures were right in the argument that he had with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Insurance Bill that was before the House last year. I think that if the Deputy studies the Estimates and again examines the statement made by the Minister he will find that the Minister was quite correct in his summary of the position as it would be after the passing of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy thinks, because there is a reduction of £68,000 that we are anticipating a decrease in employment.  He forgets that there will also be a decrease of £224,000 in the joint contribution from employers and workers.  Consequently the State's proportion of that £224,000 has not to be paid.  We do not anticipate a decrease in the number of persons employed in the coming year, and are not estimating for a decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The State contribution, of course, is decreased because the contribution from employers and employees is decreased.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce anticipated that the decrease would be only about £46,000, while in fact the contribution was decreased by £56,000.  The fewer people there are in insurable employment the less the State pays, so I take it that the fact that the decrease is higher than anticipated would seem to indicate that he expects the revenue from that source to be less than originally anticipated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the employers and employees had to contribute that £224,000, the State would have to contribute its portion, and the State contribution would be roughly three-sevenths. Therefore the Estimate to-day is for, roughly, the same number of people employed.  The Deputy is much concerned about a statement which I made on the Estimate last year, that I had under consideration the question of legislation, and that we were examining the position in regard to administration to see if the cost could be reduced.  We have had that whole position under examination, and the House passed the legislation which we introduced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish raised a point in connection with that hardy annual, the land workers.  I want to assure him again that because a man has land he is not automatically deprived of benefit.  I want to assure him that there is no definite policy in the Department, or on the part of any officials administering the Act, automatically to deprive a worker of unemployment benefit.  They are anxious to help him in every way to get benefit if he is entitled to it, but they have a definite statutory obligation to protect the interests of the people who are entitled to benefit.  For that reason, all who are concerned with the administration of the Act must make certain that a person who is not entitled to benefit under the Act will not receive it.  The number of applicants for benefit who have been refused is very small.  Of the general applications, I repeat the figures I gave last year, that 98 per cent. of the applicants automatically receive their benefit after the one week's delay, and, on the question of the small land owners, I will say that 75 per cent. of them have been <Col N="275" /> allowed after very careful investigation. There is no general rule disqualifying a worker because he has land, but no worker can receive unemployment benefit if he is employed on any other work.  He must prove to the satisfaction of the court that investigates his claim that he is unemployed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little change in the Vote.  The principal feature of difference is that the private secretary to the President at the time the Estimate had been made up had not been transferred from the Department of Defence, in which Vote his salary appears.  There is a reduction also in the travelling expenses.  The Department of the President <Col N="276" /> bears the expense of delegates to a number of conferences which are not of a Departmental nature, and it is not anticipated that conferences of that sort will absorb the same amount this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the matter which Deputy Davin raised to-day would be a suitable one for taking up on this Estimate.  It concerns the policy of the Executive Council as a whole, and from the replies made by the President, and also from the fact that raising it on the adjournment would not give an opportunity to Deputies, other than the Deputy who raised the question, to discuss it, I think it is right that we should take advantage of this Estimate to deal with it&mdash;that is, the question of discrimination in the employment given on public works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy de Valera proceeds to deal with the matter of which I gave notice to raise on the adjournment, I might say that I fully realise that it involves the policy of the Government.  Since question time I have discussed the matter with the object of getting a more suitable opportunity, if you like, of discussing the whole matter involved, and it has been arranged that this is an issue which might be raised on the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has undertaken to answer for the Government policy on that matter. In view of that, perhaps Deputy de Valera will leave the question over until that Vote comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Vote is postponed I would be very glad to do that. Perhaps Deputy Davin would be prepared to make his case now, as not merely the Department of Industry and Commerce but a number of Departments are involved.  That is a matter of the policy of the Executive as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intended bringing this matter up on this Vote independently of the question raised to-day, and I would prefer Deputy Davin to use this particular occasion to deal with <Col N="277" /> it.  But if he has made an arrangement with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to answer, then I think the best way of dealing with it would be to postpone the consideration of this Vote, if the Minister is prepared to do that, until that particular matter is dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view expressed by Deputy de Valera that this is a matter to be dealt with on the Vote for the President of the Executive Council, because three or four Ministers are involved, and the President as head of the Executive is responsible for the whole of them. I did not know Deputy de Valera was going to raise it, but I would prefer if he could see his way to agree to the arrangement arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason why this particular Vote should be postponed.  As a matter of fact there is collective responsibility, and if a Minister is willing to answer for the Government policy, then Government policy can be raised on any Minister's Vote.  It cannot be taken that Government policy can only be raised on the Vote for the Department of the President of the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is a most appropriate place to raise it as it is a Vote on which the administration of the Executive Council, as a whole, is subject to criticism. Is there any good reason why, in view of the circumstances that have arisen, the Minister should insist upon taking this Vote now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think that this is the appropriate occasion on which to raise this matter, but I do not think that it is the only appropriate occasion.  It could be raised on any Vote provided that, as in the case here, the Minister says he is willing to answer.  The only circumstance in which it must be raised on this Vote is if no Minister is willing to answer; certainly, in that case, as a matter of general policy, the Vote for the Department of the President would be the proper place to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Davin only intends <Col N="278" /> to raise the subject matter of his own question which has relation to preference on works carried out under the Relief Scheme Vote.  I think it is Deputy de Valera's intention to raise the whole issue, not only as applied to relief schemes, but to all public works in the State.  For this reason I think that the President's Vote would be more appropriate than that for the Minister for Industry and Commerce on which to raise these matters.  There is another reason.  There may be other matters to be raised, and on that particular Vote, therefore, we would not have a straight debate upon it.  The issue would be confused by other matters which would necessarily have to be raised upon the Vote as the only appropriate occasion in which they could be raised.  Therefore, it seems that Deputy de Valera's suggestion is a wise one that we should postpone the President's Vote and raise the general question upon that Vote rather than the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce so that the discussion on the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be confined to matters that relate to his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>An arrangement has been come to, and I see no reason to depart from it.  No opportunity will be lost.  If this Vote is postponed, presumably the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be taken before it.  In that case the arrangement Deputy Davin made would be carried out, and this matter would be discussed on that Vote, and, I presume, could not be discussed again.  In view of the fact that an arrangement has been made and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has agreed to answer on his own Vote, I see no reason for this Vote being postponed.</P>

Of course one gets a far better opportunity on a Vote to make his case than on the motion for the adjournment.  I was not aware that Deputy de Valera was going to raise this matter, and as a result of the arrangement I handed in an amendment to Vote 56 to refer it back for reconsideration and to take advantage of that motion to raise this particular issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to state the case here at this particular moment if necessary.  But I think that Deputy Aiken as a Whip should realise that when an arrangement is arrived at it should be carried out.  I have handed in a motion to refer back Vote 56, and I think the House will agree that that will be the most appropriate occasion to deal with this whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that that debate quite possibly might be unsatisfactory and narrowed from the general point of view.  If this particular Vote were postponed we could either say we are satisfied that the discussion has been satisfactory, or we could resume it in any particular form we wanted upon this Vote when it came up again.  As far as I can see, the solution of it depends largely upon the Minister.  If he is prepared to postpone the Vote there is no difficulty. If he is not prepared to postpone the Vote the question arises whether we should forego our rights and accept the arrangement made by Deputy Davin or not.</P>

There is no possibility of narrowing us down on the Vote for the Department of the Executive Council, but I am sorry that this arrangement has been made. While I recognise, however, that, having made it, there is a certain obligation to carry it out unless there is agreement made otherwise, I am sorry that the question is being taken on the Vote for that Department.  I would like to see this particular Vote held in reserve, so that if there is any question which, under the rules of debate, could not be covered on the Vote of the Minister for Industry and Commerce we would be free to take it up here.

      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister is definitely refusing to postpone the Vote?  I think it would save time if he did postpone it.  I would prefer that Deputy Davin, having raised this matter, would discuss it, but if he is not going to do it I must deal with it as I know it.  The matter was brought to our immediate attention recently by a communication which I received from the Manager of the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council. I got a copy of the resolution, which I dare say was sent to other Parties in the Dáil as well as to us.  At the same time it was sent to a number of public bodies throughout the country. This resolution, which was passed by the Borough Council on the 2nd March, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That we, the members of the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council, believing that the preference shown to certain sections in the matter of employment on works of public utility is grossly unjust and calculated to foster and maintain differences between Irishmen, express our deep <Col N="283" /> dissatisfaction at the preferential clause inserted in specifications inviting tenders for contracts; that we recognise the rights to an equal share in such work of all able-bodied men, irrespective of class, creed or politics, and call for the immediate abolition of this clause, and that copies of the resolution be sent to the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council, and the public bodies throughout the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact that we get the Borough Council passing a resolution like this shows, at any rate, that in raising this matter we are not raising something for the purpose of pilloring Ministers or for the sake of securing any particular political advantage to ourselves. This matter, of course, was raised long before it came up in this particular form.  It was raised by members of the House, by Deputy Davin and others, on a former occasion, and by members of our own Party.  I tried to get some information about the position and to get the history of this preferential clause in so far as I could.  I found it extremely difficult to get anything really satisfactory or authoritative upon it.  The first reference I have been able to find about it was in the first report of the Local Government Department, 1922-25.  Apparently, from that document, it was issued in a circular letter to the public bodies about the end of 1923, seven or eight years ago.  However, even that much is not quite clear.  What the report says is: &ldquo;It was further considered that in view of the services rendered by the Army to the people of the country preference in employment should be given to demobolised men suitable and willing to undertake road work.&rdquo;  The next reference I have been able to find about it is in a reply to a question asked by Deputy Johnson.  The reply was given by Deputy Bourke, and the reference is Vol. 14, col. 215, 28th January, 1928.  The reply states: &ldquo;The conditions regarding employment attaching to grants to local authorities for road work are that (a) the maximum rate of wages of an amount specified in each case is applicable to the work (b) preference is to <Col N="284" /> be given to demobilised men of the National Army suitable and willing to undertake road work, and (c) the men required for the work are engaged through the local officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question asked by Deputy Davin as to whether the preference would avail a single ex-soldier against a married man with a family, the Minister said: &ldquo;That is another question,&rdquo; and did not answer further.  The matter apparently was left at that.  I cannot find it in the statutory rules, nor can I find it amongst the papers that were ordered to be laid before the House, so that I think the question that was asked by Deputy Aiken to-day as to whether there is any legal authority for this at all is a very pertinent question.  It affects all the Departments.  It affects the Department of Public Works.  It affects the Local Government Department, and as was pointed out by Deputy Davin, it affects the Department of Industry and Commerce inasmuch as the regulations are very often carried out through the manager of the local Labour Exchange.  It has undoubtedly given rise to a great deal of criticism, and has caused a considerable amount of hardship.  Some excuse could have been made for a rule like this, perhaps, when it was introduced back in 1923, when the Ministry might possibly have a number of men demobilised from the Army for whom they would have a certain amount of responsibility to find work.  It is a considerable period now since 1923 and the operations of this preferential clause has worked out to the unfair disadvantage of many people&mdash;putting single unmarried men without dependents in the position of getting the means of earning their daily bread when married men or men with dependents, who should have a prior claim on the State, are prevented from earning their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I have quoted a resolution from Dun Laoghaire.  I will give another typical example.  I received a communication recently from Carrick-on-Suir.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir for a number of years have been agitating for a sewerage scheme.  Finally they came to <Col N="285" /> an arrangement whereby the local people were to put up £9,000 for this scheme, and were to get a grant of £2,000.  Whilst this scheme was being agitated, and particularly when such a large proportion of the total sum required was being secured locally, the people who were unemployed in that neighbourhood looked forward to the starting of these works in the hope that it would give much-needed employment to a number of people who were unemployed.  I think they expected that employment would be provided for 150 to 200 men.  The work started a couple of weeks ago, and to the astonishment of the local people, the people who were employed on this scheme were not married men or men with dependents, but were, it is stated to me, almost exclusively ex-members of the National Army.  All the people down there feel that the action of the Government, in having adopted and in pressing this preferential clause, deprives heads of families and the families themselves of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>We want to know what good reason the Government can give at this stage for having such a preferential clause. I do not think there should be any interference with the discretion of the local authority.  They know the situation they have to deal with, they know the people that are best entitled to get employment and who deserve it most, but if there is to be any interference with the discretion of local authorities in schemes of this kind, in regard to the employment they are to give on them, then the only interference should be to suggest, or, if necessary, to make a regulation, that preference should be given to people who have dependents, either married people or other people with dependents.  That is our position in the matter.  The attitude of the President to-day in dealing with this was so unsatisfactory that it determined me, at any rate, that when this Vote came along we would definitely raise it to see what account he is able to give of Government policy in this matter.  As I have said, everybody knows about it.  It has been a general complaint by Deputies on the Labour Benches and on our benches.  These Deputies were in touch with local works and have personal knowledge of <Col N="286" /> it.  Deputies in my party have spoken to me of the hardships that have resulted from this administrative policy. We want to know why the Government has adopted, and is continuing, this policy.  We want to know what legal authority they have for it, and we are not prepared to pass this Vote as long as the President says that he intends pursuing that policy and standing by it.  The instances I have given are sufficient to make it clear, I think, to every Deputy what is involved, and I think everyone of us who has any regard for the rights of the community who are out of work will be justified in refusing to pass this Estimate unless the President gives us a guarantee that the policy will be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite frank with the House and Deputy de Valera when I stated that as a result of the question which I raised in the House to-day, and following that and a conversation which I had with the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I had agreed, for the purpose of my own convenience and for the purpose of getting the best opportunity to ventilate the grievance which I tried to expose in the question, that this matter had better be raised on the Vote of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  One of the reasons which influenced me to have it raised on the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than on the Vote for the President was the fact that I had read the Order Paper and discovered that Deputy Mullins&mdash;I am sorry he is not here now&mdash;had given notice that he would move to refer back for reconsideration the Vote required for the Department of the Executive Council. I did not know, and even do not know now, for what reason Deputy Mullins put down that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, knowing that there was no amendment down to the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and also knowing that the Department of Industry and Commerce had responsibility for the employment exchanges of the country that are responsible for the operation of this objectionable regulation, I concluded that that was the best arrangement I could make to have this matter ventilated. <Col N="287" /> Deputy de Valera anticipated me, and I suppose it was a case of intelligent anticipation, following the cross-fire that arose to day on the unsatisfactory answer I thought I had received from the President in this matter.  However, Deputy de Valera has now forced me out of the difficulty in which I found myself, and I certainly think that the time has long since gone when this out-of-date regulation should be wiped out. For that reason, unless the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are prepared to give an assurance to the House, I will vote against the Vote for Department of the President of the Executive Council. Coming back to the matter I think the real point in the question on the Order Paper has not been answered or was evaded by the President.  The question was:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance to state the reasons why preference is now being given to citizens who had served in the National Army for work provided out of the Relief Schemes Vote; whether he is aware that many married men with dependents have been unable to secure work as a result of this preferential treatment, and whether he is prepared to withdraw or modify this instruction.</P>
    <P>The reply was:</P>
    <P>Any preference which may have been given to men who have served in the National Army for employment on relief works was given in accordance with the Government's general policy regarding employment which is remunerated from public funds.</P>
    <P>The President, for some reason I have not yet discovered, evaded the real question, which was whether he is prepared to withdraw or modify this instruction or justify its continuance. The National Army has already cost the citizens of this State the sum of £33,908,132.  I have taken these figures from the Appropriation Accounts and from the Estimates, and I think the Minister will find my figures correct. <Col N="288" /> That is what it has cost the people of this State to set up an army to settle a dispute between two warring sections of politicians.  Out of that, £12,681,942 has been set aside for payment of N.C.O.'s and men, £3,640,524 has been set aside for dependents' allowances, and £2,014,433 for gratuities and pensions. Is there any citizen of this State who can look upon this whole question with an impartial mind but must say that that amount of money is fair payment for the men who gave service for that particular period?  If that is so and the House agrees with that point of view, I see no reason for the preferential treatment which is being given seven or eight years after the civil war to that particular class of citizen.  I do not know whether Deputy de Valera will agree with my point of view in that.  In endeavouring to look at this question from a fair point of view, I put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to state the total number of unemployed registered in Saorstát Eireann for the week ending 28th March, 1931, and the number of those registered for the same period who had served in the National Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply, stated: The total number of persons registered as unemployed in Saorstát Eireann on the 30th March, 1931, being the nearest date to that mentioned in the question, for which particulars are available, was 25,642, of whom 2,066 persons had served in the National Army.</P>
    <P>These figures, which are the only available figures, show clearly that there is no justification at this stage for giving preferential treatment to one-twentieth of the registered unemployed of this State.  In quoting the figures regarding the amount set aside for payment of N.C.O.'s and men, dependents' allowances, gratuities and pensions I have excluded payments for civilians attached to units, payments to clergy, medical practitioners, lodging allowances, clothing, office of the Minister for Defence or the Army <Col N="289" /> Finance Officer.  In other words I have tried to get figures out of the Estimates which would show the amount of money which has been paid out to the individuals who are now getting this preference.  In a supplementary question I asked the President to-day &ldquo;Is the President aware that the existing regulation has the effect of giving preference to single ex-National Army men, many of whom are, in addition, in receipt of Army pensions, to the exclusion of men with large families.&rdquo;  The President in reply stated: &ldquo;I think that is an exaggeration.&rdquo; I will proceed to the best of my ability to prove from one case at any rate that it is not an exaggeration and from general observations of what is now going on in my own constituency it is certainly correct.  A grant of £2,000 has been set aside from the Relief Schemes Vote for the provision of a waterworks scheme in Mountrath in the County of Leix. Nothing whatever appears in the contract which would go to show that the contractor would get preference because of the fact that he was willing to give preference to men who had served in the National Army.  The tender was accepted and the contractor's foreman proceeded to the spot to select from amongst the unemployed in the area the most suitable men to carry on this work.  He selected four men in the first instance.  The local manager of the employment exchange discovered this and prevented him giving employment to these four men. The four men selected were the four most suitable men who had families dependent upon them and some of them were in receipt of home help. The exchange manager acting on instructions from the Government refused to allow the contractor to have these men start on the job and he selected three other men with one ex-National Army man originally selected. Out of the four selected by the manager three were married ex-National Army men and one a single ex-Army man.  In that particular area on the 11th April there were 144 men out of work.  Out of the 144 there were ten married men with service in the National Army.  There were six single men with service in the National Army. <Col N="290" /> There were 36 married men with dependents and 92 single men with or without dependents.</P>
    <P>Under the existing regulations the manager of the Labour Exchange is bound&mdash;and apparently the contractor has to carry out his orders&mdash;to give first preference to married men who have served in the National Army.  That disposes of ten of the thirty jobs likely to be available.  The next class of people to get preference are single men who served in the National Army, one for one with married civilians with dependents. In other words, in that area six single men who served in the National Army will be taken on with six married civilians with dependents. That absorbs twenty-two of the thirty men that will be employed.  Out of the remainder only eight married men, with a large number of dependents, will get employment.  The inclusion of the six single men, because they served in the National Army, in accordance with the regulations, deprives six married men with large families from getting work on the job.  That is the case I make, and the case that the local ratepayers will make against the existing regulation which has been enforced in that area by the Ministry.  I will quote another case of a different type.  A grant was made by the Minister for Local Government for carrying out certain public works in the Limerick City Corporation area.  I will read an extract from a resolution that was passed recently by the Limerick Trades Council arising out of the situation created there by the operation of this regulation:</P>
    <P>There is a stipulation in both contracts, that preference be given to ex-members of the National Army. Not more than 40 men will be engaged on both jobs, and as there are over 100 married ex-National Army men on the live register at the Employment Exchange, it follows that both schemes are confined to ex-National Army men, and no civilian will be sent by the Employment Exchange to work on these jobs.</P>
    <P>Some of the men who will get employment on that job have served in the National Army for a long time, and it is quite possible that some of the <Col N="291" /> married civilians who will be deprived of jobs on the work may have been unemployed for the last six or seven years.  There lies the disadvantage and the unfairness of this regulation in the Limerick area.  These are two quite different cases, and I quote them to make the case in favour of the withdrawal or the modification of the existing regulation.</P>
    <P>I was surprised when the President, answering on behalf of the Minister for Finance, stated to-day that the Minister had no figures.  If he asks the Minister for Industry and Commerce he will give the figures as he gave the figures relating to the people registered as unemployed.  Out of that total he could give the number that served in the National Army.  If he asks the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to find out the number that had got work as a result of that preferential treatment I am certain the Minister would be able to give the figure, as well as figures showing the extent to which the regulation has operated to the disadvantage of the married man with dependents.  If he asks the Minister for Agriculture he will be able to furnish figures so far as it affects the Forestry Branch, while the Minister for Fisheries can also give information to show that the regulation is operating in the same way.  The figures are available.  If not they can be discovered, and they will prove conclusively that this regulation has operated to the disadvantage of married civilians.  That is why I say that the existing regulation will have to be withdrawn or modified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to associate myself with Deputy de Valera and Deputy Davin in making a protest against the present penalisation of the unemployed. Deputy Davin to a large extent has concentrated attention on the amount of public money that has been absorbed by members of the Free State Army.  We are aware of the fact that a great many of these are drawing pensions. I do not know if cases actually occurred, but it has been alleged in this House that ex-members of the <Col N="292" /> Army who are in receipt of Military Service Pensions get preferential treatment at the expense of unemployed people.  If we take the case of the town of Carrick-on-Suir, to which Deputy de Valera has referred, we find that before Christmas the conditions there were so terrible, and the unemployed suffered so acutely, that they marched to a meeting of the local council.  It will be remembered that on the eve of Christmas a very sad heading appeared in the Dublin Press calling attention to the dreadful state of the people in that town.  The council was asked to get in touch with the Government to see whether portion of the unemployment grant could not be made available to help the starving people before and during Christmas. As Deputy de Valera asked, what has happened?  In that small town, which is undoubtedly declining, which has no great industry to support it, and which by reason of the condition of the surrounding farmers cannot look forward to any great prosperity, the people, in order to try to solve the local unemployment problem, put up the astonishing sum of £9,000, according to the information we have received, to enable a local scheme of employment to be set on foot.  The Government gave £2,000.  There you have a case where the ratepayers in Carrick-on-Suir, faced with a particularly dreadful situation, imposed a levy of £9,000 upon themselves in order to try to ameliorate the situation.  The Government steps in without giving the representatives of the ratepayers or those who are putting up most of the money an opportunity of putting up a case for the unemployed, or even of saying: &ldquo;Here are the circumstances in our town.  Why do you not take cognizance of them and why do you not relax your penal clause?&rdquo;  The Government takes no cognizance of that in Carrick-on-Suir or in any other town.  It sends down instructions to the manager of the local unemployment exchange and to the engineer in charge of the works. Is that a fair way to treat a starving population, and a large number of heads of families who are set aside while preference is given, not only to the ex-National Army men in the locality, <Col N="293" /> who may or may not have dependents, but, as I know has happened in other cases, preference is actually given to outsiders because they were ex-members of the Army against those who have lived in a district all their lives?  Is that state of affairs going to bring about harmonious feelings in Carrick-on-Suir or in other towns?  I think if the Government showed practical statesmanship and a little wisdom they would set about modifying an attitude which has aroused the deepest resentment, not alone in Dun Laoghaire, Mountrath and Carrick-on-Suir, but in other towns and villages.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin called attention to the amount of money that has been spent. Our position in this House is that we have granted a large sum of money this year, £300,000, to be expended in the relief of unemployment.  By what law or by what authority, by what principle of Christianity or justice or fair play are the Government now deciding that in this £300,000 that we granted in relief of unemployment no cognisance is going to be taken of large numbers of people who should be first entitled to it? What on earth is the Christianity or what is the morality or what is the humanitarianism of the Government that thought of applying these conditions? We have a state of affairs in the country where very severe depression exists and where people must be relieved and special relief works must be set up to relieve the situation, and at the same time we have the Government arbitrarily deciding that those who are perhaps best entitled to the benefit of that expenditure on relief should be excluded.  Does any sane person, does any ordinary person believe that at this hour of the day in the 20th century you can go down to the small towns of this country and spend the people's money, spend the taxpayer's money, and spend it purely on a political basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As if it were not bad enough to spend the unemployment grant in that way, we have, as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, other examples of this extraordinary partisanship and this extraordinary preference seven years <Col N="294" /> after the civil war has ended.  We have cases of officials, doctors and of various other persons, appointed to public positions, said to be appointed on merit and by reason of the fact that they have the best qualifications. What has actually happened?  They have got preference because they spent a few months or years in the Army though perhaps they had no service before that, though perhaps if it were left to themselves they would have preferred to look for these positions simply on the ground of their own qualifications.  I know there are large numbers of ex-National Army men who have not benefited from this penal clause which the Government have sought to enforce for their benefit. A large number of them have not found employment and they realise that it would be much better if they had to take their place as ordinary men seeking positions.</P>
    <P>They realise that in a number of areas where grave unemployment exists, where large numbers of people have been drawing home assistance for years, where people have been keeping body and soul together with the greatest difficulty, where after years of unemployment they are hardly able to work if they got the chance&mdash;these ex-members of the National Army, in a lot of cases decent men, realise that it would be much better for them and that they would have a much better chance of fair play in the community if they were put on exactly the same basis as everybody else.  If there is any distinction to be made let us make the only distinction that ought to be made; let it be the distinction that Deputy de Valera has suggested, a distinction that, I am sure, would meet with the approbation of every ex-member of the National Army who is at present an unemployed man.  That is, where public money is being spent, whether it is the ratepayers' or the taxpayers' money, it ought to be left in the hands of the local authorities, who are best acquainted with the situation in their area or vicinity, and who know how the families of the unemployed are situated.  If there is to be any distinction let it be the sole distinction of giving a preference to the <Col N="295" /> man who has dependents who are expected to live on what he can earn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of hardship has been caused, particularly amongst what is described as the unskilled or labouring classes, in this country owing to the operation of this system of preferences.  I agree that it is a good principle to reward men who have given services to the country in her time of need.  But, as suggested by Deputy Derrig and others, I think that some water has flown under the bridges of the Liffey in a period of eight or nine years, and it is about time that this preferential treatment should be ended.  I think some less objectionable method should be devised to compensate or help ex-National Army men rather than that of putting them in a position of preference or putting them into antagonism with their fellow-countrymen all through the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no other system which has produced so much resentment amongst the ordinary people of this country as this preferential treatment of ex-National Army men.  Much has been said about married men with wives and families, but there are many others in this country who have dependents, too. There are, for instance, many single men who have to support widowed mothers, and possibly one or two brothers or sisters, and individuals of that unfortunate class are crushed between the upper and nether millstone. Possibly they never get a look in at all in the matter of any employment that is going.  This attitude is one that should be deplored by every right-thinking Irishman.  It is, in my view and in the view of many supporters of this Government, establishing a new privileged class in the country.  It is a means of accentuating and perpetuating those old feuds that a careful and proper Government should seek to have removed as far as they can remove them.  I have had many complaints from all over Cork city and county with regard to this preferential treatment.  As I have said, many people who have come to me are thick and thin supporters of the present <Col N="296" /> Government and they strongly object to this setting up of what I have described as a new privileged class in this country.</P>
    <P>I feel in this matter&mdash;possibly many may take exception to my feelings&mdash; very strongly.  I do not care personally and I do not think any decent Irishman should care whether a man is an ex-member of the National Army or an ex-member of the Irish Republican Army or an ex-member of the British Army provided he is an Irishman and a good citizen.  I would not differentiate even against ex-British Army men provided they are good Irishmen and good citizens.  All these classes of people of whom I have spoken&mdash;the ex-National Army men, the ex-I.R.A. men and ex-members of the British Army&mdash;have contributed directly or indirectly to the National Exchequer.  Why are they denied the rights of citizenship and the right to work?  Why are they denied the right to partake in any work which the State is undertaking or to which the State is in any way contributing by way of relief grant or through any other measure of financial assistance? I have found many cases, some of them synonymous with those which Deputy Davin has mentioned, where married men with dependents and single men with dependents have applied for work under one or other of these schemes and where they have been turned down in favour of ex-National Army men.  Deputy Davin has gone to some pains to show how public moneys have already been expended and where preference has been given to the ex-National Army men. Deputy Davin does not deprecate the services rendered by the National Army and neither do I, but I want to emphasise this, that neither do I deprecate the services rendered to the community by other people ready and willing to work who have never been in any Army at all.</P>
    <P>If this policy is to be pursued, what may the common or garden citizen expect when the Fianna Fáil Party comes into power?  It may be that they in turn will give preference in 90 per cent. of the jobs vacant to the members of the invisible Army that we hear so <Col N="297" /> much about.  I want the Government to face up to facts.  Suppose Deputy de Valera's Government is succeeded by some other Government still more extreme, then we may have the position in this country where Government money may be expended on somebody only who has shot somebody else.  Let us be quite fair in this matter.  I hope in God it will never come to pass, but it may be that some leader of a revolutionary party in this country may suggest at some time that nobody should get a position or get employment where Government money is expended unless he is somebody who has shot a Civic Guard.  Let us be quite logical in this matter.  It may appear farfetched and, perhaps, ridiculous, but that possibility is there.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government are making a stick to break their own backs.  There should be no preferential treatment for any man in this country, and every man who is a good citizen whether ex-I.R.A. or ex-National Army or ex-British soldier, should get fair treatment.  I think it is time after the lapse of eight or nine years for the Government to drop this policy of setting up a new privileged class in this country, setting one man against another.  They are doing this by the perpetuation of this policy. I do hope that the President, when replying, will give us some indication that he is not as unbending as he pretends to be in this matter. I say that because notwithstanding the fact that he is a bit vocal in matters of this character from time to time, I feel that he is not without some humanity at least and that he does not in his heart believe in the setting up of a new privileged class and antagonising one Irishman against another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it well that it should be made quite clear, for the benefit of members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, that the grievance referred to by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Davin is not the experience of supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party alone, or of the supporters of the Labour Party alone.  It is a grievance that is felt just as keenly by many ardent supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal, <Col N="298" /> and by many people who do not support any Party, and in a very great degree by those who were members of the British forces during the Great War and who are now resident in this country.  The policy of the Government as enunciated by the President, is that the small section that associated itself with the Cumann na nGaedheal Party during a particular period should be given special privileges over all others. One could understand that policy if it was presented to the Dáil and to the country in a truthful and honest manner, but that has not been done. There is probably no one in the Dáil who more frequently stands up and appeals for the non-party consideration of important questions than the President of the Executive Council. There is no one who more often deplores the introduction of politics into any issue, but this is sheer politics, and nothing else.  If the President came here and said &ldquo;We won the struggle.  We beat the devil out of you,&rdquo; to use his own historic phrase, &ldquo;and we are going to have all the fruits of victory, all the spoils of office, everything that we can lay our hands on, for our own immediate following,&rdquo; then he would be taking a stand which would be at least an understandable and certainly an honest one.  That is not what he does.  He hides his purpose behind the cloak of hypocrisy.  He pre tends to be animated by feelings of altruism, by a desire to do the right thing by the whole nation, to have no party interests at all, no sectional affiliations. There is probably no more practiced and finished hypocrite in the Dáil than the President of the Executive Council, and this policy of securing all the spoils for one section is not presented honestly, but under this hypocritical cloak which the President loves to wrap round himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear also that the policy applies not merely to work financed out of relief Votes but to employment of every kind which the Government control or can influence.  It applies to employment in the Post Office.  This was mentioned here in the debate on the Estimate.  It applies to employment given through the instrumentality of the Land Commission.

There is no member of this Dáil who can say that the people affected by this policy are not his constituents or his supporters, and the question which the Dáil must ask itself is whether it is wise national policy that one small section of the community should be specially privileged in this way.  The policy of the Government is to secure everything that can be secured for that one small section, and to leave the rest, those who vote against them and those who do not vote at all, to scramble for what is left.  Is that a policy that is going to help us to repair the damage done in the civil war period and to make progress possible here?</P>

He never loses an opportunity of helping to revive some of the hate, the jealousy and the bitterness that was created during the civil war period. That policy suits his Party interest, and it is in pursuance of that policy that these regulations are made.  It is an attempt to introduce into this country what does operate in some places and what is known as the spoil system.  Will Deputies contemplate the situation that would exist here if other Parties were to declare in favour of the same system?  If each Government that came into office meant a complete clearing out of the Civil Service, <Col N="300" /> police officials and others, and their substitution by the adherents of that Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is alleged against this Government that they are definitely out, as these regulations prove, to secure every post, and every form of employment that they control, for their own adherents.  They are trying to establish that principle all over the country.  They are the only Party in the country that adhere to it.  The spoil system cannot operate unless all Parties agree.  There is only one Party to stand for it, that is the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
      <P>It is because I feel that the great majority of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party do not realise that that is the aim and intention of the Executive Council, that I hope in some way, even if we do not succeed in securing a reversal of that policy by a vote on this Estimate, we will, at least, get something going inside the ranks of that Party which will, in due course, exercise an influence upon the Executive Council, and secure from them a realisation that they are going the wrong way in this matter.</P>

      <P>After the pacific speech to which we have listened I hate to intervene; but I would like to point out to Deputy Lemass, when he begins to speak of the spoil system, that there were certain people whose cases had been considered, and who had been dismissed from service with the Government by reason of clear-cut complicity with an armed movement against the State, and afterwards they were returned to their employment. The Deputy has, probably, conveniently forgotten about that.  This matter is not going to be dealt with, as far as I am concerned, on a Party basis.  I do not recognise any question of Party division as far as ex-National Army men are concerned. They can be labelled as they stand.  There is no division made, as far as the Employment Exchange managers are concerned, as between a person's present political affiliations <Col N="301" /> when it comes to that manager sending forward names and when applications are made to him.</P>

      <P>Very well, let us take it at that.  There has not been revealed in this House any disposition, except on the part of the Deputy, to deprive ex-National Army men, particularly married men, of a particular preference at a particular time.  The complaint, as phrased by Deputies Davin and Anthony, is that the period over which that preference has extended has now lasted too long, and the preference, in so far as it operates to the advantage of single ex-National Army men in opposition to civilians&mdash; married men&mdash;is unfair.  As far as the period is concerned.  I have spoken already on this matter at least three times, and on each occasion I stated that such a regulation ought to be regarded as one only for a temporary period.  I have this also to say to the House on this occasion, that each time previously when there was a debate on this matter I was driven to investigate the circumstances, and I found that although there might have been regulations, the carrying out of those regulations was a different matter, and on each occasion I made up my mind, as I stated here recently, that the regulations had not been put into force and ex-National Army men, the people who did serve in a way that deserved commendation and material support from the people of this country, have not got the support to which they were entitled.  I said that preference ought to exist for some period longer.  I say that even now, although we are so many years removed from the civil war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction made, and the distinction is increasing, between the people who went in for a temporary period afterwards and those who were in the Army during the civil war.  I do not think they have any great claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are.  It is, of course, a matter for investigation of individual cases.  At any rate, I do not think these people are entitled to the same treatment as the people who were in the Army in the dangerous time when the State was being attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that these people are not entitled to the same treatment.  As a general rule, that preference was not given in their cases, and it should not be given; but a new situation may arise hereafter which may result in preference being given, say, in connection with an Army reserve.  However, that again is a different situation, and it is not the situation with which we are now dealing.  Deputy Davin asked something about a modification of the rule. I would like to see the rule operate strictly and rigidly for a bit, so that one could say, &ldquo;These people have got what they merited and, having given them something in return, we can now say we are finished with them.&rdquo;  It has not operated to any extent, however. I have heard debates here on occasions in which, if the rule were to have been applied, extraordinary cases of hardship could be revealed. The matter was raised here on one occasion by Deputy Redmond in regard to Waterford, and it has been raised in communications to me in regard to Limerick and Carrick-on-Suir. In all cases in which exceptional hardship could be revealed through the application of this rule there has been a modification made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Waterford, Deputy Redmond gave an instance quite publicly and openly with regard to the extraordinarily large number of British ex-servicemen in that area, and how <Col N="303" /> they were going to be penalised in an extraordinary way through the application of this rule.  The rule was relaxed at once.  In the case of Limerick, there was much more reluctance about relaxing it, because, as far as my investigation goes, the ex-National Army men there have got no chance up to date.  On a good case being made on any occasion the rule was invariably modified.  Similarly, with regard to Carrick-on-Suir, when a case was made the rule was modified.  What case was made to-night?  Of course Deputy Lemass will have his friends in any of these matters, but the main feature is that they always avoid details.  There is always that sort of rule amongst them; they never will commit themselves to detail.  It is apparently a dangerous thing, and if the Deputy were so to commit himself he might be caught out.  Deputy Davin gives one case. I do not know of a job in Mountrath for which there was an application made to the Exchange in relation to thirty vacancies.  I do know in regard to a particular piece of work going on in Mountrath that an application was made to the branch manager for nine men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>The branch manager was told that there were nine vacancies and he sent on nine people. There was one single man; that was the one exception.  The rest were married men.  Out of the remaining eight there were five ex-National Army men and three civilians.  For the nine posts notified to the manager eight of the men sent were married men, and one was a single man.</P>

      <P>In regard to that particular job we knew that the contractor filled three vacancies himself. Are these the three men to whom the Deputy refers&mdash;the three key men?  We knew there were twelve jobs going, and an application was made to the exchange manager for nine men.</P>

      <P>I think not.  There were nine vacancies and these were filled by eight married men and one single man.  Of the eight married men, five were ex-National Army men and three civilians.  That is the extent of the preference, as far as I know it, in the particular case to which the Deputy has referred.  It is the only case that we have got about which I consider there might be a case of hardship made.  Take the Limerick case. What is the position there?  That there are more ex-National Army men married and having dependents than there are posts available for.  In that case I have no hesitation in saying that ex-National Army men who are married have a right to any posts there are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to Deputy Aiken's questions is that they never have any illumination about them.  What are the facts with regard to road work?  That ex-National Army men get, I think, about one-twelfth of whatever vacancies there are.  The majority of those vacancies given to ex-National Army men go to married men.  I assert that if there is going to be a distinction between married and single men there ought again to be, first, a distinction made between an ex-National Army man who is married and a civilian who is married. On these debates, when I come to make an investigation, I always find that although the rule may be there it is not in practice made effective.  On each occasion on which we make an examination of the position we get the feeling that we are bound in conscience to these people to give them a certain preference over a certain period.  If that preference has not been given for any period, then we feel inclined to keep it on until these people have got what their merits deserve. We think that the rule ought not to last for ever.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin asked me if I would allow the regulations to be continued without modification.  As I have said, I do not find that it is made effective in practice.  In the particular cases in which it was shown that it had caused hardship it has been modified.  The Deputy was present at the debate that took place on the Waterford case, and he knows well that in that case there was a modification of the rule made.  In cases where definite hardship is shown, the rule will be modified.  On the whole, I make the case that something is owed to ex-National Army men over a particular period.  Although it has been the rule to give the ex-National Army man the preference indicated, he has not in fact benefited in practice.  I think the time has not yet come for the abandonment of the rule.  In fact, I think that after this debate there should be a more rigid application of the rule in order to make up for the defects that have been revealed.</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce has let slip portion of the reason for this preference when he said that he hoped it would operate for a bit, and that then they would be finished with these people.  Of the ex-National Army men who did the fighting for the Government there are 2,000 unemployed at the moment.  A good number of them are married.  The Government has not provided any employment for them, nor for the other 20,000 people who are idle and for whom they fought the war.</P>

      <P>These ex-National Army men who are being given a preference on road work have not a whole lot to thank the Government for if they are only given a couple of weeks' work during the year.  These men are simply being led on with a carrot held before their noses with the hope that at some time they will get a preference and get what they supposed they were fighting for.  The men who were on the top got a preference all right.  The men who got the big pensions got the big jobs afterwards.  Single men who were getting <Col N="308" /> big pay in the Army, and afterwards got big pensions, got the big jobs in preference to married ex-National Army men or to anybody else.  Take the case of Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  He was paid pretty well while he was in the Army.  He had £1,400 a year in his job, which was not a very arduous or dangerous one.  A lot of the married ex-National Army men who are now unemployed, and who can only get a couple of weeks' work in the year, have very little to be thankful for to the Government when they see men like Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, who had £1,400 a year in the Army, getting £3,000 cash down on leaving, £360 a year as a Deputy, and £1,000 a year as County Medical Officer of Health in the County of Meath. Put his case against the couple of weeks' work that is given during the year at 25/- or 27/- a week to poor married or single ex-National Army men.</P>
      <P>We have asked both the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce what statutory right there is for the preference that is operating at present.  There has been no answer given to our question.  We are told, I suppose, to go to the courts.  Of course the Government do not want any statutory right to give that.  They do not want any legal sanction to do what might suit them politically for the moment.  The attitude of the President and his Ministry has always been &ldquo;We are the State.  Anything that is good for our political Party is good for the State and anything that is not good for our political Party is bad for the State.&rdquo;  I hope one thing any way will result from this, that the ex-National Army men who did the fighting are not going to be fooled by a couple of weeks' work during the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony asked where was this thing going to end.  If this Government, he asked, was thrown out, was the next Government going to give a preference to their people?  Evidently Deputy Anthony does not want that done.  He is definitely foregoing his right, at any time in the future, to give a preference to the men who took up wooden guns with him in Cork.  We are glad to hear that.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera, the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, stated our case to-night&mdash;that we want in this country in the future a preference to be given to people according to their need.  We have stated our policy on several occasions regarding the provision of work and of a decent maintenance for the people of the country.  We believe that the country is capable of producing all that is required to give a decent livelihood both to married and single ex-National Army men, married and single ex-British Army men, and married and single ex-I.R.A. men.  As Deputy de Valera has said, our policy is to give preference to married men with families and to people with dependents in the provision of work while the present situation exists, that there is not sufficient work and maintenance available for all.  I hope the Dáil, as a whole, will condemn as vigorously as it can the policy of the Government in giving this preference to ex-National Army men.  Since the Government have come into office they have made no definite effort to provide work or maintenance for all the people in this country, and that applies to their attitude to the ex-National Army men whom they fooled for a while into fighting for them.  The preference given was in reality to the inner clique, and in the long run poor people who were unemployed and who joined the National Army for a living for a while got badly let down, and certainly when the Fianna Fáil Party comes into office we are going to see that there is fair treatment all along the line, and that people who are badly off and have dependents shall be given preference no matter what political view they held in the past.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this matter, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that they were looking after the men who fought.  I have here one of a large number of letters from the town of Cobh which I have received in the past few months.  There is a large number of unemployed in <Col N="310" /> that town, and this letter will give the House an idea how matters stand:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I wish to appeal to you and to put before you the fact that I and several others with large helpless families, who are in a destitute way, have from time to time applied for employment at the local Exchange. Where such employment exists as at present in the cleaning of the tanks at Haulbowline, we are turned down simply because we are not ex-National Army men.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is only one of many such letters. The Minister said they were giving preferential treatment to those who fought.  I will give him a case of one family in Cobh who fought, and who fought without being paid.  They were a family of four in number who joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and who saw the thing through to the finish. Deputy Hennessy knows the case as well as I do.  One member of that family was captured in the battle of Clonmult and executed in Cork Military Barracks, and he is buried in Cork Jail.  A second boy was captured the night afterwards in his own home, taken out and put up against a fence to be shot by Cameron Highlanders who were in a drunken condition.  He succeeded in escaping wounded, had to run nearly five miles, and spent all night out in the frost, so that his health was seriously injured.  Two other brothers served until the Truce. One of them was three years unemployed and had to go to America.  The other brother is at home idle.  He has three in family.  He got a few months' work in Ford's, and since then is unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot get any work in the town of Cobh, so that the one left out of these four brothers who fought for Ireland cannot get work in the town of Cobh while there are any ex-National Army men unemployed in that town. Is that what the Executive Council stand for?  Is that their position?  We are told that there are between 23,000 and 26,000 persons on the register of unemployed, and 2,000 ex-National Army men.  I made inquiries as to the numbers employed at Haulbowline on the tanks, and I am told that the ratio between ex-National Army men and <Col N="311" /> married men is fifty-fifty, or half and half.  I doubt if it is even that.  The letter which I have read does not look like that.  I ask is that fair play?  I alluded a while ago to the boy who was wounded, and that boy died last year in Cobh Hospital, into which he was sent by the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  That is the treatment meted out to those who fought for Ireland without pay.</P>
    <P>My first introduction into public life happened to be in connection with National Army men.  It was in the form of an appeal made to me by large numbers of unemployed civilians with families living around my district who could not get an hour's work even breaking stones on the road.  I happened at the time to be co-opted a member of the County Council.  I saw the Minister's order in connection with this.  I went down to see what could be done.  I found that single men were being brought out from the slums and lanes of Cork five or six miles to Glanmire and Riverstown and put into employment, while standing by on the roads looking on at these single men doing the work were married men with families who were themselves living <Col N="312" /> along the roadside.  We succeeded at the time in getting rid of some of the burden, but as soon as the Minister found the burden lightened, acting on instructions, stricter orders were sent to the County Council officials and borough surveyors.  It is time that was ended.  It is unfair to have single men without dependents employed before married men with families.</P>
    <P>I am sure when the Minister for Finance is looking for his taxes on tea and sugar he does not say to the married man: &ldquo;Because you are unemployed we will not ask you to pay, and we will not charge you any tax.&rdquo;  The taxes out of which these ex-National Army men are paid are drawn from those paid by the unfortunate married men and their families.  On a pair of boots which they buy for their children, if it is a foreign pair, they have to pay a tax in order to find work for the unemployed ex-National Army men, while they themselves have to go hungry.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went out of Committee.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow (Friday).</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Friday at 10.30 a.m.</P>
