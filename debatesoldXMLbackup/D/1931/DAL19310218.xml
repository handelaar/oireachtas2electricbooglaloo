      <P>The claim made on the 8th January last by Mr. McInerney <Col N="45" /> was disallowed by the insurance officer on the ground that the claimant was not unemployed.  An appeal, which will be heard by the Court of Referees at an early date, has been lodged.  The claimant has so far proved unemployment for only six days, representing the waiting week.  No benefit would, therefore, be payable on the claim, should it be allowed, unless Mr. McInerney renews his claim and proves further unemployment.</P>

      <P>Proposals for construction of footpaths were received from the Laoighis County Council on the 23rd December, 1930.  The estimated cost of the works was £9,030. About the same time proposals were received from the Laoighis Board of Health and Public Assistance for public health works.  The works proposed by the County Council and the Board of Health constituted too large a programme of works to be set in motion for the purpose of relieving unemployment and it was decided to give preference to public health works, in connection with which I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question bearing on these schemes.</P>

      <P>Five public health works were proposed by the Laoighis Board of Health and Public Assistance at an estimated cost of £29,861 9s. 3d.  The works included sewerage schemes for Mountrath and Mountmellick and the Board of Health were notified that it was not considered desirable to proceed with sewerage schemes until gravitation water supplies had been installed.</P>
      <P>In connection with water supply schemes for Mountrath and Ballinakill, the Board of Health have been negotiating for the acquisition of the necessary lands and water rights by agreement.  An intimation was received yesterday that full agreement had been reached in the case of the Mountrath scheme, and the Department are notifying the Board of Health to-day that arrangements may now be made to proceed with the work. A grant of £2,000 has been allocated.</P>
      <P>The Offaly Board of Health at their meeting on the 30th December, 1930, adopted six minor works.  The estimated cost of the works was £7 10/-; £70; £75; £120; £25, and £40.</P>
      <P>The Board of Health were notified on the 10th January, 1931, that minor works of this nature were not regarded as suitable works to which an allocation from Relief Funds could be made and that the Board should defray the expenditure out of their own funds.</P>

      <P>It would be quite impossible, and would serve no useful purposes, to get returns of the number of people employed on these different schemes.  It would vary from day to day and from week to week.  Diffe rent departments are administering the grants, and a large number of bodies are also concerned.  Once consideration is given to the state of unemployment in a particular area and to the works proposed to be carried out and grants have been allotted, then no further use could be made of the information available from day to day and from week to week as to the number of men employed on these schemes.  In many cases they could not be differentiated.  Take, for instance, work on a public health scheme, only part of the cost of that is borne by the Relief Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of <Col N="64" /> the Public Health (Special Expenses) Bill, 1930.</P>
      <P>Special expenses are the expenses incurred by a rural sanitary authority in the carrying out of public health works such as sewerage and water supply schemes, and are levied off a special area of charge, determined by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Such an area of charge, as the law stands at present, may be fixed as the townland, the dispensary district, the area of any rural district as constituted immediately before the 1st October, 1925, or such portions of any of the above-mentioned areas as may be determined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Health (Ireland) Act of 1900 an area of charge may, upon the application of the rural sanitary authority, be fixed as the entire county health district.  The small towns usually benefit most under these schemes, but their valuations are too low either to base the loan charges on these valuations or to raise on these valuations the necessary rate for paying off loan charges.  There is a considerable variation in the proposal of local bodies for the chargeability of expenses of this nature.  In some districts the tendency is to spread the expenditure for water supply and sewerage schemes over a wide area; in others, to narrow the area to that deemed to be most directly benefited.  The Public Health, (Ireland) Act, 1878, lays down that the money borrowed shall not at any time exceed, with the balances of all the outstanding loans contracted by the sanitary authority, in the whole twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the area of charge. To comply with this provision it is necessary in most cases to fix the area of charge as not less than the dispensary district in which the work is being carried out.  The annual cost over such an area throws an onerous rate on land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave particulars already as showing how that is effected in certain areas.  It is proposed in the present Bill to amend the law so as to provide that a county council may, from the proceeds of a limited rate, contribute towards the annual cost of <Col N="65" /> carrying out such works by the board of health where the area of charge is less than the county health district, and that where the area of charge fixed is an area less than a county health district, an apportionment of expenses may be made as between such area of charge and the area deemed to be directly benefited.  As to the rate that may be struck, Section 2 empowers the county council to agree to make a contribution towards annual charges on foot of loan repayment in respect of water supply and sewerage works carried out by the board of health in the county.  The amount of such contribution is not to exceed in respect of all such works the produce of the rates of 1½d. in the £ without the approval of the Minister; and with the sanction of the Minister to strike a rate not exceeding threepence. Thus when waterworks or sewerage schemes are being proposed the local authority may suggest, say, the dispensary area as the main area of charge but a small area inside that dispensary district is the area which is directly benefiting from the scheme. The major cost of the scheme will be put down on that area directly benefiting but a small charge may be put on the dispensary area or, as the case may be, on the rural district and the county council may by a small rate, struck over the county health district at large, give an annual sum to help towards the repayment of the loan charges.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of Oldcastle where the local authority consider that a water supply, of which the approximate cost will be £5,600 and a sewerage system, approximately costing £2,240, are necessary.  As I say, the cost of a water supply there is expected to be £5,600.  The loan at the present rates would be 5¾ per cent. over 25 years and, under present legislation, we would have to fix the area of charge in that case either as the rural district, the dispensary district, or the town.  If the rural district is taken as the area of charge it would involve a rate of threepence halfpenny over that district in which there are about 44,000 acres.  If the dispensary district were made the <Col N="66" /> area of charge it would involve a rate of sixpence over the dispensary district which contains about 24,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that that is an appreciable rate on agricultural land in respect of a water scheme which will, so far as some parts at any rate of that area are concerned, only remotely benefit them.  If the area of charge is made the area of the town it is anticipated that the rate would be 7/6.  Under the present proposals, if, say, the county council agree to an annual grant of £300, a very small fraction of the rate in County Meath, and if the rural district were the main area of charge, a rate of one penny for the rural district would suffice together with a rate of 1/3½ in the town. You would have the local body provided with a scheme for which it could put a reasonable rate on the area directly benefiting.  It could put on the rural or dispensary district a rate which will not bear as heavily as the rates which some of these districts have had to pay.  The local authority will be empowered to give a small subvention from the rate leviable over the country towards helping such schemes. The proposal, I understand, is welcomed by a number of local bodies who have been discussing these schemes in recent months.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment, which is in the name of Deputy O'Kelly:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to a Public Health (Special Expenses) Bill which does not embody the principle that the State as a whole shall bear such portion of the cost of any sanitary schemes as is not met by the charge on the area immediately benefited.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it is necessary to enter into any lengthy explanation of this amendment, as I think that its terms explain its purpose fairly clearly.  We all know that very necessary public health works have been from time to time postponed and delayed and, in some cases, not gone on with at all, simply because agreement could not be got by those who <Col N="67" /> were not immediately concerned as to the advisability of such schemes.  Up to the present we have had the county councils and those in the immediate vicinity of the areas benefiting protesting against the extra charges inasmuch as they felt that they were not immediately concerned.  There was no principle that I could see on which a district immediately surrounding the town was portioned off and made responsible for a part of the cost.  It seems to me that the area was portioned off, not because those in the particular contributing area, as it has been called, were particularly concerned, but because an area sufficiently large had to be taken so as to enable the money to be borrowed and so that the assessable value of the premises and hereditaments, as the Minister has said, in that particular area might be sufficient according to the law to cover the requirements for raising a loan.</P>
    <P>Why should that be the determining factor?  Is it not quite clear that the matter of public health is one that should concern the community as a whole?  Our view is this, if there is to be an apportionment of the charge and if the particular area benefiting cannot bear the entire cost, the apportionment ought to be as between the area immediately benefiting and the community or State as a whole.  That is why we put in the amendment.  We believe that it is fair and that it is more in accordance with the right idea of public health responsibility to have the charge borne by the community as a whole where it cannot be borne by the area immediately benefiting.  The Minister is empowered to determine what shall be the area and what shall be the charge on the area immediately benefited.  We believe that any Bill to meet this particular matter should be so framed as to put on the area immediately benefiting the heaviest portion of the cost provided that it is not unreasonable, that is, as heavy a charge as it can reasonably carry and that after that whatever is necessary to enable these public works to be carried out should be borne by the State as a whole.  At present the <Col N="68" /> farming community are burdened beyond their capacity, and it is only natural to expect, when any proposal is put forward for the initiation of public health works in any particular area, that the farming community not immediately benefiting by such works will object to them and that, therefore, they will be put back.  Apart from the point of view of justice there is the point of view that these works would not be undertaken unless some provision such as we suggest is made.  While we think that there is an improvement in the existing law in the Bill as proposed by the Minister we do not think it goes far enough.  We believe that after the Bill has passed the condition of affairs which prevented the undertaking of these necessary public health works will continue.  Accordingly, I propose that a Second Reading be not given to the Bill until we have embodied in it the principle that the State should be the contributing area.</P>

      <P>We are supporting the amendment put forward by Deputy de Valera for the reasons he has explained. At the present moment it is absolutely impossible to get any county council to move in the direction which this Bill intends it shall move because the farming community, as Deputy de Valera stated, believe themselves to be overburdened with taxation.  There are crying demands from all parts of the different counties, especially the rural parts, for better sanitary conveniences. These facilities have been long overdue because of the fact that the area of charge has been so limited and I am very much afraid that the extensions permitted in the Bill put forward by the Minister are not going to do very much in that direction.  I believe it is necessary that the Minister should agree to the amendment if he wants the work to be done.  Certainly things have gone so far in the country, so far as the ratepayers and high costs in these matters are concerned, that it is absolutely necessary that the State should come to the help of local authorities to carry out public <Col N="69" /> sanitary works.  These matters have been neglected for the last ten or twelve years owing to the cost being so high.  I do not believe that this Bill will go any length in solving the problem with which local authorities are confronted so far as sanitary work is concerned.  I therefore support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill I am afraid will not go far enough towards removing that unfairness.  This matter of the provision of proper water supplies and sewerage schemes is one of national importance.  Epidemics break out periodically in many places because of the want of these facilities. These epidemics have an unfortunate habit of not confining themselves to a particular area.  In these days of rapid transport, people travel much more than they did and infection is very easily conveyed.  It is just as much a matter of importance to the man living one hundred miles away from the area of the outbreak, as it is to the man living twenty miles away that the cause be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unfair to ask that every individual in the State should bear some portion of the cost of providing these facilities.  A farmer with a fairly large holding, living fifty miles from the benefiting area, is asked to contribute to the cost of the provision of these facilities whereas his neighbour living across the road but under a different rating authority contributes nothing at all although one man derives as much benefit as another from the scheme. We are not asking too much when we ask that portion of the charge be contributed by the State and that every individual in the country should have it brought home to him that he is just as likely to suffer ill-effects from the lack of these facilities <Col N="70" /> as the man living a few miles away from the area which needs these facilities.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, one of the greatest obstacles to the carrying out of a scheme in the past has been the fact that the farmer living outside a town and the farmer living at the other end of the county offered such very strong and determined opposition.  Each man looked at it from his own selfish point of view.  &ldquo;Why should I be asked to pay?&rdquo;  asks the farmer who is 20 miles away.  He naturally brings pressure to bear on his representative on the county council with the result that some very necessary scheme has to be abandoned.  I am afraid the present Bill will not remove any of these difficulties.  I shall, therefore, support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmondCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>One fact which Deputies overlook is that where water schemes have been carried out in unurbanised towns a certain revenue is derived from the inhabitants who take in a supply.  That money is put to the credit of the local authorities and lessens the charges as they come along year by year.  If we adopt the scheme put forward by Deputy de Valera, the amount derived in revenue in that way will have to go to the Government. Why should that be?  If there is a certain amount of revenue derived from water schemes that should be put to the credit of the rates paid by those who have contributed towards those schemes.  The one thing I am interested in is the question whether the extra rate to be paid over the larger area will have to be paid in one year or for the number of years mentioned in the loan.  If it was only struck for one year I would be quite agreeable, but I do not think it would be fair to have it struck for 25 years.  It should be only struck for the larger area for one year and let the benefiting area pay the rest.  A certain revenue is paid into the local authorities all over the country by water consumers.  That revenue goes to lessen the cost of that particular scheme.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the Bill and in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Most of the reasons for that attitude have been touched upon by the various Deputies who spoke.  It appears to me that instead of assisting in bringing about better public health conditions, owing to the opposition that will be aroused amongst the farming community because of the additional burdens that will be imposed on them by the Bill, the matter of dealing with this public health question will be considerably set back.  The Bill, as far as I can understand it, has not any application to urban areas.  It appears to be intended for areas for which the board of health are the sanitary authorities.  That means that where a sewerage scheme or a waterworks scheme has been carried out in any unurbanised area, that area is entitled to the assistance of a rate of 3d. in the £ over the entire county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. There may be forty semi-urbanised areas in any one county.  One, three, or ten of the forty may require water schemes.  In considering any one scheme the county council may decide that it will give for a period of years a certain amount annually towards paying off the loan charges. But it will have to bear in mind that it may have in the course of time to deal with all of those forty-two areas, let us say for a period of ten years.  It has to deal with ten or fifteen of those forty-two areas.  The rate struck by the county council for the county board of health area for these ten or fifteen schemes cannot exceed a rate of 1½d. for the whole lot without the sanction of the Minister or with the sanction of the Minister cannot exceed 3d., and normally the assistance of any one scheme might be one-ninth or one-eighth of a penny on the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are much clearer after that elaborate explanation. It did not tell us anything we did not know already.  If there is only one unurbanised area in a county, the county council can, with the sanction of the Minister, strike a rate of 3d. in the £.  The <Col N="72" /> area that has the misfortune to have an urban council apparently cannot have this contribution at all.  If that is so, it appears to me to be an unfair discrimination in favour of, say, the urban area that has Town Commissioners against the urban area that has an urban council.</P>
      <P>Some of those areas that are not urbanised are considerably larger in population than the areas that are urbanised.  I do not think it is fair to an urban area that may have to put a heavy burden on the local rates confined to the urban district in order to get modern sanitary equipment.  I do not think it is fair that 3d. in the £ from the county at large should be given to the Town Commissioners, and not to an urban council.  Apart altogether from that it is quite apparent that the Minister does not recognise the magnitude of the problem before him.  He says we can have a threepenny rate no matter how many villages or unurbanised areas there may be.  In a county the maximum contribution from the county at large will be threepence in the £.  I do not think the Minister realises the primitive sanitary conditions that exist in small towns, unurbanised areas and villages throughout the country.  In the northern end of the county in which I live we have the villages Scotstown, Tydavnet, Glasslough, Emyvale, Smithboro', Scotshouse, Newbliss, Rockcorry, Ballinode and Mullan.  I think that is about ten. There is not a waterworks scheme or a sewerage scheme in any one of these villages.  If the Minister's solution of that condition of things is a three-penny rate spread over the entire county I can assure him that that is never going to solve it.  Apart altogether from that, I am not quite clear whether, when the county council strike this county at large charge, they will include in that the urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That disposes of some doubt.  I am sure many of the Deputies here have not the advantage of knowing County Monaghan as intimately as I know it, but it illustrates the arguments against this Bill.  Take, <Col N="73" /> for example, the town of Ballybay. Surely the Minister would not seriously argue that the farmers of Killany and Inniskeen or the farmers of Truagh and Tydavnet would benefit to a greater extent than, say, the farmers of the greater portion of Co. Cavan by the improved sanitary conditions of Ballybay town if we were to put in a new waterworks and sewerage scheme there.  It ought to be perfectly obvious to anyone who has given thought to this that an arbitrary line of demarcation whereby people get the maximum benefit from schemes like this cannot be drawn.  The people of the neighbouring county will certainly derive more benefit from the sanitary conditions than the people in the same county twenty or twenty-five miles away.  That in itself is a strong argument in favour of having a State charge once it has been estimated following an inquiry as to what would be a reasonable amount on the local rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infectious or contagious diseases have a habit of spreading in the most mysterious way.  If a case can be made for making any public service in the State a State charge, I say that case is automatically made in favour of making this a State charge.  If as a result of any insanitary conditions in any one of the towns in the Twenty-six Counties an epidemic of contagious diseases arises, the people of the whole Twenty-six Counties are exposed to the possibility of that disease being spread.  If we have an all-Ireland football match, the next place we may find it is in Kerry.  It is spread through fairs, markets, sports meetings, and other ways in which people are brought into close association.  Consequently, it seems to me to be absurd to suggest that a county is the only area benefiting from an improvement in the public health services.  This is a matter on which I am very keen, and I would be very glad if the Minister would take the question into serious consideration and give it as much thought as he can afford.  It is quite apparent that he has not brought reasoned judgment to bear on this matter.  Very expensive machinery has been set up in addition to the existing machinery for the treatment of diseases.  I do not think it would <Col N="74" /> be in order to go into that in very much detail, except to refer to it in passing, but surely we should have reached a time when it would be obvious to anyone who has any interest in public health matters that we must devote more attention to the prevention of disease, and the two most important things in that direction would be proper sanitation and proper water supply.  The other things, such as housing, etc., I cannot mention here.</P>
    <P>This thing is not going to bring us any further.  It is not going to make public health services more popular than they were before.  If we mean to advance in improving public health services, then we must alter our methods of dealing with them, and the only way that can be done is to take it as a State responsibility.  In that way you will get relieved of the prejudices. There are other matters bearing on this that make it essential that the area should be certainly a wider area than the county.  For example, take the geographical conditions of any area that should get a water supply or a sewerage scheme.  If the reservoir is ten miles from the town that water supply costs more than if the reservoir were only five miles away, and the cost of upkeep will also be relatively greater.  In the same way if you have to have your sewerage pipes a mile or two out of the town in order to reach your purification beds, it is going to cost twice or three times more than a town in a different geographical position.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister had these considerations before his mind, but I think when his attention is drawn to them he ought to see that this Bill is not going to bring us forward. There is a serious risk that it may set us back.  There is a possibility that in the future&mdash;I do not know how remote&mdash;a de-rating scheme will be approved of in this House.  If such a thing were to come to pass, what rate would we have to put on the farm buildings (if agricultural land were derated) in order to give effect to these sewerage schemes, or how would it be received in the farming community if it were said we were going to have sewerage or waterworks schemes in every village, <Col N="75" /> but it would involve 10/- in the rates on the buildings on agricultural holdings?  If we were in that position I think we would ensure that our sewerage scheme would not go any further, but even if that condition would not arise I seriously suggest to the Minister that this is not a contribution towards the solution of one of the biggest questions that this country has yet to face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the speech that has been delivered by Deputy Ward and, to be candid, until his closing remarks I thought he was speaking in favour of the Bill.  He pointed out the deplorable state of sanitation in the rural areas, and in that respect I absolutely agree with him.  He painted a true picture of the situation and did not exaggerate.  It is a situation which there is no necessity to exaggerate.  In his criticism of the Bill he told us that a waterworks with a reservoir convenient to a town is considerably cheaper than when it is some distance away.  In that entirely, I agree. But, to get down to the Bill, the way to examine it is to see whether it will make the position better in the future than it is.  The position at the moment, as Deputy Ward pointed out, is that in most rural areas, other than urbanised towns, there are no proper waterworks and no proper sewage disposal systems.  The reason for that is very well known to every Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law governing the water rate and the area of charge lays it down that there must be a flat rate for the entire district, either the dispensary district or the rural district council area.  In effect that means that farmers living seven miles away from a town, who receive little or no benefit from the water supply or the sewerage system, must pay an equal rate with shopkeepers in the town who get the full value, or, if you take it over the district council area, it means that farmers living sixteen or twenty miles from a town must pay an equal rate to that paid by shopkeepers and others who get the benefit.  The reason why the sanitary situation is as it was described by Deputy Ward is because <Col N="76" /> people ten or twenty miles distant will not agree to pay the same rate as men in the town who receive the benefit.  It is an unjust system, an unbalanced system, and one that is not equitable.  We have not water supplies in our towns, and we have not sewerage systems, because of the present state of the law.</P>
    <P>This Bill in the last section proposes to give power to the boards of health to alter the rigid scheme of levying rates.  It gives power over the question as to whether a higher rate will have to be paid for a waterworks or a sewerage scheme by those who get the benefit than those living ten miles away.  It merely gives that discretionary power.  The Bill is an attempt to give added powers to local representatives throughout the country, and it is just in keeping with the general principles of the ultra-democratic Party on the left, that its members should oppose any attempt to give extra power to local boards or to place a little more confidence in local representatives.</P>
    <P>Another portion of the Bill gives power to the county council to strike a rate without sanction up to 1½d. in the £ for the purpose of providing a water supply or a sewerage system It does not compel them to do it; it leaves it to the members of the county council to do it or not to do it.  It puts a factor for the relief of unemployment in the hands of the county council that is not there at present. It puts the county council in the position that, where there might be acute unemployment in one area, they could start a scheme that would absorb the unemployed, improve the public health of the county and also the sanitary conditions of a particular area. Is it right to oppose the county council getting such powers?  They may levy a rate or they may not.  This Bill gives them power to do so if, in their wisdom, they decide to do so.  Deputy Ward stands up and opposes such power being given to county councils. The rate is 1½d. in the £.  That may create a big pool in a county out of which a grant might be made to two, three or four towns.  Seeing that the position in our towns is such as was described by Deputy Ward, I think <Col N="77" /> every honest attempt should be made by all parties to make it possible for these conditions to be removed.  At the present moment are not our boards, consisting as they do chiefly of farmers, right in opposing any schemes for which the same rate is levied on a man who gets no benefit as on the man who gets all the benefit? This Bill makes it possible to ease the situation and vary the rate. It makes it possible for a central pool to assist any work that is done.  I think this is a Bill that should go through without opposition and without controversy.  It is a Bill that will be a big step forward towards removing the deplorable conditions that exist outside the urban centres.</P>
    <P>With regard to the State carrying the liability, there is nothing in the Bill either to compel or to prevent that. From time to time the State has come to the assistance of such public bodies, and at the moment, it is giving assistance. But it would be scarcely judicious to lay down in the Bill what the State shall do for the future.  It would scarcely be reasonable for one Government to pledge the action of a future Government.  This Government may make a grant, or may not make a grant.  Nothing in the Bill prevents their making a grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is part of the considered policy of the Minister.  From my experience of local bodies it is the considered policy, and the endeavour of the Minister, to use every artifice in his power to make the farming community pay for what they have no right to pay, and for which, in my opinion, he has no right to call upon them to pay.  I have a fairly wide experience of the manner in which money for water and sewerage schemes has been raised by local bodies.  I shall give the Minister a concrete instance which is lying in his Department, if his officials have had time to study it.  It is in consection with a water supply for Dougas, in the suburbs of Cork, which was to cost £1,950.  When this scheme came before the South Cork Board it was pointed out that some sixty new houses were to be built there at a cost of £1,200 each.  These houses would be too large to be eligible for a grant, and <Col N="78" /> would be occupied by men like Deputy O'Higgins, or some other official of the Minister who could afford to pay a very high rent.  The idea was to get the unfortunate farmer living on a mountain, and having perhaps to go one and a half miles with a barrel and a donkey for water for himself, to pay for water for cooking, baths, etc., for these houses.  The attempt made to put the charge on the Cork rural district was only beaten by the casting vote of the chairman.  Subject to the Minister's sanction, it is now being placed on the Douglas Dispensary area.  The Minister, now realising that the farming community are no longer going to stand for water supplies of this description, says we can put sixpence in the pound on Douglas and twopence on the farmer on the mountain, so that the opposition will be lessened and the farmer will pay twopence in the pound for the gentlemen going into houses costing £1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the principle underlying the proposal.  The Minister says that it would be sixpence on one area and a penny or three-halfpence on the wider area.  Take a person living in one of these suburbs who has a slaughter-house and exports fresh pork and lamb across the water.  He will have a turnover, say, of £5,000 of which about £500 would be profit and he will pay rates for the slaughterhouse on a valuation of about £10.  He will be paying sixpence in the pound on that valuation or 5 shillings.  The Minister wants us to put three-halfpence in the pound on the farmer living 20 miles away with a turnover of £1,000 and no profit, who pays rates on a valuation of £100, twelve-and-eight pence on the farmer.  That is the idea underlying the Minister's scheme.  Does he consider it fair?  I realise, as everybody who has anything to do with local bodies does, the absolute necessity of both water and sewerage schemes for our villages and towns, but I realise also that the practice carried out up to the present of taxing one man's business and one man's business only to pay for all local services will have to cease.  The people who are running the only business which is being taxed at present for local services, namely, the farmers, <Col N="79" /> have got wise and will not pay any more and the sooner the Minister realises that the better.  These charges will have to be made a national charge and borne by the nation as a whole. Some Deputies who will vote to-day for this measure, have, as members of county boards of health, refused to sanction water supplies because the Minister was not prepared to give a 50-50 grant towards them.  These men will to-day probably, under the Cumann na nGaedheal Whip, vote in the Cumann na nGaedheal Lobby while they voted in that way at the local bodies where they are responsible to the ratepayers.  It is time for the Minister to realise that this would mean putting the last straw on the camel's back.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister's difficulty.  He finds that the ratepayers' representatives on the local bodies have got wise to this and are compelling the local areas to bear their own burdens.  If these gentlemen with £950 or £1,000 a year living in houses that cost £1,200 want hot and cold water in their houses the farmers are no longer going to pay for water and sewerage schemes for them.  It is time that the master builders who reap 50 or 60 per cent. profit on the houses they built should bear this burden or put it on to the price of the houses.  It is no longer going to be borne by the farmer who has nothing to gain from it.  It is sufficient for the farmers to pay the salaries of these gentlemen without having to supply them with hot and cold water as well.  The Minister should make this a national charge, so that portion of it will be borne by the gentlemen concerned.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the amendment and I am very glad that the Second Reading was postponed so as to give time for the proper consideration of the Bill and to enable the amendment to be brought forward. I think it was a very wise step.  I think the position of affairs as put forward to-day has absolutely justified the postponing of this Bill from November and has put the Minister in a very queer light in attempting to rush the Bill through without consideration in the hope that the House <Col N="80" /> would be duped and led astray and agree to it as an emergency measure at the tail end of the Session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement in the House as to the necessity for improving our sewerage.  There is also general agreement that the public health position, so far as the supply of fresh water is concerned, is not what we would like it to be.  What we have to consider is the best way and the most likely way of getting an improvement as soon as possible.  It seems to me that while the Minister's proposals are undoubtedly an improvement on the position, there are still very great delays and difficulties to be encountered before we can induce our public bodies as a whole to take that broad and long-sighted view of public health that we would like them to take.  That is why I have come to the conclusion that of the two methods suggested here the one contained in the amendment is the more likely to produce the results which we are all anxious to bring about.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins in supporting the proposals in the Bill seemed to lay a good deal of stress on the fact that these proposals were not mandatory on the county councils or boards of health.  That is a doubtful kind of advantage so far as I see because I have no great hope of the ordinary boards of health, who do not show any great interest in the position under the present system, taxing themselves for the public health services of their districts or areas or that they will be willing of themselves to strike a 1½d. or 3d. rate in order to speed up the institution of water-works schemes or a sewerage scheme in their area.  I have the feeling, even if this Bill is passed, that the number of boards of health who will take it on themselves to strike this rate inside any reasonable time will be very small indeed.</P>

    <P>Personally, if I were interested in a scheme I would not agree to go to the county council, composed as it might be of the men of the type of Deputy Corry, whose objections we have just heard stated here, and of many others who would put up that very type of objection that Deputy Corry has put <Col N="81" /> up.  The facts are that we will find a town or a village of 1,000 or 1,500 inhabitants or less, and everybody likely to get immediate benefit will be anxious to get a scheme of this kind through and to bear a reasonable share of the cost.  It would be impossible for them to bear it all.  But if you go outside that area somebody must come to their assistance, and which body is the most likely to come to their assistance and see that the scheme is carried out?  Is it the county council or the board of health on the one hand, or the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health on the other hand?  That is the way I look at it.  I take it that we can depend on whatever Minister for Public Health we have to take a broader and a longer view and to be more interested in the public health of the country than, on the whole, a county council is likely to be. That is why I would pin my faith in this matter to a central authority coming forward, and of being more desirous to come forward, to give the additional grant necessary over and above what the local body is willing to pay.  I would say, and I think there is nobody in the House but will agree with me, that it is more likely in any case that if the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has this power he will be more ready to provide the additional money required than the county councils would be which have to raise the money by striking a 1½d. or 3d. rate in the £.  Now this is a question of taxation or of local rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and so far as I am concerned it does not seem to me to make a great difference as to which pocket it comes out of, but we know there is that belief&mdash;it may be a foolish belief&mdash;that it is more equitable to raise general taxation than by simply making it a question of rates. In any case, there is no great argument in favour of county boundaries. They were drawn on very arbitrary lines, and they are there for hundreds and hundreds of years, and we do not know at this stage of our development what was the principle on which they <Col N="82" /> were drawn.  At any rate, it is not true that you can say a rate is equitable because it coincides with the county boundary.  I believe that money raised by taxation is for the benefit not alone of a particular area, but for the benefit of the whole community. The public health, as pointed out by previous speakers, cannot be said to be entirely a matter of purely local interest.  It is a matter of national interest, and as we are organised as a national entity, the whole national entity should be responsible.</P>
      <P>The time is coming when we must look at the question of public health in the same way as we look at questions of public education.  Local districts are not expected to pay for the education of the children of their own particular area.  I think, from the point of view of expediency and of getting the thing done that we are all anxious to get done, it is more likely to be done if whatever portion is required over and above the amount the local benefiting area can afford to pay is paid out of a central fund than by local taxation.  It is more likely to be done in that way than if left to the county councils.  The county councils in the past have not shown that they are particularly anxious to get this work done, and I have no hope that they are going to be much better in the future.  I think the time has come when we must face up to the problems of the improvement of public health services in this country.  I think if it came to be publicly recognised to the extent that it might be recognised that we are a food-producing country exporting food produce to other countries, it would be absolutely necessary for us to have more regard for our public health services than we have.</P>

      <P>There is agreement in this House as to the need for better sanitary accommodation in the towns and villages throughout the country, particularly in the inland counties.  I have from time to time advocated that this scheme should be treated on a national basis, such, for instance, as the trunk-road schemes were treated in the Saorstát.  This amendment aims at placing an equitable share of the cost on the taxpayers of the country as distinguished from the ratepayers.  We <Col N="83" /> are told that the farmers of the country pay eighty per cent. of the central taxation; it is only fair to ask the other 20 per cent. to bear their proportion of the cost for the improvement of the sanitation of the country towns. The other 20 per cent. are in many cases the section that benefits most from such schemes where they have been undertaken.  Deputy O'Higgins, speaking on this Bill, said that the position in future would be better than the position at the moment if this Bill becomes law.  I am not going to dispute that fact, but while we have the opportunity, and the opportunity presents itself to us now, we should make this Bill as good as it is possible to make it. I believe that we will make this Bill far better by embodying some principle such as that contained in the amendment. Deputy O'Connell has pointed out that the county councils have optional powers under this Bill, and so long as they have optional powers, I submit to the Minister that the position in regard to public health will be exactly the same as to-day.</P>
      <P>The various county boards of health throughout the country shelved the responsibility more or less.  They asked the county council for various grants to carry out these schemes. But in fact in every case the county councils have refused to pass the loans.  Now the county councils who have refused to ask for loans to carry out these schemes are not very likely to fall over one another in the carrying out of necessary improvements all over the country. Deputy O'Higgins said that a farmer living 22 miles away in a rural district is, at the present moment, paying the same as a man living in the town for the water supply of that town.  I think that does not fairly represent the position.  A farmer living 22 miles away may have to pay one penny in the £ and the man in the town may have to pay one penny in the £, but the man in the town may also have to pay a water rate which in many cases amounts to 2/- or 2/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that has not been mentioned <Col N="84" /> by any speaker is the effect of this matter on the tourist traffic.  I dare say everybody is anxious to develop the tourist traffic in this country as much as possible.  We are told that what militates against an increase in the volume of tourist traffic particularly in the South and West is that there are towns in the South and West that have not proper sanitary accommodation.  The encouragement of the tourist traffic and the bringing of visitors in great numbers into the country should be a concern of the Government.  If the tourist traffic, particularly in the South and West in this country, can be increased through the means of improved sanitation in our towns, it is obviously the duty of the Government to make a substantial contribution towards the solution of these problems.  To my mind there is no question whatever that if this Bill embodied some such principle as our amendment more schemes in the way of sanitation and waterworks will be carried through.  There is scarcely a Deputy in the House who has not been receiving resolutions from boards of health and county councils in connection with some sewerage scheme or other and requesting him to lead deputations to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Personally I have been asked dozens of times to accompany such deputations to ask for 50 per cent. of the cost of the proposed scheme.  This amendment proposes, I will not say to give 50 per cent. of the proposed scheme, but it proposes that some portion of the cost should be borne by the State.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that he was quite willing to advance 25 per cent. of the cost of the schemes at present.  He also told us that two or three years ago.  The Minister would very easily arrive at a suitable figure, considering that he has already been able to arrive at that figure of 25 per cent.  Then he has in his Department all the statistics necessary for making calculations.  He has got the valuations of the towns and the rural districts as well as the dispensary districts.  He has all this data at his disposal, data that I have not at the moment.  If the Minister supplied me with all the figures that he has I would be able to work it out in half an hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps longer than anyone else in this House I have been speaking about the absence of proper sanitary conditions in rural areas throughout the country and about the need for the improvement of the public health in this country. Up to the present there has been no attempt made to improve the sanitary conditions in a manner commensurate with the needs of the people.  Now there is an opportunity given to us to improve these conditions.  When there is a proposal put forward by means of which improvements will be effected we should examine the conditions very carefully before we throw any obstacles or objections in the way of those trying to make those improvements possible.  I came here to-day without having made up my mind.  I listened very carefully and with interest to the speeches made.  As far as I am concerned my own position is this, that I am very anxious to improve the public health conditions throughout the country. I do not care how these are improved. That is the position I occupy. On the other hand, I am faced with two proposals&mdash;one that the State bear a proportion&mdash;a proportion which has not been named.  Admittedly the proportion is extremely difficult to determine. On the other hand, the local people who are going to benefit by these works&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>That exactly is the point I was going to make.  In any conditions with which I am familiar and in any services with the running of which I am familiar, my experience is that the cost of services that are run largely by the State is immeasurably greater than the cost of <Col N="87" /> those services for which the local people are responsible.</P>
      <P>I took a very strong attitude with regard to another matter in connection with the hospitals that are run by the State.  I showed on that occasion that the cost of these hospitals was practically double the cost of an hospital run by local voluntary contributions.  I am not going to dwell on that.  What I do feel is that the proposals put forward by the Minister are very much more likely to give an efficient service at a much less rate than if the State agreed to pay even half the amount. I think if the State agrees to pay half the amount that there will be a tremendous cost to the country, because, as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, one does not care very much what pocket the money comes out of when eventually it will come out of the pockets of the people.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, has put forward a very fair scheme under which those who will benefit most will pay most and those who will benefit little will pay little.  Where the whole country is going to get benefit from the scheme they may subscribe. I think the only point on which I would agree is that we should insist that the county council should give a certain yearly contribution.  As has been pointed out, if there are only one or two areas to benefit it may only mean a ninth or an eighth of a penny in the £.  Where there are fifteen or twenty areas to benefit then 3d. in the £ may be necessary.  If an entire county benefits or if twenty areas benefit it is not a very large amount.</P>
      <P>Having come with an open mind and listened to the arguments put forward, I have come to the conclusion that the Minister's scheme, from my point of view, will be a much less costly affair than if the amendment were carried and the State were going to pay half the rate. For that reason, I am going to support the second reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions here I advocated some form of scheme to improve the sanitary conditions of <Col N="88" /> a number of towns.  Amongst the towns I mentioned in the constituency of Meath is the one referred to by the Minister for Local Government, that is the town of Oldcastle. A peculiar position, to my mind, arises not alone with the administration of this scheme but with the administration of most schemes, because farmers believe that the Minister for Local Government is very adept at putting forward schemes, sometimes compulsory, which the local representatives have to administer, and, worse still, for which they have to raise the money.</P>
      <P>Another form suggested was something on the lines of the Arterial Drainage Act.  That, of course, has not been a success, and one of the reasons why it has not been a success and cannot be is because local authorities have already too much to do and more than they can attend to. As most of you know, Oldcastle is on the very edge of Meath.  In fact the town of Oldcastle is almost entirely supported from the County of Cavan, which is a much more businesslike county than the County of Meath.  The fact of the matter is that they have made Oldcastle a really good town.  The poor law valuation of Oldcastle is extremely low and the poor law valuation of the country around Oldcastle is extremely high, with the result that I believe a penny in the £ in Oldcastle&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;would come to about £7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing about Oldcastle is that it is the centre of a great fishing industry.  Loughsheelan, a famous lake for fishing, is situated close to Oldcastle.  The Blackwater is not far distant and the lake at Virginia in Co. Cavan is not far distant, with the result that Oldcastle is a great centre for fishing.  That brings rather a good revenue to the town.  Not alone that but Oldcastle is the centre of distribution for a great quantity of foreign goods that come through the City of Dublin.  Any day you will see twenty or thirty motor cars distributing foreign goods in that town and to other towns around it.  The result of the Minister's proposal evidently would be that if a rate was <Col N="89" /> levied on the county the County Meath would be paying for a drainage scheme and water scheme in the town of Oldcastle and any benefits that might go to the farmers would go to the farmers of County Cavan. Of course they might be able to restrict it and compel the dispensary district to do it, but the question that has always to be considered is when these schemes are proposed and the question of levying the charges is raised, can the people of that district or can the ratepayers of, say, Co. Meath afford any more?  I attended a meeting of the Farmers' Union the other day and I left with the impression that they could not possibly pay anything.  I can water that down a little bit.  I expect they can pay something but it is a very doubtful point that they would be able to bear the burden of this scheme with content because if they are not really able to bear it there is hardly a doubt about it that they will put up a stiff resistance.  I do not think I can even agree with Deputy O'Higgins that there are some hopes of this being a success or that there will be some improvement in a year or two. I do not think we ought to set out that way at all.  There is not much use in starting on the expectation that we ought to have some little improvement.  In a thing like that I think very definite steps ought to be taken that some permanent improvement will occur.  After all this question of public health is a sort of battle.  It is certainly preventative. I think that ought to be the policy of the Minister for Local Government, instead of attempting to cure disease after it has arisen.  I think his policy ought to be to prevent it at the source.  As far as the apportioning of the money is concerned I do not see that there can be any extraordinary difficulty about it because people will not be compelled to accept all the schemes.  They will be only compelled to accept schemes that are obviously a necessity and that would be a national benefit.  I do not believe for one moment that the expenses would be any more than the county council would be able to bear. I am quite sure that in the way the <Col N="90" /> amendment proposes it would be cheaper, and it certainly would be done more quickly.  I cannot agree with Deputy O'Higgins that there are even hopes of a success because especially in the times in which we are living I do not think the farmers will tolerate any more burdens being imposed on them.  They are in expectation that they are on the eve of de-rating.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed is in itself a form of de-rating.  I do not expect, of course, that the House will accept it.  The House will accept the Bill which the Minister is supporting.</P>

      <P>(Clare): Not being an income taxpayer, I do not object to taking money out of a certain pocket so long as it is not taken out of the local pocket.  Some of this money will come from income tax rather than from local rates.  I would say a word on behalf of the much-abused county councils.  I do not believe that county councils are such terrible bodies as we are told they are, or that they are likely to turn down schemes which people are able to bear. The county councils are in constant contact with the people of the various areas, and they know what these people are able to bear.  I do not think that we should throw so much dirty water upon the county councils as we are inclined to do.  If they will not put schemes into operation, and will not strike a threepenny or three-half-penny rate, it is because they know that in the first instance a threepenny rate could not be borne by a great many ratepayers, and they would also understand clearly that a three-halfpenny rate would do very little in the way of supplying good sanitation and water schemes for unurbanised districts.  In the average county a rate of 1½d. would realise about £2,500.  That would pay interest <Col N="91" /> probably on £40,000 or £50,000, but what would such sum do in a county? There might be twenty or thirty towns requiring a water supply or sewerage scheme.  Is it going to be done in a proper fashion with such a sum?  Is it going to be made fool-proof?  Is it going to create a situation in which you will not have centres of contamination where an outbreak of diphtheria or fever might originate? Is it going to provide sufficient schemes for each county?</P>

      <P>The Minister realises that a grant of 5 per cent. on £50,000 would not be sufficient to provide sewerage and water schemes in counties where you have twenty or thirty towns to attend to.  What towns are you going to leave out?  You might leave out a centre where contamination and epidemics might start.  After all, you cannot reduce national health to local considerations.  If there is any real basis for the argument for charges for sanitation and sewerage schemes it surely is in order to preserve national health.  You may localise the charge but you cannot localise the effect of an outbreak of fever or diphtheria.  That is the principal objection which I have <Col N="92" /> to the Bill.  The two objections which I see to the Bill are these: First of all, the amount of money which you are going to raise in order to help the smaller districts will not be sufficient to enable all the small towns and villages to get adequate sewerage and water schemes.  The places which you will leave untouched and unattended are perhaps the places where contamination will start.  Then you are simply leaving areas without attending to the matter properly.  The proper way is to make it a national charge and to see that all districts are dealt with in a proper and complete fashion. Moreover, you are localising the national position.  Improvement in sanitation and water supplies is a national concern, but you are making it a local charge.  These are the main reasons why I oppose the Bill and support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins referred to the attitude of members on this side of the House in refusing to give to local authorities further powers.  So far as our experience goes the only extra powers that we ever saw the Minister prepared to give to local bodies were further powers to increase the rates on those who are unable to bear any further burden.  The Minister's attitude is like this: He asks the farmers to take a certain amount of responsibility for the provision of sewerage or water schemes and, at the same time, he sends an order to the county councils that they are not to strike a rate or spend any money on improving the conditions under which the farmers themselves live.  He says to the county councils: &ldquo;You can strike a rate for the purpose of having water supplies and sewerage schemes in certain towns.&rdquo;  If, however, that council decide to spend money on certain byroads he immediately surcharges them. That is the sort of power which we have seen the Minister and the whole Cumann na nGaedheal Party give to local authorities.  That is the sort of power that they do not want.  Deputy Sir James Craig said that he was prepared to accept the Bill as introduced by the Minister as against our amendment. He said that we did not or <Col N="93" /> could not define the proportion of the amount for which the State would be liable, but surely he must know that it would be impossible to define that amount until an inquiry was held and until it was ascertained what the people who would be directly benefited as a result of the scheme would be able to pay.</P>

      <P>That is so.  There is no point in that at all, because, as Deputy de Valera points out, it is not defined in the Bill any more than in the amendment. There is just one question we have got to ask ourselves.  Do we want to see public health conditions improved or do we not?  If we do, which of these two methods is the better?  If we want to get a proper answer to that question I think everybody will agree that our method of getting a solution to this difficulty is the only one.  Just as the Minister in his legislation regarding drainage tried to give it out that he had given powers to these local councils, and that it was their responsibility now to go ahead with the work, he tries to create a similar impression now.  It is all camouflage, like the other legislation passed by his Department. It is simply an effort to go to the country and say: &ldquo;I gave them the necessary legislation and it is for the local people to implement it.&rdquo;  If we want to see these conditions improved, I say that those who approach the matter in the way in which we approach it will agree that ours is the only solution for the problem.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what limits has he attached to this question of improved sanitary conditions.  Is a town defined by a certain population, by a certain number of houses, or is it open to any district in any part of the county that may put forward a reasonable scheme for sanitary improvements to have its case considered by the county council and dealt with if that body is satisfied that such facilities are required?  Speaking generally on the Bill, I can thoroughly agree with Deputy Smith when he says that this is <Col N="94" /> an effort on the part of the Minister to deal with the question by washing his hands of it in a very ineffective way. To ask the county council at the present time to strike a rate for the improvement of sanitary conditions in towns, as towns are generally understood in the country, is asking them to do the impossible.  Any Deputy who is a member of a public board realises the great difficulty and how many unsuccessful attempts have been made to get the county council to strike a rate, in some cases for the improvement of their own industrial interests. To ask them under present conditions to strike a rate for the improvement of sanitary conditions is unquestionably asking them for something which we know in advance they will not concede.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine to imagine that they will, and that by imposing a graduated rate, ranging in extent from those who immediately benefit in accordance with the proximity of the ratepayers to the area which benefits, you will get them to agree.  It is all very well to imagine that, but in reality we who live in the country know that the average farmer has a very indifferent right of way to his house.  He must travel under very unsatisfactory conditions over that right of way to get to the country road in bad weather, with, perhaps, wet feet.  He has to do all that under very unhealthy conditions, and we can understand the mentality of that man when he says: &ldquo;It is absurd to ask me to contribute to a sewerage scheme or to a water supply for the people who live in the town and who undoubtedly enjoy greater facilities than I and my family do.&rdquo;  What will be the position of the farmer who has to send his children trudging over the muddy country roads to a school where 40 or 80 children are assembled and where practically no sanitary arrangements exist?  Would it not be a much more reasonable proposition to suggest that a rate should be struck to provide these children with facilities to get over these dirty roads other than by tramping them on foot, to provide them with proper facilities in school and with some form of a meal while they are there, or to provide them with some sanitary arrangements that would <Col N="95" /> be an improvement on the very primitive conditions that now exist in most of these places?</P>
    <P>Under these conditions, as the Minister must know, his present proposal is absurd.  As Deputy Smith had stated, it is merely an attempt to hand the responsibility over to the local boards so that he can say that he gave them power when he knows very well that they will not be in a position to deal with them.  Since the Minister took up office he has spent all his energy in centralising authority.  He has deprived public boards of the right to make ordinary appointments in the way of officers whom these boards may require.  He has deprived them of the right of contracting in the ordinary way for the supply of clothes and other articles for the institutions under their control.  He has centralised these institutions, and he knows it has not proved satisfactory.  Notwithstanding all that, he advocates centralisation, which undoubtedly means a reduction of the powers of development in country towns.  On this one question alone, and it is a vital question, it is rather strange that he should depart from the idea of centralisation which he adopted so strenuously and go back to the other method of decentralisation, handing back to the local authorities the power of which he deprived them in regard to other services on which they might function. Clearly the Minister is not sincere in this effort.  The only practical solution of the problem is contained in the amendment proposed and advocated from those benches.  That is, if there is a grievance it is a national grievance, and it should be dealt with in a national way.</P>

      <P>It is certainly very interesting to see the Cumann na nGaedheal members and their loyal supporters, the Independent members, searching for some sort of excuse to vote against the amendment introduced by Deputy de Valera.  Deputy Sir James Craig from Trinity told us how interested he was in public health and how he had fought for it all his life. Then Deputy O'Higgins told us the same thing and opposed the amendment <Col N="96" /> on the grounds that we wanted to keep the power out of the hands of the county council.  Deputy Carey said he would be against this Bill if it meant putting a rate for more than a year on the area not directly benefited. Then, lest he might find out in the course of the discussion that the Bill was going to put a rate for many years on the areas outside that directly benefited, he left the House.  It is a pity Deputy Craig did not remain also to listen to the debate.  He might have discovered the attitude of people throughout the country towards the Bill and towards taxation for local improvements.  Deputy Craig may theorise in Trinity College about increasing sewerage schemes and putting additional water supplies into towns, but it all boils down to the question as to how it is to be done.  We know that for many years, because farmers and others who did not benefit directly had to pay, they used their influence to hold up such improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Government stand for centralising authority, but they always try to decentralise the collection of taxes.  They tell the local county council whom to appoint, and use the jack-boot to kick people into the appointments, but when it comes to the payment of these officials they see that their friends, the high income tax payers, and others are not called upon to pay.  We want to give authority to the county council, and want to put them in a position to do what they should do.  We propose that the local bodies would run the schemes, and that over and above what the people directly benefited would pay the central authority should pay.  If we want to see these schemes put through, that must be the system adopted.  The Ministers, of course, want to continue the old system they used when they sent Deputy O'Higgins down to County Meath and forced the County Council to give him his thousand a year.  When he draws up the schemes he knows perfectly well they cannot be put into operation by the local ratepayers.  It was most amusing to hear Deputy O'Higgins talking about our amendment going to take power out of the hands of the county councils.  The county councils unfortunately had not <Col N="97" /> the power to reject Deputy Dr. O'Higgins or people like him who were foisted on them, and they had to pay them.  We want to relieve the county councils of the burden of paying the sums that are necessary in addition to what the local people can pay for those schemes, and there has been no case made against it.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Craig knows anything about any part of the country, and if he is sincere in his statement that he wants to see sewerage schemes and waterworks gone on with, he will vote for our amendment.  In Co. Louth alone, one of the smallest counties in the country, there are at least 12 towns and villages that want sewerage and water schemes, and the 3d. rate all over the county, together with what the local towns could bear, would not be sufficient to go ahead with these things in any reasonable time.  It might do it over a period of 100 years, but we want to see it done right away and to see these areas get the sewerage schemes and the waterworks which they require.  It will be necessary for the Government to step in and help the local authority.  They prate all round the country about our credit being high, but when it comes to seeing that credit is used for the benefit of the local people they are very backward in utilising it along those ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to this Bill.  I do so from my experience in the Mayo County Council.  The Minister has taken up a sneering attitude with regard to the proposal of Deputy de Valera in making a large proportion of the charge a national responsibility.  He has asked in a rather sneering fashion what the cost of the national liability might be.  I am sure the Minister is not so ignorant as not to be aware of how the Drainage Acts and certain proposed drainage schemes are being affected by a proposal similar to that contained in this Bill.  Deputy O'Connell will agree with me when I say that some very desirable drainage schemes in the County Mayo had to be dropped owing to the very fact that it was impossible to get the County Council to give the necessary guarantee from the <Col N="98" /> county funds.  That is the very motive that will affect all those proposed public health schemes, the reluctance of people who are not directly benefiting to contribute to schemes from which they do not benefit.  The Minister now proposes to stabilise this position and he asks us for an estimate of the possible national liability if our amendment is accepted.  The very reason why we could not agree as members of the Mayo County Council to accept proposals that there should be contribution from the county at large for such schemes is that, up to the present, we could not estimate our liability, because the liability would really be governed by the precedent of giving a contribution for any specific scheme.  Immediately we pay for one every other area in the whole county will begin making their demand and we could not know where we would stop.</P>

      <P>The Minister has an example of what was done with the Road Fund.  That money was capitalised and the money borrowed spent on a road scheme.  I see no difficulty why some such scheme could not be found to finance those projects.  As Deputy Smith pointed out, this Bill is going to get us no further.  If the Bill passes, the position this time three years is going to be the same as to-day.  Local influences and <Col N="99" /> jealousy will still work.  The total amount&mdash;I am giving a rough estimate&mdash;that could be got from a rate of 3d. in Mayo is £4,000 or £5,000. It is quite possible that the charges for necessary and urgent public health schemes in the County Mayo would be a lot greater than £5,000 a year.  I am not going to say they would; neither am I going to say they would not.  The Minister as has been pointed out has left it optional to the county council which produces the situation which exists at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand I know of schemes at present being discussed in the Co. Mayo in which it is being considered if left to the area of charge it will mean 5/- or 6/- in the £.  Does the Minister realise what that means in small towns where there are a lot of labourers whose maximum wage may be only 25/- a week?  They are probably paying 5/- a week rent for houses.  Is the landlord going to pay that additional 5/-in the £ valuation for their benefit, or is he going to increase the rents and how are they going to pay out of their low wage?  If the Minister wants those projects to be undertaken and to go ahead there is only one way of doing it and that is by the manner by which the Road Fund was handled, making it in some ways a national charge, getting that money from people who would directly benefit and putting the incidence of that taxation on the people who would get the greatest benefit, the wealthiest classes in those small towns.  Oftentimes the people who agitate most for those schemes are the wealthy shopkeepers in the main streets.  We all realise that in most cases the schemes are necessary and urgent but those people often ignore the poorer classes in the locality and they create sometimes an artificial public opinion in favour of certain projects.  They do not consider the charges which may fall on people who will scarcely get any benefit out of the schemes as long as they get what they consider necessary luxuries themselves.  I again repeat if the Minister wants the projects to be undertaken and to go ahead, he <Col N="100" /> will in some way provide a substantial national contribution that will prevent an undue burden being placed on the poorer classes and especially on the people who do not benefit directly from these schemes. If he does not there is going to be no development.</P>

      <P>Deputies who spoke against this Bill have apparently formed the opinion that local authorities will act in the future as they did in the past.  Even Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Walsh were of that opinion.  Local authorities could not give any contribution towards sewerage and water schemes in the past. Under this Bill local authorities can do so, and they can widen and extend the area of charge.  I think it is not fair to assume that these local authorities will adopt the same attitude in the future as they did in the past.  The circumstances are entirely different; and if this Bill is passed I think it is most unfair that Deputies should really advise local authorities not to accept it.  It remains with the local authorities to work it or not.  We heard a good deal of grousing in this House year after year about the insanitary condition of our towns and villages.  I always notice that where there is a big and troublesome problem to be tackled, just as this is, the cry from the Opposition&mdash;and it certainly is a very popular cry for the Opposition&mdash;is, &ldquo;Make it a national charge.&rdquo;  Three or four years ago when a Relief Vote was being passed in this House for the provision of sewerage and water schemes in the smaller towns, I think the Minister was prepared to contribute one-fifth of the total cost.  I am aware that schemes were not carried out then because the areas of charge were too small and the local authorities could not give a sufficient contribution.  A rate of 1½d. in the £ will mean about £3,000 in one year in County Galway. We have to look at the other side of the question, however.  We hear so much of disease breaking out in small towns for want of water supplies or sewerage schemes.  We also know what the cost of fever outbreaks in these small towns comes to, and I am sure <Col N="101" /> the Minister will be able to give us the figures showing how this cost falls on the rural population in order to cope with the disease.  We know what it costs to maintain patients in the fever and central hospitals in the different counties, and that most of the expense has to be borne by the farmers.  We know that the farmers have been hard hit, but in considering this Bill we must look at what they have to pay when outbreaks of fever occur in small towns.  I think if that expense was put up against the contribution to be given towards these schemes by local authorities there would be very little difference.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed it will certainly give local authorities a chance of doing what they have been trying to do.  It is not fair to say here that local authorities have not made every effort to provide water supplies and sewerage schemes.  They have done so, but they had not the power, and they could not get the people to pay a rate in order to proceed.  It is only fair to give local authorities a chance of deciding what they are prepared to do under this Bill.  It is easy to say that the cost of this Bill should be made a State charge.  If we take all the money that has been provided, even under relief grants for sewerage schemes and water supplies, it will be found that the general taxpayer is paying a fairly large amount of the cost.  I would ask the House not to accept the amendment, because it is not fair that the local authorities should not get a chance of dealing with any schemes that might be promoted under the Bill.  I believe that the local charges will not be very much more than 1½d., and in Galway that amount will realise £3,000 in one year.  I believe that in any one year, half of that amount would not be required to help such schemes.</P>

      <P>When local schemes are under consideration, and when certain aristocrats in the towns have to be considered, the Deputy would much prefer saddling the expense on the people living around the town, generally the poor people, and making them pay rather than have the richer classes paying their due share and doing something to remedy a very great national evil.  I would like to hear from Deputy Brodrick and from other Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches something against this amendment. Why is it that the amendment is less acceptable to them than the futile proposal of the Minister?  One of the big lessons learned here&mdash;certainly by Deputies on these benches&mdash;was the gigantic failure of the Arterial Drainage Act.  When that Act was being passed we were told that great things were going to be done and drainage schemes carried out in every county. because of the powers given to the local committees and the county councils.  The Minister or Deputy Brodrick cannot get up to-day and point to a single scheme of any value that was carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act.  Here is the very same thing.</P>

      <P>The same method is being attempted by the Minister in connection with this matter.  He proposes to give the county councils certain powers, and pretends that the way is open to them to carry out these schemes.  I would prefer that Deputies would criticise our amendment.  Perhaps there is a weakness in it, and we <Col N="103" /> would like to have it pointed out. Neither the Minister nor Deputies have attempted to point out any weak point in it.  Deputy Sir James Craig said he was opposed to the amendment, but his only reason was that anything was better than nothing at all, and that any improvement on the present Act would be a good thing. Deputy O'Higgins said the same thing.  Our attitude is that this is no better than the present system.  If this great national evil is to be remedied it is better to do it in the right way from the start, rather than be patching up a very bad scheme afterwards. You will find it more expensive to carry out schemes of this kind in this way than by tackling the question as a big national problem as was suggested when the question of arterial drainage was being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident, from my knowledge of localities in Mayo, that people living adjacent to small towns would be victimised to a great extent under the Bill introduced by the Minister.  If it is just, as the Minister pretends, to think of putting the burden of the upkeep or the carrying out of a sewerage scheme in a local town on the people who live adjacent to that town and who get no benefit from it, it is equally just to make it a national charge.  I am sure that very great assistance would be given to the Minister by the members on these benches and on the Labour Benches if he tackled this matter in a big national way, and then something would be done.  Under these proposals you will find in three years' time that fewer water and sewerage schemes have been carried out than in the past under existing circumstances. We were attacked when we opposed the Second Reading of this Bill before the adjournment, and the Minister and the President argued that we were holding up the Relief Vote by preventing the Bill being passed to enable the county councils to carry out such schemes.  You will find if you pass this Bill in spite of our opposition, that very few schemes will be adopted by the local bodies under the Bill, and that no appreciable amount of relief work will be given, because the local bodies are not fools, even though the <Col N="104" /> Minister thinks they are, and they will not accept a scheme of this kind.</P>
    <P>You will always have local jealousy as some Deputy said.  I am probably going to make an unpopular statement when I say that I consider that even the people's prejudices should be respected at times.  In certain localities you will find schemes being opposed because of local prejudices and jealousies due to the cost being unfairly put upon some people, while others who will get the benefit of these schemes will not be asked to pay their due share as compared with those who get no benefit.  You will find those prejudices preventing the schemes being carried out as happened under the Arterial Drainage Act. The Minister will argue that the County Councils have power to do it themselves; that if the local towns do not want sewerage schemes carried out they will have themselves to blame; that the boards of health have to sanction the schemes and that the Minister only comes in later to accept or reject the schemes.</P>
    <P>What is to happen if you pass this Bill and give these powers in cases where you have no county council? What is to happen in a case like Mayo where you have the Minister's. &ldquo;rubber stamp&rdquo; administering the affairs of the county?  Who is to decide whether schemes are to be carried out?  Will influential people in certain towns bring influence to bear on the Minister's &ldquo;rubber stamp,&rdquo; to have certain schemes accepted and the cost put on the local people who will get no benefit?  Are those schemes to be carried out against the opposition of the local people?  Perhaps the Minister will continue his jack-boot policy and abolish a number of other councils and then he will have his &ldquo;rubber stamp&rdquo; in counties where schemes are to be carried out to suit the aristocrats and the rich people in the towns at the expense of the poor.  We are opposed to that and we propose a more just and a better method, and that is that the question be taken up in a national way.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies should realise that that is the proper way to tackle this question and should accept the amendment and they <Col N="105" /> will find that more work will be done and that there will be co-operation amongst Deputies to make this scheme a success.</P>

      <P>They attributed the amendment to Deputy de Valera. There was no mention made of Deputy O'Kelly.  The House was led to believe that these Deputies never gave the slightest consideration to the Bill.  The most extraordinary feature about it is that they have not even read the amendment and they proceed to dictate the ways and means by which those schemes should be carried out and how the expenses should be defrayed. The only conclusion I can come to is that just because Deputy de Valera proposed this amendment in the absence of Deputy O'Kelly they thought it was all right.  The Bill as introduced is a proper Bill.  If a county or a town benefit by a water scheme or a drainage scheme the local authority should be made responsible and have some liability for the money expended.  It would be delightful, of course, if Deputies could go back to the county councils and urban councils and tell them that they had extracted a sum of money from the Exchequer to be expended ad lib at the sweet will of Deputy Smith, or Deputy Maguire, or Deputy Aiken, in any way they liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a responsibility to everyone in it.  The county councils and the urban councils are responsible to those whom they represent.  They must discharge their duty in the way that they think fit and proper and get full value for the money and for every pound of their expenditure, but if the money is to be a grant or contribution from the State or the Exchequer we know very well where it will go.  The <Col N="106" /> Government that would hand over the entire sum, or 75 per cent. of the sum, necessary for the carrying out of such schemes would not get value for their money.  I happen to be a member of one of those councils, and I am not under any misapprchension as to the expenditure by the county council, and when it comes to placing responsibility on the county councils and the urban councils and making them liable for certain sums of money they expend they certainly will see that they get the best value for the money so spent.</P>
    <P>The only other feature I see about this amendment is that those interested in it expect one of those days the report of the De-rating Commission. It would appear to me that this amendment is a sort of counterblast to the report anticipated from the De-rating Commission.  It would seem to say to the farmers, &ldquo;You are not going to have it all your own way; we must get some of the spoils: you cannot have it both ways.&rdquo;  The farmers cannot have de-rating of agricultural land unless the cost of this is extracted from the sums to be recommended for de-rating.  I do not know what sums are to be recommended or whether there will be any sum or not.  This is a counterblast.  In general, we find where grants are given we do not always get the full value.  I know if Deputies on the other side had given consideration to this matter they would not have gone so far as to attack this Bill in the manner they have done. They should consider it from the point of view of the country in general, and that it is universal in this that it attempts to improve the conditions throughout the country and to make them better than they are, and to get the county councils and the urban councils and the sanitary authorities responsible for these schemes interested, in so much as they are contributing bodies as well as the parties directly interested.</P>
    <P>We all know that throughout the country there is great need for water and sewerage schemes and all that. But at the present moment I do not think the Government should be forced along lines of embarking on very large projects that would involve the country <Col N="107" /> in extraordinary cost and expense. The Government have proceeded along lines infinitely in advance of anything the people of this country ever expected. They have reached a stage in providing housing for the people of this country that was not expected to be reached for the next twenty years, and the national purse and the ratepayers and the people of the country generally have to find the money necessary no matter in what form it was subscribed.  That is the initial stage in which the money must be got.  There is no other means of getting it.</P>
    <P>What the Minister ought to do in these matters is that if schemes are put up they should be investigated, and I am sure they are investigated. He should see the necessity for them and provide schemes in accordance with the requirements of any particular area, and so far as the ability of that particular area goes to pay for such schemes.  But the elaborate schemes which some people have in mind to be provided, out of national funds, are not needed in this country for some time.  We must proceed on moderate lines for a few years to come. and I think we will be able to persevere as a healthy nation with minor schemes without embarking on the great wholesale schemes which we are asked to undertake in the near future. We know it is highly desirable to have efficient water supplies and proper sewerage schemes throughout the country, but we know that people must cut their cloth according to their measure.  It would be highly desirable if people could live in modern houses with all modern requirements, with arrangements for baths, elaborate ranges and lighting if they could afford it.  Most people cannot afford to do it.  People must cut their cloth according to their measure and make provision according to their means.  If grandiose schemes are embarked on with the aid of the ratepayers and taxpayers' money, it will be found that this country cannot stand it.  There are many requirements by local authorities from time to time, some of them very elaborate, but the country is not in a position to pay for enormous <Col N="108" /> schemes or the requirements necessary to bring us actually up to date.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have sufficient material to go on with, and all the essentials required and make the county councils and the urban councils and the contributing bodies responsible for their share in the expenditure.  If there is a State grant available for such work well and good; there should be reasonable contribution from it. This amendment is not worthy of the occasion.  It is a very large proposition. The change sought here would require much more consideration than could be given to it by an amendment of this nature to this Bill.  It would involve many thousands, probably some millions of money, if an amendment of this character were adopted.  It is not at all a proposal worthy of consideration. I cannot see anything in it except that it is a counterblast to something else.  I trust that the House, having regard to the fact that those who propose this amendment do not seem to have read the Bill or the amendment, will reject the amendment if it comes to a division.</P>

      <P>After the contradictory remarks of Deputy Connolly I should like to remind him that at least three Deputies referred to the amendment which was actually introduced by Deputy de Valera in the unavoidable absence of Deputy O'Kelly.  The House may not have had the advantage of the presence of Deputy Connolly when that matter was being discussed. The Deputy said rightly whether they were taxes or rates that were paid for such schemes they came out of the pockets of the people.  The Deputy proceeded to tell us that our amendment was absolutely unworthy because it entailed the expenditure of thousands of pounds.  I do not see exactly how that is consistent.  The amendment apparently was not read by the Deputy, because it would not, to use his own words, force the Government along lines involving thousands of pounds.  It would not force them anywhere.  The final word would be with the Minister.  The Deputy said this was a matter that required grave consideration.  Certainly, and because it requires greater consideration <Col N="109" /> than has apparently been given to it by either the Deputy or the Minister we ask that the Bill should not get a Second Reading and that our amendment should be given consideration. The thing is not a counterblast to de-rating or anything else.</P>
      <P>Because we genuinely believe that the Minister's measure will not work and that the schemes will not be carried out we are proposing this amendment.  We genuinely believe that the Bill will not work.  Deputy Brodrick referred to the county councils and said that they should be given a chance.  The Deputies on the other side are now great advocates of the county councils but not in the making of appointments.  It is only in the matter of spending the money that they are prepared to leave the county councils any power.  They will let the county councils tax themselves. If Deputy Brodrick knows the temper of the ratepayers of Galway or the farmers of Galway he will realise that the chance of getting schemes there carried through is very small at present.  Any Minister or Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy who has been out recently at meetings or conventions and who will genuinely report here what has been said to him, will agree that the chance of getting money passed by the county councils for sewerage or water schemes is very slight indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise with Deputy Connolly that it is the people who will have to pay in any case, but we consider that the fairest distribution of the burden in providing sewerage or waterworks is by making of it a national charge. Deputy Sir James Craig says that we do not fix the amount under the amendment.  Neither does the Bill. These things are fixed at an inquiry. An inquiry is held, and at that inquiry the charges are fixed.  That would be the position under the amendment just as it is under the Bill.  I wonder what is going to happen where the county council's affairs are being worked by Commissioners.  Is the Commissioner to have thirty votes?  If the council has so many votes one way, is he to have so many votes the other way?  Or is he just to decide that the county is <Col N="110" /> going to have water schemes and put it on the rates in spite of what the people may think?  There should be provision in the Bill as to what is to happen where a county has a Commissioner. The country is likely to have more Commissioners.  I believe Galway is in danger of having a Commissioner. Deputy Sir James Craig said that the schemes run by the Government are more expensive than schemes run by local bodies.  What is to prevent these schemes being run locally?  Nothing.  A town wants a sewerage or a waterworks scheme.  The public health authorities will have something to say to these.  An inquiry will be held, and the works will be supervised by the engineers from the Board of Works.  It will not mean that the contractor and his men and the inspectors will come down from Dublin. The work will be done locally with supervision by a Government Department, and I think you are much more likely to get these things that are necessary for the public health well done in that way, and it will not be more expensive to the councils.  It would be a fairer method of distributing the burden to have the amendment passed.  If the amendment is adopted and a new Bill brought in, it would be better for the public health than to pass this Bill as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBoland" hpid="Mr. P. Boland Mr. P. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is of such a nature that no amendment except the amendment moved by Deputy de Valera would be of any use.  The Bill is such that it cannot be amended in Committee to embody the proposal foreshadowed in the amendment.  The amendment is the only alternative to the Bill, and I think the Minister would be well advised to withdraw the Bill and have its proposals reexamined. It is quite possible that the Minister for Finance, with the assistance of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Works, could draft a scheme so as to have the finances something on the same lines more or less as in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  In some counties that Act has worked fairly well, but in other counties it has not worked at all.  In any case, the finances of the Arterial Drainage Act are set out in such a way <Col N="111" /> as to include a State contribution up to 50 per cent., with contributions from the local council, say, up to 20 per cent., and the remainder to be derayed by the area benefited.  That is one suggestion that might meet the situation.  In any case, the Bill is absolutely hopeless as it stands.  In view of recent legislation in this House it is clear that the rates will be increased by an amount of from 2d. to 4d. in the £ this year.  The rates will be increased by the Vocational Education Act, and the Agriculture Bill now before the House will also increase the rates.  Then there are other charges for diseases of animals.  Owing to these causes the local authorities will shoulder heavier burdens this year than they did in recent years.  When introduced in the last session this Bill was a purely emergency measure in connection with the Unemployment Relief Vote.  It was presumed on that occasion that portion of £300,000 passed by this House for the relief of unemployment would go to finance schemes of this nature.  When we have finished with that £300,000&mdash;and I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries has said that he has almost disposed of it already&mdash;where are we going to get the money afterwards?  The Party at this side of the House has been criticised by the Minister and the President for not allowing the Bill to pass on the last occasion, overlooking the fact that it is purely a retrospective measure and that it covers anything that has been done within the financial year.  Therefore, there should have been no excitement about it on that occasion.  Even in the interval I do not think that it received the consideration from the Minister's Department nor from the Deputies on the other side of the House that it should. The Bill, in any opinion, is a non-partisan measure.  With the solitary exception of some of the Minister's supporters the Bill has been treated as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise the Minister strongly. even at this stage, to indicate what measure of grant the Minister's De partment will give in aid of these schemes &mdash; what is expected of the <Col N="112" /> local authorities and how much the people directly benefited are to meet-These are points that I would like to have cleared up.  There is absolutely no use in a measure dependent upon relief schemes or upon unemployment schemes that may be introduced from time to time.  The finances of the measure should be definite, and there should be so much voted by this House and not be depending on the unemployment problem in the country.  The national health problem is quite another problem in itself.  It would not be right to say that a town should wait for a sewerage scheme or a waterworks scheme until there is unemployment in that town.  A measure of sanitation should not depend on unemployment. The Bill does not meet the necessities of the times.  It does not accord with the views or wishes of the local authorities.  If it is such a measure as can be amended it is worth our while to amend it.</P>
    <P>It has been complained of in the country, and it has been more or less a genuine complaint, that legislation passed in this House has been rushed to such an extent that we find in its administration afterwards grave defects. It would have been a good thing if when the Local Officers and Employees Bill was going through this House in 1926 it met with the criticism that this Bill has met with.  It would have saved the Minister for Local Government from some of the disabilities under which has Department labours as a result of that measure.</P>
    <P>The only effective amendment is to reject the Bill as it stands and have a Bill introduced that will embody the proposals that this amendment foreshadows. I see no special virtue in the Bill as it stands, and the amendment is the only effective amendment that could be made at this stage by a private member.  It has been stated that the amendment does not specify the amount.  No Deputy of this House other than a Minister could state the amount, and, therefore, the amendment is the only possible alternative, and I would ask the House to vote for it in preference to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A special reference has been made here to the failure <Col N="113" /> of the Minor Schemes Drainage Act. I would like to say a word about it as illustrative of the position that is before us.  Two Deputies from County Mayo have pointed out that the Act put a class of work as a responsibility on local bodies and that they are not carrying out that work, that in Mayo particularly minor drainage schemes have come before the county council and that they have been turned down by the county council.  I understand the suggestion from the two Deputies who have spoken is that these minor drainage schemes were good schemes that ought to have been carried out. I wonder if I am mistaken in that view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am trying to understand what the Deputies ment by saying that schemes of drainage were turned down by the county council and that it ought to have been the responsibility of the central Government to go ahead with them.  I am trying to find out whether or not they were turned down in spite of the fact that they were good schemes, because there is no point in referring to the matter unless that is so.  So I have assumed that the Deputies who have spoken are complaining that because a certain thing was the responsibility of the local body good schemes were turned down because the local body would have to bear a certain amount of the expenses in connection with them.  The suggestion, as far as I see it, is that good drainage schemes were turned down throughout the country by certain county councils and that if the central Government were responsible these schemes would have been gone ahead with and some one would have paid.  I wonder who would have paid.  If we take the position as stated by Deputy O'Dowd, 80 per cent. of the central revenue of this country comes from the pockets of the farmers, and the very people in whose interests apparently the county councils turn down these schemes would have to pay. So I do not understand why, if the Deputy wants to protect the farmers, county schemes likely to be turned <Col N="114" /> down by local bodies in the interests of the farmers should be carried out by the central authority at the expense of the farmers.  It is a matter I would like to have cleared up.  I do not know whether the Deputy accepts Deputy O'Dowd's statement that the farmers of the country are providing 80 per cent. of the central revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Importance has been laid from every side of the House on the necessity for providing towns, small and large, with suitable water supplies and proper sanitary accommodation, and exception is taken to this Bill because it does not provide that, right from to-morrow, all the small villages mentioned by Deputy Ward in Monaghan, and all the small villages that are in Cork, and in other parts of the country, are to be provided with water and suitable sanitary accommodation.  The Bill is to be turned down because a great national scheme will not be gone ahead with to provide water and sanitary accommodation for these places, and that it would be cheaper to do that. Deputy Hogan, of Clare, tried to say a good word for the work that the county councils had done, in spite of the fact that Deputy de Valera finds that the legislation under which our small towns were provided with waterworks and sewerage schemes in the past had no principle upon which it was based. In spite of that fact a very considerable amount of good work has been done throughout the country, and supported by the farmers, and paid for in part by the farmers, for the provision of water and sanitary accommodation for our smaller towns.  Even in very recent years there has been a considerable amount of expenditure towards that end.  During the last seven years the amount of loans provided for waterworks in the country and repayable from the local authorities, whether urban or rural, has been approximately £700,000, and during the same seven year period, from 1924 to 1930 inclusive, for sewerage there has been an expenditure of £448,000.  So that a considerable amount of work is being done. Apparently, although there is no principle lying at the bottom of the legislation under which this has been done, there has been a certain amount of good machinery&mdash;no principle <Col N="115" /> but good works.  Deputy de Valera provides us now with principle but with no good works, because while Deputy Walsh, from Mayo, wants the main cost of water and sewerage schemes borne by the rich persons in the town, according to Deputy O'Dowd, Deputy de Valera's principle would put a big amount of the cost of those schemes on the farmers who according to Deputy O'Dowd, provide 80 per cent. of our central taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the far benches and also those on the Labour Benches tend to set their objective behind the blue haze and to tell us that if we march on in that direction all these little difficulties will solve themselves in time.  They say that an inquiry will tell us how much of the cost of the extension of waterworks in the City of Dublin should be borne by the farmers in Eastern Galway or in Western Galway, and that in the same way inquiry will tell us how much of the cost of waterworks or a sewerage scheme in Ballyhaunis is to be borne by the farmers of North Cork, and how much by the citizens of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to a special Bill brought in here having definite relation to rural sanitary authorities.  That was the Bill.  The amendment has relation to that particular problem.  If the Minister wants to go outside that and to talk generally as to whether urban areas shall bear the whole of the cost or otherwise, I would say that the determination of that cost should be in relation to the ability of the particular area to bear it, just as in the case of Oldcastle the Minister evidently was satisfied, after inquiry, that a rate of 1/3½ or one-sixth of the total cost would not be too much to expect from Oldcastle.  How did he arrive at that?  By having a definite examination of the case.  Accordingly, if that principle were embodied in the Bill, a similar inquiry and similar power on the part of the Minister has to be understood.  Obviously there will have to be an inquiry.  Is the Minister going to make general the rate which he thinks is sufficient in the case of Oldcastle, and will he say that one-sixth is always going <Col N="117" /> to be the particular proportion to be paid by the particular area benefiting? Of course not.  As regards Dublin, no reasonable person will find fault with any Bill which makes Dublin, or any urban district that is sufficiently large, bear the cost of its own scheme.  This Bill, however, refers to rural areas, and it is the unfairness of asking a farmer who happens to be living adjoining a place like Oldcastle to contribute to the cost of such a scheme that caused this amendment to be brought in, as well as to facilitate the State generally in getting the kind of public health services which are necessary for the good of the community. There are two ideas, and the Minister is only playing with the question when he tries to make capital out of the fact that there is no definite ratio mentioned or that we have not dealt with problems outside the general scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned in the Bill with rural districts, and I will help them by means of the Bill, if I get it; but the Deputy must know that provision is not going to be made by which State grants will be given in a certain proportion for the provision of waterworks and sewerage schemes throughout the country.  The House is in the position that it must accept this Bill as an addition to the present powers of local authorities or do without it.  Deputy Boland practically suggested that this Bill is simply an adjunct of the Relief Vote voted before Christmas.  That is not so.  I was anxious to get the Bill, as we were using the Relief Vote, voted before Christmas, for the furtherance of public health schemes and as a further assistance to overcoming the objections of local authorities to these schemes at present by lightening the cost of such schemes falling on the farming population.</P>

If the Minister will look at the top of page 3 he will see it stated that the capital cost of the work is to be defrayed out of borrowed money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will have the point which the Deputy makes examined: but it is not intended that the acceptance of a grant for relief schemes will prevent the sub-division of the area of charge in the way proposed here.  If any difficulty arises as a result of the phrasing we can have it remedied on Committee.  As I explained, however.  I wanted this Bill at the time we were inducing public bodies to embark on such schemes, by defraying part of the cost out of the Relief Vote.  This Bill, however, is not by any means simply an adjunct of the Relief Vote.  Deputy Fahy says that no work will be done under this Bill, and that the schemes will not work.  He spoke of Gort, but really he does not know what the position in Gort is.</P>
      <P>The following is an extract from a letter written by the Acting-Secretary of the Galway County Council on 22nd October last:</P>
      <P>The Council is, in fact, anxious that the Gort water supply should be provided, but strong representations were made by the members for Gort area that the area of charge should in equity be agreed to by the Ministry as proposed by the Board of Health, namely, that the rural district of Gort contribute a sum not exceeding one penny in the £ on the rateable valuation of that area towards the cost of the scheme, the balance to be borne by the area fixed for the lighting charge of Gort town, namely, the townlands of Ballyhugh, Rathvilly and Gort, this latter area to be responsible also for the maintenance of the waterworks should the scheme be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, the board of health and the county council were anxious to have <Col N="119" /> power to enable them to do what this Bill will enable them to do, for the purpose of providing a water scheme for the town of Gort.  Gort, and I believe Oldcastle, in spite of what Deputy O'Reilly says, and other places in Cork, Sligo, and different parts of the country, are all waiting to take advantage of the relief grant.  Castlepollard, from which Deputy Kennedy comes, is waiting to take advantage of this Bill, to take advantage of the relief grant and to go ahead with the scheme under which the charge will be more equitably divided than it has been in the past between those who are really benefiting directly from the scheme and those who are in the neighbouring rural areas.</P>
    <P>The fact has been dragged across the whole of this discussion that our county council areas are not what they should be.  One would imagine from Deputy O'Connell that all these areas for public health matters should be wiped out and that the nation as a whole should be treated as a public health unit.  It is in keeping with some people's ideas that the country as a whole should be treated as a unit for home assistance and things like that. That brings us down to a consideration of what is local government at all. Judging by the general tone of the discussion here to-day it should be wiped out, with the result that drainage schemes and other schemes of that particular type, instead of being scrutinised locally and turned down on their merits locally, would be left unscrutinised, to be provided by a central authority here, with money from withheld land annuities, sweeps, or some other brain-wave which we hope we will get.</P>

      <P>However, the position generally is that at the present moment in Gort, Oldcastle.  Drimoleague, Mountrath, Ballinakill, or any of these other areas which are waiting for sewerage or water supply schemes, if these schemes are proceeded with they will have to be done by either a charge placed on the rural districts, on the dispensary districts, the townlands or some portion of one of these areas, with either a heavy charge falling on the people directly benefiting or in an equitable charge falling on the farmers in the neighbouring area.  The passage of this Bill will not prevent any local body from operating on the lines on which it has operated in the past.  It will enable them to make a small contribution from county funds towards the repayment of principal and sinking fund charges.  It will enable them to differentiate between the neighbouring rural area, the area immediately benefiting in the district which is made the area of charge for the scheme.  In regard to the proposal to make the country as a whole the area that should make the contribution towards water and drainage schemes, whether in the rural areas or in the urban areas, the House cannot expect that any proposals like that will be put before them.  The choice is whether they will give these additional powers to local bodies or leave the local bodies with the limitations which they have already and with the certainty that some useful schemes that would otherwise be proceeded with will not be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. This Bill is necessary.  It aims at regularising a certain number of matters which were not dealt with in the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  Advantage is taken to deal with a corporate body commonly known as &ldquo;the Department,&rdquo; which was established by the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, under the title &ldquo;The Department of Agriculture and Other Industries and Technical Instruction for Ireland.&rdquo;  As originally created, it exercised functions not only in relation to agriculture, but also to technical instruction and to sea and inland fisheries.  Its functions in regard <Col N="123" /> to technical instruction and fisheries have already been transferred to the Department of Education and the Department of Lands and Fisheries respectively.  It is now proposed to dissolve the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction and to transfer all its powers, duties and functions, as well as property, to the Minister for Agriculture.  The following Acts will be repealed: The Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899; the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1902; and the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) No. 2 Act, 1902.</P>
      <P>The first two named Acts refer both to agriculture and to technical instruction, and, so far as technical instruction is concerned, have been repealed by the Vocational Education Act, 1930. The No. 2 Act of 1902 relates to certain moneys placed at the disposal of the Department, and are not now required. It is, therefore, proposed to repeal it. The Vocational Education Act, 1930, has also repealed the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying idea in the financing of local schemes of agriculture and technical instruction was that local authorities should contribute rates in aid of such schemes, and that the sums so raised should be supplemented by contributions from the State.  The Acts of 1889 and 1891 provided for the levy of a rate of 1d. in the £ for purposes of technical instruction and agriculture and technical instruction, but it also contained a provision that the 1d. rate raised under the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891, could also be applied for purposes of agriculture as well as for technical instruction. All county councils have exercised their powers to raise rates under these several Acts, with three exceptions, and have in fact levied rates of 2d. in the £ for purposes of agriculture and technical instruction.  On the 1st April, 1931, however, the power to levy rates under the Acts of 1889 and 1891 will disappear, and only 1d. at the outset can be levied for purposes of agriculture, unless the new provisions as to rating contained in this Bill are put into effect before rates are struck for the financial year beginning on the <Col N="124" /> 1st April, 1931.  In all counties, except three, the maximum rate of 2d. in the £ is being levied.  Of the total amount raised, 70 per cent. is applied to agriculture. In no county is the amount applied to agriculture less than a rate of 1d. in the £.</P>
    <P>For some years past it has been felt that the rates which may be levied for agriculture are not sufficient for the needs of local schemes of agriculture. It is proposed to make it mandatory on every county council to raise in each financial year for the purpose of agriculture a sum equal to not less than a rate of 2d. in the £, and if the council sees fit it may raise an additional sum equal to not more than a rate of 1d. in the £.</P>
    <P>I may say the cost of the schemes which are paid for in part out of this amounts to £83,159.  Of this amount £48,000 is raised by the Vote and £69,000 is completed by taxes.  That is really in the first and important provision of the Bill.  This Bill also abolishes the Council of Agriculture and the Board of Agriculture.  The Council of Agriculture had no real function apart from being a debating society to elect the Board of Agriculture. The Board of Agriculture had the spending of the Endowment Fund, about £200,000 a year, and the sanctioning of any payment out of the Endowment Fund.  These functions are now performed by the Dáil.  The Board of Agriculture was all right in its time.  Before there was a Parliament in this country it was quite good business. Certain sums were to be granted each year from the Treasury, and should not be subject each year to be voted by a Treasury which had no great interest in the country.  So it was sound enough to get £200,000 for a large number of years permanently voted to the Department of Agriculture. If that were to be done someone had to make arrangements for the detailed spending of the money.  The Board of Agriculture did that, but now we are in an entirely different position. The schemes are voted by the Dáil. Therefore it is proposed to abolish both the Council and the Board of Agriculture.  We do provide in this Bill that consultative bodies such as <Col N="125" /> the Consultative Council set up in the Dairy Produce and the Eggs Act should be established by the Minister.  These bodies have special knowledge and technical skill to advise the Minister on some specific point.</P>
    <P>We also make certain provisions with regard to county committees of agriculture.  The position of committees of agriculture in relation to county councils has received very careful consideration.  Hitherto local schemes of agriculture have been administered by committees appointed by the county councils, but it was open to county councils themselves to administer the schemes without the assistance of a committee.  In future a committee of agriculture must be appointed in each county.  The experience gained in the past 30 years has shown that, generally, committees of agriculture were too large and unwiedly and that despite their size they did not adequately represent the various districts comprised in the county.  Difficulty was also experienced in obtaining a quorum at meetings, notwithstanding the size of the committees, the attendance of many members being confined to meetings at which appointments were being made.  Provision is contained in the Second Schedule to the Bill for dealing with members who do not attend regularly, and also with the size of the committees which shall comprise a number of members not less than three times nor more than four times the number of county electoral areas in the county.  The number of such areas varies from 4 to 8 so that the membership of a committee will accordingly vary at the discretion of the county council from a minimum of 12 or 24 as the case may be to a maximum of 16 or 32.  The committee may be composed wholly or partly of such members, and membership will be confined to persons who have practical knowledge of agriculture. The Bill provides that members of county committees shall have a knowledge of or some interest in agriculture. Whether that provision is something more than a pious opinion is another matter.  Everybody could claim that they had some interest in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Generally committees of agriculture will be very largely independent of a county council, but three functions have been reserved to the county council, namely, (1) borrowing, (2) raising of rates, and (3) creation of any pensionable office within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1925.</P>
    <P>A committee of agriculture will be deemed to be either local authorities or committees of the county council only for specific purposes.  They will be local bodies within the meaning of Part 4 of the Local Government Act, 1925, so as to enable their officers to participate in the superannuation benefits of the Act of 1925.  They will also be local authorities for the purpose of certain provisions of the Act of 1925, and they will be committees of county councils for purposes of the payment of travelling expenses of members.</P>
    <P>A considerable portion of the Department's whole-time permanent staff were at one time paid out of certain &ldquo;special funds&rdquo; placed at the disposal of the Department under various enactments.  As these funds were not &ldquo;moneys voted by the Oireachtas&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 17 of the Superannuation Act, 1859, the Minister for Finance is precluded, under the existing law, from granting to these officers and employees any superannuation allowance in respect of their service during the periods while they were so paid.</P>
    <P>Many of these officers and employees have had long and meritorious service paid for out of the special funds, and while so paid have carried out duties analogous to those carried out by officers paid from voted moneys.  They have, therefore, an equitable claim to be placed on the same footing as regards superannuation benefits as the officers who during their entire service were paid from voted moneys.  Accordingly a clause is included in the Bill enabling the Minister for Finance to grant superannuation or other allowances or gratuities on the scale laid down in the Superannuation Acts to the officers and employees in question as if they had been paid throughout <Col N="127" /> their service under the Department from voted moneys.</P>
    <P>Some of the officers in question served during portions of their careers under county committees or joint committes appointed for the purposes of the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, and were transferred from the county committee's service to the Department's direct service prior to 7th December, 1922, and, consequently, are debarred from the superannuation benefits granted to county committee officers by the Local Government Act, 1925.  Some served during portions of their careers under other Government Departments or boards of commissioners, such as veterinary inspectors.  It is proposed, accordingly, that in calculating for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts the period in respect of which superannuation allowances may be granted in the case of such officers their service under county committees or other Government Departments shall be reckoned as if it were service under the Department direct.</P>
    <P>Proposals for extending superannuation benefits to Endowment Fund officers, who constitute a large proportion of the officers referred to, were agreed to by the British Treasury in 1914, but owing to the outbreak of the European War these proposals were not made effective.  Provision, however, is now made in the Bill to apply the superannuation clauses retrospectively; but certain cases of exceptional hardship can be dealt with by granting extra-statutory gratuities.  A somewhat similar scheme to that now proposed was agreed to for officers of the Congested Districts Board in 1920, and a superannuation scheme for Forestry officers was in course of preparation at the time the Forestry Commissioners ceased to function in the Irish Free State.  These are the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill really does not affect the people very much.  It is merely an internal departmental matter for the most part.  There are some clauses that do affect the people in their relations with the Government that we object to, but, on the <Col N="128" /> whole, things will not be very much different from what they have been up to the present.  I see here a clause about consultative councils.  I think there have been powers given to the Department to set up these consultative councils already, and the Minister did not make very much use of them, especially in regard to tillage.  If he postpones setting up councils in regard to tillage for any time, he will have to send to Russia or Germany to get experts to consult.  I hope that under the clause dealing with superannuation the claims of veterinary surgeons to be established will be met, and that they will be put on the same footing as other civil servants.  I think the whole matter has been too long delayed.  The Minister has often praised these officers, and it is up to him now to make restitution and give them the same status, at least, as civil servants who are in other departments of the State for a long time.  The Minister is assuming a lot of powers he has had already to direct the activities of the local committees of agriculture. The county councils will be compelled to strike a rate of 2d. in the £.  Some of the local committees of agriculture have complained that the Department refused to sanction schemes, and that they forced schemes on these committees.  As, under this Bill, the Minister still retains authority to force the committees of agriculture to accept his schemes and also to reject any schemes put up by the local people, we will have to oppose this clause forcing the local people to strike this rate of 2d.  That is a Committee matter, and we can deal with it in detail on the Committee Stage.  I should like just to say that I know of schemes put up by the Louth County Council to encourage the growing of wheat on small holdings, and the Department would not allow them to spend more than £10 on them, and, on the other hand, forced them to give £15 for ploughing matches.  I think the people in Louth know how to plough as well even as the people in Wexford, and they do not want any encouragement in that way.  It would have been much better if the money had been spent in the way that the <Col N="129" /> committee of agriculture thought best. We are going to agree to the Second Reading of the Bill.  It does not make many changes.  The £688,000 spent by the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Branch will still continue to be spent, and this Bill is not, I suppose, going to make the Minister spend this money any more effectively.  I suppose we shall have to wait for another occasion to tell him how he could spend the money more effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some information that one would like to have from the Minister before the Bill is given a Second Reading.  He told us that power is taken to make a levy of 2d. for agricultural purposes.  I take it this is very largely for agricultural education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to know exactly what the levy is for.  A levy is also made under the Vocational Education Act, and I should like to know the relation between the two levies, and, if they are for different purposes, to what purpose each is to be applied. One would also like to know the relations exactly between agricultural education in the future and the jurisdiction of the Vocational committees. Will agricultural education, as applied to youth, in future come under the jurisdiction of the vocational committees in the different areas, or will it still be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture?  That is a point one would like cleared up.  Then, also, the Minister spoke of the appointment of a consultative council.  Will that council be a different body from the agricultural committee he spoke about?  One would also like to know what the relations of these two new bodies will be to the vocational committees in their particular area. One would like to see the functions of each of these bodies very clearly defined.  I should like the Minister to say exactly how this policy of agricultural education is to be carried out in future under the Department and under which committee it will be administered.  These are points one would like some information <Col N="130" /> about before one agrees to the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Good's points first.  The educational work done by county committees of agriculture is mainly done through the county instructors, and they are paid partly out of voted money and partly out of money raised by rating.  In the country a certain amount of educational work is done by the county committees of agriculture, or rather, by the county councils through the committees of agriculture.  That educational work is done by instructors who are available to every farmer who wants to consult them as to livestock, tillage, manures, seeding, etc.  There are a number of these officers in each county paid for out of this general fund, and this fund is fed by a rate and by taxation.  That is the educational side of the work of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the agricultural classes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have mentioned the agricultural classes.  The agricultural classes are only a small part of the educational work of the county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will these continue to be under the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education would have no jurisdiction, I take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems an extraordinary thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, I do not understand that.  I cannot see how it can be otherwise.  There are certain officers in each county whose duty it is to advise the farmer on any problems about which he likes to consult them. It is their duty also to put into operation live stock and other schemes for each county.  These consist of premiums for bulls, boars, etc.  The committee choose the farmers who get premium animals and advise the <Col N="131" /> county councils as to the number of premiums necessary or desirable.  They make arrangements for demonstration plots with regard to manures, seeds, etc.  These are all purely and simply agricultural officers.  It would be a very extraordinary situation if they were under the Minister for Education. What does he know about premium bulls and live stock?  But it would be an equally extraordinary position if an officer of that sort, who is after all a practical man and got a good training in agriculture in the old days in the College of Science, and later on in the universities, and in addition has a considerable amount of practical experience by reason of the fact that he is operating in the county, and was there to advise any farmer who wanted to consult him on any problem, and was not allowed to act on the technical ground that he was not an officer of the Department of Education.  That would be the position the Deputy wants to bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is troubling me is whether the organisation of agricultural classes in the area will cut across other classes by the Minister for Education under the Vocational Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>After all there is not such a distance between Merrion Street and Hume Street that we cannot co-ordinate things a little, and there is not such a rush for the education of the agricultural classes.  There is no fear of classes cutting across one another.  There are technical instructors in parishes as well as agricultural classes, and very little co-ordination could ensure that.  They do not take place at the same hour of the day in the same village.  I could give an undertaking to both Deputies that that will not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Still, the education will be administered by two different Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will.  Education is a very wide word, a very comprehensive word.  Here is an officer whose main purpose is to administer the scheme, and what the Deputy is really objecting to is that in addition he is free <Col N="132" /> to give information and put his technical and agricultural skill to use to the benefit of every farmer in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I do not get the Deputy's point.  If you like, they are not educational at all.  Let us put it that way.  They are not educational schemes for the county.  We do not deal with education at all, if you wish. We have a great many officers carrying out live stock schemes and advising farmers, but not educational schemes pure and simple at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there to be instruction given in the technical school in agricultural subjects?  If so, under which Department is that instruction to be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no instruction in the technical school in agriculture dealt with under the Vocational Act. Agricultural education in this country consists in the instruction given by our county instructors, by officers of the county committees in the counties, by officers of the Department in the counties and at the institutes of the Department and at their colleges throughout the country subsidised by the Department.  But so far as I know there is no agricultural teaching in any of the schools schemes dealt with under the Vocational Education Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the possibility is included in their scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility may be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is mentioned in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the intention that it should be administered by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such scheme, so far as I know, administered at the present time.  In any event, my position is: there are certain officers here who are officers of the various county committees and officers of the Department of Agriculture for the purpose of <Col N="133" /> carrying out live stock schemes, and, in addition to that, advising the farmers.  These are the only officers with whom I am concerned in this Bill, and they have always been there.  We are not abolishing them.  If we did there would be considerable objection. There is no connection between these agricultural county committees which existed since 1899 and the consultative councils to be set up under this Bill to which Deputy Good and Deputy Aiken referred.</P>
      <P>We have set up consultative councils already.  If we did we did it under powers under specific Acts such as the Dairy Produce Act and the Eggs Act. We provided that councils might be set up in regard to eggs and butter.  Here we are taking general powers for the Minister to set up a consultative council in connection with any branch of agriculture.  That would be a council really of technicians&mdash;of people with special knowledge, who would advise the Minister.  He would, of course, be free to take their advice or refuse it. The important point is that this council would not be composed of laymen, but of technical men, of experts and men with special knowledge in any particular subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be temporary advisers, not permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Gratuitous advisers such as under the Dairy Produce Act or the Live Stock Breeding Act, who have special knowledge and whose views are available.  We provide here that the Minister may set up such a council to advise on any specific question. There is no connection whatever between that and committees.  Deputy Aiken pointed out in this connection that the powers of the county council to raise a rate, say, for 2d. in the £ for agriculture is a Committee question, and he indicated that the Opposition Party would probably oppose it.  I think Deputy Good was concerned also with the finances of this scheme.  As I have mentioned already, these schemes are mainly schemes for bringing in stock, and in addition to that that the rates and taxes for local authorities pay not only for these animals, but for agricultural instructors, and pay for certain experimental work done by <Col N="134" /> agricultural instructors in the country. For the whole lot such as they are the cost is about £131,000 a year at the present moment.  All these schemes are initiated by local bodies.  You have schemes common to all counties, and you have special schemes for special counties, but such as they are they are initiated in the main by the county committees themselves.  The powers of the Department are only the powers of sanction.  There is never any difference of opinion between the Department and the county committees except on matters of detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference. They have to give way to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's powers only go so far as to enable them to refuse to sanction any scheme. The Department cannot force any scheme on the county committee.  At all events, these schemes are originated in the county.  They are originated by men who know the local needs. As I have already said, the cost is £131,000.  Of that sum only £48,000 is found from the rates, and £83,000 has to be found from the taxes.  It is to be remembered also that most counties strike over 1½d. in the £ for agriculture at present.  Yet their total contribution from the rates is only £48,000, whereas the taxpayer has to find £83,000.  It does not seem unfair to provide that it shall be mandatory on each council to strike a 2d. rate and so increase the amount paid from the rates and lessen the disproportion between the amount paid from the rates and the amount paid from taxes.  In answer to Deputy Good also, I may say that under the Vocational Education Act it is mandatory on the counties to begin with striking a rate of 1¾d., going on to 2d., 3d., 4d., and finally to 6d.  Our ideas are more modest.  Instead of a 6d. rate, the maximum rate is to be 2d.  Already they are striking a rate of 1½d. in the £.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Bill is entitled an Act to make provision for the early vesting of holdings in the purchasers thereof under the Land Purchase Acts, and for that and other purposes to amend those Acts and the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891, and also to make provision in respect of the variation of certain tithe rent charges and variable rents.</P>
      <P>I propose at the outset to survey very briefly indeed the results achieved under the earlier Land Acts, as such a survey appears to me to be a necessary preliminary to the discussion of a Bill of this character in order that Deputies may get a complete picture of land purchase operations to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1870 was the first step on the road of parliamentary land reform which culminated eight years ago in the passing of the Act of 1923.  But, as one would expect, this first Act tackled the problem in a rather gingerly and timid fashion and produced remedies which at the time were called &ldquo;rank Socialism,&rdquo; but which to-day <Col N="136" /> would not bring a blush even to the cheek of the most extreme Tory diehard. It gave very limited and strictly qualified compensation for disturbance and improvements, it legalised the Ulster Tenant Right Custom and, by the John Bright clauses, it made the first tangible move in the direction of State-aided land purchase.</P>
    <P>It failed because of its very limitations and because it still left the landlord his arbitrary power to raise rents at will.</P>
    <P>The next step or milestone on the road was the Gladstone Act of 1881 which boldly accepted the &ldquo;Three Fs&rdquo; which the tenants had long been fighting for, viz., the right of fixity of tenure, the right of having a fair rent fixed on the holding, and the right of free sale of the interests of the holding. This Act established the Land Commission and gave it large judicial and administrative powers to grapple with the problem.  As a court it was empowered to hear applications from the tenants and fix fair rents, and it was also empowered to deal in a somewhat larger way with land purchase, by advancing up to three-quarters of the purchase money to be repaid in 35 years by annuities of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>There followed the Ashbourne Act of 1885, which can truly be said to have laid the foundation of State-aided land purchase as we now know it.  For its day it was a bold measure, and credit must be given the Tories who steered it triumphantly through a highly critical Parliament.  The entire of the purchase money was advanced at 4 per cent. and the period for repayment was extended to 49 years, but, as the Act was admittedly experimental, not more than £5,000,000 was advanced, and a 1/5th of the purchase money was retained as a guarantee deposit.  Three years later the £5,000,000 was doubled, and by the Balfour Act of 1891 a further £33,000,000 was made available for land purchase operations.</P>
    <P>Five years later another Balfour Act, in 1896, abolished the guarantee deposit and introduced a system of decadal reductions which made the financial terms easier for the tenants.</P>
    <P>We come now to the next milestone, the Wyndham Act of 1903, which may <Col N="137" /> be said to have marked the definite turning of the State to the solution of the Irish land problem, by means of the creation of a peasant proprietary. Up to that, whilst the State was extending this idea in its enactments it was doing so rather against its will and largely because of the force of circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Wyndham Act, as Deputies know very well, arose out of a conference of landlords and tenants presided over by Lord Dunraven; it abolished the slow and costly system of sales of individual holdings and decreed that purchase should proceed by transfer of whole &ldquo;estates&rdquo; to the occupying tenants.</P>
    <P>The Wyndham Act, in common with all the earlier Acts, was founded on a strictly voluntary basis.  Sales were transacted either directly between the landlord and his tenants, or indirectly between the landlord and the Land Commission and the tenants.  From the beginning it was universally popular, and during its period sale agreements poured in from all over the country.</P>
    <P>Next in chronological order we have the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907.  This Act, though a short and rather minor one in the land code, is remarkable in that it was the first measure to give Parliamentary approval to the theory of compulsory acquisition in land purchase. Then there followed the Birrell Act, passed in 1909, which, though its financial provisions had the effect of considerably slowing down land purchase, increased and extended the compulsory powers of acquisition introduced by the Evicted Tenants Act.</P>
    <P>We find, therefore, that prior to Saorstát legislation the tenants had secured the legal recognition of the &ldquo;Three Fs,&rdquo; the abolition of dual ownership, and the acceptance of the theory of compulsory acquisition of land, though its application was limited.</P>
    <P>In terms of figures the results of half a century of beneficial legislation were somewhat amazing.  There were vested in 330,000 tenants 11,000,000 acres of land at a price of £110,000,000.  And there remained to be dealt with at the advent of the Saorstát Government 100,000 <Col N="138" /> holdings comprising 3,000,000 acres, at an estimated price of £20,000,000, in addition to about 1,000,000 acres of untenanted land.  That was the problem that faced the present Government when it assumed office in 1922.  And one of its first great reconstruction measures was the Land Act of 1923. This Act is so recent that here I need do no more than remind you briefly of its main features; later it will be necessary for me, in order to explain this Bill, to go into some detail with regard to a number of them.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1923 abolished the relationship of landlord and tenant.  It straight away reduced the tenants annual payment, or rent, or whatever you wish to call it, by 25 per cent.; forgave him all arrears prior to 1920, cut down any arrears between 1920 and 1923 by 25 per cent., and added the balance to his purchase money to be paid off by a small addition to his annuity.  Never before had tenants been able to win such immediate advantages from a Land Act, and there was still to come the further reduction of 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. in annual payments which was to follow the final vesting and the setting up of the annuity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most sweeping feature of the Act is that contained in Section 24, which decrees that, with certain exceptions, all tenanted land wherever situated, and all untenanted land, situated in any congested districts county, and such untenanted land situated elsewhere as the Land Commission shall declare to be required for the relief of congestion, or the facilitating of resale, shall vest in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day. Nothing like this had been attempted before, and the powers taken by this section have already yielded most valuable results for the State.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions of the Act of 1923 continued, as you know, the system of payment in stock returned to by the Birrell Act of 1909.  The vendors are paid 4½ per cent.  Land Bonds, equal in nominal amount to the purchase money and carrying interest as from the date on which the purchased land is vested in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The method of fixing the price of <Col N="139" /> tenanted land employed in the Act was new to land purchase legislation. Heretofore a price was arrived at on an agreement or bargaining basis, but under the Act of 1923 this vital matter was settled automatically by reference to the tenure and the rent.  The new standard price was to be a sum the interest on which at 4¾ per cent. was to be equal to the new standard purchase annuity and that annuity was itself to represent a reduction of 35 per cent. on judicial rents fixed before August, 1911, and a reduction of 30 per cent. on similar rents dating from after August, 1911.  In the case of nonjudicial rents, the landlord and tenant may agree upon the new annuity; if they do not agree the Act of 1929, which gives the tenant a reduction of 35 per cent. on his rent, comes into operation and if, then, either the landlord or the tenant object, the annuity is fixed by the Commissioners subject to a right of appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Such are the main features of the Land Act of 1923.  Since then four more Acts have been passed, and now I am before you to-day asking you to give your sanction to yet another.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a person is asked is there to be no finality to Land Acts and land purchase.  I think Deputies will agree that that is an exceedingly difficult query to answer.  It would certainly take a much wiser man than I am to answer a query of that character. In any event, I do not think I will have very much trouble in convincing Deputies that the Bill which I am asking you to give a second reading to is such that it will give rise to no opposition.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of land purchase to which we all wish to see finality, and finality within a reasonable period, and one of these is the placing of every purchasing tenant definitely on the road to become an owner in fee simple.  We have made good progress in that direction since 1923 but we have a long way yet to go and if the statutory requirements which have governed our procedure up to the present are still to be insisted on many years must elapse before the last tenant to be dealt with can be <Col N="140" /> started on his annuity repayments. We have over 80,000 holdings remaining to be vested under the 1923-29 Acts and more than 20,000 holdings on Congested Districts Board Estates to be resold to purchasers.  Without a disproportionate and uneconomic expansion of staff we cannot, under present conditions, hope to vest in the tenants more than 5,000 to 6,000 of the 1923 Act holdings and 4,000 of the Congested Districts Board holdings each year for, say, the next five years.  That rate of progress is not enough for the needs of the case.  We can improve upon it and improve upon it enormously, and without endangering the solid, financial and administrative security which must always be a primary consideration in land purchase operations, if we are given power to vary in certain vital respects the legal requirements to which we have hitherto been bound, and it is with a view to securing those necessary amendments in our land code that this Bill is being presented.</P>
    <P>Now, let me say at the beginning that this Bill enunciates no new principles, revolutionary or otherwise, with regard to the acquisition and distribution of land, nor does it propose to alter in any respect the basic financial clauses of the 1923 Act.  This Bill is largely an administrative Bill, necessitated by the limitations of the machinery of procedure in the earlier Act and rendered possible by 7 years of valuable experience acquired in the working of that measure.  But whilst it does not, to any large extent, change or add to the principles of the first Saorstát land measure it does introduce an entirely new, elaborate system of machinery and I am hopeful that its immediate and permanent effects will go a long way, indeed I trust all the way, towards removing real difficulties that have been met with in the administration of the Land Acts.  The machinery it will set up is in its main features something quite new not alone to Land Commission procedure but to the practice of the law itself.  At any rate so the lawyers tell me.  But I am fully satisfied that not only will it stand the test of practice but that <Col N="141" /> it will, in time, accomplish all that I claim for it.</P>
    <P>Stated very briefly, the first object of this Bill is to get the Appointed Day for all tenanted land fixed at the earliest possible moment and the lands vested in the Land Commission, thereby securing to every tenant the commencement of his redemption period and the fullest reduction in his annual payment to which the law entitles him.</P>
    <P>The second object, certainly not less important, is to speed up the vesting of holdings to be resold by the Land Commission to their tenants on Congested Districts Board Estates and to allottees of parcels of untenanted lands, thus giving these purchasers at the earliest possible date all the benefits of the annuity system of repayment.</P>
    <P>Tenants on the estates of the Congested Districts Board have harboured for many years a grievance, and it must be admitted a very genuine grievance, by reason of the delay in vesting their holdings in them and the clauses in the Bill framed to meet their cases should banish that grievance for ever.</P>
    <P>Other clauses deal with bona fide agricultural sub-tenants and extend the advantages of the annuity system of repayment to the &ldquo;Clare Island&rdquo; class of holders, thereby doing away with a lengthy and troublesome procedure and enabling this class of holding to be quickly and simply consolidated with other types.  In the past it has been very difficult to consolidate a holding on which the tenants were paying &ldquo;Clare Island&rdquo; annuities.  &ldquo;Clare Island&rdquo; annuities are not a charge on the Guarantee Fund, and before a parcel of land subject to a &ldquo;Clare Island&rdquo; annuity could be consolidated it was necessary for the Land Commission to obtain a deed of charge for the alienation of the parcel.  This new procedure will enable, by an easy and simple method, these parcels to be consolidated.</P>
    <P>Before explaining the procedure of the Bill it will be necessary for me to review in some detail the procedure under the '23/'29 Acts.  From the passing of the Act of 1923 tenants, as I have said, ceased to pay rent as such <Col N="142" /> and became liable for an annual payment in lieu of rent and for a capital sum representing compounded arrears of rent, if there were any arrears during the three years preceding the passing of the Act.  The Land Commission is obliged to pay to the vendor a sum equal to the payment in lieu of rent each year up to the Appointed Day. Compounded arrears of rent are added to the purchase money and repaid by an annuity consolidated with the purchase annuity.  They are paid to the vendor by the Land Commission as part of the purchase money.</P>
    <P>For the immediate purpose of the collection of payment in lieu of rent and compounded arrears of rent the landlord or vendor is bound to furnish the Land Commission with a complete schedule of particulars of his tenancies. This schedule provides the basis on which the Land Commission work towards vesting.  After the particulars have been checked and the holdings surveyed and reported on, a provisional list is published of the holdings which will vest in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day.  All objections having been disposed of, a final list of the holdings is published, and that final list is conclusive evidence that the lands comprised in it will vest in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day.</P>
    <P>The next step is the fixing and gazetting of the Appointed Day whereupon the lands vest automatically in the Land Commission and since 1927 in the tenants as well, and the tenant from that date gets whatever extra statutory reduction in his annual payment he is entitled to and his redemption period commences to run.  Under the Act of 1923 a period intervened between the Appointed Day and the date of the vesting of the lands in the tenants, during which the tenants paid, instead of payment in lieu of rent, an annual sum equivalent to the standard purchase annuity; but now by Section 17 of the Act of 1927 a twofold vesting takes place on that date, viz., to the Land Commission and then from the Land Commission to the tenants, and vesting orders are done away with accordingly.  The vendor, on his part, receives the purchase money, plus the <Col N="143" /> interest thereon, from the Appointed Day, as soon as the Judicial Commissioner has ruled on the allocation schedule.  Such is the existing procedure with regard to tenanted land.</P>
    <P>The results of the Land Commission's operations during the past seven years in respect of tenanted land reveal that although purchase particulars have been lodged in respect of over 2,900,000 acres, only some 550,000 acres have been vested in the Land Commission.  This means that while all tenants in the Saorstát are getting their 25 per cent. reductions in their rents, a very large proportion, because of the fact that the Land Commission has not been able to fix the Appointed Day, are still deprived of the additional reduction, whether 5, 10 or more per cent., to which they are entitled, and of the advantages of their sinking fund repayments.  Not infrequently examples come to light down the country that emphasise in a telling way this disparity.  For instance, John Murphy, on the Jones estate, because his landlord furnished his particulars early and there were no special difficulties in the case, has been enjoying his full statutory reductions and every possible statutory advantage since the Appointed Day on this estate was fixed, say, two years ago.  Just across his mearing is Pat Kelly's farm on the Brown estate.  But the Brown estate is a complicated one and there are many errors in the landlord's schedule of particulars, so Pat has been for the same period paying merely payment in lieu of rent, which gives him only the advantage of a 25 per cent, reduction on his former rent.  Naturally, Pat has a grievance and cannot understand, seeing that the two estates come under the '23 Act, that there should be two years' difference to his disadvantage between them.</P>
    <P>Now, as I have said, the main object of the Bill is to remedy this and similar inequalities of treatment by providing statutory machinery that will vest all the holdings at an early date and thus give the tenants at one step the benefits they are entitled to under the Act of 1923.  The procedure will be as follows:&mdash;Taking the vendor's Schedule of Particulars as the basis, checking it <Col N="144" /> as far as possible from information already in the Land Commission or readily available, calculating from these particulars the standard purchase prices and the standard purchase annuities, there will be published a list, called under this Bill a &ldquo;List of Vested Holdings,&rdquo; which will be, if not varied, conclusive evidence that the holdings are, or will be, vested in the Land Commission on the Appointed Day named in the list.  In some cases the Appointed Day may be the date of publication of the list.  In many other cases the Appointed Day may be the gale day prior to the publication of the list, or perhaps the gale day subsequent to the publication of the list, but in any event it will be in or about the publication of the list.</P>
    <P>On the publication of the List of Vested Holdings the tenants will be deemed to have entered into subsequent purchase agreements, and on the Appointed Day will at once be credited with the advantages to which they are entitled under the Land Acts; they will get their full reduction in rent (thence-forward annuities), and the redemption period will commence to run.  This new procedure, by abolishing the publication of Provisional Lists and by postponing until after the Appointed Day the extremely important tasks of surveying and, where necessary, inspecting holdings and checking boundaries, of ascertaining rights and easements, or disposing of objections, &amp;c., will in one stroke give the tenant practically all the benefits he is entitled to under the land code.  It certainly will clear the way to speedy progress, and I am hopeful that within 12 months from the passing of the Bill every bona fide agricultural tenancy in the Saorstát will be vested in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>When all this necessary work has been completed in respect of each estate the holdings will be vested in the tenants by Vesting Orders, and the fee-simple will thus pass into possession of the tenants.  From the Appointed Day the tenant pays the equivalent of annuity, and from the publication of the Vesting Order he pays actual annuity, but, as I have said, he gets full credit for every sum he pays from the Appointed Day, both <Col N="145" /> with regard to reduction and the redemption period, so that as far as he is concerned the vesting of the holding in him amounts virtually to a mere, formal act.</P>
    <P>Now, as the List of Vested Holdings deems the tenants to have entered into subsequent purchase agreements and as the fixing of the Appointed Day vests their holdings in the Land Commission, what, you will naturally ask, becomes of holdings which the Land Commission may wish to retain either for rearrangement or for relief of congestion, or of holdings that are not admissible by the Acts?  Well, we have made provision to deal with such contingencies. With regard to the former, notwithstanding that a holding has appeared in the List of Vested Holdings, and that the tenant has been deemed to have entered into a subsequent purchase agreement to buy that holding, the Land Commission has the right under this Bill to retain and resume it, if necessary.  With regard to the latter cases, i.e., holdings that appear in the List of Vested Holdings but which are subsequently found not to come under the Acts, the Land Commission, after hearing the parties concerned, may make such order as the justice of the case may require, and there is a right of appeal to the Judicial Commissioner. Likewise a tenant who claims the benefits of the Acts, and whose holding does not appear in the List of Vested Holdings, may apply to the Land Commission to have his holding so returned. Such applications are heard by the Land Commission, with a right of appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the important matter of the purchase money; for this Bill is designed not alone to help the tenants, but to enable the vendors to receive their purchase money at the earliest possible moment.  The purchase money will come to credit on the publication of the List of Vested Holdings, and the Land Bonds will then be issued.  It would be rather much to ask a vendor to wait for his purchase money until all the necessary inquiries that I have described have been completed after vesting.  So, therefore, as soon as the title can be read the purchase money will be distributed, and if any person <Col N="146" /> is overpaid he will be under a legal obligation to repay such sums as may be necessary to redeem the excess bonds issued to him.  The Land Commission will, in the first instance, endeavour to recover the overpayment, and State assistance will be called on only after failure to do so.  It is anticipated that most of these overpayments will, in fact, be recoverable, and that the State will not have to suffer any appreciable loss at all.  A safeguard which will in practically every case be ample to meet any demands of this nature will be the 10 per cent. of the purchase money which may, at the discretion of the Land Commission, be withheld as a guarantee deposit.  There may also, of course, be cases in which subsequent inquiry discloses that the tenants have been paying too little, as from the Appointed Day, and the Bill makes provision for recovery in such cases also.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate and expedite still further the distribution of purchase money, I propose in this Bill that distribution is not to be held up merely because title is imperfect, provided, however, that in the court's opinion any adverse claim is unlikely to be sustained.  And where any person subsequently proves within the time allowed by the Bill that he was entitled to share in the distribution of the purchase money, the Land Commission will pay him such sum as the court may allow.  In addition, the provisions of Section 63 of the Land Act, 1903, whereby the purchase moneys of superior interests not exceeding £30 or £100 can be distributed without investigation of title, have been extended by this Bill to the purchase moneys of estates.  Another provision to meet the convenience of vendors and persons deriving income from charges on land, etc., is that which enables the interest on the Land Bonds representing the purchase money to be paid to the persons entitled to receive the same pending the distribution of the purchase moneys.  As I have explained, vendors are not entitled under the present procedure to receive any dividends on purchase money until it is distributed by the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> In this Bill it is provided that the interest on the Land Bonds will be paid to the persons entitled pending the distribution of the purchase money.  This marks a big change in the present practice where no interest on Land Bonds is paid out until the purchase money is distributed, so that during the interval that elapses between the payment of Land Bonds to the credit of an estate and the distribution by the judge, these parties are deprived of all income from the bonds.  With regard to sub-tenants, too, it is necessary to provide special procedure in view of the automatic vesting on the publication of the List of Vested Holdings.  A somewhat similar arrangement to that in the case of retained holdings becomes necessary.  After the publication of the List of Vested Holdings and the fixing of the Appointed Day vesting the tenancies in the tenants the Land Commission shall declare that the sub-tenants are to be deemed to be tenants of their portions of the holdings, and these portions will be deemed to be separate holdings, and the standard annuity having been ascertained in accordance with the Acts of 1923-1929, each sub-tenant shall be deemed to have entered into a subsequent agreement for the purchase of his separate holding on the date of the declaration.</P>
    <P>The tenant's subsequent purchase agreement will be withdrawn as from the date of the declaration, and the Land Commission will redeem all the intervening interests.  The right of the tenant to recover any arrears of rent that may be due to him by the sub-tenants is preserved to him under this Bill.  I come now to the next important innovation in the Bill&mdash;the provisions for expediting resale to tenants on Congested Districts Board estates and to allottees of parcels of untenanted land.  The procedure after the passing of this Bill regarding these classes of purchasers will be as follows:&mdash;The Land Commission will publish from time to time lists of holdings on C.D.B. estates.  These lists will give such details of these holdings as are available and will specify the annuities subject to which the Land <Col N="148" /> Commission is prepared to resell them. The same provisions will obtain in regard to holdings on parcels of untenanted land; these, too, will be published in separate lists called in the Bill &ldquo;lists of holdings of untenanted land.&rdquo;  This plan will have one great advantage&mdash;it will obviate the necessity for getting purchase agreements signed, a laborious and difficult task that hitherto seriously obstructed the rapid vesting of these holdings.  The effect of the publication of these lists will be to put the tenants at once in the same position as tenants of retained holdings under the 1923 Act. They will become liable for the payment of a sum equivalent to their purchase annuities, and on vesting they will be given full credit for all such payments.  Even if the holdings are rearranged or resumed, the tenants will get full credit for all payments already made by them.</P>
    <P>When, ultimately, Vesting Orders are made in respect of these holdings every person named in the Orders will be deemed to have entered into a subsequent purchase agreement for the purchase of his holding as from the date of the Vesting Order.  But all parties interested will be afforded an opportunity for making objections to the Vesting Order.  The Land Commission will consider and deal with such objections, and a right of appeal will lie from them to the Judicial Commissioner. In practice the tenant on a C.D.B. estate will be, for our purposes at all events, in the same position as a 1923 Act tenant.  They will get credit for every payment they make, for all the sinking fund payments, from the date of the publication of the lists.  In the case of exchanged holdings a triple result will be achieved by each Vesting Order; each Order will deem the tenant to have entered into a subsequent purchase agreement for the exchange of the original holding for the vested holding; the Order will operate as a surrender of the original holding to the Land Commission; and finally it will transfer to the vested holding all encumbrances, charges and equities affecting the tenant's interest in the original holding without any further conveyance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> This represents an innovation in Land Commission practice and will enormously speed up these exchange transactions.  An important change also has been introduced regarding fee farm grantees and long leaseholders. The Act of 1923, as you will recollect, excluded land subject to these tenures from the provisions enabling tenants to purchase and regarded it as untenanted land. Section 11 of the 1927 Act enabled holders under such tenures in non-congested counties to sell their lands in certain cases to the Land Commission as untenanted land and to repurchase them on Land Act terms, the holders being thus placed on the same footing as grantees or leaseholders in congested districts counties under the 1923 Act.  The provisions in this Bill permit grantees and leaseholders whose lands are not required for the relief of congestion and who satisfy the conditions laid down in Section 11 of the 1927 Act to purchase as ordinary tenants, their lands being treated as tenanted land.  This change will give the grantees and lessees all the advantages already bestowed on ordinary tenants.  I am sure that innovation will meet with the approbation of many Deputies in this House.  This was a concession which I think Deputy Gorey made a very big fight for during the debate on the 1927 Act, and I think he was ably supported by other members of the Farmers' Party.  What I have described are the main provisions of the new Bill.  A number of auxiliary provisions of lesser importance remain which I do not consider it necessary to deal with in any detail at this stage as Deputies will have an opportunity of discussing them fully on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two other sections I would refer to briefly. Section 31 is an effort on my part, a mere layman, to settle a dispute among lawyers and high judicial dignitaries by declaring the Appointed Day to be definitely the date at which landed property should be considered to have been converted into personal property.  I trust I have succeeded in settling this dispute satisfactorily. Then there is the question of water <Col N="150" /> supply, an essential matter, as Deputies will readily realise, that must be considered when land is being divided, and when every holding must be given an adequate supply of water where possible.  I propose to give the Land Commission power to take and use water for domestic and farm purposes, providing rights of access and fixing compensation and so on.  The Bill also provides for the repayment to the British Government of the annuities arising out of the improvement expenditure on lands allotted to British Ex-Servicemen under the Soldiers and Sailors Act, 1919.  The capital cost of these improvements has been met each year since 1922 by the British Government and the annuities chargeable on that capital cost are consequently returnable to that Government.  Not the least of the difficulties of the Land Commission are those in connection with the transferring of migrants to their new holdings. It is frequently most difficult to get migrants to move, and one of their main objections has been the cost of transferring themselves, their families, their stock, their farm implements and machinery to the new holdings, so I am proposing to give the Land Commission power in Section 38 to make grants in such cases towards their removal expenses.  I have sketched as briefly and as clearly as possible the purpose of this Bill and I have endeavoured to show the particular niche it will occupy in our land code.  Every clause dealing with its dominant feature&mdash;the speedy vesting of all lands&mdash;has been subjected to the most minute and careful examination, and I am confident that although novel and possibly far-reaching in its effects it will successfully grapple with the problem.  At all events it represents an honest and sincere attempt to meet and deal with all the remaining obstacles in the way of the vesting of lands.</P>

      <P>This is a very important Bill, and it deserves the closest consideration of every member of the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that new machinery is being set up to expedite land purchase procedure. We welcome any step that is <Col N="151" /> taken to do that and to confer upon the tenants benefits that it was intended under the 1923 Act should be conferred upon them.  The Parliamentary Secretary has now given us a long history of previous land legislation. The Land Commission operations are going on for more than half a century, and he admits that according to the present routine procedure there is no possibility that the final work of completing land purchase will be finished for a good many years.  During all that time the State will have to bear the expense of maintaining the Land Commission.  When the Parliamentary Secretary comes forward with a Bill of this kind, in which he states a new and elaborate system of machinery is being devised for the removal of difficulties, we must always remember in connection with this particular Department, that it would seem that very often in order to remove difficulties new difficulties have to be created.</P>
      <P>Only to-day the daily Press tells us that a special additional staff will have to be engaged to deal with this work. If this special additional staff is merely temporary the taxpayer might not feel very aggrieved, but unfortunately every time the Land Commission proceeds to remove obstacles they have to employ a fresh additional staff and that staff remains there.  The obstacles apparently are not removed, but the staff remains and becomes a permanent fixture.  We had a very good example of that in the Gaeltacht Housing Act, when last year we allotted £5,000 for the payment of an additional staff to deal with that housing grant.  I have been in some parts of the Gaeltacht where, strange to say, no inspector has yet set foot to know whether the people wanted these houses or not.  On the other hand, it may be that they are in more deserving places preparing schemes in view of impending political possibilities.</P>

      <P>Yes, provided it was necessary and provided the work was going to be done.  In setting up an extra staff which is going to concentrate upon the new method of procedure, we must remember we are going to have all the old staff, and that the traditional procedure will still be carried on.  In other words, the traditional procedure which is necessary, and which has been emphasised over and over again from the Government Benches as being absolutely necessary before estates can be finally vested in the tenants in fee simple, must go on.  We must furthermore take into consideration the fact that even when the tenant purchaser is placed on an annuity basis at the present time he very often finds that he is unable to meet the obligations placed upon him.  The terms on which tenants purchased were laid down in the 1923 Act, but there was no provision in that Act that when times were bad or if depression prevailed amongst the farming community there would be any alleviation of the charge fixed upon them.</P>

      <P>I did not bring the debates of 1923 with me.  That is pretty far back, but not so far back that Deputy Gorey should forget that he said substantially what I am saying now, only that he probably said it much more emphatically than I would dare, because he was then in the very important position of being leader of the Farmers' Party, when there was such a party.  The tenants complain that they are suffering from depression, from a great fall in agricultural prices. In fact, the circumstances are that many thousands of pounds are due in respect of arrears of land purchase annuities, showing that the condition <Col N="153" /> of the farming community does not even permit them to meet these charges.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey may get up afterwards and make a splendid speech urging that I am favouring embezzlement, that the farmers should not pay their way, or something else.  At this hour of the day, when the farming industry is in the condition in which it is, if any Deputy thinks that he can get away with the real problem of reducing these charges upon agriculture to the very minimum by saying that we are preaching some kind of false doctrine, then he is only trying to fool the community, and I submit that that will not go.  These people have a perfect right to have the whole case reexamined, and if necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the reduction of land purchase or an extension of land purchase annuities is a burning question in the country. Statements have been made by speakers on the Government side that that is a matter of no consequence; any reduction which might be effected would not matter a jot&mdash;it would not be worth speaking of.  Furthermore, they say that it would not matter inasmuch as in the long run it might increase the period over which the annuity would still have to be paid, and whatever advantage the tenant might gain by a reduction in the annuity would be more than counterbalanced by an extension of the period. <Col N="154" /> But they forgot to deal with this point, that the present Government are not able, because they have handed the power to another authority, even to go into this question of extending the period of land purchase annuities, or of granting a reduction.  They have handed over the power in this matter just as they have handed over the finances to another authority, and they are not in a position even to discuss the matter; they are not in a position to state exactly how the sinking fund stands, let alone having the power to remedy it or try to reduce the charges, if that course were feasible.</P>
      <P>If the case of the tenants who are actually paying annuities is bad&mdash; and it is bad&mdash;the position of the unvested tenants is very much worse. When the Land Act of 1923 was passed it was generally anticipated, and I think the Minister for Agriculture will not deny that he led the country to believe, that the Appointed Day would be fixed in a very short time. Deputy Gorey said on that occasion that the only thing they were concerned with&mdash;they were quite satisfied with the arrangement by which, on the Appointed Day, the tenant's annuity would begin to run&mdash;was that that Appointed Day should be fixed as early as possible after the passing of the Act.  Since we came into this House the Minister for Agriculture has admitted that he himself thought at that time that the Appointed Day would be fixed within at least five years after the passing of the Act. Five years have passed and seven years have passed and still only a small percentage of the tenants have been vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we suggested here that provisional vesting was possible without vesting the estate in full fee-simple in the tenant, that the full legal effects need not follow and that a new interpretation could be given to the Appointed Day, we were told by the Minister for Agriculture that we were upsetting the whole procedure, that we were making a very radical change which would upset the whole present method, including the Local Registration of Title Act.  We have since ascertained that title is of very little importance in the determination of <Col N="155" /> the vesting of the tenants.  In so far as title is concerned on the landlord's side we will find that a short-cut can be discovered when it is found necessary, although it is not so very long ago since the Minister for Agriculture told us that this question of title was really so complicated, with persons who might be claimants scattered widely apart from China to Peru, that no short-cut was possible. Nevertheless, he is here presumably giving his benediction to a very considerable short-cut which it is now sought to effect.</P>
    <P>These unvested tenants have paid £6,000,000, according to the last figures that I got some time during the past year.  They have been paying at the rate of from £800,000 to £900,000 a year.  They paid £845,000 last year. They got no benefits out of that payment. None of the money went to redeem the purchase price, and they had to do without the 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. reduction which would be given to them on vesting.  In the meantime money appreciated greatly. There was a fall in agricultural prices, as I have already stated, and the tenant had to sell perhaps twice as much produce as he had to sell seven years ago in order to get money to make his payment in lieu of rent.  No relief was forthcoming.  It is now proposed in this Bill to fix the Appointed Day and, without finally vesting the land in the tenant, to give him the full financial benefits so far as making his annuity run from that day, and so on, are concerned.  What is going to be done in the matter of the £6,000,000 which the tenants have already paid? The total amount necessary to complete land purchase was estimated at £30,000,000.  The tenants who are unvested have paid one-fifth and probably more of the total amount necessary to complete the job.  Are they going to be at a dead loss so far as this £6,000,000 or more is concerned?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that this provisional vesting and the publication of the lists will practically coincide.  I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary that although there is a definite provision that the <Col N="156" /> Appointed Day can be fixed retrospectively that, in fact, it will not be, but that it will, if not actually coincident with it, fall about the same time as the publication of the lists. Therefore, we can take it that, so far as the tenants who have paid out six millions of money and who have not got any value for it so far as a reduction in their purchase money is concerned, the Government is not going to take any steps to give them justice or something in exchange for all that money.  It is not my business to suggest how that is to be done, but I think there are ample provisions in the Bill for dealing with it. There are provisions in the Bill for holding up mortgage encumbrances, for dealing with difficulties in regard to purchase money, with regard to the Guarantee Deposit Fund as well as provisions by which the landlord need not be at a loss.  Under that provision he can still have his dividends paid out to him, even though he is not entitled to get his full capital sum. All these provisions show that there is in the Bill as it stands machinery not alone to vest immediately but to vest retrospectively, and to give the tenants, if the Government wish to do it, the benefit of not alone paying off their annuities from to-morrow or to-morrow twelve months, but of paying their annuities off from the date of the passing of the 1923 Land Act.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary called attention to the provisions with regard to the landlord.  The Minister for Agriculture has stressed at great length in this House the difficulties with regard to title.  He said that these difficulties were simply insuperable, they could not possibly be overcome, and the suggestion that anything in the nature of provisional acceptance of title could for a moment be justified was scouted by him.  We were told it was utterly impossible, and that even this House could not do the impossible. Nevertheless, in Section 33 of the Bill we see that the court, even in a case where the title is admittedly imperfect, is to have the power to pay out his purchase money to the landlord.  He is to get away with the spoil even <Col N="157" /> though his title may be imperfect. There will be a very good argument for that&mdash;that if you want to take a short-cut in land purchase procedure for the benefit of the tenant you cannot have the landlord living on air in the meantime. You must make corresponding provision for him.  Later in the Bill we read that when the claimant has established this imperfect title, has been paid his money and has cleared away, a subsequent claimant may come along with a better title.  If the subsequent claimant should prove that he, in fact, is the man who has the real title he is going to get compensation.  Where is he going to get compensation from? The first claimant is going to be paid his purchase money while the second claimant is to be paid in the form of compensation.  The second claimant is to be paid compensation because the first claimant was paid in the wrong. But where&mdash;and I commend this to Deputy Gorey, who is so anxious to know where the money is to come from &mdash;is the money going to come from to compensate the second claimant, who proves that he, in fact, was the man who had the real title?  It is going to come from the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Therefore, under this Bill we are going to pay the landlord his purchase price on his imperfect title, though title is such a high and mighty subject that I am almost afraid to refer to it, but fortunately I have somebody else here now who is capable of dealing with it. The first claimant is to get away with the purchase money, and then later on, when compensation is awarded, when it is recognised that a mistake has been made, the compensation is to be paid at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>A guarantee deposit fund is to be set up.  It is suggested that this is a great step, because one-tenth of the purchase money may be withheld by the Judicial Commissioner pending financial adjustments. It is suggested that it is an adequate safeguard.  As far as I can see, there is nothing in that to prevent a claimant or an owner getting away with the spoil, because in the first place the dividends will be paid out during the transition period, the full dividends on the Land Bonds will be available for the owner pending <Col N="158" /> distribution, and later on compensation, if it has to be paid, will not be paid out of this guarantee deposit fund.  It will have to be paid at the expense of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-tenancies, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that before the Land Commission would determine that they were to be in fact holdings entitled to be treated as separate holdings and vested as such, they would have to be bona fide agricultural lettings.  There are no provisions in the Bill dealing with this matter.  There is no provision in the Bill to determine when a sub-tenancy will in fact be taken over by the Land Commission as a separate holding. There is no provision in the Bill to show upon what principles the Land Commission are going to proceed. They have a complete discretion in the matter of deciding that any letting in the way of a sub-tenancy by a farmer may in fact be taken over by them as a separate holding, but, as far as I can see, there is no safeguard for the direct tenant.  The provision that intervening interests will be redeemed, and that the Land Commission will buy out those redeemed interests, and in that way compensate the direct tenant for turning the sub-letting into a separate holding, is not in fact worth much, because if the annuity on a new holding, plus the annuity on the holding from which it was taken away&mdash;if the two annuities are less than the total purchase annuity, then it is deemed under this Bill that the intervening interests are of no value.</P>
    <P>If you take a portion of a holding away and make it a separate holding there is no proof whatever that the annuity on the new holding plus that on the part remaining of the old holding&mdash;that the two annuities together are going to be greater than or even equal to the purchase annuity on the original holding.  In other words, the fact that you divide up a holding and create a new holding upon it, that you turn the sub-tenancy into a new holding, may very often destroy some of the amenities in regard to the original holding.  At any rate, you will create a situation <Col N="159" /> whereby you cannot possibly say that the purchase annuity to be fixed upon the two holdings should be equal to or greater than the total standard purchase annuity.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I am not making myself very clear, but in any case it is a Committee point, and I simply want to emphasise that there are no principles whatever laid down in this matter&mdash;nothing to say when a sub-tenancy is, in fact, agricultural or is not.  Therefore we are completely in the dark.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not even told us the principles on which the Land Commission are likely to proceed, or the extent of the work that lies before them in this matter of sub-tenancies. With regard to the arrears due by a sub-tenant to the tenant, if the sub-tenancy is being made into a new holding, would it not be reasonable that the arrears in that case should be added to the purchase money instead of leaving the direct tenant in the position that he has to follow and recover from the sub-tenant whatever arrears may be due?</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding rights of way and conferring waterways and the provisions regarding regulation of turbary seem to be very good ones and if they will do anything at all to stop the litigation that arises in these cases they would be very welcome and confer a great boon upon the country.  As to the question of migrants, we are not clear&mdash;I am not at any rate&mdash;when the Parliamentary Secretary refers to migrants and to the provision for paying their expenses whether he means migrants who would be regarded as substantially large farmers in many areas and who are transferred to one of the Midland counties or whether he is referring to the migrants like those in Connemara who are being shifted on to reclaimed lands, or whether these expenses will, in fact, be provided for both classes of migrants.  It seems to us that in some cases the migrants ought to be able to pay their own expenses.</P>
    <P>As to the provisions regarding fee-farm grants or long leases we would <Col N="160" /> like to have more information from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what exactly is the reason for extending the scope of the provision to allow these people to come in under the 1927 Act. I know that these long lease holders and fee-farm grantees have in a great many cases a claim, and a very sound claim, and we are in favour of these claims being examined.  On the other hand, when you want to have a general position allowing any holder of that class in the congested areas to apply to be taken over by the Land Commission and to avail of State facilities, you want to be quite sure that nobody is being allowed pass through the net whose land would under ordinary circumstances be taken over for the relief of congestion.  I know I will be told that that is fully safeguarded.  We are not in opposition to the principle; we simply want more information as to what exactly is the justification for extending this to the congested areas: what is the number or the extent of the cases concerned, and any other information which the Parliamentary Secretary chooses to give to enlighten us.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill carries out this provisional vesting, and in so far as it seeks to confer upon the tenants the great benefit of allowing their annuities to run from an carly date, we are in favour of it.  We are in favour of any measure that will be for the advantage of the tenants, and the Land Commission can never say that they have come to this House to ask for powers to help tenants to get final possession of the land, and that they were refused.  They have got the fullest powers from the very start since the 1923 Land Act was passed; they have got the fullest powers they have asked for from the House.  If the delay is protracted and unnecessary the responsibility is upon the shoulders of the Land Commission.  We hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will go further than his statement that this provisional vesting and this fixing of the Appointed Day is likely to take place within the next twelve months. We hope he will be able to be more definite before this Bill passes through the Committee Stage and be able to <Col N="161" /> assure the House that by a certain date what this Bill seems to us to contemplate will in fact come into operation and that these 80,000 tenants, nonjudicial as well as judicial, will get this reduction.  We think that a time-limit could be fixed to give them the financial benefits they are entitled to and that they have been deprived of wrongfully during the past seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(Cork): I rise most enthusiastically to support the Bill before the House.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his very clear and lucid history of the Land Acts since the 'seventies.  I was proud to see that in his address he remembered the work of the brave leaders and of the rank and file, of the brave men who went to the scaffold and the brave men thrown on the roadside during that great and memorable struggle that brought us into the happy condition we are in now.  I had the honour of serving as a young man under the flag of the Land League. Every Land Leaguer was my friend.  I stood in the ranks and never flinched. Thank God, I am here to congratulate the Government of this sturdy State on putting the coping stone on our work. More power to the Government.  Since they came into office in 1922 they have had several Land Acts to their credit&mdash; Acts that are carrying on the great work of land purchase.  To-night the coping stone is being put to the work of half a century, and many thousands of our countrymen, from Donegal to Cape Clear, will rejoice when they read the papers to-morrow and see that the Appointed Day is about to arrive, and that the Government are using every possible means to bring that happy day into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at the attitude taken up by the last speaker.  I thought that he would be broadminded enough to look back and see what brought us to the happy position of considering this Bill to-night.  I might remind him and Deputy Flinn that we had no cheeseparing when we were fighting to get possession of the land.  We had none of these little quibbles or small points. We went boldly into the breach and fought until the last landlord handed <Col N="162" /> in his gun.  I am surprised that there should be such a lack of enthusiasm amongst some Deputies here to-night. Deputies should remember that we are dealing with the farmers and their position.  The farmers whose lands are now proposed to be vested will have no thanks for the men who will by any act or criticism stay the happy day when they will be the owners of the soil, and succeed to the land of their sires, thanks to this Government that has finished the grand work of rooting the Irish people back in the land.</P>

      <P>I do not share the enthusiasm of the last speaker.  When I read this Bill I felt it was not quite bad enough for me actively to oppose it, but I certainly felt that it is not good enough to be worthy of any word of welcome.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing the Bill, struck a note of personal, perhaps even of Party triumph.  I am sure that every landlord and every land agent in this bit of a nation will applaud, but that note will not be re-echoed by the small farmers in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer one question, but I do not undertake to answer any more irrelevant, ill-timed or inappropriate questions.  Why will not it be welcome?  Because the only part of this Bill that is really much good is Clause 9.  This Bill is a monument of the ineptitude of the Government of the country and its Ministers.</P>
      <P>Clause 9 has been called outside this House the &ldquo;Derrig Clause,&rdquo; and will be called again the Derrig clause. Clause 9 is merely the application to land purchase in this country of the idea of Deputy Derrig.  The machinery is slightly altered and is, perhaps, more smooth-running, but the idea is his.  If you take that out of the Bill what is left?  This Clause 9 is now introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary in 1931, and we are treated to the history of statutory land purchase in this country, but not one word of apology to the farmer who has had to wait till 1931 for this clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory land purchase in this <Col N="163" /> country up to 1923 was, with certain exceptions too trivial to be worthy of mention, a voluntary system of land purchase.  The machinery then in use was appropriate to a voluntary system of land transfer.  That machinery was taken over in 1923 and applied to a compulsory system of land transfer.  That machinery was unfitted for, or at least was not modern enough or up to date enough for compulsory purchase.  Once you got compulsory purchase, once you compelled the owner of the soil to part with it to the tenant there was no reason why there should be the extraordinary delays that have taken place between the moment of ownership on the part of the landlord and the moment of divesting that ownership from the landlord, and vesting it in the Land Commission, to be held by them until such matters of routine as must necessarily be gone through have been gone through.  But in the meantime once the landlord is divested of this land, once Land Bonds appropriate for the purchase of that land are made available there ought to be no further delay in giving the tenant the full benefit of the reduction. As we are told and as we see, he will get it now under this Clause 9.  What apology has been made for waiting eight years to introduce that machinery?  Small tenants have been paying during all this time, roughly, using round figures, ten per cent. more than they would have been paying if obvious machinery had been introduced, once compulsory land purchase was introduced.  That is why I say that the note will not be re-echoed by the small farmer.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that the small farmer is to receive any reimbursement for the manifest injustice done him because appropriate means have not been resorted to more quickly to divest the landlord of the land.  I could give many other reasons for the statement I have made but, unfamiliar though I yet am with the rules of procedure in this House, I venture to think it would not be seemly for me to make on this occasion what would be more <Col N="164" /> properly a Committee Stage speech dealing with the various details of this Bill and dealing with the many omissions from this Bill.  But may I say one parting word about Clause 9&mdash;the best feature of this Bill?</P>
    <P>The idea underlying Clause 9 was resisted two years ago when Deputy Derrig introduced it.  What is the impelling fact that has placed it in the Bill to-day?  Is it the clamour of the small tenants on the side of the bogs? It is not.  It is the clamour of the landlords to get their Land Bonds. That is what has put this clause into the Bill now, that this year and next year are not to be allowed to elapse until the landlord has laid his hands on the most sought after of all securities, this doubly guaranteed security of the Land Bonds.  That is what put this into the Bill.  Where does the small tenant come into this Bill again? He comes in perhaps under the clause dealing with sub-tenants.  During the years that have elapsed since 1923 and during the previous years we have had a good deal of experience of the chicanery to which sub-tenants and many small tenants had been treated, in this way among others:&mdash;Many of these sub-tenancies had been carved many years ago out of statutory tenancies, subject to statutory conditions, and in breach of one of these conditions against sub-letting without the consent of the landlord.  Many of these tenants had been in physical occupation and paying for these sub-tenancies for a generation, but because technically they had not legal title to the sub-tenancy, many of them have been thrown out of sub-tenancies and many have failed to achieve what I venture to think were their manifest, substantial rights.  The provisions dealing with sub-tenants ought to include a clause that would provide that every sub-tenant who had been in physical occupation of his tenancy for six or, if you like, twelve years be deemed to have a legal title in his sub-tenancy subject to his rent.  Is there such a clause there?  No, not a word about it. So much is there in respect of the sub-tenant as is just enough to facilitate the operation of this Act for the more powerful interests concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> I turn to other parts of the Bill and I come to one portion relating to untenanted land.  When I first read that portion relating to untenanted land I ventured to think that perhaps I would see something in it that would lead one to hope that the new plantation taking place in parts of the Midland and Eastern counties would cease. New ranches are being created there. We thought the small holders of land in Kildare, Meath and Westmeath would have the large ranches divided up amongst them.  Have they been divided?  Quite the contrary.  Farms over 300 acres in extent have been created in favour of certain persons so that I feel justified in describing it as a new plantation.  Is there anything going to be done to stop that?  Is there anything in this Bill that deals with untenanted land that will engender any new hope in the breasts of landless men outside the congested districts?  If there is I shall be glad to have it pointed out to me.  It certainly is not manifest in this Bill.  The line I have taken up is to contrast this Bill in its operation as regards the landlord, who is getting his bonds, and the tenant and as regards the rancher and the small man.  I have contrasted the more important parts but even if I go into the unimportant parts of the Bill I still find that strain running through it, serving powerfully to show this contrast.  Take two sections in what is perhaps the least important part of the Bill, Sections 30 and 31.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of this Bill is introduced here in the hope, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, that it will prevent litigation of a very high-class character&mdash;litigation as to whether, after a landlord has got these bonds lodged to his credit, after the Appointed Day has been fixed, or in some other contingency&mdash;as to whether nominally in the eye of the law they are real or personal property.  Is not that a wonderful boon?  Is not that something that should excite the warm enthusiasm of Deputy Sheehy?  Contrast it with the clause beside it?  That clause deals with registration of title.  There was one thing that could have been done in relation to the registration of title which they have not done, that is, <Col N="166" /> they could have left the tenant with a pledgeable document, his land certificate, so that he could borrow money if he wanted to without incurring the cost of a mortgage, a reform that is due to the tenant purchaser for many years past.  His land certificate, on which he could borrow money, is held in the Land Commission.  The Land Commission can be protected by an endorsement.  But the tenant is left at the mercy of the bank, the bank's solicitor and his own solicitor, rather than give him a cheap and easy way of dealing with that important side of the small farmer's life.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I have been reading over the speeches made by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Agriculture on the last occasion on which this motion was before the House.  I congratulate the Ministers, not upon the accuracy of their facts, but upon the fertility of their imaginations. If it were not that the rules of debate and the rules of the House preclude the Ministers in the Chamber from publicly worshipping &ldquo;my lady nicotine,&rdquo; I would have formed the opinion that their pleasant mental fictions had been evolved while they were blowing smoke rings upon the <Col N="167" /> Government Bench, because there never was in any speech made, even by a Minister in this House, such a taradiddle of misrepresentation as was indulged in by the Minister for Finance in endeavouring to justify the attitude of the Government in refusing to set up this Select Committee to consider the present position and future prospects of the industry of tobacco-growing in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as is usual with the Government, when they are in a tight place, invokes the memory of Arthur Griffith, and proclaims with what devotion and zeal they had served the ideals of that dead leader.  The Minister said that against his better judgment&mdash;it would appear that in patriotic causes the Minister is always acting against his better judgment. We have heard him state on a public platform that in 1919, 1920, 1921, against his better judgment, he advocated the establishment of an Irish Republic in this country.  Now we hear that in the year 1923, against his better judgment, he was prepared, as a devoted follower of Arthur Griffith, to advocate a preference for Irish-grown tobacco.  Here are his exact words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of tobacco growing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was discussed a good deal in the papers edited by the late President Griffith and most of us had the idea that a flourishing tobacco industry ought to exist here and that it was merely foreign misrule and foreign misregulation that prevented its growth.  A closer examination convinced us that there was really no prospect of growing tobacco here on a considerable scale on anything like an economic basis.  Nevertheless,&rdquo; and here is where the misrepresentation comes in, the misrepresentation which can never be absent from the speech of any member of the Government when they are endeavouring to justify a refusal to do their duty to their countrymen.  &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a very considerable preference was given to tobacco&mdash;as much as it was thought could in any way be justified. In my own view the preference given was perhaps more than could be <Col N="168" /> strictly justified unless it were to be of a temporary character.&rdquo;  (Column 1193, Vol. 36, Official Debates).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A considerable preference was given to tobacco growing,&rdquo; in his own view, &ldquo;perhaps more than could be strictly justified.&rdquo;  Just let us examine, as an example of the manner in which the members of the Government have approached this question, that statement of the Minister to see what truth there is in it.  The duty on tobacco in the years 1923, 1924 and 1925 was 8s. 2d. per lb. on the unmanufactured article. By an Imperial preference that duty was reduced in Great Britain in the first instance, in 1924, to 6s. 8d. per lb. Subsequently, however, in the year 1925, the Imperial preference in Great Britain was increased by 2s. 0?., leaving the consequent duty on tobacco grown within the British Empire at 6s. 2d.  The figures 8s. 2d. and 2s. 0?d. or 25 per cent. off the original customs duty on tobacco, represent, in the opinion of the British Government, what would be a fair and adequate preference to give to tobacco grown within the British Empire.  Most of this tobacco, remember, was not grown under conditions such as prevail in this country.  A good deal of it was grown by very cheap labour.  All the tobacco grown here in 1921, 1922 and 1923 was grown by labour which, as compared with the rates which prevailed before that date and have come into operation since, was comparatively highly paid.  I do not want to be taken as stating that it was too highly paid.  At any rate the rate of wages paid to the tobacco workers in this country was very much higher than that which was paid to workers in other parts of the British Empire.  Yet, notwithstanding that fact the British Government did not consider that a preference of 25 per cent. was unjustified, and was not too much to give to tobacco grown within the Empire.  That was the attitude of the British Government.  What was the attitude of this devoted follower of Arthur Griffith, the Minister for Finance?  The actual preference given to tobacco growers in this country under the Government of that day, under Mr. Cosgrave's Government of 1923-1924, was a preference of 1s. 6d. <Col N="169" /> in the lb., which was in fact, 25 per cent. less than the preference which the British Government gave to the tobacco growers here, and also to the tobacco growers of British India, British Rhodesia, British Nyassaland, and all the other tropical or sub-tropical countries with which our farmers were competing in the British market.  I ask you to test the truth of the Minister for Finance's statement, to use it as a touchstone to form your own opinions as to the sincerity with which and the open-mindedness with which the Government approached this question, by contrasting the preference of 1s. 6d. given to tobacco-growers in Saorstát Eireann, by what proclaims itself and calls itself a native Government, and the preference given in Great Britain by the members of the British Government to the tobacco growers in their dependencies and in their dominions.  And yet the Minister for Finance with his protection or preference, which the figures clearly prove was altogether inadequate, comes here and says that a very considerable preference was given to tobacco, in his own view, perhaps, more than could be strictly justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the recommendations of the Special Committee which was set up by the Dáil&mdash;the Special Committee&mdash;the composition of which, in view of the possible division upon this matter will, perhaps, interest the House&mdash;consisted of, among others, Deputies Mulvaney, Gorey, Cole, Sears, Beamish, P.J. Egan, Esmonde and E. Doyle.  The recommendation in view of the figures which I have quoted as to the preference given in Great Britain on Empire-grown tobacco was, to my mind, a very moderate one.  The Committee recommended that the duty on Irish tobacco should be reduced from 6s. 8d., or 5/6ths of the full excise duty to 5s., or 5/8ths of the full excise duty as compared with 8/2 per lb.</P>
    <P>Think of the circumstances under which our growers were to compete in the British market and even in our own, particularly I will say in the British market.  Here we were paying by contrast with the wages paid in tropical and sub-tropical countries a <Col N="170" /> very high standard of wages.  I wish particularly to guard myself against misrepresentation in this.  I wish to emphasise that I do not think that the wages paid were too high, but they were very much higher than those paid elsewhere.  In order to meet the competition of tobacco produced by poorly paid labour; in order to help our growers first of all to maintain the home market for themselves, to develop and extend it, and to develop the industry so that our growers could in the future be able to compete in the markets of the world, the recommendation of the Special Committee would have meant that in our own markets our own growers would have secured a preference of 3s. 2d. in the lb. as compared with a preference of 2s. in the lb. which Imperial growers secured in Great Britain.  In round figures it meant that we were going to increase our preference by fifty per cent. for our own growers, and I say that that was not, taking every relevant factor into consideration, an excessive preference to give and that the recommendation of the Committee was an eminently reasonable one.</P>
    <P>But think of how the Minister distorted this recommendation.  Think of the gloss which he put upon it.  I admit that he was assisted to some extent by an unfortunate observation in the Committee's Report.  The Minister referring to this recommendation described it as one which would have given a subsidy of £120 an acre for every acre of tobacco grown.  As I have said the Committee unfortunately by a misstatement in the Report gave him an opportunity to make that misstatement, because they said that the proposal in that regard would entail a loss in revenue of £116 per acre.  It would entail no loss to the Revenue. Let nobody be under any misapprehension on that score.  If this tax is not collected on home grown tobacco do not think that the Government are going to have to tighten their belts and carry through some of the economies for which the country is clamorous and which would be so very helpful to the farmers at present, but which they refuse to make.  If this sum of £116,000, amounting to about <Col N="171" /> £145,000 per million lbs. of tobacco grown here, were not to be taken off tobacco it would be taken off something else.  There are many things which we import which are as much in the nature of luxuries as tobacco which could equally well bear this tax, and would equally well distribute the incidence of the tax over the whole community.  One of the reasons why tobacco is so useful a commodity from the point of view of the Minister for Finance is that, notwithstanding the dictum of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that tobacco is no longer a luxury but has now become a necessity, notwithstanding that, many people are still old-fashioned enough, and I am one of them and I presume the Minister for Finance is another, to regard it as a luxury, and, therefore, a proper commodity to tax. No man or child I think is going to go hungry for tobacco no matter what cravings he may have, and if he does, it is not going to stultify his physical development.  Did I understand the President to make an observation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the President ought to start on it.  As I was saying, tobacco is a luxury article, and therefore a fair object to tax.  Not only that, but it is consumed by a considerable number of our people.  For that reason it is assumed that a tax upon tobacco does not bear heavily on any individual in the community.  There is another commodity which is consumed not so much as tobacco by the poorer portion of the community, not consumed so much by the workers in the community, but a commodity which is also very much in the nature of a luxury, and which is imported on a very generous scale into this country, and that is petrol.  As I have said, the deficiency which would have to be made up to the revenue per million pounds of tobacco grown, if we grant the privileges which the Committee recommended, would be <Col N="172" /> £145,000.  A tax of a penny a gallon on petrol which is used to a large extent to drive luxury vehicles in this country would make up that deficiency, and the revenue would not suffer any loss in consequence of the fact that the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann had made up their minds to do what the British had been doing before, namely, to foster and develop the tobacco industry in this country, an industry which at one time was a very important one here.  Or, if the Minister for Finance will not be permitted to put this tax upon petrol, let me suggest, that instead of putting the tax on raw unmanufactured tobacco grown in this country, an increased tax be put on the finished article, on cigarettes and plug.  In that way he could compensate the revenue for any temporary deficiency which may be caused by the fact that he refrained from collecting the tax on the raw tobacco in the field.</P>
      <P>Another misstatement of the Minister for Finance to which I would like to draw attention is that he said: &ldquo;The position seems to be that it would cost something like 1s. 6d. a lb. to grow tobacco which can be bought at sixpence.&rdquo;  I have had the opportunity of looking up the report of the Imperial Economic Committee on Tobacco and I find that, so far as imports into Great Britain of tobacco grown within the British Empire is concerned, none of it in the years 1923, 1924 and 1925 was imported into that country at so low a price as sixpence per lb.  The average price of Rhodesian tobacco in 1924-'25 was 1s. 4¾d. per lb., and in 1925-'26 it was 1s. 4¾d. per lb.  The average price for Indian tobacco was 9d. per lb.  In not one of these countries was tobacco sold at an average price of 6d. which the Minister for Finance put before this House as the figure with which the cost of Irish-grown tobacco would have to be compared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another misrepresentation from the Minister's speech is: &ldquo;If it is going to cost the Exchequer £3 a week to grow a half acre of tobacco&rdquo;&mdash;that is £156 a year for a half acre of tobacco.  If we multiply that by two, we get £312 per year as the figure to which the <Col N="173" /> Minister's imagination has now exalted this subsidy.  In an earlier part of his speech he admitted that the figure would be something in the neighbourhood of £120 an acre, but that figure has now, under the influence of the Minister's fertile imagination and strong prejudice, swollen to £312 an acre.</P>
    <P>Having delivered himself of that gem he said: &ldquo;It is only a shade better than a proposal to grow oranges or tea.&rdquo;  From the farmers' point of view, in the present year, it may be only a shade better than a proposal to grow sugar beet and hand over the whole subsidy not to the native farmers who produce the beet, but to foreign capitalists who are exploiting the farmers in the interests of the Ministry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was followed by the comedian of the front bench, the Minister for Agriculture. There is one thing, at any rate, which the members of this House are spared from doing, and that is from taking the Minister for Agriculture seriously.  Of course we have good authority for doing that. We remember the famous occasion on which his colleague, the Minister for Defence, admitted that nobody took him seriously, at least in relation to the Army.  He also followed the Minister for Finance, and said that it was stated&mdash; stated by the Minister for Finance&mdash; that it takes about £300 an acre to grow tobacco.</P>
    <P>I have here an official publication issued by order of this House giving the report of the Special Committee on Home-Grown Tobacco, with minutes and certain appendices.  I turn to the appendices and find that the average cost of growing an acre of Irish tobacco in 1924, for a small grower, was £35 16s. 11¾d., which is one-ninth of the figure mentioned by the Minister for Agriculture, and also by the Minister for Finance.  For a large grower the figure was slightly higher because, of course, he has to pay a considerable amount in labour.  In the case of the large grower the figure was £39 10s. 10d.  That was the only argument that the Minister for Agriculture contributed to the debate.  The rest <Col N="174" /> of it was full of cheap sneers about Deputy Derrig's energy and about the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&ldquo;if they want to let off steam, try to find some other way of doing it.&rdquo;  The Minister had no argument to answer the case made by Deputy O'Reilly in support of the motion, and contented himself by saying: &ldquo;We, as a Government, are satisfied that there is no case for tobacco growing in this country.  We may be wrong, but there is one thing which a Government ought to do, and that is to come to a decision, and having come to a decision, whether right or wrong, stick to it.&rdquo;  That is what they are doing in the case of land annuities.  They made a blunder, and though it costs the people of the country three and a quarter millions a year, they are sticking to it.  &ldquo;Though we may be wrong, there is one thing the Government ought to do, and that is to come to a decision.&rdquo;  That is what we feel in regard to this whole question of tobacco.  The Minister for Agriculture says that they are satisfied that there is no case for it.  I would like the House to listen to what is the considered opinion of those who are engaged in experimental work in connection with tobacco growing.  This book which I have in my hand was not written by a Fianna Fáil Deputy, or by any follower of Arthur Griffith, such as the Minister for Finance.  It is a book produced by the late solicitor for his Majesty's Customs and Excise, and it deals with the question of tobacco growing in Ireland.  It says: &ldquo;Experiments in the cultivation of tobacco in Ireland have been conducted under the supervision of the Department since its institution in 1900.  The experiments made in the years 1900 and 1902, and carried out on a number of small plots widely distributed, establish the fact that good tobacco could be produced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The contention of those who were connected with this industry for a considerable period of years, for I think almost twenty-five or thirty years, is that Irish tobacco could be grown here on a commercial scale and with profit to the community.  There is an ample market for native tobacco provided it can be fostered and developed.  In <Col N="175" /> 1930 we imported into this country 12,563,000 lbs. of unmanufactured tobacco the value of which was £770,000&mdash;over three-quarters of a million.  At one time Irish tobacco was very highly esteemed in Great Britain but tastes changed and there were other developments.  At any rate, it has been established that the soil of Ireland is particularly suited to the growing of tobacco and with a suitable soil and with a potential market, amounting to something over three-quarters of a million pounds, we are told by the Minister for Agriculture, who, I say, believes in beef and butter for the British and potatoes and Indian meal for the Irish people, that &ldquo;we as a Government are satisfied that there is no case for the growing of tobacco in Ireland.&rdquo;  In my opinion an overwhelming case was made before the Committee for the fostering of this industry.  We are not asking the Dáil now to accept the report of that Committee but to set up a new Committee which will approach the matter with an unbiassed mind and which, in the new circumstances that now prevail, will investigate the whole question.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to keep the House any longer but before a division is taken on the question I would like the House to consider the advantages that were claimed for this industry by those engaged in it.  First of all, the amount of labour required for the cultivation of tobacco is far greater proportionately than that required for any other crop commonly grown in this country. As a comparative standard, it is stated that the number of hours of manual labour required per acre of tobacco is estimated at 748½ as against 309 in the case of potatoes, 270 in the case of beet and 87 in the case of wheat.  One of the problems, to which any Government really concerned about the welfare of the people would devote its closest attention at present, is what we are going to do with our agricultural population who at present are prevented from seeking, if you like, the relief which emigration to America and elsewhere has heretofore afforded them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> Here is a way in which a considerable amount of these young people who are now idle and hungry at home could be employed and help to maintain themselves.  The labour involved in the cultivation of an acre of tobacco is, as I have said, 2½ times that required for the cultivation of an acre of potatoes, almost three times as much as that required for the cultivation of an acre of beet, and almost eight times as much as that required for the cultivation of an acre of wheat.</P>
    <P>On that ground alone, on the ground that it would provide increased employment for the agricultural population, this question at present merits the closest investigation.  As well as that it is also claimed that the crop is one which is eminently suitable for the small farmer, seeing that much of the labour required is of a nature that could be supplied by members of his own family, particularly in the slack season.  One of the great advantages of the crop is that the work of curing is undertaken mainly during the winter.  For that reason it would provide much needed and much wished-for occupation among the rural population during those months when work on the land is slack.  It is also stated that the cultivation of tobacco necessitates the breaking up of a considerable area for other crops in order to provide for rotation, and is consequently a stimulus to tillage.  The President claimed that for sugar beet.  He thought it justified him in introducing the cultivation of sugar beet into this country.  I do not wish to be taken as objecting to that.  I like the Government to do anything constructive, but I would like when they undertake schemes of this nature that they would, at least, have the prodence and the foresight to ensure that it is their own people who will benefit and not the foreigner.  Unfortunately, that prudence and foresight were grievously lacking among those who drafted the programme for the sugar beet factory.</P>
    <P>It is also stated that this being a crop requiring intensive cultivation, tobacco growing improves the land and in consequence better yields of subsequent crops result.  At the same time its growth improves the agricultural <Col N="177" /> methods of the producer. These are four strong reasons given by the Committee for the growing of tobacco, and the fifth I suggest is that there is a wide field for its development. Twelve and a half million lbs. of unmanufactured tobacco is imported annually to the value of over £750,000.  We have that market.  We have these four advantages indicated by the Committee, and we suggest that, in view of these facts, and in view of the present economic circumstances of the country, the Committee called for in the motion should be set up.  I hope that when the matter is pressed to a division the Deputies from those constituencies most closely affected by this question, constituencies like Meath and Wexford, and Deputies like Deputy Esmonde will vote on the motion.</P>
    <P>The faces of these Deputies are so seldom seen in the House when a matter concerning the welfare of the constituency is under discussion that one is liable to forget that they exist. At any rate we have Deputy Gorey, Deputy Cole, and Deputy Esmonde, none of whom is here at the moment, in 1926 presenting a report to the Dáil recommending that something should be done to save the industry from extinction.  They admitted that that report was rather a perfunctory one to this extent that their recommendations were provisional in view of the fact that their inquiries had been limited by their terms of reference, but they made it in order to save the industry from extinction.  I am afraid that that industry is now like the red deer, almost more or less extinct in this country, but it is an industry which I think can be revived, and it is an industry the possibilities or revenue from which any native Government should investigate.  For that reason we are pressing this motion and we hope that the Deputies who want to do anything for the agricultural community will support us in the division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with very great attention to the speeches made with respect to the advantages of growing tobacco in this country, but to anyone <Col N="178" /> who has given this subject any consideration whatever, it must be perfectly obvious that the growth of tobacco in this country can only be carried on at the expense of the taxpayer. It is not an industry that has been tried in this country for a period of almost twenty-two years.  It is an industry which has been helped and fostered by subsidies from the State, and it is an industry which has been proved conclusively cannot be run either for the benefit of the State as a whole, or the benefit of the individuals engaged in the growth of tobacco itself.  If tobacco is to be grown in this country the twenty-two years' experience we have had of its culture, has demonstrated what I may roughly place under three heads&mdash;(1) that the growing of tobacco in this country can only be carried on at a heavy financial loss; (2) that the crop of tobacco which grows in this country is almost impossible to dispose of, and (3) that it will never be a revenue-producing industry for this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why Deputy MacEntee, in the course of his speech, did not inform this House that already the taxpayers in this country are out of pocket to the tune of over £100,000 which has already been wasted in the twenty-two years that we have been engaged in the culture of tobacco.  Any sane business man knows when he has lost £100,000 in the setting up of an industry that only one thing remains, and that is to get out of it as fast as possible. After the twenty-two years' experience we have had in the culture of tobacco in this country, we found, as time progressed, that, instead of being able to produce tobacco at a low cost, the cost of production was steadily increasing. I will quote from the Report: &ldquo;The yield per statute acre of tobacco was decreasing and the selling price obtained from tobacco when grown was steadily diminishing.&rdquo;  Is there any sane man standing for industrial development in this country who would support the resurrection of an industry of that kind?  I read very carefully the speech Deputy Derrig delivered in support of this motion.  The Fianna Fáil Party have turned to almost every <Col N="179" /> possible phase of this subject in order to put up a case in this House, and up to the present they have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig asked the House what were the reasons why the Government would not embark again on the growing of tobacco in this country and I went so far as to say that from this side of the House no reasons were adduced as to why tobacco should not be grown in this country.  In the Committee set up in 1926 to deal with the question of tobacco growing, in paragraph (3) of the report they pointed out that every acre of tobacco cultivated in this country involved the State in a loss of £116 per acre.  Do you want to involve this country in its present economic condition in a loss of £116 per acre by rescuing this defunct industry of tobacco growing?</P>
    <P>First when the project was started a bonus of 1s. per lb. was given to every grower in the country, not 1s. per 20s. as Deputy MacEntee wrongly informed the House but 1s. per lb. grown in the country.  That was increased to £50 per acre until we paid away in subsidy a sum amounting to £100,000.  After that twenty-two years' experience what was the condition of tobacco grown in Ireland?  The result may be briefly stated.  The acreage of tobacco fell from 217 acres in 1914 to 15¾ acres in 1926 and when we take the subsidy how are you going to find employment for your unemployed in an industry such as that?  We have been told by Deputy MacEntee in the course of his speech that this was an admirable country as far as climatic conditions were concerned for the growth of tobacco.  Deputy MacEntee simply made that bald statement in the House without adducing a single fact or figure to prove it.  It would be well if Fianna Fáil attempts to preach such a doctrine as tobacco growing in this country that they should profit by the experience we have already undergone.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputy O'Reilly to the crop of tobacco grown in 1912 and I will ask him what happened if this is an ideal climate for the growth of tobacco.  In 1912 we produced 40,000 lbs. of tobacco and a frost damaged <Col N="180" /> that 40,000 lbs. to such an extent that 8,500 lbs. had to be sold at 2d. a lb. In other words, one-fifth of the crop was almost useless.  It might be well to remark in dealing with tobacco grown in this country and the experience gained after twenty-two years that in seven different centres when we had this subsidy of £50 per statute acre the cost of production was 10.2 pence per lb., and the selling price of tobacco was 4.3 pence, so in every lb. of tobacco we produced in this State the State lost 5¾d. per lb. and this is one of the industries that Deputy MacEntee tells us is going to find employment for the unemployed in this country.  I cannot imagine for one moment why the Fianna Fáil Deputies have not availed themselves of the information that is on the records of this House.  I stated in my opening remarks that there were three factors concerning the production of tobacco in this country.  One was that the cost of production after twenty years' experience rose and the average yield steadily fell and the price received for every lb. of tobacco produced resulted in a loss of 5¾d.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the various centres at which tobacco was grown.  I would like to deal with two of the most important centres, Louth and Wexford.  In 1911 Louth produced 949 lbs. per statute acre but in 1912 the amount was only 588 lbs. per statute acre.  The price in 1911 was 5d. per lb., and in 1912 2.7d.  Take Wexford.  The average there per acre was 1,111 lbs. in 1911, and 707 lbs. in 1912.  In 1911 it was sold at 5d. per lb., and in 1912 at 2.7d.  In 1911 the loss in the growing of tobacco in Louth amounted to £19 7s. 6d. per statute acre, and in 1912 that increased to £20 10s.  The loss in Wexford in 1911, was £16 6s.  That amount increased in 1912 to £19 8s. per statute acre. Yet this is the wonderful industry that is to provide employment!  Was there ever such tomfoolery talked?</P>
    <P>I would like to draw Deputy O'Reilly's attention to the fact that in 1912 39 out of the 50 small tobacco growers had heavy deficits, and only in 11 cases out of the 50 was there any sales to meet the charges.  Will <Col N="181" /> Deputy O'Reilly tell the House how; when every pound of tobacco grown in this country is sold at a loss of 5¾d. we are going to find work and wages for the unemployed?  One would imagine that such experience would be sufficient to prevent any sensible man advocating a campaign of tobacco-growing again in this country.  If, having paid a bonus of 1/- in the lb. and increased the subsidy to £50 an acre, after 22 years' experience there has been a loss of from £16 to £20 an acre, in the name of Providence how does Deputy O'Reilly imagine there is going to be a profit for the Free State farmer in the growing of tobacco? It is well known in business that the first thing a man with capital invested in an industry will do when he finds that he is losing, after giving it every possible chance is to cut his losses and to get out.  That is what the Government Party has done and no sane man can deny that their action has not been for the benefit of the country.</P>

      <P>We are asked to produce a crop in this country, and when we have it we have no market in which to sell it.  Will Deputy O'Reilly inform the House why £140,000 worth of tobacco, produced between 1914 and 1926, remained in the bonded stores and were not sold?  Will he tell us why the Irish manufacturers refused to take it, when we are told that Irish tobacco has a special flavour?  How is it that our Irish manufacturers refused to take it, except at a price at which it could not be profitably sold?  I cannot understand why this motion has been moved by the Fianna Fáil Party after the ruthless criticism and analysis it has suffered at the hands of Deputies on these Benches.  The Committee <Col N="182" /> that was set up, and which inquired very fully into the matter, stated that the decline of Irish tobacco-growing was due to one very important fact, the refusal of the Irish tobacco manufacturers to buy Irish leaf.  How is Deputy O'Reilly going to overcome that difficulty?  Let us get down to hard facts.  To put it briefly, we are asked to produce a commodity which cannot be sold except at a loss of 5¾d. per lb.  We are asked to produce a commodity which our Irish manufacturers refuse to buy.  We are asked to produce a commodity which facts and figures show has been produced at a loss of from £16 to £20 an acre.  Is that the panacea the Fianna Fáil Party advocates for the reconstruction of industry in this country? If it is, all I can say is that the people of this country will have more sense than to return them at the coming election.</P>

      <P>Although I heard Deputy Byrne's speech before on two or three occasions I do not quite follow it yet.  The Deputy told us that there were huge losses per acre, that the tobacco could not be sold, and that the revenue lost over £100,000.  I do not understand where the revenue lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Not having displaced any revenue there can be no loss there.  The Deputy referred to the crop grown in 1912, and graciously told us that the season happened to be a particularly frosty one.  The frost came early and destroyed the tobacco. It was lamentable that a crop should be destroyed by the early frosts. Canada, the greatest wheat-producing country in the world to-day, when it started to produce wheat, was unfortunate <Col N="183" /> in that respect during the first two or three years, as they had early frosts and lost their crops.  Evidently the Canadians were not like ourselves. They did not lose heart; they continued to grow wheat.  As far as weather conditions are concerned, I think, from the farmer's point of view, there was considerable loss last year, too, in the one thing we are permitted to say we can produce&mdash;hay.  I do not think to-day that a farmer in Ireland is allowed to say he can produce anything else.  Wheat has been definitely turned down; barley has only the faintest hopes; oats will be a past memory soon; while butter, of course, is in agony, and had to get a special stimulant in the shape of a subsidy.</P>
      <P>I wonder what is going to become of farming?  It is quite evident that Deputy Byrne is not a farmer.  I could not name any particular crop that is produced by the farmer to-day that pays.  Still, he has to stick it out.  The beet business has been mentioned.  It is a very highly subsidised industry, and unfortunately&mdash;as far as I know&mdash; the farmers do not get much of the subsidy.  It goes to someone else.  The question of tobacco growing presents a peculiar feature in a country that has adopted tariffs.  We hear a lot about tariff procedure, that it is wrong and highly improper to put a tax on an article that is not produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tax on tobacco is a tariff, and we get no opportunity of producing that commodity in this country.  One of the reasons I ask that this Committee be set up is that they will have a chance of exploring every avenue and they will be in a position to see if it is possible to take a more sensible standpoint than there has been taken hitherto in the matter of tobacco-growing. I think it is more or less a pity that a lot of money should have been thrown away on an industry that was greatly mishandled, and it is regrettable that the little experience gained during the course of the experiments in tobacco-growing should also have been lost.  I and a great many other people in this country are convinced that there is a field for the <Col N="184" /> greatest possible development in the tobacco industry.  My belief that there is a great future in tobacco prompts me to ask for the setting up of this Committee.  The Committee will not cost anything.  Deputies, I am sure, will volunteer to serve upon it.  I take it that the Minister is afraid to set up such a Committee.  If he is not afraid, why does he not allow it to be set up? The only conclusion anybody can come to is that he is afraid that any Committee will investigate the possibilities of this industry.  Reference has been made to a sum of £100,000 being lost to the taxpayer.  What about the dole that is paid in respect of unemployment?</P>

There is no reason whatsoever why they should not be so employed, and the Minister cannot give any explanation in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not apply with a tariff on tobacco of 8s. 2d. a pound; you have any amount of liberty there.  As long as the principle is followed here of declaring, without any examination of the case whatsoever, that an industry such as tobacco cannot be started, I fear that we will have to continue for a long time with an ill-developed agricultural industry, and, indeed, without any other forms of industry.  I spoke already on the subject of restrictions, and I read out just a few of them for the House.  The reason I did so was to show that only certain classes of people were selected to make a trial of tobacco-growing.  I read them out also in order to show that the Government of the time that put those rules and regulations into <Col N="185" /> force&mdash;it was the British Government&mdash; must have been very definitely convinced that there was the greatest amount of danger to the revenue in tobacco-growing; in other words, they were absolutely convinced that tobacco-growing in this country could be made a wonderful success, and they took every possible precaution not to allow it to be grown.  It is on record that for years after the British Government destroyed the industry in this country the farmers in the County Wexford, which is the county that was most famous for tobacco-growing, continued to grow the plant amongst the potato stalks in order to satisfy the taste they had cultivated for the home-produced tobacco.  The people of this country are in a very unfortunate position.  They pay the highest price for probably the rottenest flour in the world, and they pay the highest possible price for probably the rottenest tobacco in the world.  I do not know of any part of the world where people smoke the type of tobacco that we smoke here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If you go across to France you will find that the people there smoke their own home-grown tobacco.  In Germany the people smoke their own tobacco; but in this country we smoke what is known as Virginian tobacco and I may say that it is only here that that class of tobacco is smoked.  A similar condition applies in the case of the flour we use here.  In France you will not see that class of flour; Frenchmen would not use the type of white flour that is used here.  I have seen it stated that in Dublin those controlling the baking industry will not reduce the price of bread because the people are so critical and have such a highly-cultivated taste that they refuse to take anything else but a special type of flour.  Similarly we in this country are inclined to refuse everything else but a special type of tobacco.  This whole question of the tobacco industry will have to be examined before very long.  I do not know anything about the Minister's revenue, but I am quite confident that at this moment his revenue from tobacco is showing a very <Col N="186" /> considerable loss, and the reason for that is that the people are no longer able to buy it.  The conditions now applying to tobacco will have the same effect as the Intoxicating Liquor Bill has had upon the licensed trade.  Perhaps that might be a good thing, too, but at any rate I believe that the Minister is afraid he might lose some revenue if this Committee that is suggested were set up.  What is the position in regard to tobacco at the moment?  What is the position of the ordinary labourer, the man who is hardest hit?  The agricultural labourer to-day is not getting anything like a living wage.  That man is compelled to pay practically £9 each year in taxes if he smokes round or about the average amount of tobacco. I noticed in going through the country that most of the poor men have had to give up smoking, one of the little luxuries they had, because they could not possibly afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am not wrong in stating that the Minister at this moment is considering his income from tobacco. The revenue is bound to diminish.  It is altogether misleading to say that an industry for the growing of tobacco could not be started.  There is in existence at present such an industry.  It is concerned altogether with the manufacture of cheroots.  These cheroots, while imperfect in manufacture, yet have given very good results.  The excise rules and regulations are so severe that they impede that particular industry. The policy adopted in this country heretofore was to grow a very dark strong leaf, principally for pipe tobacco.  That was the policy of the Department and was preached by its instructors.  The people permitted to grow tobacco followed out that policy. But people's tastes change in the course of a hundred years, with the result that such a strong tobacco is now found not to be at all suitable and not in demand.  But no effort was made to develop the cheroot end of the industry, the reason being that the authorities knew perfectly well that if it were developed it would mean the cultivation of a taste for Irish home-grown tobacco.  In that way the industry would get into such a position that they could not prevent its further <Col N="187" /> development, and the authorities did not want that.</P>
    <P>The industry that is in existence at the moment has been working for the last twenty years, more or less.  Quite a satisfactory cheroot can be turned out by hands that have had special training.  The cheroot can be manufactured in the factory erected on the farm where the leaf is grown.  I believe I am not wrong in stating that this industry is a profitable one, and that more is made out of the growing of the tobacco leaf than from anything else the farmer produces.  I have it stated as a fact that nine people are employed in that industry at a living wage.  There is no use in the Minister trying to persuade the House that there is nothing in the industry.</P>
    <P>I say there is everything in it.  The manufacture of cheroots alone would, if encouraged, give a great deal of employment to farmers' sons and daughters.  In years to come the manufacture of pipe tobacco could be undertaken.  The attitude of the Minister is that he is convinced that no good can come from the development of the industry.  Yet he is afraid to set up a Committee that, after hearing the evidence could form an opinion itself.  The Minister knows that any Committee that might be selected in this House could not, after hearing evidence and getting the necessary proofs turn down the case for helping this industry.  The Minister <Col N="188" /> knows that and what he is afraid of is that if the Committee reported in favour of the industry he would lose revenue.  I sympathise with the Minister because I know he is hard pushed and that as the years pass he will get less revenue from tobacco.  I believe that in the end he will be compelled to establish more industries.</P>
    <P>Two industries that are peculiar to every country that has succeeded in holding its own are tobacco and wheat growing.  France grows more tobacco than any other crop with the exception of wheat.  There are some people, of course, who may scoff at those ideas. That, however, will not deter those of us who happen to know something about these matters from speaking on them.  In England at the present time, I suppose half the population scoff at Mr. Baldwin because he talks about wheat growing.  That is due to the unfortunate ignorance that prevails amongst the people.  I do not intend to delay the House longer on this matter.  Personally, I sincerely regret that the Minister could not see his way to agree to set up the Committee asked for.  That Committee could either turn down the question submitted to it or admit that something might be done to help the industry by relieving it, not perhaps from the duty, but from the restrictions that interfere so much with its progress at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Vote for the relief of distress was introduced last November, the Government had great lip sympathy for the unemployed, particularly those in the rural districts. We were told by responsible Deputies on the other side not to be talking on this subject and wasting the time of the House, but rather to let the Vote go through, so that the work could be gone on with immediately, in order to relieve the prevalent distress which the Government speakers alleged was due to the bad season.  If there was one thing apparent to-day in the reply which the Parliamentary Secretary gave to me, and the reply which the Minister for Finance gave to Deputy Davin, it was the insincerity of the Government in this matter.  That was quite apparent to us when we coupled the evasive answers with the statement of the Minister for Finance when this Vote was being introduced, namely, that provision would be made at the end of the financial year, if this whole sum had not been expended, to carry forward the balance to be spent in the new financial year.  In other words, at a time when unemployment is being relieved to some extent by farming work, for some reason the balance is to be carried forward and spent on the relief of unemployment which would not then exist to the extent which it <Col N="191" /> existed during the winter months.  The President, speaking on the matter, stressed the large amount of unemployment in the rural areas.  We find from the answers of the Parliamentary Secretary that out of a total of £300,000 only £69,000 has been earmarked to be spent in the rural parts by the Land Commission.  That is the sum that was to be spent, but it has not been spent.  In contrast with that we have the following: In 1924-5, when £385,000 was spent on the relief of unemployment, £186,000 was spent by the Land Commission; in 1925-6, when £336,000 was spent, £137,000 was spent by the Land Commission; in 1927-8, when £101,000 was spent, £51,000 was spent by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that in those years by the month of February most of that money had been spent.  Work was started immediately after Christmas and was carried on through January and February into March.  I have spoken to Deputies of all Parties in the House on the subject and I find that there has been practically no money spent up to now on the relief of unemployment by the Land Commission or by any other Government Department.  We can, therefore, understand the Parliamentary Secretary's evasion in his answers, that he could not give the amount spent.  It would mean a tremendous amount of work to make up what proportion of the £69,000 was spent up to a week ago, say.  Neither could the Minister for Finance give the number of persons employed as a result of this grant. The gentlemen who leave that very perfect Department on a Tuesday to carry out their work in the various counties and return home at the weekend surely have time in their hard socialistic week from Tuesday to Friday to get the necessary information for the Parliamentary Secretary.  The amount is so small that it would be a disgraceful answer to give in the House.  It would be an indictment of the Government's absolute neglect of the unemployed and of their attempt to carry forward this sum, so that if an election is suitable in the Summer of this year this money can be spent <Col N="192" /> in an attempt to bribe and fool the electorate.</P>
    <P>I notice that in Westmeath we have got the very large sum of approximately £400.  We are getting a slap for the slap we gave the Government last June.  It is the smallest sum yet given out.  Even so, I should like to know where the £400 is being spent or has been spent, whether in its allocation the Government have taken into account the most populated areas and the areas with the greatest number of small holders.  Have they based their allocation on the returns of the census? Have they taken, for instance, the Coole electoral area where there is twice the population, twice the number of small holders, and three times the number of unemployed in any other area in Westmeath?  I believe they have not and that they will not spend a threepenny bit there because they do not get any sort of vote there.  The unemployed can exist on home help.  Deputies who are on public boards and who have a knowledge of the conditions in the Free State know that the demand for home help is greater this year than ever before.</P>
    <P>Memoranda galore has been sent up to the Land Commission and we are told to prepare schemes.  We prepare schemes and so the matter goes on. Inspector after inspector is sent down. When all fruit fails and the work is obviously work that should be done and work that would give relief to the unemployed, we are asked next will the County Council maintain that work if done by the Land Commission. These questions were not asked in 1924-'25 or in 1927-'28.  What is the reason of their being asked now? Where works have been started have all these stipulations been put up? I doubt it very much.  I notice that notwithstanding the anxiety in this House to relieve unemployment in the rural areas £75,000 has been earmarked for the borough and urban areas to be administered through the Department of Local Government&mdash;a sum which is in excess of the sum given for the rural areas through the Irish Land Commission, which is not spent, but which is about to be spent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> After three months of doing nothing on the part of the Land Commission surely they should make some endeavour now at this late moment to get on with this work?  They can have their election in April and have the gain of spending the money before it. But surely, in common humanity, in view of the serious unemployment, they should try and spend the money that they have at their disposal during the next six weeks, and not be scheming and shamming the way they have been since they passed this vote last November.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the unsatisfactory reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary, I must say that I heartily endorse every word which has been spoken by Deputy Kennedy.  I represent the same constituency as the Deputy, and I must say that out of the scheme of work sent forward to the Land Commission by the Westmeath County Council, and I am sure also by the Longford County Council, very little work was carried out by the Department.  I was in the Co. Longford last Sunday and made inquiries there as to the work carried out by the Irish Land Commission and I found very little had been carried out.  I have a case in my mind, and I regard it as an unpleasant thing to have to mention it in this House, where a ganger employed in the County Longford on a scheme of relief work is an old age pensioner. There are also instances where sons of large farmers have been employed and where people for whom the work is intended do not get any employment. I do not hold that these relief works were not intended for small farmers.  I visited a little town in the County Westmeath where a great deal of poverty exists and I have seen children there in their bare feet which I have not seen for years before.  No work has been carried out there except a small system of drainage on a little river.  The work carried out lasted about a fortnight and was finished last week, I am informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not make an appeal in this House for any particular town.  I know that the town in which I live <Col N="194" /> does not come under the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, but work entrusted to the Irish Land Commission to make bog roads and to carry out the drainage of rivers and land ought to be carried out in every little town in Westmeath and Longford.  As far as I am concerned I do not make an appeal for any particular place.  I do not care what Fianna Fáil or Cumann na nGaedheal are doing, but I myself have sent in several schemes to the Irish Land Commission and I have got acknowledgments from them. Land Commission inspectors have visited several of the places with which these schemes deal, but there are a number of cases in which the inspectors have not paid a visit to the area with which the schemes are concerned. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to take a note of these places and to send inspectors to these places that have not yet been inspected. In the districts concerned with a great many of these schemes a list of the unemployed in these areas has been submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have these schemes examined and to carry out the works in these areas that contain the largest number of unemployed at the moment. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear in mind what I have said.  I have sent in schemes from several towns and villages in Longford as well as in Westmeath.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will send down his inspectors and see that as many as possible of these works are carried out in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>If I mistake not the Parliamentary Secretary when giving a list of the places or counties in which expenditure had been incurred under the Relief Vote made no mention of the County Waterford.  I did not intend speaking at all on this matter, but a few days ago I got a petition from a small area in the county in connection with employment given by the Forestry Department.  Local men complained that men have been brought in from outside areas to do this particular work, while in that particular <Col N="195" /> area there are 80 unemployed men.  They complain that it is not right that work in that particular district should be given to men brought in from other districts when there are so many unemployed in their area. Deputy Kennedy complained that only the small sum of £400 has been expended in his constituency, but my complaint is that in my constituency no money at all has been spent under this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how Deputy Kennedy arrived at the sum of £69,000 allocated by the Irish Land Commission.  He then takes it that that is the only money that is being expended.  Deputy Kennedy was aware that this grant was available and he had an opportunity of informing his supporters that that was so.  The Deputy was present at a number of meetings in his constituency, but he did not inform the people that the money was available.  I do not know why.  There may, however, be a reason for it.  I have gone through the constituency and on every occasion I made it known to the public there that this money was available.  We got a number of schemes submitted. I think in all there were 324 schemes or something like that number.  I do not anticipate that all these will be carried out.  I am satisfied that the sum which he alleges was left to the Department of the Irish Land Commission is not at all adequate.  However, it takes a considerable time to inspect those works, to report upon them, and have them sanctioned by the Land Commission.  So far as I know and I am familiar with the work in Longford and Westmeath, there are in operation at present approximately fifty works or schemes.  That is not a very bad achievement in the space of a month or two.  The number of men employed in these in Longford alone is 151.  I am aware that there are a number of other works under consideration and I believe they are going to be sanctioned.  A certain amount of money is going to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is concerned with one Department and one Department only.  I <Col N="196" /> certainly think that a very large sum of money should be available and should be allocated by the Minister for Finance for these works and for this reason&mdash;that the money goes entirely on manual labour and thus gives the greatest amount of employment. This is reproductive work. One can always see after the expenditure of this money that something has been done and some benefit has been conferred on the district.  The work that the Land Commission has been doing throughout the country has been very beneficial and it is very satisfactory work.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health are dealing with other schemes which mainly concern urban districts and towns in which town commissioners are functioning. A considerable amount of money was also allocated by the Local Government Department to these towns and districts.  But that does not represent anything like the sum of money that is being spent on any one area.  There is a further allocation of money under this relief grant and this money is going directly to the benefit of the farmers.  I refer to the money that is being spent by the Department of Agriculture in which a great deal of labour is employed.  A considerable amount of work is being done under that Department alone.  I know that in one area £1,000 is being made available and the people of the country are taking advantage of the opportunity. I do not think that it is the fault of the Department of Lands and Fisheries nor the fault of the Government that more money has not been spent on the relief of unemployment in this constituency. As for the county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a reference made that large farmers were employed on those relief works to the <Col N="197" /> prejudice of the unemployed men in the district.  I know perfectly well the conditions that obtain where accommodation roads are being made in a number of districts.  The farmers are giving their labour and horses free so that the money that is available goes entirely to the unemployed men. That works out in this way that more unemployed benefit by the money available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryBroderick" hpid="Mr. H. Broderick Mr. H. Broderick">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to this arrangement money is being made available for the labourers that otherwise would not come to them at all.  That money would otherwise go in payment to horse owners.  That shows the spirit in which the people of the country are availing of the grant.  I certainly think that a sum considerably larger than has been mentioned here should be made available by the Irish Land Commission to carry out the works and schemes submitted to them. But I think the money should go largely to the small class of drainage works.  For instance schemes costing, say, £20, £30 or £40 should be dealt with preferably.  In this way the money would be of more benefit to the unemployed.  I know that the moneys already spent in Longford have gone very beneficially to the relief of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to explain the curious circumstances by which a number of counties are not getting anything out of this Vote.  It is surely inconceivable that there are counties where there is absolutely no unemployment in rural areas.  I am particularly interested in one of these counties.  It is a county in which over £16,000 is being paid in home help, and over 50 per cent. of that money is being paid to able-bodied men.  Yet the Land Commission does not find that they are under any necessity to provide money there for the relief of unemployment.  I understand that the <Col N="198" /> two chief tests for getting work done out of this Vote are unemployment in the particular area and the social utility of the schemes proposed.  In that county schemes have been put forward that would be of very great utility, for instance, schemes that would enable last year's turf to be saved even yet.  Such schemes are badly needed.  There is very considerable unemployment in the County Wicklow and I would like to have some explanation as to why the Land Commission does not find it necessary to spend any money there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Moore in protesting against the delay on the part of the Land Commission in sanctioning schemes. In the county that I represent, there is a great lot of unemployment. Schemes have been put up that would be of great utility and yet they have not been sanctioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all drainage schemes.  In reply to Deputy Kennedy, I am yet at a loss to understand why he regarded my reply to-day as unsatisfactory.  The Deputy's speech has not made it clear to me that my reply was unsatisfactory, and Deputy Broderick's speech did not help to clear the issue in any way whatsoever.  The Land Commission, after all, is only one Government Department responsible for the expenditure of the relief grant.  Deputies must remember that a big proportion of this money has been allocated to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, a big proportion has been allocated to the Department of Fisheries for the purpose of carrying out schemes in the Gaeltacht areas, a certain proportion has been given to the Board of Works, a certain proportion to the Department of Agriculture and certain proportions have been given to other Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been allocated about £80,000 and approximately £60,000 of that amount has been already spent, while the rest of it has been earmarked for expenditure.  It was made perfectly clear by the Minister for Finance, when introducing this Vote, <Col N="199" /> that on this occasion he expected that the State would get full value for the expenditure of this money.  It is perfectly true, as Deputy Kennedy has said, that a great deal of money was expended by way of relief under previous grants, between the years 1924 and 1928, but it must also be borne in mind that a good deal of that money was not spent to the very best advantage.  There was quite a lot of very bad work done.  On this occasion, at least so far as the Land Commission is concerned, I have taken particular pains to see that the work done under the Land Commission's portion of the relief grant, at all events, is up to a very high standard, that it is work that the Land Commission and the State will be proud of.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that memorials have been received from many counties, including Wexford and Wicklow, with regard to certain works that would be of real utility in these counties.  As a matter of fact, the Land Commission intend to do a certain number of these works, but it would be quite impossible for them to do all the work in respect of which memorials have been received.  Memorials have been received from Waterford in regard to certain drainage work.  I think Deputies will agree that this is not the time of the year to do any work on drainage schemes, that it would be uneconomic for any Government Department to undertake such work at this particular season of the year. Consequently, we have left these schemes over until the months of May, June and July.  I hope that a certain portion of this money will be revoted after 31st March next, and we will be able to devote a portion of it at least to those works.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Kennedy on another point, as a matter of fact inspectors were not sent.  No inspector was sent to report on certain works that we have undertaken in Westmeath, for the very good reason that these works were reported on at least two years ago.  When we were in a position to spend money out of funds at our disposal naturally we arranged for these <Col N="200" /> works to be undertaken.  The county councils have always been asked to undertake responsibility for maintaining works on which the Land Commission spent money out of the Relief Vote.</P>
