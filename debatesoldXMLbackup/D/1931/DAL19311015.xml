      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state the outcome, if any, of the discussions which he stated on November 19th, 1930, were proceeding between the Currency Commission and the Banks concerning the regulations to be made prescribing the times and intervals at which and the form in which, shareholding Banks shall publish their annual balance sheets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the discussions, to which the Deputy refers, between the Currency Commission and the Banks, it has been arranged that all Banks will in future issue their balance sheets on the 31st December in each year.  It has also been arranged that the item for notes outstanding will be shown in a uniform manner on all balance sheets, so that an accurate comparison can be made between one Bank and another and <Col N="178" /> between one period and another.  In addition, the Banks have agreed to furnish the Currency Commission with statements segregating as between the Saorstát and elsewhere the deposits and the advances appearing in their accounts, and this information is published from time to time in the Irish Trade Journal.  Further discussions are still taking place and, in view of this fact, I have refrained from issuing regulations under Section 44 of the Currency Act of 1927.</P>

      <P>I beg formally to move the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the Second Reading of this measure.  There is an aphorism that every instance of the infliction of punishment is an instance of the failure of that punishment. Like most aphorisms, that is but a half truth.  Crime must be punished and no criminal code can so reform man as to obviate the necessity for punishment.  It is significant, however, that the coercive measures <Col N="179" /> such as the Firearms Act of 1925, the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, and the Juries Protection Act of 1929, have failed to achieve the purpose for which ostensibly they were designed.  They are no remedy, and force is no remedy for the national, political and economic diseases which afflict the body politic. Either the prognoses and diagnoses have been wrong or those responsible for applying the remedies have proved their utter incompetence.</P>
      <P>If, after eight years' treatment, the disease has grown worse, it is surely time to try other remedies and other advisers.  We have suggested other remedies.  We are willing, if given the chance, to apply those remedies.  We think that those matters could be remedied without the display of force and coercion evidenced in this Bill. The President spoke yesterday about removing the menace once and for all. The first thing to do is to remove the root cause.  Deputy Morrissey spoke of two alternatives&mdash;giving this power to the Executive or power to outside bodies.  We know not who they are. There is another alternative.  They should let some body take office who believe they can govern without such measures as this, and let the present Government resign.  We genuinely believe that we could govern without such measures as this.  No Party in this House, and no Deputy in this House, desires to see Communism, Atheism or Godlessness spread in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy questions that I would like him to name the Deputy whom he suspects.  Unemployment and hunger are fertile soil in which to sow the seeds of Communism. There is a danger, slight as yet, thank God, but I have realised it through speaking to the homeless people in Dublin and to people in Kerry and Connemara who knew hardly a word of English, to whom the word Communism was unknown and who know very little about Russia or Russian propaganda. I have spoken to such people within recent months.  They said to me &ldquo;We want work; we do not want charity.&rdquo;  That cry is growing more <Col N="180" /> clamant day by day and it must be answered.  Until it is answered you will not remedy existing evils, not even by Bills such as this.  The people whom I have met in the Gaeltacht are growing more insistent day by day in their demands.  Nobody can accuse them of Godlessness, for religion is woven into the warp and the woof of their daily lives, as the President and others on the opposite benches well know.  They demand the right to live and such demand is not against Catholic teaching, as even the Minister for Defence will admit, as is proved by Catholic teaching and philosophy, by the Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII and by the more recent Encyclicals of his successors.  It is quite in consonance with Catholic teaching.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence yesterday gave us a great disquisition on the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, with a slight tinge of Calvinism, as to the spiritual direction the State should give, and other matters of that kind. It would appear, in fact, that the Executive Council are now displacing the Hierarchy.  So much has been said on the national and the political aspects of the question that I do not need to deal with them; it would be tedious reiteration to do so.  In the debate on the Land Commission Estimates I referred to the extraordinary amount of land still in the hands of a few people in this country despite the operation of the Land Acts and the Congested Districts Board over many years.  Emigration, owing to economic conditions in America and elsewhere, has been largely stopped.  There are young men on the farms, two or three or four sons, and they are naturally throwing hungry eyes on this land which they see only half tilled and in some instances hardly used at all. To ask for that land is not adopting an anti-Catholic attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Property has its rights.  No man disputes the right of private property, but the State has a paramount right, giving due compensation for the use of that land for the benefit of the community. The sooner they set about doing so the better for the peace of this land.  Yesterday the Minister for <Col N="181" /> Defence had, apparently, little respect for the Constitution.  We are glad that he had such little respect.  The President spoke in glowing terms of the encomiums that the Constitution has received from authorities on constitutional law in foreign lands.  He enlarged on the full political rights, the untrammelled liberty, that the Constitution gives the citizen, and then he advocated this Bill as necessary to protect the citizen from the invasion of his rights.</P>
    <P>In 140 years, more or less, there have been eighteen amendments to the American Constitution.  In nine years we have had twenty-six alterations in our Constitution.  I cannot call this Bill, the seventeenth amendment, for it is the very abrogation of that Constitution.  What were these amendments that we have had?  Did they tend towards the enlargement of public right or getting on the road to freedom?  If we look in that direction we may find some cause for the present unrest when the Vice-President of the Executive Council declares that he thinks we were better off with six counties, a British province, and this section of it not absolutely free. If we tried to get the land divided, tried to protect Irish industries, put tariffs on, gave employment and better housing, and could get a Government that would at least march on the road to freedom, we would be much more likely to get peace than by coercion.</P>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies on the benches opposite realise exactly what they are doing in voting for this measure? Section 2 of the Constitution is referred to in this Bill and then we get 2 (a) in the Bill.  After 2 (a) there is a blank, throwing into disregard, whenever the Executive Council likes, the Constitution they were so proud of.  Fundamental rights were referred to by the President as covered by nine or ten sections of this Bill.  Five or six sections deal with the Executive and eight sections with the judiciary.  It is for the declaration which expresses freedom of the person, the subordination of the Executive to the people of this country, the independence of the judiciary and such matters that this Constitution has been praised in other <Col N="182" /> lands for the good things in it.  The Minister for Defence yesterday referred to the awkward period between the failure of the civil courts and the setting up of martial law.  Was it a prophecy? One reading this Bill must realise that the setting up of martial law would be less drastic than the measure now before us.  Martial law has been declared to be no law, but at any rate those who administer martial law are subject afterwards to the jurisdiction of the civil courts, and even if they get an Indemnity Act, any outrageous performance of theirs not warranted by the occasion may be judged. But under this Bill there is no appeal, there is no revision.  Nobody can question the doings of these military tribunals, so that this measure is much more drastic than any martial law could be.</P>
    <P>Martial law cannot be declared under this Constitution until the courts have declared that there is a state of siege, a state of war, or armed rebellion.  Have we that armed rebellion now?  Is there a state of siege?  If you think there is, be honest about it and say so, and if not, do not camouflage your extra martial law under the name of an amendment to the Constitution.  The civil courts under this Bill will have no right to declare whether there is a state of armed rebellion.  They will have no right to revise any sentence passed by a courtmartial.  In Article 6 of the Constitution there is the right of personal freedom.  Article 7 of the Constitution deals with the inviolability of the dwelling, and Articles 9 and 19 with freedom of speech and the right of public meeting. In this Bill you are going even further than the British who have no express declaration of some of these rights, but in order to make assurance doubly sure we put them in print and then wipe them out by a vote of this House.  I wonder do you realise where you are going?  Not only will these military tribunals be secret, not only is there to be no revision over them, but the Article which allows the Press to comment on them is wiped out of your Constitution. The Executive Council, if they so <Col N="183" /> desire, may prevent and do by this Act abolish the right of free expression of opinion about such matters in this House.  Everything subsequent to Article 2 is abrogated by this Bill. If you pass it you may find yourself in an internment camp for referring to any act of a military court in this House, and the Press daring to do it outside will be suppressed and fined.</P>
    <P>These are serious matters.  There is in this Constitution an express declaration of the freedom of the Press.  The British have no such thing.  But under this we are to over-rule the Criminal Libel (Amendment) Act of 1888.  What did that Act do?  It allowed privilege for a fair and accurate report in any newspaper of judicial proceedings&mdash;that is to go&mdash;newspaper reports of public meetings, and in this Act it is said that no criminal prosecution shall be commenced against any proprietor, publisher, editor or any person responsible for the publication of a newspaper for any libel published therein without the order of a Judge in Chambers first having been obtained.  That Judge goes and the military are to be the Judges. In the Constitution you laid down that certain courts were to be set up in this country.  You not only declared the citizens' rights, but you provided remedies. You are abolishing both the rights and the remedies.  Both are gone when this comes into force and it is to come into force as soon as an Order is passed by the Executive Council. We all know that that Order will be passed if this Bill gets through. What is the use of talking of defending the rights of the citizens?  The President tells us that the ordinary citizen may go about his lawful business without fear of molestation even under this Bill.  I leave it to you to consider the Constitution of these Courts.  Five military officers not skilled in law.  No judicial calm there.  I am not making suggestions against them, but I say this to you on all sides of the House: you know the history of Ireland for the last eight, nine or ten years.  Do you think there would be an unbiased trial for one who fought against them if brought up under this Act?  Three will form the Court, two may give the judgment. <Col N="184" /> Where have they stood in the last few years.  Fighting one another perhaps on the hillside.  One is to be the Judge and Jury and there is no appeal.  Any Civic Guard may arrest people whom he suspects of being about to commit any crime which he considers seditious.</P>
    <P>Who is to define what this sedition is?  The opinion of the Guard arresting the man and keeping him seventy-two hours detained, and it is said that during that period any Guard may question him and if he does not give the full information with regard to anybody whom he knows to be concerned in such matters he may be punished. How do they know what information he has?  Would it be possible for a Guard to bring a man into barracks and get a relay of Guards to examine him for seventy-two hours without sleep, which is really more serious than any third degree methods?  Is not that a possibility under this Bill in connection with the bad blood that existed, unfortunately, between different sections of nationalists in this country? Do you think that that is only a remote possibility or that it might not happen within a week of this Bill being passed?</P>
    <P>We are told that under the Constitution that Executive is responsible to the people.  According to a section of this Bill members of this Dáil may be &mdash;I cannot say elected&mdash;appointed by the Governor-General.  The Dáil may be adjourned for a month by the Governor-General.  What is to stop the adjournment of this House for a month?  To get it to meet for a day and then to adjourn it for another month and to set up a dictatorship without changing a line of this Bill? Do you not think that is a possibility? If certain measures have failed in the line of force perhaps it may be claimed that this is failing too and that more drastic measures, namely the adjournment of the Dáil, after meeting one day in every thirty-one, might be justified under this amendment of the Constitution.  Under the Constitution you have the independence of the Judges.  What independence will those Judges have who will try these men for their lives?  I ask you to envisage this for a moment&mdash;a man seventy-two <Col N="185" /> hours under questioning in a Guards' barracks, tried by a military court, no appeal and no reference in the Press. There is no appeal to any court and there is absolute immunity for the court that tried him.  There is the possible prohibition of any discussion in this House as being against the public interests.  Do you feel easy when you think of such a thing as that?</P>
    <P>I ask you honestly, do you not think that it could happen, and even if it only happened in one case that a man was sentenced to death in the wrong, and that the sentence was carried out, would you like to accept responsibility for placing these powers in the hands of a military court?  We think that much harm is being done and much unrest caused by political tests.  Under this Bill anybody charged before these courts and convicted before them will lose his employment under the Government or a local body, and will lose his superannuation or his right to pension.  Are such steps as that likely to bring about peace?</P>
    <P>In the Appendix to this Bill certain crimes which are to come under it are set out&mdash;things mentioned in the Juries Protection Act, the Firearms Act, the Treasonable Offences Act&mdash;on many of those a man is to be tried for his life.  I submit that under all these statutes there is a statutory penalty fixed for the crimes, and all through this Bill in addition to that this Court may inflict such punishment as it thinks proper.  There is no statutory limit to any sentence that it may pass&mdash;such punishment as they may think proper.  Would it not be right to fix some limit?  There is a sufficient penalty, one would imagine, for perjury.  Under this, not only statutory penalties may be inflicted, but such other penalties as the military courts think there should be. I ask you to weigh up these things, and seeing the possibility, whether you think you are going to make for peace in this country by passing the Bill now before you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really very little to be said in regard to this measure.  I stated yesterday that in Section 2 of this measure we are in fact making a new Constitution for the <Col N="186" /> Free State.  That statement has not been disproved by anything that was said from the Front Bench of the Government Party.  I asked the reason of the urgency on the part of the Government of getting this Bill through the House in two or three days.  No satisfactory case whatever was made to show why it was necessary that the Bill should become law within three days, denying to this House the right it was supposed to have of discussing fully any measure which was brought before it, denying the Deputies the right to give their views or to represent the views of their constituents, to go back to their constituents and consult them with regard to it, and to come here and express these views.</P>
      <P>No sufficient reason has been put up why that course should be adopted. The only conclusion one can come to with regard to that is that they do not want to give the opportunity to the country of studying this measure to see what it entails.  They are afraid of the rising agitation in the country against the measure if they did not put it into law as an accomplished fact before the people had really time to study its provisions.  I believe it is the most drastic measures that has been introduced into this House since it was set up.  We are asked to pass it into law without being given any opportunity whatever to amend any of the provisions in it.  Even though a Deputy may be prepared to accept some portion of the measure and to amend another portion of it he has no opportunity of doing that.  He must take it as it is thrown at him by the Executive Council.  In fact, it simply means that the House is asked to hand over all powers of every kind whatsoever to the Executive Council and to have full and complete faith in them. I wonder what would be said to the executive of any trade union who would come forward and make a proposals of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a common comment in regard to this measure <Col N="187" /> that there is nothing in it that any law-abiding citizen need be afraid of. There is nothing in this measure that any law-abiding citizen need fear if the 5,000 Gárdaí or the 4,000 or 5,000 members of the Defence Forces could be said to be absolutely infallible.  I have a great deal of faith in the common-sense and judgment of the vast majority of the Gárda Síochána.  I believe that in the vast majority of cases they will carry out any work that is entrusted to them, under this measure or any other measure, with calmness and judgment, but it is asking too much of the ordinary citizen to ask him to believe that every member of the Gárda Síochána and every member of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann will carry out this impartially, without any suggestion whatever that no law-abiding citizen will come under suspicion of any one member of the Gárda Síochána or any one member of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies fully realise the extent of the powers that are proposed to be given to every member of the Gárda Síochána and of the Defence Forces&mdash;the soldiers&mdash;under Part III. of the Bill.  Any member of the Gárda Síochána or of the Defence Forces, with a reservation in the case of a non-commissioned member of the Defence Forces who can only do it if he is authorised either generally or specially by the Minister for Defence&mdash; and a general order may be given by the Minister for Defence&mdash;may stop any citizen in the street at any time. The citizen may be apprehended, searched and taken to the Gárda Síochána barracks or some other place of detention for seventy-two hours, and there is no remedy whatever available to the citizen if that is done.  He can be detained.  All that is necessary is that the member of the Gárda Síochána or the member of the Defence Forces who stops him in the street when he is going about his business, states on oath that he suspects him to be a person who is about to commit a crime or has been about to commit a crime, or thinks that he is in some way associated with somebody who is about to commit a crime or is thinking of <Col N="188" /> committing a crime.  That being done, there is no right to cross-examine the Gárda or to bring forward rebutting evidence.  There is no use in bringing forward rebutting evidence.  &ldquo;A simple statement on oath shall be conclusive evidence incapable of being rebutted or questioned by cross-examination, rebutting evidence or otherwise, that such member did at that time so suspect such person, and was then entitled to stop and interrogate such person under this section.&rdquo;  As I said, no law-abiding citizen has anything to fear if he had supreme and absolute faith in every single member of the Gárda Síochána and of the Defence Forces.  But that is asking too much. I am prepared, as I say, to go a long way in regard to the members of the Gárda Síochána.  I am not in the same position to speak of all the members of the Army.  Even going that distance, is there no danger to the law-abiding citizen under powers of this kind?  Is there any Deputy here who will say there is not?  Remember that any member of the Gárda Síochána can ask him to give a full account of his movements during any specified period, and that if he fails or refuses to give such account or gives an account which is incomplete, false or misleading, then he can be sent forward to the Tribunal and tried by the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the punishment which the Tribunal may inflict upon him.  I am thinking of the law-abiding citizen in this case.  I have no sympathy with the man who is not a law-abiding citizen.  I am thinking of the law-abiding citizen whose only safety from being put into that position is the integrity of every single member of the Gárda Síochána and of the Defence Forces.  That is his only safeguard from being put into that position.  I ask Deputies in this House if they found themselves in that position and were asked to give a full and complete account of their movements for any specified period that may be mentioned&mdash;last week, a fortnight ago or a month ago &mdash;how many of them would be in a position to do it, or how many of them would be prepared to do it?</P>

      <P>Really this is a serious matter.  These are the provisions of the Bill.  These are the powers we are asked to give to the Executive.  I am not one of those who say the Executive are going to go out and do wild things, vindictive things, absolutely foolish things.  I have never made statements of that kind.  At the same time, I do want some measure of right for the ordinary citizen.  If there are people who commit crimes, if there are people who do not deserve the liberty they have there is no reason why the liberty of all the citizens should be interfered with in the drastic manner set out in this Bill.  You have this Tribunal that is set up.  I stated when the Juries Act was under consideration that if it were proved that the jury system had broken down in regard to certain classes of crime I would be quite willing and ready to agree to the setting up of some form of special court that would deal with these particular classes of crime.  That is my position now.</P>

      <P>They would not do this duty because it was not part of the terms of their original appointment. It is well for judges, who can afford to take up that attitude.  A great many servants of the State and employees of private companies can not afford to do that.  They must accept new terms and conditions of service when these terms are put up to them.  But even that difficulty could be got over.  Surely it would be possible to appoint men of legal training to that special court&mdash;men who would be able to weigh evidence, men of judicial minds who would know the value of evidence, men who could distinguish between evidence and mere suspicion or hearsay.  I believe that among the legal profession in this country men of repute and standing could be found who would be prepared to try this kind of case.  The appointment of these men would be some safeguard that evidence adduced before the tribunal would be given its proper weight, and that the tribunal would act in accordance with the evidence.  The President has not said whether or not that was tried or the reason&mdash;</P>

      <P>I confess quite honestly that I cannot see the foolishness of the proposition.  If any member of the Government could point out the difficulty or the folly in connection with it I would be grateful.  I see <Col N="191" /> very great objections to putting men into the position of judges just because they chance to wear a military uniform. Men who have no legal training are to be put into a position in which they will try people for their lives.  I think that that is more drastic action on the part of the Executive Council than appointing legal men to do the work.</P>
      <P>When complaint was made yesterday that these powers were entirely too drastic, the Minister for Defence remarked that it was better that they should get more extended powers than were necessary than that they should not get sufficient power.  In fact, he made the case: &ldquo;Give us all the powers that we would want in any possible circumstances, and you may trust us to use only those powers which we require.&rdquo;  Although the Minister gave us a lecture on Catholic philosophy, he spoke quite contrary to the correct doctrine in regard to that matter.  The law, according to the Encyclical of the Pope, must not undertake more or go further than is required for the remedy of the evil or the removal of the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear on platforms frequently the plea that this Government should be returned to power because it has secured peace and order in the country. We shall probably hear more of that between now and the next general election.  When, after nine years, the Government come before us and ask for those drastic powers, it does not seem to me to be the best form of testimonial in support of the statement made on their platforms that they have secured peace, order and good government.  The Minister for Finance, speaking yesterday in the Seanad, said that the disturbance in the country was due to a handful of thugs, supported by a number of dupes and rogues.  Let us accept that, for the moment, as the position.  What circumstances would induce any considerable number of our people to fall in behind a handful of thugs or a number of rogues?  Surely that is a question which deserves the examination of the Executive Council.  Surely we have not so far lost faith in the good sense or in the morality of our <Col N="192" /> people as to believe that without any apparent or well-founded reason they would fall in behind &ldquo;a handful of thugs or a number of rogues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, yesterday, and Deputy Fahy, to-day, called attention to the circumstances which make the growth of this movement possible. Members of our Party have also referred to these circumstances on different occasions and I have no hesitation in saying that the main cause of the trouble will be found in the economic and social conditions which prevail in a great part of this country.</P>
    <P>In these conditions will be found fruitful soil for the sowing of these pernicious doctrines.  Should it not be our aim and object, and especially the aim and object of the Government, to get right down to the root causes of the trouble?  Should it not be our aim to remove the causes which induce our people to fall in behind those men?  If the causes which lead our people to attach themselves to those men and to swallow their doctrines were removed, it would go much further, in my opinion, towards securing the conditions we want to see than will the bringing forward of drastic measures of this kind.  We all know that this menace has grown and spread concurrently with the increase in unemployment and depression, due to economic and social causes.  We have not the same problem that many other countries have.  The problem here is simpler than it is in great industrial countries. It is much easier for us to find a solution of our social and economic difficulties than it is for England, America, or Germany to find a solution of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done in the last nine months?  What is being done now to bring about a revolutionary reform in our social and economic conditions in order to stop the growth of this menace among us? I urge the Government to direct their attention to the causes which make these doctrines possible and which make it possible that people, men and women, in out-of-the-way districts all over the country, far removed from towns, will listen to the preaching of those people who have raised their <Col N="193" /> heads amongst us.  That will be done until the social and economic conditions under which our people live and labour are changed.  Where they see poverty and hunger in the midst of plenty, while they see these conditions round about them, many dupes will be found, because the temptation is very strong and the people preaching these doctrines are very clever.  They know the lines to follow, and it is only by attempting to remove the conditions which make men listen to these doctrines that the real solution of the difficulty that faces us at the present time will be found.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to make an earnest effort to deal with the social conditions in this country.  They are very fond of saying, and I agree with them, that we must not be guided by what happens in England and other countries. Surely it is possible to find a solution in our own country for the economic and social difficulties that face us here.  Men who are employed and have the means of livelihood, men who find themselves living under fair conditions are very slow indeed to listen to the preaching of people who say there must be confusion and there must be chaos and there must be revolution created in the country.  The man in employment drawing good wages, who sees his family growing up around him with opportunities opening up for them is not anxious to be a revolutionary or to alter the conditions under which he lives.  But the man who is in despair and who sees nothing before him but hunger and no chance for his young people is apt to grasp at anything that promises to better the conditions under which he is compelled to live at the present time.  I think it is along these lines that the solution will be found and I think the Government are making a big mistake even from their own point of view, giving them full credit for good intentions, in introducing this drastic measure without having made any attempt whatsoever to remove the causes that give rise to the necessity for it.</P>
    <P>I believe the people who will welcome this Bill most in this country are the very people that it is intended to <Col N="194" /> get at.  I honestly and sincerely believe that.  It will give them further excuse to go through the country, sow seeds of sedition and cause more trouble.  I believe that that will happen.  You may deal with these but if you do you will find those that you deal with elevated into the position of martyrs, and you will find others coming forward to take their places.  I strongly oppose this measure.  I strongly oppose the drastic interference it makes with the liberty of individuals.  It was said here yesterday and loudly applauded, and it was referred to again to-day by Deputy Fahy, that if there was to be a choice between giving full liberty to the gunmen and to the murderers of Superintendent Curtin and giving full liberty to the Government, then, of course, full liberty should be given to the Government.  No one disagrees with that; everyone accepts it. But that is not the alternative.  No one wants full liberty for the gunmen. No one wants to give any liberty to them if you could find them&mdash;none at all.  The trouble is to find them.  The trouble is to convict them, and I have offered a solution which I am prepared to support with regard to their conviction.</P>
    <P>Nothing that I have ever heard of has been so drastic as the powers asked for under this Bill.  We are asked to hand over complete and absolute power by this Bill to the Executive Council, and the Executive Council or any Minister on his certificate can make anything an offence under the last section of the Bill, which provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any offence whatsoever (whether committed before or after this Article was inserted in this Constitution or before or after Sections 4 to 34 of this Article came into force) in respect of which an Executive Minister certifies in writing under his hand that to the best of his belief the act constituting such offence was done with the object of impairing or impeding the machinery of government or the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has only to certify. The present Ministers may not always be on the Government Bench; other <Col N="195" /> Ministers may some day take their places and may find in that Article an excuse for doing something that they would otherwise have no law or authority to do.  This is simply a question of asking us to hand over complete and absolute power.  It would be far better for them not to go to the trouble at all of drafting this Bill but rather to say &ldquo;the Executive wants complete and absolute power to do everything that they think necessary to do without question and without any right of appeal to the Parliament of the people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is with no light heart but rather with a sense of serious responsibility that I rise to make my contribution to this debate.  I feel that there are occasions, and this is one of them, when one is called upon to set aside many considerations even to the extent of alienating and antagonising certain elements in the country in order to discharge a public duty.</P>
      <P>Before I came into the Dáil I told the citizens of Cork that I would endeavour, as far as it lay in my power, to discharge my public duties according to my conscience.  I also indicated in many public speeches that I would on all occasions that offered condemn assassination and murder.  I also stated to the citizens of Cork, who know me for a long number of years, that I would not shirk any of these responsibilities, and that I was prepared to face any punishment that might be meted out to me by the gun-bullies or any armed forces that were in opposition to the Government established by the votes of the common or garden people of this country.  I feel now that I am faced with that responsibility as a citizen of this State.  As a public representative I am faced with a double responsibility. I am not going to play to the gallery now any more than I played to the gallery in 1922, 1923, 1924 or 1925.</P>

      <P>In both of these capacities, as a citizen of this State, and as a public representative, I am opposed to closure motions of any kind or character.  Whilst I intend to <Col N="196" /> vote for this Bill I am not in the position of other self-confessed Deputies here who stated that they had not read the Bill.  I have read every line of the Bill.  I have punctuated every sentence in it, and I am in full agreement with it, because of the circumstances that brought about its introduction.</P>
      <P>I realised when seeking election to the Dáil that we had the freest Constitution in the world.  It may, perhaps, be suggested that it was not a Constitution that embraced the whole of Ireland, that all of us had at one time or another envisaged.  I have met newly-born patriots, some of whom have never struck a blow for this country, who have now become wonderful patriots, who tell us that this Constitution does not suffice for their ideas and that we should seek within this Constitution to give protection&mdash; mind you, little finicky debating point, every academic point that can be made is made or in favour of whom?  Is it in favour of the honest working-man who wants to go about his daily work in peace and quietness? Are these points made in favour of the industrious merchant or shopkeeper? No.  All the solicitude I have heard is for the gun-man and the gun bully, the murderer and the assassin, and there is none for the honest man that not one line in this Bill points against, notwithstanding all the camouflage and the wool that they tried to pull over our eyes during this debate.  No honest God-fearing man in this country need be afraid of one line or one section in this Bill.  That is why I am supporting it.  I know it is not popular to do so.  It is far easier to be on the side of the angels, the angels in this case being the fellows with blackened faces who go about pulling labourers out of bed at night, terrorising them and terrorising the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been happening in this country for the last couple of years? A very small but noisy and vocal minority are attempting to dictate to the majority of the people.  I feel that the Government would be lacking in any sense of duty, civic or national, if they did not put this thing down <Col N="197" /> even at the sacrifice of life or limb. I for one am prepared to make that sacrifice.  I say that publicly and I am not ashamed or afraid to do so, thank God.  I speak on behalf of a city which, thank God, is, as far as I know&mdash;and I am in contact with both the rich and poor&mdash;the most law-abiding and the most peaceful city in Europe to-day.  If I were to take the parochial, the insular or the narrow view I might sit here quietly and let the statements that have been made go unchallenged and I would be safe. Then of course I would get the plaudits of the gun bullies, the gunmen, the rotters and the people who want to exploit any disturbance in this country, the looters.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the people of Cork who sent me here that anything was possible under the Constitution under which this House functions.  It is possible, and this Bill does not suggest that it is not possible.  I have always advocated freedom of speech.  Any doctrine may be advocated, not that I want to advocate Sovietism.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  But if any one wants to advocate a Soviet in this country I feel he should be entitled to do so.  According to our Constitution any man or woman is entitled to advocate Communism, Socialism or any other ism, provided they do so in a constitutional way, and have no guns in their hands and no dumps in their backyards.  At the same time, notwithstanding what the Constitution gives us by the way of freedom, I cannot close my eyes to the fact that this freedom is abused and that many people in this country want to translate the word liberty into the word licence.</P>
    <P>I ask any Party in the Dáil, which may, at one time or another be in power&mdash;when Cumann na nGaedheal may be wiped out&mdash;what would they do in similar circumstances?  Would they allow the abuse to go on or would they wait for a conflagration all over the country?  That would be unwise statesmanship, imprudent statesmanship. The time to nip it is in the bud. I welcome this Bill for that reason.  I <Col N="198" /> am glad to be at one with most of the speakers who have stated that these insidious and pernicious doctrines that have been preached have not got much of a foothold or much of a following in this country.  This is the time to stop it and not to wait until things have so developed that perhaps it might be too late.  I am very much concerned about rights that have been at all times exercised, at least for very many years in this and other countries, the right to combine for lawful purposes.  The right to combine for the killing of men is not a lawful purpose.  The right to combine to subvert the authority of the State set up under the freest Constitution in the world; the right to combine by force of arms to subvert this Constitution and this State&mdash;that is not a proper or a right combination. It was quite lawful to combine in such a way as was envisaged under the Acts that allowed the people to combine for land purchase, for trade union and for other purposes.  Such combinations were recognised according to law.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the liberty of the citizen, the liberty of the subject. What about the liberty of poor Curtin, or poor Ryan?  We have all this lip sympathy and all these mouthings in the present circumstances, mouthings about liberty, mouthings about trial by jury, when we all know in our heart and soul what is occurring in the country.  I will relate a small story of an incident that occurred to me during this very week.  I was followed by two policemen into a country district.  I was missing for some time, and these policemen could not find me.  They inquired along the roadside if anybody had seen a fowling party.  I was one of the fowling party.  They got no information along the road, because every person interrogated had not seen any fowling party at all, although they really had. That is quite a common thing.  Nobody wanted to suggest that I had not a licence and they did not know but that the police were after me.  I just want to illustrate conditions by that story.  We all know if we are courageous enough to admit it that there are many crimes committed in this country. Many people know who committed these <Col N="199" /> crimes, and yet, through some lack of moral courage, some sense of comradeship or something else, some indefinite sense, they do not come forward willingly to give evidence, and so the vicious circle goes on.  We have had some very tragic occurrences in this country lately.  We had the poor lad Ryan pulled out of his bed during the night and murdered, and no one has yet been made amenable to the law for that.  All the sympathy and solicitude goes out to the citizen who is going to be roped in and held in jail for so many hours.  Not one word of sympathy for the poor lad who was shot in Tipperary a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I have this fault to find with the method of introducing this kind of legislation.  I held, and hold still, that the Constitution should be sacred. There should be very grave reasons why it should be altered or amended, and I suggest in the best faith that there might be another method rather than by altering the Constitution.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice could tell us whether it would not be better to introduce a special Bill dealing with this matter rather than the way that has been chosen, namely to alter the Constitution.  I feel in that connection at the same time that I would scrap not one, not two, not three but every Article in the Constitution rather than see an innocent man led out on the roadside and murdered by the black-faced assassins who go about at the dead of night.</P>

      <P>To me the lives of that humble labourer and that superintendent of the Civic Guard who were murdered, brutally murdered, were of more consequence and were more sacred than every Article of your Constitution. Yet I do regret that it has been found <Col N="200" /> necessary to alter the Constitution because of these terrible atrocities.  I cannot envisage under the provisions of this Bill all the terrible things that it is alleged are going to occur in the country.  We have been told by no less an authority than Deputy MacEntee that the pilfering&mdash;listen to the absurdity of this&mdash;of one penny will lead to the execution of the pilferer under this Bill.  Did you ever listen to such piffle, such drivel, in all your life?  We have been told that there are dire penalties, even if a man is seen talking to a friend in the street.  Everybody who has spoken against this Bill knows in his heart, if he is courageous enough to say it, that no self-respecting, law-abiding citizen has anything to fear from the provisions of the Bill.  In this matter I consider that the interests of the State are above the interests of Party.  Some members of the Dáil stated that to their own knowledge&mdash; and I think the President was one of them&mdash;there is a campaign going on in this country conducted by certain Russian agents.  These people may be mythical agents or they may not, but in any case we all know because of the circulation of their literature in this country, because of the circulation of some of their newspapers&mdash;I have read at least one&mdash;that these pernicious doctrines are being preached, and that they are percolating into every little hamlet and town in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some time ago a Bill the principle of which was not generally opposed, for the suppression of evil literature.  I am always an advocate of the suppression of evil literature, but in this case our Government made themselves quite ridiculous.  They banned certain books, and at the same time allowed a whole stream of this kind of pernicious literature to circulate, not alone in Dublin and Cork cities, but right through the little hamlets and villages of this country.  There was no ban whatsoever on that class of literature advocating all kinds of things for which this Dáil does not stand, for which no Irish father and mother stand, and for which, I do know, the clergy of the country do not stand. There is still another menace not at all touched on by any Deputy who has <Col N="201" /> spoken, as far as I know, and I have heard most of the speakers.  There are persons going into the towns and villages of the country week after week preaching these pernicious doctrines, and they are meeting, at the crossroads and in the villages, young lads who in other circumstances, if America or the emigrant ship had been open to them, would have cleared out of the country.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known and accepted fact that there is a breeding ground in the country, and a breeding ground in nearly all other countries at the moment for this insidious propaganda. I consider it a highly criminal thing for any Irishman, especially an enlightened or educated Irishman, and more especially a member of the Dáil, to be a party to that kind of insidious propaganda in this country.  But there are members of the Dáil taking advantage of it, and going down and fanning the flame of discontent.  I believe, as a citizen and as a representative of my city in the Dáil, that they would be far better engaged in trying to counteract that propaganda than in doing what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that the workers in our villages and towns should not get the highest and best possible conditions that they can get under the circumstances.  I do feel that we who have been sent here by the people of the country should have a higher conception of duty than going around amongst the discontented people and the malcontents who are to be found owing to the economic circumstances of the country&mdash;that we should have a better conception of our duty than fanning into flames the ideas that have been put before them and which perhaps may one day culminate in a conflagration in this country. That, to my mind, is a highly criminal thing to do.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment at any great length upon what previous speakers have said, but I do feel, when references have been made, for instance to the Gaeltacht and to what is occurring in the Gaeltacht, and the disaffection that is in the Gaeltacht, that everybody here knows that there has always been poverty in the Gaeltacht. <Col N="202" /> It is now, perhaps, more acute than ever.  This Government, after all, is doing something for the Gaeltacht. My complaint against the Government is that they have not done enough for the unemployed in the cities.  I see no reason even now for receding from that attitude or altering that opinion.  I do feel, with Deputy O'Connell, that if our programme, which would have tended to relieve them and abolish unemployment, had been adopted, the economic causes to which he refers would not have existed up to this, or if so, they would exist only to a limited extent and not to their present proportions.  I want to say, in conclusion, in connection with this Bill, that if I refused to vote for it, if I refused to give the Government the powers they ask for under the Bill, I should feel, if another man were murdered in this country, that I had some kind of complicity in that crime and that I was just as guilty as the assassin who fired the shot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to give a silent vote on this new Constitution which is being brought in here tonight. We have been told about the terrible conditions of affairs existing in the country and of the causes of it&mdash;a condition of affairs which nobody in the country seems to know anything about except the Ministers themselves. Now I maintain that it is not the jury system that has failed in this country. It is the police system in this country that has failed.  The unfortunate people of this country are paying one and three-quarter millions each year for a police force.  The Civic Guard force is established for the detection of crime.  Why have they not detected those crimes?  What becomes of that one and three-quarter millions that we pay for the Civic Guard forces, with five of them in a village that holds one publichouse?  What are they doing? Why have they not detected those crimes?  Does the Minister for Justice think that drilling is going on?  Does he think to bluff the people into the belief that the Civic Guards see drilling going on and do not interfere with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the case that we are asked to meet.  Is there an organisation in this country existing at the present <Col N="203" /> time which is able to know the particular time and place, when and where shootings and other crimes can be committed with impunity?  If so, what is that organisation?  Let us have this matter out.  What is the organisation?  What is the organisation that can go and shoot a man to-day knowing the exact hour when and the particular place where every Civic Guard is placed?  What is the organisation existing in this country that has a vested interest in keeping up further shootings and turmoil in the country? What is the organisation?  What is the organisation which knows that it can shoot without any fear of detection? What is the organisation that knows that its members will be the first on the scene the following morning to remove all traces of the crime?  I suggest that that organisation is to be found in the secret society formed with the support of the Minister for Local Government in 1924 and which is now dignified under the name of the C.I.D. I suggest that that is where the organisation is to be found.</P>
    <P>We had a candidate here a few moments ago for an Adjutant-General as Brigadier, a candidate who talks about himself, who talks about men with masked faces and about shootings. The very first man I ever saw in uniform in this country shouldering a big wooden musket was Deputy Anthony. He was the very first individual I saw in 1913 when I brought a load of oats into Cork.  I saw him with his wooden musket on his shoulder marching up and down Parnell Bridge for fear the Germans would run away with the bridge.  That is one of the men who is going to put down this thing with a strong hand.  Deputy Anthony carried a big long rope down through the streets of Cork in 1914, on the anniversary of the celebration of the Manchester Martyrs; he was going to bind the gap that was left by the number of fellows that were sent out to be assassinated in France.  That is Deputy Mark Anthony.  This is the individual who the very moment any shot was fired for the independence of this country took his wooden musket, dropped it into the Lee at Parnell Bridge, and strolled down to the place <Col N="204" /> where he got a good schooling, to the office of the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; to hold a quill pen until the shootings were over.  This is the individual who comes here now.  He should remember young Walsh from Mayfield who was found, at 12 o'clock in the night, within ten minutes after having left the Civic Guard Barracks, on the side of the road with his head stove in by the butt of a revolver.  This is the man who comes now preaching about shootings.</P>
    <P>The President and his Ministers have endeavoured to play upon the Catholic principles of the people.  I consider myself a far better upholder of Catholic principles than this smoke-screen of the Masonic League, whose rule has been carried on here, to my knowledge, for the last three years.  That is so to the knowledge of every Deputy in this House.  If there is any menace to Catholic principles in this House it is in the Masonic organisation.  If the Ministers believe there is any menace to Catholic principles in this country they should declare that organisation to be an illegal body, and they could deal with that organisation in a manner in which they are at present dealing, or pretending to deal, with the organisation that has no being or, in fact, does not exist.</P>
    <P>They talk of Communism.  There is no Deputy in this House who does not know in his heart that Communism could not exist in the hearts of the Irish people for twenty-four hours. They know that every labourer with a cottage would be an enemy of Communism or that kind of Socialism that is supposed to be travelling round the country.  We have this Masonic organisation, and a certain Deputy in this House has boasted that it has increased by 70 per cent. in the last four years under the fostering care of the Executive Council.  We had this organisation using threats through their official organ.  I have here a copy of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; for March, 1930. In that issue of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; I find the following declaration.  It is referring to the period when this Government was put out of office by the vote of the Dáil and called back again by the votes of the so-called Independent Group here.  It reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> On the other hand, the Government has received a warning which ought to be salutary.  It has discovered that phenomenon of natural history which, neglected, has ruined many Governments&mdash;the fact that even a worm will turn.  Passive revolt may not be less dangerous than flagrant revolt.  The Independent Group, which keeps the Government in office, has been reduced to a dangerous state of mind.  It still desires to keep Mr. Cosgrave's Government in power, but consistent contempt of its wishes and interests has imbued it with a spirit of apathy.  It has fallen into the category of those who, as the saying is, are not good companions on a tiger hunt.  A stage has been reached, indeed, when the Independent members, though still lacking courage to oppose the Government, are losing the habit of support.  They have been disheartened by Mr. Mulcahy's autocratic treatment of their views on the Greater Dublin Bill. They cannot reconcile the Government's frugal attitude to old age pensions with its orgy of expenditure on the compulsory propagation of the Irish language.  The outstanding moral of Thursday's accident is the need of new relations between the Government and the Independent Party.  In plain terms, the Government must recognise its debt to the Party that keeps it in office.  If it continues to ignore that debt the Independent members must begin to realise their duty to their constituents. They must school themselves to use bravely the only weapon that all Governments fear.</P>
    <P>That is the threat held up by the minority in this country to the representatives of the majority of the people.  We have that threat carried further.  We have the fruits of that threat in the Poor Relief (Dublin) Bill following an amendment to the Bill in troduced here by the man of iron of yesterday, General Mulcahy, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The General introduced his amendment to the Dublin Relief Bill here.  It was opposed by Deputy Good.</P>

We had, when those cases were brought up here, week after week, the Minister for Justice making the amazing statement in the case of one civic guard who was brought up in court and fined £10 for assault that he was a good civic guard.  That civic guard, who was fined £10 for assault, is now going to have the power to take up Deputy Gorey, question him on everything he did for the last month, and question him about every hare he poached during the last month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well then.  Article 2 of this Bill absolutely wipes out the Constitution.  This Bill is in future to be the Constitution of this State.  The Bill lays down that any individual who is suspected in any way in any manner by any civic guard can be taken up and questioned.  If the individual does not say &ldquo;Your honour, sir&rdquo; to the sergeant when he meets him at the station that individual is liable to be arrested as a suspected person, as an individual who is not paying due respect to law and order.  That individual may be imprisoned for 72 hours in any Civic Guard station by the civic guard.  Any individual is liable under this Bill for any offence which they may pretend he has committed.  He may be tried by five military officers and sentenced to death.  Anyone who has been through the troubles from 1914 onwards and during the last few years from 1921 to 1923, especially knows the unfortunate differences that exist in this country between certain specified individuals. <Col N="208" /> Those individuals are going to be pulled up one after another, and they will be brought before men against whom, perhaps, they were fighting in 1922.  No matter what rebutting evidence is submitted, the civic guard's statement on oath is going to be taken.</P>
      <P>A man might, for instance, be in the house of the parish priest.  Something might happen in the district. That man will be arrested and he will be kept for seventy-two hours under torture by one civic guard after another. They will try to force evidence out of him and, in the finish, for quietness sake or possibly because his head will give way, he may say something.  The civic guard will swear on oath that the individual who was in the parish priest's house at the time the crime was committed was actually seen on the spot.  The evidence of that civic guard is to be taken against the evidence of the parish priest.  This Bill is another portion of the price that is being paid by the Executive Council for the support of the Masonic group in this House.  They have repeatedly paid for that support.  The Minister who was accused in a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of not listening favourably to them is the Minister who crawled into the lobby and voted against his own amendment because the Masonic group would not have it.</P>

      <P>My point of view on this Bill is the point of view of a democrat rather than nationalist.  From that point of view I want to say that it was a pleasure to me to listen particularly to the speeches of Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Anthony.  When all is said and done, no country is going to be judged <Col N="209" /> finally by its army or by its police force; rather will it be judged by the character of its civilians.  It is the civilian, the man in the street, who is going to make a country.  Of course it is the business of the Government to establish law and order and to maintain law and order&mdash;to maintain decent government.  The trouble up to the present in this country has been that the people of the country, no matter what side in politics they might be attached to, seem to think that it is the business exclusively of the Government and that they have no functions at all in the matter.  That point of view is rather peculiar to this country. Take any first class country, any European country, any country like France, Germany or England.  What made these countries great?  It was the standard of good sense and the democratic instincts of the people of those countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not interrupted Deputies when they were speaking.  As I have said, it is a pity that Deputy de Valera did not realise that long ago, because the Deputy has been consistently exploiting all the weaknesses that were bound to develop in this country as a result of the lack of freedom and the lack of self-government. Since 1922 we have been endeavouring to establish a democratic sense in this country, to make the people realise that this is their country, that they can do what they like with it, that they can make it what they like, and I may say that we have got very little assistance from the Deputies on the opposite benches.  We have got plenty of assistance from outside.  You can get it in any parish in Ireland.  There is a big proportion of the people of every <Col N="210" /> parish who are Nationalists, whose fathers before them were Nationalists, whether or not they were out in 1916&mdash; people who have a real love for this country and who want to see it advance on the road to peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>This is the first time since 1922 that I have seen Deputies who have no affiliation with the Government stand up here fearlessly, take their responsibilities fearlessly, and enunciate democratic principles that we all gave lip service to when the British were here. For that reason I welcome the statements that were made in this House by Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Anthony.  I look upon such statements as a ray of sunlight, a breath of fresh air in the Dáil, and they form one of the first signs that I have noticed that this country is going to advance and prosper.  I will contrast those statements, although I do not like making the contrast, with the speech of Deputy O'Connell.  I am a Democrat even before I am a Nationalist.  I believe in self-government and in majority rule, and I have given a good many hostages to it.  I believe in equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a Constitution, adult suffrage, proportional representation, and trial by jury.  Could anything be more democratic?  Could any possible Constitution have more regard for the rights of the plain man?  And yet it is these institutions that are being attacked.  That is admitted; it was admitted yesterday by Deputy de Valera, and that cannot be denied.  If anyone would deny it the Deputy would deny it, but he had to admit it yesterday. These institutions, the sheet anchor of democracy, are being attacked.  That is the real issue.  That is what we are debating here&mdash;the attack on these democratic institutions, institutions that ought to be more scared to the poor and the weak than to the rich and the strong.  When we are debating that issue, what is Deputy O'Connell's contribution?  He has not exactly justified the attack on these institutions, but he explained it.  That is what his whole speech amounted to&mdash;an explanation. I will not say it was a justification, but the dividing line is very thin.  He gave an explanation as to why these institutions should be <Col N="211" /> attacked.  I put it to him as a Labour man: Is there any legitimate explanation for an attack on trial by jury?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked Deputy O'Connell to answer that question and I will leave it at that.  Take Deputy de Valera's attitude.  I listened to him yesterday.  What do I find?  He made two speeches.  He was for and against, hot and cold, right and wrong, moral and immoral, democratic and antidemocratic, all things to all men.  His first statement was that the incidents &mdash;incidents mind you&mdash;mentioned by the President did not justify this Bill. He did not deny that these incidents occurred.  He referred to them as incidents.  What are these incidents? The Deputy is a past master of distinctions and phrases and of the double entendre&mdash;words that say one thing and may mean another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Another part of the myth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are these incidents that do not justify this Bill?  The Deputy calls them incidents.  I do not want to use extravagant language, but the murders of Curtin and Ryan and the murders of trial by jury are referred to as incidents by this democrat and <Col N="212" /> do not justify this Bill.  His next statement was that in five or ten years' time there will be the same need for a Safety Bill.  Why will there be the same need for a Safety Bill, and what is the meaning of that statement?  It does not matter what you or I take out of that statement.  What really matters is what the people outside take out of that statement.  What is the only meaning that they can take out of the statement&mdash;that in ten years you will have similar murders?  Deputy de Valera stated it, and left it at that.  Of course he did not justify them.  He stopped short at that.  There will be no need for this Bill in ten years' time unless you have the incidents again in ten years' time, and it was left to Deputy de Valera to suggest you would have.  I do not care how he wriggles out of it, or what he says he meant, but I know what the gunmen will take out of it, and he knows it, too.  He went on to say: &ldquo;They preferred to imitate the activities of Hamar Greenwood.&rdquo; Who was Hamar Greenwood? An Englishman who was a Chief Secretary here and the representative of a foreign Government here.  Does the Deputy still keep up the humbug that President Cosgrave is an Englishman, or that I am an Englishman, or that my authority or President Cosgrave's authority or the authority of the Executive Council was the authority of Hamar Greenwood?  Does he still keep up that humbug; and if he does not, what does he mean?  Because the country is entitled to know from the Leader of the Opposition in times like these what he meant.  You and I know.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The arguments that would be put up to young men to join the organisations mentioned&rdquo;&mdash;that is Saor Eire, Cumann na mBán, the I.R.A.&mdash;I am quoting again from Deputy de Valera's speech&mdash;&ldquo;would be a repetition of those put up by Mr. Blythe and Mr. Mulcahy when they were asking the young men of the country to join the I.R.B.&rdquo;  What is the plain meaning of that?  The plain meaning of that to anybody who knows English is that there is as good reason for joining these organisations which shot Curtin and Ryan as for joining the organisations that were formed here to put the British out of the country.  What else does that mean? What do you think the gunmen will take out of it?  They will take out of it this, that they have the same right to shoot now as in the old days the Volunteers had the right to shoot Hamar Greenwood and the British. That is all they can take out of it.  That was one part of the Deputy's speech, such as it was.  As I said before, the speech was divided into two parts.  But there was another part.  He then went on and announced that the only authority in this country&mdash;he gave his allegiance to majority rule&mdash;was the authority of the Dáil, something for which we have been striving for the last seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that the only authority in this country that had the right to take life was the authority established by this Dáil.  That was the second part of his speech. If he had made one or the other I would know where Deputy de Valera stands, but he made both in the same speech.  As a rule his timing was not just as it was yesterday.  He makes a speech to-day and enunciates one set of principles, and he makes a speech to-morrow and enunciates another set. <Col N="216" /> Yesterday he came along, and in the same speech enunciated two quite different sets of principles.  If the authority in this Dáil is the only authority that can take life, if the authority in the Dáil is the only legitimate authority in the country, why talk of the methods of Hamar Greenwood, and why say that the men outside have the same right to organise against this Dáil as Mulcahy and Blythe had to organise against Greenwood? That is what he did say.</P>

      <P>Not much; a little too much for you.  That has been his consistent line since 1921.  He will blow hot and cold.  On the one hand, he will play up to the gunmen and on the other hand he will mouth morality, and that is what has left this country as it is.  Remember this, and this is why I went on the speeches of Deputies Anthony and Morrissey&mdash;that bacteria will only breed if the atmosphere is right&mdash;in a fetid atmosphere only. It is that sort of pettifogging, double dealing, confusing morality, confusing constitutionalism and physical force that has created the atmosphere that makes it possible for the sort of bacteria to breed that was responsible for the murder of Curtin and Ryan, and if there is one man in this country more than another who was responsible for that it is the Leader of the Party opposite.  I say that deliberately and I have been in public life and watching him since 1921.  He has injected into this country a culture which can only cause decay and disintegration.  From that point of view the speeches made to-day by Deputies Morrissey and Anthony were the first sign of fresh air and sunlight which are going to dissipate them in this country.  What the Dáil and the country are entitled to is this: they are entitled to know on which leg Deputy de Valera stands. He often tells us that he is the leader of the second biggest Party in the Dáil, and we hear that he is going to be the leader of the next Government. If he is, he will have responsibility, and what this country is entitled to know beforehand is which set of principles he is going to invoke when challenged by the gunmen, as challenged he will be undoubtedly. That is what the plain people of the country are entitled to hear, and they have not heard it yet.  I honestly would rather if Deputy de Valera had made a speech yesterday backing the gunmen than the pettifogging double-dealing speech he made.</P>

      <P>This report may be wrong also.  It is not from the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; but from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of August 24th, 1931.  The Deputy remembers addressing an aeridheacht at Roebuck House.  In Roebuck House he was inspired by Cumann na mBán, the gunmen, and the rest of them.  This is what he said:</P>
      <P>For a long time the Government had been deliberately at work to produce a situation that would justify new repressive legislation.  Openly and secretly they had been trying to foment unrest and produce all that would justify them in arming themselves with new powers that would enable them to appear before the people as strong men defying anarchy.  If they got from the people approval of this repressive legislation at a general election or otherwise they would use that legislation ruthlessly to stamp out the last vestige of militant Republicanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the Deputy who informed us yesterday that if this Bill were passed it would mean an accession of strength to militant republicanism.  We have heard from Deputies opposite that there is going to be trouble.  I draw attention to this, particularly Deputy O'Connell's attention.  We hear a lot about repressive legislation, the fact being that there has been no repressive legislation here.  There was one Public Safety Act.  It never operated, but <Col N="219" /> particular portions of it were on the Statute Book for 18 months in 1927. That Act provided for military courts, and while that legislation was there there was not a shot fired or a word said.  The militant republicans remained quiet, and so far as the ordinary citizen was concerned it might as well not have been on the Statute Book.  There was never any necessity to put it into operation.  One month after the Act was repealed, or after the section of it which provided for the establishment of military courts was repealed, a juryman was shot and a witness murdered.  Since then that sort of thing has been continued.  Deputy O'Connell need not be alarmed.  There will be no civil war when this Bill passes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody there to be provoked by this.  The one attribute of the men outside who have been challenging the State for the last three years is that they will take no risks whatever&mdash;everything must be dead safe.  Any little brat with a gun can intimidate a civilian.  Once people stoop to that there is no way to protect that civilian except to have two detectives, one on each side of him, or to make it too dangerous.  Deputy O'Connell need not be afraid.  This Bill will not cause confusion.  This Bill, I make bold to say, will solve the problem with very little necessity to operate it.  I go further and say that if we had more speeches like those of Deputies Morrissey and Anthony, showing public spirit, that civilians could not be cowed, that there was a real love of democracy and good European blood in the civilians of this country, we would never need the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>Yesterday we had some revelations from the Minister for Justice.  He mentioned that there were several members of this Party in touch with Russia.  He mentioned the leader of this Party, Deputy Lemass and Deputy Aiken and said that in 1925 a mission was sent to Russia which included <Col N="220" /> a member of this Party and for some unexplained reason he did not mention who the member was.  I happened to be the member of this Party who went to Russia in 1925.  That is correct.  The fact that a mission went to Russia in 1925 has been urged as a proof that this Party or the members of it have been associated with Communist activities.  The Minister for Local Government made a big mistake when he said that the first Irishman to send a deputation to Russia was the leader of this Party.  He was corrected by Deputy MacEntee shortly afterwards and reminded that the Provisional Government of which he was a member sent an envoy to meet representatives of the Soviet in London and we have not heard that these men have been tainted with Communism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to tell the House what I was doing in Russia.  I followed a line that was followed by the Irish Nationalists from the days of Elizabeth, when O'Donnell went to Spain to seek aid against the British, up to the time Casement went in the last war.  Casement went to seek the aid of England's enemies to smash England.  I went on the same mission and followed the same line, but the Russians were too busy minding their own business to mind me.  I failed completely.  In all our history our friends were always England's enemies.  We could not get help from the Boers, but we sent help to the Boers.  I was not old enough at the time, but we did send Irishmen.  There is a member of this establishment who actually fought to show the age-long <Col N="221" /> hatred to Britain.  I went to Russia in the vain hope that we would get Russian people to weaken the power of our enemies, and I am proud of what I did.  I have a document issued by an organisation of which the Minister, and I am almost sure the President, were members in 1917.  I have never heard him called a Muscovite, a Bolshevik, or a Communist, as he called others yesterday, because he was a party to this letter.  This document was issued by the Election Committee of Dr. Pat McCartan in 1917, who was a Sinn Fein candidate for South Armagh about the same time as the President was elected in Kilkenny.  It has printed in big letters: &ldquo;McCartan to the representatives of the Russian people, London,&rdquo; and is headed: &ldquo;Trotsky, the most respectable citizen in the world.&rdquo;&ldquo;Trotsky insists that England shall allow the people of Ireland, India, etc., to determine their own form of government.&rdquo; Why did he refer to Russia? Because Dr. Pat McCartan explained the position of Ireland to the Russians. I am not going to bother you about what follows.  The President is well known to be a very religious person. No one would ever attempt to call him a Communist, but he sent his agents around this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You were a member of the Committee, and I am not going to tell you that you are a Bolshevist.  The really serious aspect in this matter that has been presented to this House, and which the Government pretends they consider serious, is that there is a taint of Communism in this movement.  I am quite satisfied that the Government would never attempt to bring in this measure if they were not able to work up this stunt that there was a foreign influence at work.  I believe they would be quite satisfied to use the ordinary machinery they have at their disposal. It is quite adequate to deal with the situation, but they have got up the stunt of failure, as a foreign delegate&mdash; apparently somebody else I do not know anything about&mdash;has succeeded. They got the twelve apostles apparently trained in Moscow to spread <Col N="222" /> the gospel in a country like Ireland, which is full of individualists.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose there is any country in Europe since the Land Commission began to work where there are so many small proprietors.  To think that any serious people are going to be humbugged by the suggestion that Communism is going to take root here is preposterous.  It will not work with me, and I think that anyone will not be deluded by this well-staged display of gunmen.  I have a grievance too.  I do not see why I should not have protection. I am entitled as a Deputy to be protected as well as some of the people I see protected, and I want to take this occasion to protest against my exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About three years ago there was a motion asking for the revision of the cases of certain prisoners, and more particularly of certain people who were on the run in Ireland at the time.  I spoke in the debate and mentioned what I knew to be a fact, that there were so many men on the run in whose case the slate had not been wiped clean that we were going to create a situation in this country that would inevitably lead to a state of disorder, and that the Government would do what I said these were trying to do, on the eve of an election, to stampede the country into a belief that civil war was about to start again.  I condemn gunmen.  I always condemned them. I did not like them even at the time the present Minister for Local Government was organising them.  That is in the old days in the time of the British.  I never liked them.  When a document of his was captured suggesting the poisoning of British troops it appalled me.  I never liked murders and I accept the authority of this place for the simple reason that it is a fact. It is a hard fact, and there is no getting over it.  I have accepted the authority as the only authority in this country. I say give these people a chance, and wipe the slate clean, instead of harrowing them, as you did for instance, in the case of Con Healy, a man I knew well who was harried for about two years.  To show that he was not a criminal he could get shelter in any house in his own area in County Cork.  When the C.I.D. came after him <Col N="223" /> they told people if they caught him they were going to shoot him.  The result was that Healy, being a spirited man, carried a gun, and when the police came he fired but he did not hit them.  When charging him with this offence they charged him with firing on the police, and they gave him five years in jail.</P>
    <P>When we came here in 1927 we made a genuine attempt to settle this question and to have the Republican movement conducted on strictly constitutional lines.  We made a special appeal to the Government to wipe the slate and to give the people a chance.  They never did it.  I deliberately say now&mdash; I am not doing this for Party purposes &mdash;that you have done this deliberately, as Deputy Lemass said last night, to cover up all the blunders you have made in other lines&mdash;your Shannon scheme and other things.  I am sorry they have been a financial failure.</P>

He talks in big amounts.  We have not heard much about the Drumm battery lately.  I believe it is a failure, too.  I did not study this Bill, but I read some of the provisions about the military court.  I shall give a little experience of mine in this connection. Towards the end of the civil war, I was in Mountjoy Prison.  There was a boy of eighteen years of age named O'Rourke there.  He is dead now.  He was brought out to face one of these tribunals, and he was beaten senseless and thrown into a cell.  Deputy Doctor Ryan happened to be a prisoner in Mountjoy at the same time.  He attended the boy and tried to bring him round.  When he had restored him, to some extent, he asked why did they do this.  The boy replied: &ldquo;I do not know.  They told me I was going to be shot in the morning.&rdquo;  The Doctor asked: &ldquo;Were you tried?&rdquo; The boy replied: &ldquo;I don't know, except that the beating I got was a trial.&rdquo;  That boy was taken out in a bruised and beaten condition and shot dead.</P>

Without their own knowledge, they have gone gradually down, and that is where they are now. But I certainly say the chief blame is on the Government, and if they had taken the genuine advice they got here four years ago they would not have this state of affairs.  I am afraid it was deliberately done in order that they might be kept in office.  I say that fully and honestly believing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I made my protest against the closure motion. To-day I should like to elaborate my reasons for doing so.  I had two reasons.  In the first place, I had not had an opportunity of consulting my constituents and getting their mandate for my vote on this Bill.  In the second place, the Government themselves did not give the people an opportunity to afford them the mandate which I hold they would have got if they had asked the people for it.  When I was a very young member of this House&mdash;in July, 1927&mdash;a Public Safety Bill was brought in, following one of the most regrettable incidents&mdash;as they have been referred to here&mdash;that have occurred in this country, the murder of the Vice-President of the Executive Council.  A Public Safety Bill was brought in, as I held at that time, under panic conditions. We had debates on that Public Safety Bill on all fours with the debate we had here to-day.  We were told about what would happen in three or four years.  We were told that that measure would drive the people to revolution and all sorts of things.  We were told, too&mdash;I want to emphasise this&mdash;that certain powers given to the Government would be so abused by servants of the Government that innocent people all over the country would be indicted out of private party spite.  I <Col N="225" /> was a young member of the House on that occasion.  I suffered a good deal for having supported that Public Safety Bill, although I did my best to take the objectionable features out of it.  Some of my amendments were accepted by the Government.  In the few years that that Act remained on the Statute Book, I did not know of one instance where an innocent man was arraigned or brought before a tribunal because of party or personal considerations.  That Public Safety Act created a furore all over the country, but, while it remained on the Statute Book, there was no injustice done to an innocent man because of it. I am prepared to go to my constituents to-morrow with a much greater sense of security after supporting this Bill to-day than I could go to my constituents a month after voting for the Public Safety Bill.  If I might sum up the situation so far as opposition to this Bill is concerned, the mildest speaker, so far as I can understand, is prepared to give control of this State on a fifty-fifty basis&mdash;fifty per cent. to the gunman and fifty per cent. to the Government.  That is as far as they will go.  How can we run a Government under these conditions?  No matter what Government is in power&mdash;I am not speaking for the personnel of the Government before me; I am speaking for the personnel of any Government which is given authority&mdash; that Government must get a hundred per cent. control of the law and order of the State.  Otherwise there could be no law or order in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said here that for seven hundred years the people of this country have been fighting for freedom. It has been suggested&mdash;possibly with a certain measure of truth&mdash;that we have not got enough freedom at the moment, and that, perhaps, for seven hundred years more we shall have to fight on until whoever is then alive is satisfied with our measure of freedom. I would be untrue to all my principles of life if I did not vote for this Bill.  I have been an upholder of majority rule all my life and an opponent of the gun. I believe that whatever extensions of freedom we will have secured in the future will be gained by constitutional methods.  Nothing that occurred in <Col N="226" /> this country in recent years has convinced me that I was wrong in adopting constitutional methods long ago.</P>

      <P>I never used a gun, and when the gentleman who interrupted me held a gun I was at the wrong end of it.  I could give a little more history if I liked.  There were men who held guns and who, I think, were not less patriotic than I was.  But I did not believe in the gun.  There were men who honestly believed that by the gun they could get a bigger measure of liberty than I could get by other means.  But that is not my point. I would be false to my nature if I did not support this Bill, which is in conformity with my public actions during my whole life.  I am sorry my friend has interjected a rather unpleasant thing, because I could tell something about the gun which would not please him.</P>

      <P>There is another principle being fought for.  There is the principle of free speech fought for by those who oppose this Bill.  What manner of speech has been going on during the last few months?  People talk about our fighting for freedom for 700 years.  This country has been Christianised for 1,500 years.  Are we to stand by and let Asiatic rats come in and take the Christianity from our people which they have held for 1,500 years?  If this Bill was designed for no other purpose than to guard against that I would say that purpose alone would justify this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other reasons for this Bill. I opposed the Public Safety Act because it was an emergency and panic Act.  I was justified to a certain extent in opposing it on these grounds. I believed a week ago that this Bill was simply going to be an emergency measure like the Public Safety Act.  I found on the morning that I came up here, and only then, that this Bill was going to take the form of a new clause in the Constitution, and that the Government were taking powers now in this Bill for themselves and their successors, powers which I hold they made a great mistake in not taking years ago.  I say that with all the knowledge.  I have of the use the Government has already made of their powers.  They had powers under the Public Safety Act to do things and acts of injustice were not tolerated.  I hold that every Government in this extraordinary period of the world's history should have in its Constitution, or by some other means, power to deal with people who want to subvert the State, and who want to destroy law and order.  That seems to be the new <Col N="228" /> policy all over.  The Muscovite policy, as the President said, has permeated the nations of the world which have not power to deal with these Russian rats and everybody else who puts up his head to subvert the State, destroy law and order and kill religion, no matter what religion so long as it is a Christian religion.  That is what is being done here and in other countries.  This country would not be doing right if it did not take powers to deal with these people in the future.</P>
    <P>I have two grievances against the Government in connection with this matter.  One is that they did not consult the people openly and get a mandate they could stand over.  The second is that they did not think of having powers like these incorporated in the Constitution before to-day.  I am going back to my constituency tomorrow with the full knowledge that not one half per cent. of the people who voted for me at the last election will find fault with me for the vote I am about to give to-day, but I complain that I have not had the opportunity of saying to my constituents: &ldquo;I went up to the Dáil and did what you expected me to do.&rdquo;  I am satisfied that the vote I am about to give is the right vote, but I regret that I did not get a mandate from my people before I came up here.  I am quite satisfied that this Bill should have been brought in years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been attacked. The principal attack, as made by those who for some time have been accustomed to accept our Constitution, is that it is unconstitutional; that it interferes with the liberties under the Constitution, described by us as democratic, as giving every member of the public the right to express his political views, as giving the means to the people, if they so desire, to put any Government they like into power; and that that Constitution is being abrogated.  Nothing of the kind.  This Bill is being introduced as an Article in the Constitution because it is necessary for the preservation of the rights already enshrined in the Constitution. It is necessary because, as I think most people in this House ought to <Col N="229" /> know, that in the last few months a campaign has been growing or threatening to grow beyond all control, a campaign which, if not dealt with and dealt with quickly, would in a short time be beyond the control of this or any other Government, a campaign to make the rights of the people absolutely nugatory.  What is the good of having rights enshrined in the Constitution guaranteeing the liberties of the individual when for political motives ordinary individuals can be taken out of their houses and shot, when the ordinary man can be terrorised and prevented from giving expression to his political views?</P>
      <P>People talk of elections, but everybody knows that there are a number of places at this moment where the free expression of opinion by the electorate would be almost impossible.  If that state of affairs was allowed to continue, those who had experience in this country for the last ten years must know perfectly well that that terrorism would completely dominate the country.  It is said that this Bill interferes with the rights of the people guaranteed by the Constitution.  This is the only way we can see to guarantee to the ordinary law-abiding citizen the rights that are his by the Constitution. If these powers the Government is asking for are not granted or if they are not effective, then the Constitution still remains, but it remains, so far as 99 per cent. of the people are concerned, a dead letter.  It remains a dead letter, not because people's rights are interfered with by the Government, but because the people's lives are interfered with by the ordinary gun bully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People seem to suggest that there is no evidence of unrest demanding a Bill of this kind.  I know perfectly well the extraordinary difficulty of convincing some people when they demand evidence.  We know that when dumps were discovered the suggestion was made that they were planted there by the C.I.D. for the purpose of helping Government propaganda.  These dumps were openly acknowledged afterwards by the organisation from which they were captured, but there was no withdrawal of the charge made here.  What <Col N="230" /> is the situation we are faced with?  I have met ordinary people from the country in the last few months and they have been more perturbed as to the future in store for this country than even in the year 1922.  In some respects, so far as the potentialities of danger are concerned, I think that the situation if not dealt with immediately will be more serious than it was in 1922.  At that period you had two big parties contending and there was all the likelihood of compliance with the will of the majority.  What is the situation to-day?  If the position that has developed in the last couple of months is allowed to go on unchecked, what will be the situation?  You may talk of Soviets or republics or anything you like, but is it not the position that this country is going to be split up so far as control is concerned into a number of parishes or half parishes and each parish or half parish will be under the control of a local committee of men with the guns in their hands? That is the situation&mdash;dismemberment of the country in that sense, a complete lack of control, a situation created that neither this nor any other Government that may succeed it can deal with.</P>
    <P>That is the situation we have to try to prevent from developing beyond control.  Deputy O'Connell told us that he has no sympathy, except with the law-abiding citizens, and that he does not want full freedom for the gunman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any freedom for the gunman.  Unfortunately that is what the gunman has.  I may say that a situation is developing, and in some places has developed, in which the only person with political freedom is the gunman.  The ordinary citizens in certain neighbourhoods have not that freedom any longer.  The story told by Deputy Anthony that people were afraid to give information because he was seen passing with a gun is typical. We know that strangers in certain parts of the country will not be shown the way if anything disagreeable has occurred in the neighbourhood.  People are afraid and are already terrorised. <Col N="231" /> That was so a couple of months ago. The danger is that if it is not grappled with it will become universal.  There is no good in Deputy O'Connell and other Deputies saying that they have no sympathy with these things, if their detestation and their hatred of these crimes are not translated into current cash, into something effective.  That is why I object to the attitude taken up by Deputy O'Connell on this occasion, and on more occasions than this.  So far as expressions of sympathy go, everything is splendid.  It is only when it comes to giving expression and practical force to these intentions that we part company.  There is no good being sympathetic with a person who has been murdered.  There is no good being sympathetic with people who are being terrorised if effective measures are not taken to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested, I think, from the opposite benches that the ordinary law is there.  The whole contention of the Government is, and that contention is borne out by the facts as they prevail in the country at present, that the ordinary law has broken down, that it has proved ineffective to deal with these matters.  The ordinary law and the ordinary tribunals are not capable of giving to the citizen the protection to which he is entitled.  It is because that is so that this Bill is necessary. Therefore nothing could be more absurd than answering arguments in favour of the Bill by suggesting that the ordinary law is there.  The ordinary law, as anyone who does not deliberately shut his eyes to facts knows, has broken down.  The jury system has broken down.  It was threatened.  It has broken down. There was a certain amount of partiality in some cases.  Leave that alone. On the whole that would not have been unduly effective.  It has broken down because juries are terrorised, and because witnesses are terrorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are portions of the country in which already people are afraid to be seen speaking to the ordinary civic guard.  Why?  Is it because these ordinary citizens do not respect the law? Is it because they are not friendly to the Guards?  It is not.  It is because <Col N="232" /> already they are beginning to be afraid of the consequences.  That is affecting not merely the administration of the law where quasi-political crimes are concerned, but it is affecting the ordinary administration of the law in some cases.  That is one reason, but not the only one, why we are anxious that the administration of this particular Bill should be entirely removed from the ordinary administration of the law. As a result of the way in which political crime has been fostered in this country for a number of years, the ordinary administration of the law is in danger of being contaminated.  We want to keep the two rigidly apart. Not merely that, but, as the President pointed out in his speech, in the circumstances that are necessary we want, when a situation of this kind arises, to have a tribunal that will not be open and that the people with whom it deals cannot hope that it will be open to any kind of terrorism.</P>
    <P>Incidents have been referred to.  It is not one murder, two murders or three murders.  That is not the important thing.  It is that these murders, either of Superintendent Curtin, Carroll or Ryan, and various other attempted murders, are symptoms of a widespread conspiracy.  That is the seriousness of it.  It is not the murder, appalling as it may be, it is the fact that they are symptoms of a disease that threatens the very existence of this country.  That is the reason why it is necessary to deal with them.  They are not isolated events, and anyone who refers to them merely as incidents ignores the real facts of the situation. They are incidents by which a certain number of people are attempting to arrogate to themselves the right to dictate to the people of this country what political opinions they will effectively hold, what political opinions they will give expression to, and what form of Government they will live under. These incidents, lightly referred to here occasionally, are symptoms of the gradually growing success of that policy in the last couple of months. The immunity that these people have enjoyed, the widespread conspiracy evidenced by it in most of the counties of the Saorstát&mdash;dreadful evidence of <Col N="233" /> it in some cases&mdash;that conspiracy has been going on and not a single step could be taken under the present laws to bring to justice the people who were guilty of these crimes or who instigated them.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that the House and the country have to face.  The country knows it well.  I met many people, even to-day, and they told me that it was with a sigh of relief they greeted the First Reading of this Bill, and the majority that it received. They felt that it was the duty of the Government to introduce it, and that if the Government had been guilty of anything it was guilty of delay in not introducing a measure of the kind before. That was the main criticism I heard.  I cannot share that criticism. We waited, and we were as slow as possible before we introduced a measure of this kind.  Certainly it has been borne upon every member of the Government for the last three months that unless this situation was taken in hands quickly it would get out of hand. That is no exaggeration.  Any one who is familiar with the history of revolutionary movements in this country knows the speed which things of that kind can attain.  I put it to Deputies in every Party that there is a duty not merely to Party, but a duty to the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell and Deputy de Valera spoke of getting at the causes&mdash; the economic causes.  It is quite true, of course, that these people can appeal to the man out of work and to the man in hard circumstances.  These doctrines that are being preached can make such an appeal.  Even the revolutionary element with guns in their hands can make that appeal, and in some cases can make it successfully. Is Deputy O'Connell's knowledge of the revolutionary movement such that this thing can wait until the economic system of this country, as he calls it, is tackled in a fully revolutionary manner? The thing is absurd.  There would be no economic situation or anything else if this thing was allowed to get out of hand.  It could get out of hand in a couple of months if not dealt with.  We have been accused of introducing this measure to make Party <Col N="234" /> capital out of it.  I ask anyone who listened to the speeches on both sides of the House, both for and against this measure, and I ask the public to judge, where was the appeal to popular sentiment?  Where was the effort to get the support of the ordinary unthinking public?  On the side of the unfortunate prisoner, as Deputy Anthony put it very clearly, why is there all the practical sympathy?  It is practical sympathy I am interested in, and not in expressions of lip sympathy. Why is it that all the practical sympathy of certain Parties in this House is always with the malefactor and never for the malefactor's victim? Why is there always a shrinking from taking steps to protect the innocent? Why is it that all the pleas for every tittle of the law, every little refinement, every little rule of evidence have to be thrown on the side of those who are guilty, of those who are trying to ruin the country, while nothing is to be done for the protection of the ordinary citizen?  That is the situation we have to confront.</P>
    <P>We expect to get very little Party capital out of this.  We knew it was our duty as a Government to prevent this situation from developing or else to clear out. There is no other alternative open to us.  We did not expect to get any great or enthusiastic support from a large number of people in this country because we proposed it.  If we do get any Party advantage out of it&mdash;and I make a present of this to the Deputies opposite&mdash;it is because of the attitude adopted in this House by the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the only reason that we could get any advantage out of this measure.  As to the measure itself, it is not the kind of measure that any Government would care to introduce.  It was introduced only because it was completely and absolutely necessary, because there was, if you like, a half state of war in this country.  It was a one-sided war in which all the shooting, all the activities, all the deploying of armies, everything, could be done by one side, and the people and the people's Government, the Dáil, were completely bound up, tied up, and they had nothing to do but to stand bound <Col N="235" /> hand and foot looking on at the destruction of the country and the institutions of the country.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>It is because we take steps in the only possible way to protect the rights of the Constitution, and to see that those rights granted by the Constitution are not violated, are not mere paper, to see that they are a reality, that we are accused of scrapping the Constitution, but you may scrap the Constitution in reality and still let every Article of it stand.  That is the attitude adopted by those who uphold this measure.  This Constitution can be violated, can become a dead letter so far as the ordinary citizen is concerned. The Articles all remain sacrosanct, but the Constitution becomes a dead letter. Deputies have only to think over that fully to realise it.  We try to prevent that occurring.  That is the reason I ask the support of the Dáil for this particular measure.</P>
    <P>Two main things are aimed at.  The first is to deal effectively with crime. Extended powers are necessary for that.  If we try to limit the powers contained in this Bill in order to safeguard against the possibility of abuse of power, anybody familiar with the administration of the law or familiar with the drawing up of Bills must realise quickly that you may kill the Bill, that a safeguard to guard against an imaginary evil that may spring up from ill-will on the part of the Executive or a deliberate perversion of the law by the Executive, will only have the effect of killing the Bill altogether. We undoubtedly seek tremendous powers in this Bill.  We found it impossible to limit these powers because we felt that any limitation of them would probably mean interference with the proper and effective working of this engine to guarantee to the ordinary citizen all ordinary rights.</P>
    <P>The second portion of the Bill deals with the question of propaganda.  Does anybody suggest that there has been any undue interference with the free expression of opinion in this country? I know no country in which there is less <Col N="236" /> interference by those in authority, with the expression of opinion than there is in this country. Many people are shocked not because we interfere with the expression of opinion but that we allow so much free expression of opinion, especially of certain doctrines.  Somebody said that this is a Bill to prevent the expression of political opinion.  It is nothing of the kind.  This is a Bill, I quite admit, to prevent incitement to crime.  Everybody knows &mdash; I wonder does Deputy O'Connell and others of his Party who are voting against this Bill deny it&mdash;that there has been plenty of incitement to crime in certain papers in the country for the last six months.  I do not think he can deny that.  This is a Bill to see that incitement to crime of that kind can be dealt with.  We are asked why they were not dealt with up to the present. Again experience has shown us that the ordinary law is not capable of dealing with that particular state of affairs.  It is no good to tell us to appeal to the ordinary law when our whole case is that the ordinary law is incapable of dealing with the situation that now exists.</P>
    <P>After the passage of this Bill the expression of political opinion, so long as there is no appeal to force to back that up, will remain as free as it was before.  Without the passing of this Bill Deputies know that in a very short time there would be very little free expression of opinion in this country even so far as this House is concerned. They know how the affair started with jurymen.  They were visited.  They were told in quite a calm, gentle way, of course, with no element of threat&mdash; far be it from anybody to threaten them!&mdash;that certain people were being tried.  That was merely brought to their notice, and we know what happened afterwards.  That was the first step.  We all know of the visits to Deputies in the last couple of weeks when they were asked to give their opinions on this Bill.  We all know what the visit to Deputies would be the preliminary to.  The way in which Deputies have reacted to that threat is certainly one of the bright spots in <Col N="237" /> a very black situation.  Not one Deputy has been influenced by action of that kind in the attitude he has taken or will take on this Bill.  That is a very hopeful sign, not merely as far as this House is concerned, but so far as the country as a whole is concerned.  These visits were merely to see what Deputies' views were!  Advice was given that Deputies should be visited and have views placed before them.  As a visitor, you did nothing illegal.  You said nothing.  You only called on your Deputy.  Who was better entitled to visit a Deputy than a constituent to find out how he intended to vote on this Bill?&rdquo; Quite so.  As I said, that is how the matter started with jurymen.  We had a case quoted by the President in which a number of men visited a Limerick body because they passed a resolution condemning the murder of Superintendent Curtin.  They said: &ldquo;This will suffice for the present.&rdquo;  Is that to be the case also with Deputies&mdash;a polite request: &ldquo;Do not vote for this horrid Bill; that will be enough for the present&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>As I say, the responsibility unfortunately is, first and foremost, on the Government to put before the people their view of what the situation is, and not merely what the situation is but what are the potentialities of the situation. I say that because I have been convinced, especially within the last three months, that there is a situation here that, in a very short time, would mean that each half parish in this country would be completely under the rule of the local little knot of people with the gun.  I ask the Deputies who are not too much committed to Party ties whether their experience of this country in the past does not appear to be that the Irish people will not succumb to Communism in this country.  People are too much attached to the old principles!  I wonder how long they would stand it?  What real active opposition would they be able to put up against, not the peaceful visit telling them what views they are to adopt, but against the much more effective visit which has taken place in this country by people with guns in their hands?</P>
    <P>I say under these conditions there is no future for this country, under this <Col N="238" /> or any other Government, because no Government would be possible if a situation of that kind were allowed to get out of hand.  This Bill has been introduced as being the only means we can use to cope with that situation. We trust and hope it will deal with that situation.  We introduced it because we are the Government whose mission it is to look to the safety of the country.  This Bill is necessary, not for the safety of the Government, not for the safety of Government officials, of Government servants, such as police and soldiers, but it is still more necessary for the safety and the protection of the lives and liberties of the ordinary citizens of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this Bill as an attack upon constitutional action and constitutional methods.  It was asserted by a Deputy from these benches yesterday that if there is a sincere desire to promote the peace of this country on the part of the Government the removal of the Oath of Allegiance to King George might perhaps help to foster that so much desired peace.  The Minister for Justice thereupon said: &ldquo;If I remove that oath will you give me any guarantee that the people who resort to physical force will come in?&rdquo; I am merely paraphrasing the Minister's words. That rhetorical challenge on the part of the Minister for Justice is a fair example of the specious methods adopted from time to time when a serious matter of this sort has to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a comparatively short time ago a complaint was made from these benches that three men whose names and addresses were given had been assaulted and beaten by C.I.D. men in the County Clare.  The fact of the assault having been committed was denied by the Minister for Justice, but he did not stop there.  The Minister said: &ldquo;If there is any pretence of truth in that allegation, go to the courts.&rdquo;  The men went to the courts and they got damages.  The allegation was made that a C.I.D. man assaulted a citizen here in this area in which we live. Again there was the suggestion &ldquo;go to the courts.&rdquo;  He went to the courts, <Col N="239" /> not like the Clare case for damages, but with a summons charging an offence against the C.I.D.  The District Justice fined the C.I.D. man 40/-. There was an appeal to the Circuit Judge in this city and the Circuit Judge affirmed the conviction.  In the case of these men they resorted to the courts because they accepted the invitation of the Minister for Justice.  Now without argument and without excuse the Government take away from them that resort to the courts.  They close and lock the doors of these courts.</P>
    <P>It is said that that is being done because juries cannot be trusted.  It was not a jury that inflicted the fine of 40/-.  It was not a jury on appeal who affirmed that fine.  Is it suggested that the District Justice was corrupt or had been intimidated?  Is it suggested that the distinguished Circuit Court Judge who heard the appeal had in some fashion been intimidated?  There is no such suggestion.  Every possible fact and circumstance in favour of the defendants in the cases I have referred to were elicited by the able counsel who appeared for them.  Yet the Judge gave damages or imposed a fine.  That is one effect of acceptng an invitation from the Minister for Justice of the type that is made here &ldquo;resort to Constitutional methods.&rdquo;  In that same Constitution there was placed an Article giving a Referendum to the people of this country, but when that Referendum was resorted to, the very fact of availing of it was made an excuse and an occasion to destroy it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputies of this House quite seriously to consider whether the Constitution in piecemeal is being made a will-o'-the-wisp.  The moment that you follow a piece of that Constitution, that moment it vanishes and evaporates.  Yet the Minister for Justice yesterday had the coolness again to put forward a challenge of that sort.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by what I have heard from the opposite side as to the need of immediately effecting such a drastic change in the law and the legal procedure in this country.  Why is all this being done in such a panicky <Col N="240" /> way?  Why is it all being rushed through in seventy-two hours?  If there was this terrible need for immediate change of this fundamental character why were we not brought together a month ago?  Why were we not brought together even a week ago?  We have been referred here to a document going back as far as 1925.  Why were we not summoned a week or a fortnight earlier and allowed an opportunity of calmly examining and understanding the Bill?  A Bill of 34 clauses with appendices was handed around yesterday afternoon.  I assume, of course, that the gentlemen on the benches opposite, endowed as they are with pellucid intellects, have mastered that Bill and all its implications in the very short time that is being made available.  All I do say is that I have not been able to hear of any precedent for this Bill in any other Legislature in the world.</P>
    <P>A careful examination of the Bill, even by a skilled and industrious official or Deputy, would require, not two days&mdash;it would require at least two weeks.  Is that a fair way to treat this House?  Is it a fair way to treat the people of this country?  We have been told that it must be done; that, to use a phrase of, I think it was the Minister for Local Government&mdash;at all events it was from the Ministerial Bench&mdash;that trial by jury has been murdered.  Now it is better that we should use language exactly.  Trial by jury has not been murdered.  In this country crime not associated with politics is punished with a celerity and with a thoroughness that is scarcely eclipsed in any other country; and ordinary crime is punished with the whole force of public opinion behind the authority that enforces punishment.  Statistics show that we are not a crime-loving people as compared with other nations.  Reference has been made here to the murder of Superintendent Curtin and to another murder &mdash;murders which every decent man in this country deplored.  Those murderers have not been brought before a jury.  If there had been an arrest for the murder of Superintendent Curtin; a public trial by a jury, and the evidence made available through <Col N="241" /> the ordinary channels to the public; if that evidence seemed convincing, and if the jury appeared to fail in their duty, I certainly would reconsider my attitude towards jury trials in such cases.  But that has not occurred. Are the public of this country satisfied that everything possible has been done to bring those criminals to justice?  At all events, it is not the failure of the jury system that is responsible for leaving at large the murderer of Curtin or the murderer of Ryan.</P>
    <P>Is the suggestion that if the people aimed at by this Bill are brought before the ordinary courts, that the ordinary machinery is not adequate or proper to deal with them?  Of course if anyone is tried in the ordinary criminal court he is hedged around with certain safeguards as regards evidence. He cannot be convicted on mere gossip, mere hearsay.  It is true that a court of criminal appeal may perhaps be availed of.  Is there any real desire to get ride of that machinery and to substitute for it a tribunal or procedure whose decisions are not to be open to review?  Is this House in this hurried way, and with so little reflection and so little consideration, to confer on this tribunal of three military officers, skilled, no doubt, in the arts of war, but who, from the nature of their profession and occupation, are not apt in the judicial functions&mdash;is this House to confer upon them a power the like of which has not been conferred upon High Court Judges, not to speak of Circuit Judges, from all of whom there is an appeal?  What parallel is there for it?</P>
    <P>As the time for debate is so very short I do not propose to state in detail the many objections that even a hasty reading of this Bill has led me to formulate. It was hasty, because although I have devoted a certain amount of attention to this Bill since I received it yesterday afternoon, I am conscious from its structure and such reading or attention as I have been able to give it that caution is necessary.  On looking through the Bill I feel rather appalled. I feel that good advice would be to make haste slowly in regard to it.  I do not like <Col N="242" /> the idea of a court whose judgments or procedure are not open to any review in any respect, especially if it is a secret court.  I do not like the idea of a court consisting entirely of men who have received no training as regards the law of evidence.  I think that even in courtsmartial either under the Free State régime or under the British régime, in the more important cases, even the courtsmartial had amongst its members an officer who was a member of one or other branch of the legal profession. The proceedings in those serious cases were reviewed by a Judge. Advocate-General, a gentleman eminent and experienced in the legal profession.  Why are these elementary safeguards being dispensed with? Why is this blank cheque being given as regards sentences?  There is nothing here at all to insure that the punishment will in any way have any relation to the crime. Why have we Section 9?  Section 9 is an extraordinary section.  Apparently if the witness does not give the evidence which commends itself to the Tribunal as regards its truth, very direful results may follow.  The Tribunal might very easily make a mistake in regard to the evidence that the witness has given, and I must say that I have been unable to find anything approaching a precedent for such a section as Clause 9.  I have seen that some years ago under the Empire in one of the provinces of China there was a rule of law which approached, but did not fully reach the point that has been reached in Clause 9 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to refuse a Second Reading to this Bill.  I ask Deputies to refuse to give the advocates of physical force in this country a new argument.  We have heard various statements and assertions made throughout this debate.  All decent people are sick of the factions that infest this country.  We hear of certain Ministers here having their private secret societies.  We have heard of secret societies outside.  These warring societies are each struggling for its own predominance.  Should we not try to rid the country of all of them? <Col N="243" /> Strong government is resorted to in many countries.  There are countries where the Government is at least as strong and dignified as it is in this country.  But in this country only the coat is trailed.  If we draw attention to anything that is unhappy here, anything that may be provocative, and say that perhaps the temptation&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;to lawlessness should be removed, we are represented as encouraging crime.  Why should jurymen be pestered over cases and why should any other tribunal be pestered over cases arising because certain people want to fly the Union Jack in this City when they know perfectly well that it is provocative and will cause trouble?</P>

      <P>Why should not public opinion express itself against that?  That sort of thing is simply trailing the coat, looking for a fight. With the public opinion of the country behind the law, as I believe it would be behind the law if certain irritants like the Oath to the King of England were removed, the law would deal with these matters very strongly.  We hear of Communism.  I have tried in my constituency which I know very intimately&mdash;I do not know it merely as two counties; I know practically every parish in it&mdash;to get evidence of these Communistic activities.  Perhaps it may be said that I am too hard to satisfy in regard to evidence, but I have tried to get it and I have obtained statements that purported to prove Communism and those statements on examination did not bear the slightest destructive criticism. They did not bear anything at all in the nature of cross-examination.  They just seemed to fizzle out and the neares I could get was something to do with land.  Anywhere I found anything approaching what might be called confiscation or Communism had to do with some area where the Land Commission had not fully operated and where the effects of land legislation had not fully penetrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People here seem to close their eyes <Col N="244" /> to facts.  The title to Irish land has often been assailed in the past. Most of the land of this country was confiscated once, a great deal of it was confiscated twice, and some of it was confiscated three times. You cannot draw too strong an inference from any feeling that may exist in a particular pocket of a parish where the land question has not been adjusted in the way the law of this State contemplates it will be adjusted.  For these, amongst a number of other reasons that I have not time to adduce. I ask the House to refuse a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>

      <P>This debate has had all the evidence of unreality that the debate last night had.  The same smoke-screens that were thrown across the path of the Dáil last night were thrown across to-day.  It is unfortunate that the Government is so much afraid of discussion or have got the wind up to such an extent that they are afraid of a revolution on Friday night, that they cannot permit a full and adequate discussion on the Second Stage of the Bill, that I will be unable to comment at length on the speeches made here this evening, one of the most deplorable of which was the speech of Deputy Anthony.  Since the time is so short, the most I can do is to described the Deputy's speech as treachery to the working classes.  I will described the utterance he made to the effect that even at the sacrifice of limb and life he will be prepared to stand by this Bill as a faint shadow of the utterance of another Labour leader in this House in 1923, when he pledged the last man and the last shilling to crush the Republic. All I want to say at this stage, since no adequate discussion is permitted, is that, whether you like it or not, this issue will be settled outside your House by the ordinary common people of Ireland, and every Party that brands itself as guilty of creating this situation, and allowing this situation of manufacturing a revolution to develop, will have to bear its share of the guilt, and that guilt will not be light.</P>

      <P>Last night, when the President was addressing himself to the urgency of this Bill, he told us that what they wanted was time and leisure to deal with the grave economic crisis that is now upon us.  No person has a better knowledge of the extent of that crisis than the Minister for Finance. He knows very well that at the end of this years he is going to be faced with a Budget deficit of at least two and a half million pounds, and in this notion he is asking the Dáil to give him a blank cheque in order to carry out a policy the cost of which he himself has not been able to envisage.  He has no idea and has not made an estimate of the cost of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that before this policy of fomenting disorder is embarked upon the House at any rate should be given some information as to the liabilities which are going to be incurred under the Bill, and how these liabilities are going to be discharged.  The present position of the Exchequer is this, that with the deficit which is facing him the Minister next year will have to impose a very heavy addition to the income tax, will have to impose and additional duty on tea, will have to tack on an additional duty on beer, spirits and sugar, and a heavy impost on every article of necessity. On top of this he is now embarking upon a policy that is going to disturb the whole course of trade in the country.  I think that before this goes any further we ought to try to see for ourselves whether the game is worth the candle.  I know that there are some men unfortunately to when life means little, but to whom property is everything.  I should like them to look into the future with regard to this matter.  If the Executive get away with the Bill, succeed in securing the assent of the Dáil to this policy, and succeed in setting themselves up as a dictatorship, does any man imagine that they are going to maintain themselves permanently in that position? The life of dictators in all countries is comparatively short, but the expense of a dictatorship may be very great, and at the end who is going to pay for it?  I do not know who will be in this House when the accounts in this regard come to be totted up at the end of the regime.  Possibly I will not be here, and possibly my Party will not be here. Other people will be here.  If they are here, I charge them with this as their <Col N="249" /> responsibility and as their duty, that whatever this Bill costs the cost of the Bill will not be borne by the community, but will be borne by those who are now driving it through the House against their better judgment in default of any evidence that there is any necessity for the Bill.  There are men on the opposite benches who are quite calmly going into the Lobby backing the Government by their votes.  I hope when there is another Minister for Finance replacing the present Minister that he will see that these men who backed this policy by their votes will back it by their private fortunes as well.</P>

      <P>A situation which was very much the same as this was previously considered&mdash;I am not quite sure whether Deputy MacEntee was raised to what was called Cabinet rank in his organisation at the time&mdash;certainly by members who did arrogate to themselves such Cabinet rank, and they decided this:</P>
      <P>The continued existence of the Free State Government will depend largely on the ability of the Free State leaders to improve the economic condition of the country and to restore stability and security to its industrial life.  They cannot do this with any degree of success while there remains in the country an armed force not under their control and hostile to their State, implying by its very existence a threat of armed action against them at any favourable moment.</P>

      <P>I think that a very useful thing has been done both by the Minister for Industry and Commerce just now and by the Minister for Agriculture some time ago in tearing off completely the mask of hypocrisy with which the President succeeded in covering over this proposal of the Government.  The President came here in the guise of a statesman.  He came here appealing to all Parties to consider the situation that he alleged existed in the country, and asking that the representatives of the people would discuss and decide what action was best suited to deal with the situation. But the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in quoting that document, and the Minister for Justice last night in quoting a similar document, made it quite clear that the main purpose behind the proposal was the making of Party capital for Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;the sole and main purpose behind the proposal.  The observation which the Minister has just read from that document is a very sensible observation, but I want to know now if these documents which the Minister has secured, and which relate to the year 1925, are the reason for this Bill.  Have they anything to do with it?  Is this Bill introduced because the Minister discovered these documents?</P>

      <P>I say so now.  The document, on the admission of the Minister, has nothing to do with the proposals before the Dáil now.  These proposals have nothing to do with the professed desire of the President to have peaceful and stable conditions in this country.  These proposals are introduced here in order to create a position favourable to Cumann na nGaedheal in the coming election.  It is my sincere conviction that the introduction of the Bill, accompanied by the speeches made by various Ministers in this Dáil and outside, will have the effect of strengthening the organisations that they purport to suppress, and I say that that is what the Government want.  They are trying to squeeze Fianna Fáil between the hammer of Cumann na nGaedheal and the anvil of the I.R.A.  That is the political design behind this measure.  It was not produced as the result of any sudden crisis which arose.  The Minister for Local Government, in a rash moment, &ldquo;blew the gaff&rdquo; last night&mdash;he gave the game away.  This measure, he said, was introduced because the Government decided that the civil was is going to start when the Government want it to start and not when the I.R.A. want it to start.  That is what the Minister for Local Government said last night, and by that declaration he destroyed the whole pretence that these proposals are the result of any crisis which has arisen in the past few months.  He revealed the fact that the Executive Council coldly and calmly sat down and decided to provoke a civil war now for some particular reason.  What was the reason?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason? That is a question which the Dail has to ask itself.  The Government no doubt visualised the I.R.A. as a potential danger but they did not contemplate that danger manifesting itself in serious form now.  They have decided to provoke it now.  The Minister for Local Government has told us that the Government has selected this period in which to have whatever disorder is to <Col N="252" /> come.  Why did they select this period?  What particular advantage is there to them in having that disorder now instead of at some other period? There is a Eucharistic Congress next year.  No one could contemplate the Government deciding to start a civil war as a sort of side-show to that Congress.  Besides that there is a General Election due.  I say that the Bill is introduced and the situation provoked because the Government think that by doing so they can create a favourable atmosphere for themselves at the General Election.</P>
      <P>It was obvious to-day from the speech made by the Minister for Agriculture that his one concern was to discredit his political opponents in this House.  Every point he made was the point of a party politician.  He was not at all concerned about the effect of his utterances upon the country as a whole.  He was not at all concerned with peace, order, progress and stability. He was concerned only with getting votes by any unscrupulous means that he could.  We have to take it anyway on the word of the Minister for Local Government, who is an authority on civil war, that the Government have decided that this time is suitable for a civil war, or, at any rate, whatever civil disturbance they can provoke.  In the next month or two months or three months they are going to use the powers conferred under this Bill for that purpose, and they have decided that it is advantageous to the nation that they should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be, and I can see Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches considering it advisable to proceed in this way to bring whatever situation there is in the country to a head, to get it over and done with, but I can see an alternative also which Deputies are choosing to ignore.  We have discussed a number of questions in the last two days which have, in my opinion, little to do with the situation we are now dealing with.  I would like very much somebody like Deputy Good or other Independent Deputies who were not associated with the Sinn Fein movement at any time to tell us quite frankly what they think of it all.  They <Col N="253" /> see us and see that Deputies opposite were members of the Army Council of the I.R.A., and were in the Inner Council of the I.R.B. up to 1922, 1923, and perhaps 1924.  Some may be in it still.  They see that we were in the Army Council of the I.R.A. and other organisations up to 1925.  Was there any particular virtue in 1923 or 1925 which made them right or made us right in deciding to cease our connection with these organisations?  Undoubtedly the situation has changed. We must not take it that all the virtue is on one side.  The people with whom we are dealing do not regard themselves as criminals, but it is difficult to try to express their attitude here as I see it without being misrepresented as advocating their policy or outlook.  I do not want to do that, but I do suggest, in view of our past and the associations of individuals on the Government Benches and on these benches with that movement, it is our duty to try the method of common sense before we try the method of repression.</P>
    <P>I say whatever situation exists is due to three main causes, and I would like to put the three causes in the order of importance as I see them.  The first is the absence of an Executive Council that will make any serious attempt to progress towards complete independence. Secondly, the bad economic conditions, and, thirdly, the restrictions imposed upon the political action of certain groups.  If these three causes were removed, if there were an Executive Council in office which had as its declared policy an advancement from the present position, if economic conditions were better, and if it were possible for all groups to send their representatives into this Dáil without compelling them in advance to forswear any political policy they had, we would be able to deal with the situation by the existing law.  It is merely because we choose to ignore this, and because we refuse to consider any remedy for these causes, that this drastic legislation is to be enacted.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, however, cannot take the attitude that there is no alternative to the Bill before it.  There is the alternative which Fianna Fáil is prepared to try, and which it believes will <Col N="254" /> prove more successful than the method proposed by the Government.  I choose to call it the commonsense method. Call it what method you like.  The basis of the suggestion is that the root causes of whatever discontent exists should be removed before repression is resorted to.  If there is violence, if there is an organisation started for the purpose of committing acts of violence, if those root causes are removed, whatever powers the Executive Council in power require to deal with that situation should be given to them. I am not talking of general theories that would apply to all countries.  I am talking of the particular situation that exists in this country.  In view of the past of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government, as well as the past of Deputy de Valera, myself and Deputy Aiken, we are morally bound to try the method of common sense before we try to let the idea of brute force fill our minds to the exclusion of anything else.</P>
    <P>The demerits of the Bill have been discussed at length.  Deputies have heard speakers put forward proposals. Deputies have heard the lucid exposition of Deputy Geoghegan that some of the provisions had no parallel in any legal code in the world, and that this Government had taken on powers that no other European Government except a group of brigands in some Eastern European State had taken on. They are taking powers to declare any act to be a crime which they certify a crime.  The President read out yesterday a list of incidents that occurred. He referred particularly to the suppression of an Orange meeting in Cavan.  There was also one suppressed in Leitrim.  Why did he not refer to that?  Is Deputy Paddy Reynolds, who organised the suppression of that, going to be tried under this Bill?</P>

One of the few safeguards in the Bill the Minister is proposing to delete by an amendment.

      <P>Is not the discussion on this measure very largely due to prejudice against certain members of the Executive Council?  It started from the speech of the leader of the Opposition in attacking at least two members of the Executive Council.  It could have been avoided, and we could have a discussion on the Bill without that prejudice.  Deputy MacEntee comes along and says someone will be charged in a year or two with the cost of this.

      <P>I accept that. I am not making any attempt to insist upon it, but I want to point out that Deputies have the choice of a discussion on this Money Resolution, leading to a Second Stage debate on the Bill, and a discussion on amendments.  In the circumstances it does not seem that <Col N="257" /> the Chair should interfere.  But whatever we are going to discuss should not be discussed by way of question and answer or cross-examination across the floor of the chamber.  Deputy Lemass could, I think, be a little more pertinent to the Money Resolution without explaining how some member of the House deliberately said something that was not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I put to the House is that we should not take the risk of giving to the Executive Council the powers it seeks in this Bill merely because the President assures us that he is only going to use these powers sparingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the assurances the President gives here now.  The President's words will not be in the Bill.  The sections in the Bill are what I am concerned with.  The speech the President made in introducing the Bill and the speeches he made in the course of the debate will not, I am sure, be read before these military tribunals when some prisoner is brought up for trial.  We are concerned with the powers the Executive Council are asking, powers which, we say, are not necessary to deal with any situation in the country that we know of, except they want to provoke a situation, as the Minister for Local Government hinted, in order to make political capital for themselves.  A certain situation does exist.  I am not saying that everything in the garden is lovely, that the country is peaceful and the flowers are beautiful, and that there is no need to worry.  There is a situation which concerns all of us.  But that will not be improved, and it will not be removed by enacting legislation of this kind or by the use by the <Col N="258" /> Executive Council of the powers that this Bill will afford them.</P>
      <P>There is another method&mdash;the common-sense method.  We think that the Dáil, before arming itself with jackboots to deal with these people many of whom, however mistaken they are, hold their convictions quite sincerely, should examine that method.  It was made abundantly clear, particularly by the Minister for Agriculture, that the main purpose behind this Bill is political.  The President himself indicated that by the motion he put down to curtail discussion. Before we saw the Bill at all we knew that it was going to be rushed through this machine by the method of the guillotine.  That may be good Party tactics, but it is not statesmanship and it cannot possibly parade itself as statesmanship.  We knew that also by the speech the President made yesterday, in which he attempted to convey that any Deputy who wasted time, as he said, discussing the Bill was encouraging crime.  That was not statesmanship.  That was a small, petty attempt to score a point over political opponents.  We knew it also by the speech of the Minister for Justice, who talked about the Fianna Fáil Party running away whenever they were asked to come down and do something practical.  He was not concerned with statesmanship.  Quite frankly and openly, he stood up to make as much capital for his Party out of the Bill as he could.  He did not make much.  It was not his fault. The spirit was willing but the ability was weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in which the Dáil finds itself is that, having been moved, as, no doubt, they were by the President's speech, and induced to give a First Reading to the Bill, there are now revealing the whole works behind it. They can see it as something probably devised by the General Secretary of Cumann na nGeadheal with an eye to the coming General Election and an ear to the result of the past by-elections. Knowing the Government Party had a very poor chance indeed of coming back with one-fifth of its present numbers in an election under <Col N="259" /> the circumstances which existed a week ago, they decided to change the circumstances and to try to precipitate a situation in which they would have a khaki election.  No doubt, they succeeded. We cannot go back to the situation of a week ago.  The very introduction of this Bill has created a new situation, but so long as the people of the country know the game the Government are up to much damage cannot be done.  It is only if they are taken seriously that irreparable disaster may be caused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak a second time on this Bill but I cannot refrain from expressing my gratitude to Deputy Lemass for a few of the sentiments to which he has given expression.  A phrase that came into common parlance years ago in Parliamentary circles in Great Britain commenced in this way: &ldquo;What Gladstone said in '86,&rdquo; and then went on.  The British people, in time, grew heartily sick and tired of this phrase and this cant.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Lemass state this afternoon that it was time that both sides&mdash;Fianna Fáil and Cumann nGaedheal&mdash;gave up talking about what was said in 1922, 1923, 1924 or 1925.  The country has had enough of that.  The country wants to know what is going to be done here and now in the present circumstances and situation. Deputy Lemass's solution for the present situation, which he does not deny is a serious and grave one, is on similar lines to what I understand to be Deputy O'Connell's solution. Deputy Lemass says: &ldquo;Remove the root causes.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Connell says: &ldquo;Bring about revolutionary reform.&rdquo;  I ask both these Deputies what is going to happen meanwhile&mdash; before you remove the root causes and before you bring about the revolutionary reform?  Do they think that they will be able to solve the unemployment question in a few months?  Do they think that they will be able to remove in a few weeks the grievances of the small working farmers who are not getting good prices for their produce? Do they think seriously that <Col N="260" /> if they were to remove the Oath from the Constitution to-morrow that they would satisfy those who openly profess the doctrines of Sovietism and declare that what they want is not an Irish Republic, but a Soviet and a Workers' Republic?  I do not think that they can possibly believe that that would be the case.  Therefore, I think it is not fair for them to say, and it is not just to themselves, or to those they represent, to say that that alternative is one to which any body of sensible men could lend countenance for a single moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has spoken strongly against military courts.  I also have spoken strongly against military courts.  I opposed the last Public Safety Bill largely on the ground that military courts were being set up.  I hate the prospect of military courts.  I hate the idea of the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act or doing away with trial by jury.  The last Public Safety Bill was introduced after the assassination of Kevin O'Higgins.  That time was serious enough.  At that time I myself believed that the legislation introduced by the Government was nothing short of panic legislation.  The same cannot be said of the state of affairs to-day. In the meantime there has been a growth of various organisations throughout the country.  There has been a development in arming and drilling.  There has been an importation of rifles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says they were there in 1927.  I say none of them ought to be there to-day, and that is one of the reasons why I am in favour of this Bill.  Whether they were there in 1927 or not has nothing to do with the case.  I say there is no reason for any lethal weapons, revolvers, rifles, or anything else being in the country except they are under the control of the proper authorities in the country.</P>
      <P>The solution we have heard from the Fianna Fáil Party, backed up by portion of the Labour Party, is, to my mind, a very unworkable and academic solution.  We have to deal with facts as they are and conditions as they are. When Deputy O'Connell spoke against military courts I quite agreed that if posible military courts should not be set up, but what is the use of civil courts under conditions like these? What is the use of having men brought before juries, and what is the decency of asking jurymen to act?</P>

      <P>The Deputy quotes Joseph Chamberlain.  That was a very intelligent remark and I am afraid I cannot answer it.  Military courts should not be the ordinary law of the land, and they will not be the ordinary law of the land, they will only be the law in cases of grave emergency, where the Executive Council consider it their duty to cope with them.  After all, who are to be tried by those military courts? Are they to be harmless civilians or innocent people?</P>

If they are the great soldiers they call themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Capt. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are to be tried at all let them be soldiers and let them be men and let them be tried by soldiers too.  We have heard from Deputy O'Connell of the possible danger to the law-abiding citizens if this Bill is passed into law.  Of course there is a possible danger to the law-abiding citizens; nobody denies that fact.  But I venture to say that the danger to the law-abiding citizen when this Bill is passed will be far more remote than the dangers to the law-abiding citizen before this Bill is passed.  What is the position of the law-abiding citizen to-day?  How does he know that at any time if he does not please certain gentlemen who profess to be soldiers of the Irish Republic, and who have arms and ammunition at their command, that he will not be set upon and sent to his grave?  I say the danger to the law-abiding citizen if this Bill <Col N="263" /> is passed will be far less and more remote than the danger and the risk he is incurring and running to-day.</P>
      <P>We heard explanations, almost justifications, as some Deputies said, for the attitude of violence adopted by some sections of the people in this country. It is suggested that because economic conditions are so bad here they have almost the right to resort to such means, that it is only to be expected that the use of the revolver and methods of violence should come into play.  I ask Deputies seriously to consider how that doctrine can be sustained. Is it to be suggested that across the water in Great Britain, where things are far worse than they are with us to-day, where there are 3,000,000 of unemployed, that the people would tolerate the threat of armed force and resistance to the institutions and the law of the land.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly well able to make my speech, and I only welcome these fatuous, rather irrelevant, and, I am sure, friendly interruptions. This Bill does not deal with acts which are ordinarily illegal.  It deals with acts of a special class which amount to treason or sedition, or the preaching of doctrines that tend to subvert the existing institutions and to overthrow the State by violence or force of arms.  I welcome the statement made by Deputy Lemass that he wished we would not keep on reverting to 1922 and the year or two following; that we would concentrate upon the present and do what we can to bring about a state of peace and order, so that ordinary self-respecting, law-abiding citizens will feel that there is the security which is granted to them by the Constitution, which should be theirs by right, and which should be enjoyed by this country in its present condition.</P>

      <P>I asked the President, or some of his Ministerial colleagues, yesterday, to produce whatever evidence or documents the Government had in its possession which would justify the introduction and the passage of this measure, which is regarded by the Government as being so urgently required.  The only documents <Col N="265" /> read in the debate by any Minister were documents that it seems to me apparently passed between certain individuals in the year 1925.  What in the name of goodness has what happened in 1925 between Mr. Sean Russell and Deputy Lemass, and other individuals not then in this House, to do with the measure that is now before us?  Has the Government any documents or any evidence in its possession which were discovered in recent times to show the extent of this menace that exists, and that will prove that there is justification for this Bill?  I want to know from the Minister for Justice if he has any document in his possession which would justify the recent speeches made by some of his supporters&mdash;Deputy O'Connor, Deputy Dolan, and Deputy Hassett&mdash;in Tipperary?  I have read the newspapers very carefully, and I want to know if what I saw in the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; which generally gets notes of the speeches made by Government Deputies beforehand, is correct?  Do I understand that Deputy O'Connor, Deputy Dolan, and Deputy Hassett and other Government Deputies, when referring to the importation of Russian money, had these documents in their possession?  Do they regard them as their personal property, or are these documents supplied to them from the headquarters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party?  Does the Minister for Justice know anything whatever about the money that is supposed to be coming to this country from Russia and elsewhere, about which we heard so much from the Deputies referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A document was read last night by the Minister for Justice giving the whole contents of a communication which was sent by Mr. Russell to Deputy Lemass in 1925.  Surely to God that has nothing to do with the present Bill.  If it has I suggest that the more recent Army Officers' mutiny would come under the terms of a Bill of this kind.  We know that there was a mutiny recently amongst Army officers, and that it led to the dismissal and resignation of some officers from the Army and from the reserve of officers. If a document which dates as far back as 1925 is read surely to goodness the <Col N="266" /> Government might tell us about incidents of which they know a good deal more in connection with the Army officers' mutiny.  If they like let them go back to 1922, or to 1916.  In the opinion of members of this Party who are opposed to the Bill, none of these things have any reference to the measure before the House and the Government makes no attempt to justify a measure of the kind.  Deputy Redmond, like other Deputies, who hear whispers in the Lobby, and who are in constant communication with the Government Party managers told us about arms imported recently.  I was told that arms had been landed in Kerry and in Westport.  Can the Minister for Justice, or the Minister for Defence answer for that?  Can the Minister for Defence tell the House if there is any truth in the statement that has been recently circulated that arms were landed at Westport and in Kerry?  Is there any justification for the circulation of the statements that are going around the city of Dublin that sixty or seventy men drilled in the public square in Listowel on a recent occasion?  If not, why are the Party managers and the principal Government supporters making use of these statements for the purpose of frightening the population which has nothing whatever to do with these irregular organisations, and that the Government intends to put down through the agency of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister for Finance, or from some other minister, the number of additional men that have recently been employed on protection duty?  What is the pay of these men and the expenses per day, whether all the men employed are ex-officers of the National Army, and if they are in receipt of military service pensions?</P>

      <P>Of a different standing, I should imagine, because they are selected men, but there is nobody on protective duty who has not been several years in the Guards. Nothing has been done except to utilise the Guards for this special purpose, and while they are on this particular duty, these men get their ordinary plain clothes extra allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Deputy clearly to understand that he should not take statements he sees in certain daily papers as being correct.  There has been no new force established and as far as recruiting goes, there have been comparatively few men recruited this <Col N="268" /> year.  These were recruited to make up for the ordinary vacancies which occur from time to time in the Guards. So much for that.  Deputy Davin asked me why I quoted a document from the year 1925.  I quoted that document because Deputy Davin asked me what evidence was there that there was any inter-communication between this country and Russia.  I started off by showing that a person who is now a person of importance was then shown to be in Russian pay.</P>

I will show you now some further definite information from a paper which calls itself &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; and describes itself as the official <Col N="269" /> organ of the I.R.A.  I will tell you what the aims and the objects of that army were in March, 1931, and all because Deputy Lemass has been repeating this foolish nonsense which was given expression to yesterday, and which certain orators have been ringing off platforms round this country&mdash;&ldquo;Take away the oath and all will be peaceful.

      <P>From page 3 of that interesting document I read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Revolution is possible when two conditions are fulfilled; there must be a mind collected within an organisation; and there must be a widespread restlessness from the pressure of conditions, and against injustices and wrong existing things. The restlessness manifests itself in <Col N="270" /> unrest that is made clear in big meetings, voices in public bodies, demonstrations, etc., and the presence of the organisational factor is demonstrated by the fact that these mass gatherings are not allowed to go down soft bye-ways.  The restlessness must develop into challenge to the machinery of State and produce clashes between the machine and the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one of the aims of the so-called I.R.A.&mdash;to produce a clash between the people and the machinery of State.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The final stages of revolution bring the mass of the people and the forces of the State into conflict; the most courageous of the mass mind take the main shock of the clash with the armed forces; that is what the army of the revolution is, the stoutest hearts and the clearest minds.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds like Blythe.</P>
      <P>
        <b>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney:</b>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has never happened (and it can't happen) that a sheer military instrument has achieved revolution; such an instrument may change administrations, but never overthrow a system.  We are therefore forced to recognise that the building of the revolutionary struggle forced us to dislodge reform from the leadership of the bulk of the people.  This must be done by building up a struggle against the interests that are degrading the people.  Set deep as they are, in the people, the duty falls on the volunteers to help into groups these minds in the country that see that no solution of the evils that crush us is possible except in the tearing down of the system out of which these evils grow and if we build right towards that solution, the final stages will be a mighty drive to break the connection with England.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There very clearly and distinctly is laid down for you the aims of the I.R.A., that they are going to tear down the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said it was not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>You suggest here, &ldquo;Take away the oath and they <Col N="271" /> will be content with the existing system.&rdquo;  That is the absolute nonsense with which the Deputies childishly seek to deceive their own minds.  I wonder if they are quite so foolish as to deceive even themselves?  They certainly do not deceive other persons.  It proceeds:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To-day we must begin at the root, and use language that is understandable at this stage and lead on step by step to the final struggle. An open revolutionary mass movement must be built up, and our Army will be big if the courage is high in that movement, and that will depend on the leadership being worthy.  In this early building then, we must recognise that the building up of an open struggle is not something to do if it takes on easily; it is as necessary to revolution as an armed force, and if we separate these two factors we shall get Risings and Insurrections but we may never achieve freedom.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There you have the complete aims and objects of the I.R.A.  I gave you yesterday the aims and objects of Saor Eire.  I give you to-day the aims and objects of the I.R.A.  They stand for this and nothing else, open revolution by force.  They stand for the overthrow of the existing state of society in this country, and you come here and say to us &ldquo;Wait, be quite, do nothing, rest supinely, do not use any force. Let them carry on as much as ever they like, wait until we have settled every single economic problem, and when we have settled every single economic problem, then only are we to attempt to deal with them.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass stated before and again to-night what is absolutely sound common sense, that if we allow an armed force in this country which is not under the control of this House, if we allow whatever persons who wish to go out to commit crimes and outrages, the possibility of a solution of our economic problems is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to solve the economic problems, the first and most necessary thing to achieve is peace and order. Peace and order must come first and order and peace will bring a solution <Col N="272" /> of the economic problems.  Deputy Lemass talks about civil war.  There will be no civil war.  The country may rest at peace.  Again and again I have stated and I stated here to-night that I am not in the slightest bit disturbed about the future of this country if the Garda receive the requisite powers for the maintenance of order and if there is set up a proper tribunal which cannot be intimidated.  I said that from platform after platform through the country.  I repeat again in this House to-night that I am satisfied that this Bill is going to restore order in this country and that it will enable us to give our whole attention to the settlement of economic problems.</P>

      <P>What does the Deputy want?  He wants nothing done.  He wants simply to wait.  He has no solution.  He talks about what he says are the methods of commonsense, but he does not tell us what his common-sense dictates to him.  His common-sense, or what he mistakes for common-sense, seems to be this: simply to wait, wait, and let these evil-doers do precisely everything that they want to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said nothing else.  I listened to the Deputy's speech and I could get nothing else out of it.  He said that we wanted to provoke civil war.  I deny it.  We have taken here the powers which will prevent the possibility of civil war.  The Deputy says it is a political advantage to us that we should bring in a measure of this kind.  It may or may not.  This is not the time in which Party considerations should be given any deep thought at all.  This is the time in which every Deputy in the House should act, not as a Labour man or as a Fianna Fáil man; they should all act as Irishmen.  They say that there is a difficult problem to be faced; that there are men who are endeavouring to upset the social system in this country.  In that case they should rise above Party.  I wonder if they will. I wonder if on the benches opposite <Col N="273" /> there will be found men who see and know as they must, the danger which is attacking the present civilisation of this country, who will have the moral courage to do what every single one of them knows in his heart of hearts is the correct thing to do, to support the measure which is necessary for the preservation of peace and the present ordered condition of society.</P>
      <P>If we are getting any political advantage out of that the Deputies opposite can take that away from us. If it is a useful weapon for us it is a weapon that will be stricken in our hands if they wish to take it from us. They can come out and say boldly and openly: &ldquo;We will have no more of this gun work.&rdquo;  But Deputies opposite make excuses for gunmen and say &ldquo;We do not regard them as criminals; they do not regard themselves as criminals.&rdquo;  What are they? Crime is not a subjective thing. Crime does not consist of what a man thinks.  Crime is the breaking of the laws of the country just the same as the breaking of the law of God.  It is no use for a person to say: &ldquo;I am not sinning,&rdquo; when he is.  Sin is not a subjective thing.  The breaking of the law is sin.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily. A person may cheat his conscience, and that is what you are encouraging these young men to do.  You are encouraging them to cheat their consciences; you are encouraging them to go on in the belief that they are entitled to commit murder and that murder by them is not sinful or wrong.  That is what you are encouraging them to do by your attitude to-night.  Deputy Lemass talked of the President's case for the Bill.  The President made an appeal to the Party opposite to act as patriots.  What response did he get?  None at all.  I know that I, personally, and I believe every Deputy at this side of this House, would regard with delight if there came a good strong statement from the Deputies opposite that they were going to support us; that they were going to fling their whole weight and all the influence that they bear <Col N="274" /> in the State against the Party that is making for disorder.  If they would get up on their platform, if their leader, and Deputy Lemass and others would say that it is utterly wrong for these associations outside to have arms; and if they would say to every follower of theirs and to every person whom they could influence: &ldquo;Tell the Guards where the arms are to be found; tell the Guards where the dumps are to be found; give all the information that you yourself might have, or that you can possibly get as to where the arms were in 1925 and in 1926, or at any other time, and where they are now.&rdquo;  I ask the Deputies opposite to be thoroughly genuine if they are sincere behind their leader when I understood him to say that now this Oireachtas is the one and supreme power in the State.  If the Deputies are sincere in their beliefs and sincere in following them, then they should do everything that is necessary for the preservation of the power of the Oireachtas.  It is their duty to do everything that can deter these persons who are endangering that power or infringing on that power.  It is the duty of Deputies opposite to plead with persons who have arms that they should give up and surrender these arms.</P>

      <P>If Deputies opposite are sincere in their statements and if they are opposed to crimes of violence; if they are opposed to unauthorised persons in endeavouring to upset this State by force of arms they will take that course, and that course will be the test of their sincerity.  It is a matter on which the country at any rate should form some opinion. Deputy Lemass was not satisfied with what he could say himself about this Bill.  He quoted Deputy Geoghegan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Geoghegan is in the House at the present moment, because I do not believe that Deputy Geoghegan, who is a member of the Irish Bar, could possibly talk the inconceivable nonsense that he was reported by Deputy Lemass to have talked.  I was not in the House when Deputy Geoghegan was speaking.  I <Col N="275" /> am sure that he could not have said the unmitigated nonsense that Deputy Lemass unkindly attributes to him. Deputy Lemass said that Deputy Geoghegan declared that in this Bill there was the power in the Executive Council to make any act a crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy quoted Deputy Geoghegan as an authority for that statement.  Well, of course, that statement is absolute and entire nonsense.  No such power is given in the Bill at all.  There is no power given in the Bill to the Executive Council to declare any act a crime.  Where a crime has been committed, the Executive Council can, if it is a crime of a political nature, send it for trial before the tribunal. It does not create a crime.  It simply gives, in certain cases, power to send a certain class of crime before the tribunal.  The creation of the crime and the choosing of the venue for the crime are things so hopelessly absurd that I am glad indeed to discover that it was not Deputy Geoghegan, a member of the Irish Bar, who put forward that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that there is power here to interfere with the right of every citizen.  There is no power in this Bill to interfere with the right of every citizen.  This Bill is a Bill which preserves the right of the law-abiding citizens, which preserves the rights of law, which preserves the rights of this House and may preserve the very existence of this House.  There is no right and no power given in the Bill to interfere with any citizen unless the courts have got the suspicion that that citizen comes within the designation of a person who is engaged in breaking the law.  And no person who keeps himself clear from suspicion, no person who lives a law-abiding life, unassociated with criminal conspiracies, need at all fear the operation of this <Col N="276" /> Bill.  There is no use in misrepresenting, as the Deputy has done, what the Bill contains.  This Bill contains a code of law which is adequate to deal with the present situation, adequate to deal with any situation which will arise, and adequate to obtain that there shall be no exercise of sovereign authority in this State by any power except this Oireachtas, the one spot in which sovereign authority is placed, the sovereign authority which comes from the people of this State.</P>

      <P>We have been told that this Bill does not embrace every citizen.  It has been made very clear by the Minister exactly what that means.  It does not embrace the citizen who can keep himself clear of suspicion.  That is in other words a definition which includes a person is something entirely outside his control. If a person will keep himself clear of suspicion, clear of suspicion by somebody else, then he has no fear.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Corry stay quiet?  He has no power whatever, no power of any sort or kind whatever inherent in himself to keep himself clear from suspicion in the mind of somebody else.  Everybody who is capable of coming under the suspicion of any one of a whole set if designated persons, who is capable of coming under the suspicion of any one of a collection of designated persons becomes automatically a person returnable for trial at the peril of his life by a closed court-martial with no procedure of any sort or kind set down before him, with no appeal, with no publication of the proceedings, with no standard of evidence upon which they are to deal.  I do not know anybody in the whole country who does not come under the definition of the people who are included in the Bill as given by the Minister.  Have they not suspected each other?  Have they not accused each other of organising conspiracies in the organised forces of their own country?  Is there one single man of them who is clear of the possibility of coming under the suspicion of any other one of them?  There is nobody clear under this Bill.  We <Col N="277" /> have got to find money for this thing. And what have we got to find money for?  For a Bill which enables a Minister to declare any two people to be an association; and in so doing to declare these people to be members of an illegal association to subject them to the risk of trial by closed courtmartial at the peril of their lives for any offence.  There is no definition of any kind which limits the word to any offence whatever which the Minister can be got to certify in writing, in his opinion, because under 7 (3) it would cover everything which one could possibly imagine a person to do.</P>
      <P>I am probably one of the strongest pleaders for law and order in this country.  I do it on economic grounds. I do it because I know the cost to this poor community of maintaining resistance against a small minority of anti-social people of any kind&mdash;ordinary criminals and enemies of the social structure&mdash;for the benefit of the whole. And because we cannot afford in this poor country the high extravagance of a costly legal organisation to maintain that, I want the law respected. But I cannot ask the people to respect the law until it is itself respectable. This law is not respectable.  It is a law for worms; it is a law for crawling creatures.  It is a law for a country which, if it respected it, would have no respect for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They would lose the only basis upon which their testimony to the value of the law would be any good.  We have had every sort of drivel talked from the exponent of sober justice, who is the Minister for Justice.  Theology?  Why does not the expert in theology, who keeps a Kempis on his shelves and Calvin in his heart, take him out and give him a few elementary lessons, or better still, get him a penny catechism and ask him whether a man can commit a sin without knowing he is doing it.  That is the doctrine which is being preached by the Minister for Justice of this most Catholic portion probably of the whole world.  He has actually had the effrontery to go upon <Col N="278" /> the Front Bench and declare, standing in his official position, the most scandalous heresy that I have ever heard uttered, a heresy which would be incapable of utterance by anyone who had any intelligence, whose intelligence had not been completely submerged by the national spirit which he has imbibed.</P>
    <P>After three or four hundred years the American Republic introduced a few years ago their eighteenth amendment; I am going to give you a parable.  It was introduced after extraordinary delays and extraordinary examination.  Every single State in the country had separately to decide upon it.  The whole State drawn together in its Congresses had to decide upon it.  There were Referendums and Polls of various kinds and eventually they did decide on the eighteenth amendment.  Its purpose was good. It was to deal with an admitted evil. The intention was to remove that evil. After four or five years the American people know that the result of that well-internationed effort to alter their Constitution after the most careful examination of the evidence upon which it was being done has been a mistake of a fatal and fundamental character.  It has organised crime upon the highest scientific basis.  It has built up an organisation of crime with an armoury, with financial resources and with technique of a kind such as the world has never seen.  It has brought the whole body of American law into contempt and has risked the whole stability of the American State in the relation of its people to respect for the law, despite those careful precautions and the length of time taken in passing it with that good intention. What are we doing here?  Not after consulting the people, not after careful consideration even in this House, not with proper time to consider the matter, and not after trying for alternatives and seeking those co-operations and helps which might have enabled the thing to be done, but hastily we have now introduced our seventeenth amendment in nine years and our sixteenth amendment in two years for the purpose of doing a thing which is ostensibly good, with the best objects <Col N="279" /> in the world, as professed, but which is going to have the same effect as the eighteenth amendment in the American Constitution.  It is going to build up evil in the attempt to destroy it.</P>
    <P>If I could see any hope in this thing, if I could see any means whatever by which this could be made for the benefit of the people, by which it could be made to bring the masses of the people, especially the young people, the 30,000 a year of new people who are going to be kept in this country behind the general body of the law by a motion of this kind the position would be different.  But in my opinion this is going to drive a wedge in the law itself.  In the amount of its punishment, in the method of its application and in the form of trial which leads up to the decision it violates justice in relation to professed crime, so that it itself becomes criminal.  The whole body of the law in its sanctity in relation to the people is attacked in the process.  You are wrecking any possible hope of putting the people in a real spirit behind the law when you pass a law which is obviously and fundamentally wrong, bad, unfair and dishonest in its application and capable God knows of terrible abuses.</P>
    <P>When Draco was asked why he had for all crime the punishment of death he said that any crime against the State deserved death, and he knew no greater punishment for greater crime. Is that true to-day?  Are there to be no preliminaries?  Is death to be the gift for which men may pray upon their knees?  You had a case given here on the personal knowledge and authority of two Deputies of the House.  Deputy Boland, who as a witness to facts within his own knowledge, is a man whom no one in this House will challenge. You had that testimony certified by Deputy Dr. Ryan from his own knowledge. There were preliminaries to death in that case.  Is that what is going to happen?  Are these people going to be dragged in, any person that they choose, and before they are subjected to the farce of trial, before they are subjected to the certainty of condemnation by unnamed and hidden judges in secret courts, are they going <Col N="280" /> to be not merely questioned but put to the question?  All that power is here, and it is given to men whose mentality in relation to those to whom they are opposed has been illustrated in their speeches and in their acts here to-night.</P>
    <P>Assume for a moment that the Minister for Agriculture was the Executive Minister who was to certify in writing, a man who in this House has said that we were Catalysts of murder; that the whole of those who were responsible for the constitutional movement towards change were Catalysts of murder, what would be his responsibility in relation to this whole body and those who support it?  The Minister for Agriculture has got up in this House and said that he would prove or attempt to prove&mdash;he believed himself that he had the proof and that the proof was good enough&mdash;direct connection between the men who sit upon this Front Bench and the murder gang. What would be his responsibility, what would be his absolute bounden duty in conscience but to throw the whole constitutional movement of Republicanism also under the ban and under the fear of one of those tribunals with a sentence of death for any offence which he might choose to imagine.  That is the position.  There is no man in this State who has an enemy over there who is not under this Bill in direct and immediate peril.  That being so this Bill itself is fundamentally bad. You are putting into the hands of men whose previous conduct does not entitle you to regard them as responsible men in relation to the lives and properties of those to whom they are politically opposed&mdash;decent men&mdash;the power of life and death.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flinn got one shock in his life and it drove him to the writing of nervous literature.  It has made him an orator.  Whether he is addicted to anything more than oratory I do not know, but at any rate we get the oratory.  What is all this oratory about?  Let me relate it to two or three cases.  John Ryan was murdered at night and left on the roadside; Carroll had his head blown off <Col N="281" /> in a lane near Dublin; MacInerney was shot in the back and the State Solicitor in Co. Clare was outraged.  That is the oratory; that is what brings forth this oratory from the man who got a great shock the time the Great War was on.  Now, relate this Bill to those things.  No honest man, no law-abiding man should have any fear, or has any fear, of this Bill.  Deputy Geoghegan, and God knows he never was more than a sheep in wolf's clothing at the best, had fear of the Bill before he saw it.  He asked to-night why Deputies did not get at least a week to consider this measure&mdash;a week to consider and understand it, he said. Before he had seen it, even if seeing it would have led to his understanding it, he got afraid and he recommended that pressure be put upon people not to have this passed.</P>

      <P>We read in to-day's paper of a protest that has been made against this Bill.  What are the circumstances of the protest as given in the paper?  We see that two men called upon a town clerk and asked that a meeting of Commissioners be held to protest against this Bill.  The <Col N="282" /> clerk said it could not be done until there was a requisition calling the meeting.  They said to him &ldquo;Go and get a requisition.&rdquo;  As the paper phrases it, &ldquo;the town clerk complied.&rdquo; A requisition was got, signed by the Chairman and five others, calling the meeting.  Need the paper have gone on to say, as it does, that &ldquo;the meeting was held and a resolution of protest was passed unanimously?&rdquo; Deputy Geoghegan pressed the button, reckless and indifferent to what was going to happen after he pressed that button, Deputy Geoghegan going red!  After his eyes had been fawning obsequiously upon the great red robes of the judges under the old British regime, it is but natural that he should go red.  He goes red&mdash;a most nauseating sight to see respectability, as typified by Deputy Geoghegan, come to that point.  The serious thing is that behind the follies of a man like Deputy Geoghegan one has to consider the position of people who are going to take that sort of performance as a backing for them.  We are going to get the position that Deputy Lemass perfectly described in an old document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has started on a Money Resolution and on that Money Resolution Deputy MacEntee thought fit to talk of economic conditions in this country.  I throw back to these Deputies their own summing up of the situation in 1925.  I make no statement to the effect that there is any army that they control at this moment, but I say the same views are sound now with regard to any unauthorised army in this country.  I will state those views as they are precisely phrased in this document: &ldquo;The continued existence of the Free State Government will depend largely on the ability of the Free State leaders to improve the economic condition of the country and to restore stability and security to its industrial life.  They cannot do this with any degree of success while there remains in the country an armed force not under their control and hostile to their State, implying by its very existence the threat of armed action <Col N="283" /> against them at any favourable moment.&rdquo;  I do not care who controls that army; as long as it is not controlled by and under the authority of the State, it does provide a menace to the economic stability of the country and we are not going to allow that to last a day longer than we can stop it.  Deputy Lemass took from my reading of that, that I was making some allegation of connivance as between him and those groups.  I do not need to tell him that I made no such allegation.  The allegation, at any rate, was refuted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke of our trying to provoke a situation here for our own political betterment.  Deputy Davin was one of the men who previously talked about dumps.  He asked was there ever a dump and he threw doubts upon whether the Killakee dump was ever discovered.  He threw doubts upon whether there was anything like that ever in existence.  &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; came out immediately with its own comment upon that matter.  I will take an except from the issue of 11th of July last: &ldquo;There is a tendency to make the reports of conflicts between the Imperial forces and the I.R.A. a basis for stunt politics, to be fought out on the basis of facts manufactured to suit the needs of parties.  Cosgrave gets &lsquo;dumps&rsquo; into headlines and Fianna Fáil energetically strives to make their headline.  &lsquo;Dumps, moryah!&rsquo; Now, the fact is there are dumps: the arms stored in them are in good order &mdash;even enemy publicity comments on this&mdash;arms are in constant use for drill purposes, and generally an energetic campaign to build up an army that will serve the mass of the Irish people goes steadily on.&rdquo;  I accept Deputy Lemass's view in 1925 that while there is an army and these dumps there and arms being energetically used, there cannot be much in the way of economic stability in the country.  People talk fatuously of tariffs.  &ldquo;A tariff a day to keep the I.R.A. away,&rdquo; is no policy. Deputy Lemass propounds that policy and knows himself it is fatuous.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated over and over again that there was not such economic progress as he expected there would be, and he himself has stated the reason for it.  The reason is still there.  We are asked: &ldquo;Why not take some other method than the Constitution Amendment Bill&rdquo;?  I have heard no comment yet in detail with regard to the other method.  Deputy MacEntee, I understand, talked last night of a conference with regard to Article 17.  Deputy de Valera tried that already with the people who are now outside and did not succeed in getting them to accept his resolution in March, 1926.  The Deputy stated that if the admission Oath was removed from this Assembly then it became not a matter of principle, but only of expediency as to whether people should enter.  There was a counter-resolution tabled to that one by Father O'Flanagan saying that it was incompatible with the principles of Sinn Fein that anyone should enter any authority established under what they described as British legislation, and Father O'Flanagan's resolution beat Deputy de Valera's resolution. We are asked now to go to the people who refused that resolution from the Deputy and say: &ldquo;We may take out this Oath,&rdquo; and what is going to happen? At any rate to have such a conference would be weakness.  If people in this country are going to be allowed to pick and choose as to what they will obey in the existing law and what they will not obey, then there is no end except chaos.  If there is going to be a group idea with regard to the Oath to-day, as the President said yesterday, will there be a group idea with regard to the socialisation of property to-morrow, and when a new Government is faced with that, is there to be a conference to remove the impediment to these people talking part in political life in the later period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been measures of this type before and on every occasion on which measures of this type were brought in we had threats about gatherings that were to be on the hillsides, about gaols being full of people, and, as Deputy Lemass said, there was to be an accession of strength <Col N="285" /> for the people aimed at by reason of the repressive measures put forward. We have had our experience and there was no great filling of gaols in the recent years and there was no accession of strength to the outside people.  The fact that stares everybody in the face is this, that the Public Safety Act, passed in 1927, prevented all political crime while it lasted, and it was not six weeks repealed until we had the murder of Armstrong, followed by the shooting of White and by the series of things which the President read out yesterday, and which apparently Deputy Davin did not hear or advert to.  He said to-night that all he could hear of was of documents going back to 1925, forgetting the actual incidents that were detailed in the President's speech, not a single one of which is as much as a year old.</P>
    <P>A question was asked to-day in an earlier speech with regard to America and a contrast was made as between the number of amendments there have been to the Constitution here and the limited number of amendments to the American Constitution. Deputy Flinn tried to make play with that by talking of the long and detailed process that had to be gone through before a constitutional amendment could be passed in America.  We, thank Heavens, have not that system.  The Constitution is easily changed and can be changed to meet difficulties and should be changed to meet difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;if and when the majority of the people want it, but not before.  Why has the United States not to make any legal changes with regard to the sort of menace we are now facing?  Because they have already made it in one stringent way, if not particularly in our stringent way.  The law which provides for the acquisition of American citizenship has this clause in it:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That no person who disbelieves in or who is opposed to organised government, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organisation <Col N="286" /> entertaining and teaching such disbelief in or opposition to organised government, or who advocates or teaches the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of any officer or officers, either of specific individuals or of officers generally, of the Government of the United States, or of any other organised Government, because of his or their official character, or who is a polygamist, shall be naturalised or be made a citizen of the United States.</P>
    <P>They have no room there for what Deputy O'Hanlon described as the Asiatic rats who are running through this country at present.  They are not allowed to be American citizens and they can be deported if by any chance they get in.</P>
    <P>We have tried for a number of years to get the people in this country to settle down under a particularly free and ordered Constitution.  The majority of the people have accepted that invitation and are living in an orderly and peaceable way, and the order, peace and security of their existence are imperilled by a small group, some fanatical, others purely and decidedly criminal, who have stood out to break the Constitution and to break it by force, who talk to people, not by addressing them or appealing to their reason, but with a gun in their hands. The only way they can penetrate to these people's brains is with a bullet through the brain.  We are going to stop the Constitution and the liberties of the people being imperilled by that group of people.  I make a present to any Deputy who has spoken, or who intends to speak, of what might happen under this Bill.  Let imaginations roam and say that every peace-loving citizen could be, under a criminally-minded Executive Council, brought into peril both of his liberty and of his life under this Constitution.

We are asked what is the alternative. I say we have been preaching what the alternatives is, and we believe that that alternative is one which will save this country and put it on stable conditions, if adopted.  The Minister asks us what guarantee have we if the Oath were removed that these people would come in and accept the present Constitution, and he says when Deputy de Valera brought in a resolution at the Sinn Fein Convention some years ago he was beaten in that resolution.  I know I was beaten on it.  I was beaten by a very small majority on it, and if majority rule had obtained, if we were not told definitely beforehand that majority rule was not going to obtain, because a certain matter of principle was involved, I would have continued on in that organisation and in a very short time I am certain I would have got a majority vote in that organisation as I got it throughout the country.  If the majority of people throughout the country had the barrier here removed so that they could come in here freely the chief reason for the opposition to this Assembly would be gone.  I say it is the fairer way.  We talk of the Kellogg Pact and we go over to Geneva and try to make peace between the Chinese and the Japanese and we say that we must no longer use methods of force, that we must try and secure that national objectives must be advanced by peaceful methods.  Peace for everybody except for our own people.  Understanding for every people except the people who were misled by gentlemen who are now assuming to themselves the powers of life and death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Minister for Justice speaking a while ago and reading out <Col N="288" /> articles from &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oglach na hEireann.&rdquo;  I am perfectly certain that the men who wrote these articles, if they were not inspired by the same motives, got largely the substance of these articles from a little book called The Voice of Freedom&mdash;selections from Irish Freedom from 1910 to 1913.  One of the first articles is by Earnán de Blagd.  He tells the young men of Ireland what arms means.  He says there can be no military spirit worth anything if the men of the country are not virile and hardy, if their arms are flabby.  We have heard that word in another connection recently.  &ldquo;If their arms are flabby and their palates crave delicate food, if they are but talkers and artists, crafty merchants and cunning artificers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are taunted that it was not the interests of the trader or the worker we had at heart.  We had this doctrine preached by Ernest Blythe and if some people are not yet able to see the changes that Ernest Blythe has convinced himself have taken place, at least he ought to have, in his heart, some pity and understanding for the men who think still as he thought and believed when he was organising for the I.R.B.  &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;ceased to be the island of saints and scholars simply because her people gave too much time to their books and prayers and too little to feats of strength, daring and sword play.  Let us, therefore, train our bodies to be strong and hardy and our minds to the thought of war that we may not shrink from slaughter. Let us learn the use of arms that we may be ready for to-morrow; for, to-morrow or the next day our opportunity will come.  No vigilance of spies or guarding of ports can prevent us arming if we will, and if we have weapons and ourselves ready there shall be no failure and no fiasco.&rdquo;  The men who taught that doctrine and who are sitting in these seats because it was to a certain extent successful&mdash;these men who talk of a free Ireland&mdash;of the power of the Irish people now to rule themselves&mdash;these people who spread that doctrine in spite of the Church talk of the Church.  They used secret societies which were condemned <Col N="289" /> by the Catholic Church.  They have seen the errors of their ways.  New circumstances have arisen which have convinced them.  They are clear thinkers.  Their brains are active.  They are able nicely to discern exactly what the Governor-General does and does not mean, and what the Oath of Allegiance does or does not mean.  But the average young man in the country has not that fine discernment they have got and at least they should have some bit of ruth towards him, make some attempt to give him a chance.  There should be some attempt to lead to the right those beautiful sentiments and honourable ambitions of these young men and from the path to which they have been driven.</P>
    <P>Every one of us who was in that movement&mdash;I am not talking of some of these men&mdash;this man to-day who talked of himself as a democrat first. He admitted he was in the national movement by accident.  I am not appealing to these men.  They have never felt the sentiment.  I am talking to the men who must have understood it, who went out and braved everything in order to try to achieve the things that were intended, who tried to arm themselves when there was just the very same appeal for order, the very same appeal for respect for established authority.  When all these appeals were made these men went out. They stood against it all.  They were outcasts in their own country.  They stood against it all because they hoped that some day those arms might be useful to win, as they put it, a crown for Dark Rosaleen.  It is the same thought that is at the back of the minds of the young men who are driven mad by the attitude or want of understanding&mdash;the understanding that they can see can be got between the Chinese and the Japanese, but that understanding which Irishmen seem to be incapable of giving to brother Irishmen. I want to appeal to commonsense, to ask these men who, if they will only put themselves out of it for a moment, can understand these feelings: &ldquo;Do you want to humiliate them?  Are you not content with victory?  Must they pass under the yoke?&rdquo; The President of the <Col N="290" /> Executive Council once made the most shameful boast that ever came from a man who was in a position to represent the Irish people.  The boast was that he had made his opponents go under the yoke, made them swallow the Oath of Allegiance to a British King.  That is his boast.  That is what he achieved after all the blood that has been shed in order to try to win, after seven hundred years, freedom for this country.  They tell us we are free, and yet the moment they come to bring in even this Bill they must insert the Oath, the badge of slavery, recognised as such by all outside.</P>
    <P>When the civil war was over I put forward a proposition honestly that went as far as it was possible for a human being, to get acceptance for it. So far, indeed, that Senator Jameson, as he was, and the man who accompanied him, Senator Douglas, when they saw it, said that of course they could say nothing, but to take it to the President of the Executive Council. One looked to the other and said: &ldquo;As a business man I would take this.&rdquo;  He was anxious to see stability re-established after the war and an attempt made to give a new start to the country. That attempt was turned down because Eamonn de Valera, under it, they said, would get back again to public life.  It is a terrible thing to think that men could be animated in big things by such mean motives.  It is a terrible thing to think that because they thought I could get back to public life that that was sufficient to turn down proposals which in themselves would be good for the nation.</P>
    <P>To me, anyhow, it is not understandable. I find it very difficult to think that there would be any men who had in their hearts a particle of love for Ireland&mdash;as these men must have had, I will admit, when they worked for Ireland in the past&mdash;who would be so blinded, as the result of strife, enmity and hatred, that they would be willing to sacrifice the good for the country that could have been obtained by negotiation on these terms.  Look at these terms to-day and what are they?  Terms which meant that the majority-rule of the representatives of the people would be accepted, terms <Col N="291" /> which meant that all arms would pass under the control of that authority, to be held, pending an election on the issue, terms which exacted only one thing, or asked for only one thing&mdash; that those who had honestly fought to maintain the State which that democrat over there prates about&mdash; he is not present at the moment&mdash; who prates about democracy.  What are his views about a State that had been established on the most democratic grounds on which a State ever was established&mdash;about the Republic of Ireland, which was established here on universal suffrage and the free vote of the people?  All the people who were defeated in that civil fight had pledged their lives to maintain that State, had fought to maintain it as long as they could, without the slightest chance of success, and they only surrendered that ideal, which had been the ideal of the people and which had led them into the path they had taken, had only surrendered that ideal and allowed the Republic to be disestablished when they were no longer able to protect it.  At least, there could have been understanding of their attitude if anger, hatred and ill-will had not got into the hearts of the people who stood in the way of it.  All that was asked was that these men should not have to endure the humiliation of an act of national apostasy, as they regarded it&mdash;to forswear the complete independence of Ireland and to accept the sovereignty of that Crown from which they had declared themselves independent a few years before.  These are the men who are being hounded, these are the men who are being driven, without the slightest attempt to understand their motives, without the slightest attempt to make right use of those motives which are, in themselves, noble and good&mdash;the desire to have the complete independence of their country.  Instead of giving them a chance to change with the new conditions, to accept the new conditions and to orientate themselves in the direction which is necessary if they are to advance in the future, these people are to be condemned to <Col N="292" /> death, condemned to the treatment we have been told of by Deputy Boland and to the treatment we know was served out to a number of other such people during the war.  They are to be taken into those secret tribunals and maltreated and nobody is to hear a word about it, and nobody is to be allowed to raise his voice in protest. That is the situation.</P>
    <P>I know it is exasperating when you cannot get people to listen to what you think is reasonable.  I can understand exasperation in these circumstances. I have often put myself in the position of having to deal with people in these circumstances.  I would say, at least, that I should have infinite patience, that I should try very, very hard indeed&mdash;as hard as I would try to avoid the risk of war between the Japanese and the Chinese&mdash;to save them, ourselves and the country generally from the consequences of rashness on the one hand, and, if you like, unreasonableness on the other.  I am quite willing to admit that.  Sitting down calmly and taking the position as it is, there is a considerable amount of unreasonableness in the attitude taken up&mdash;that if this Assembly were free, if it were completely open and representatives of all sections could come here, if the only rule that was asked to be accepted was the rule of the majority of the elected representatives of the Irish people it should nevertheless not be recognised&mdash;I say, undoubtedly, it is hard not to feel that there is unreasonableness, to say the least, in that position.  But tradition is a hard thing to kill.  They have been reared in that tradition.  That is the gospel which has kept Irish nationality alive through all the centuries of persecution. Shall we not have, at least, a small bit of understanding of that? Shall we not try to the utmost limit of our patience to give an opportunity for reason to assert itself?  We are given as an excuse for this Bill what can only have been a stupid interview. Any of us who have had dealings with Pressmen&mdash;particularly foreign Pressmen&mdash;know that they try to write up every situation in Ireland in an extravagant way.  They want to know merely: is it black or is it white?  If <Col N="293" /> you say it is not black, then it is white, and white with a vengeance.  If you say it is not white, then it is black, and black with a vengeance.  That is the attitude of many a reporter and interviewer, and I have no doubt that the interview&mdash;which was read out in this House, and which was supposed to be given by Frank Ryan&mdash;was a very imperfect representation of what really took place.  If that interview, for instance, was submitted and passed by him, I can only say he was acting the amadán.  Because that happened, we are going to have a situation created in which we may have men taken out and shot by the roadside.</P>
    <P>It is said that we have no respect for the lives of citizens.  We have respect for the lives of citizens.  We have respect for the life of every citizen.  We have respect for the lives which may be forfeited if this Bill is put into operation and does not operate exactly as the Minister for Agriculture expects.  I hope sincerely it will.  I hope sincerely the result of it will be that there will be no activities. I suppose I have to be very careful of my words.  I used the word &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; when I referred to the long list read out by the President.  Wilful distortion &mdash;absolutely wilful distortion&mdash;was resorted to by the Minister for Agriculture in order to try to get material to make a speech here to-day.  I was supposed to be an adept coiner of phrases.  That is one of the myths these gentlemen have been careful to create.  I speak frequently here.  I speak, as a rule, straight out.  I rarely use notes, except when there are figures or something of that sort in question.  I am supposed to be a very skilful weaver of phrases. I used the word &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; because there was a long, long list.</P>
    <P>I was interested in listening to the Minister for Education using that word. He talked of &ldquo;incidents,&rdquo; the very same word.  The only objection he found to the word was because of the fact that &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; might mean isolated occurrences, and that there were here a regular train of them indicative of some organisation and directing policy.  Now the insinuation, of course, was that I <Col N="294" /> thought lightly of murder, that I thought lightly of the taking of people's lives, that these were only mere trifles that did not affect me.  I used the word because it was the only word that occurred to me to cover the whole list.  When the other gentleman, the Whitechapel gentleman who has just spoken, tried to refer to the same things he called them &ldquo;a series of things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture tried to make out that I had been blowing hot and cold.  I have not been blowing hot and cold.  I do not want any of the young people of Ireland to doubt where I stand on this matter at all.  I do not want these gentlemen, however, to misrepresent me.  I tried to warn, in advance, the young men who were being led on to a false track by the pretence made to them in 1922 that they could continue on with their I.R.B., that they could continue on with the organisations they had in the past, even when this State was set up; that they could continue, and when the time came, no matter what assembly of representatives there might be, they could act independently of that assembly, and use whatever arms came into their hands.  I tried to warn them.  I remember speaking in Thurles, and to make clear the difference in the situation I said: &ldquo;Do not think you can ever do that if this Treaty is accepted.  You cannot do it.  You are going to have a new state of affairs altogether and if you dare to attempt to go along that line there blocks your path an Irish Ministry.  If you want to proceed with your I.R.B., with your secret society, you might have to wade through the blood of Irish Ministers.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is this gentleman who says shame now, going out in the streets to misrepresent me in the damnable way that I was misrepresented on that occasion?  Was it a shame to point out to young men how they would be misled?  Is that Deputy who said &ldquo;shame&rdquo; the gentleman who came to me in 1914 and was the first to ask me, when I was a member of the Volunteers, would I join the physical force <Col N="295" /> party, as he called it, and become a member of the secret organisation which was working inside the Volunteers&mdash;a dual Government&mdash;the one thing that Cathal Brugha tried to stop when the Dáil was founded and we wanted to get real acceptance of the will of the civil executive?  We have the Minister for Local Government now coming along and having the audacity to tell us that he stands always for civil authority.  What was he organising the I.R.B. for when he was a member of the Executive Council? He wanted to fool Seán MacEoin, he wanted to fool Mick Brennan and men like Tobin and Thornton and Cullen.  These are the men he wanted to fool.  He knew they were discovering that they were on the wrong track, that they were led to fight with their brothers on false pretences. He wanted to keep on fooling them when they got restless and found that they had fought their brothers not to get arms in order to make an Irish Republic, but to get arms that were going to be definitely used for the purpose for which the late Lord Birkenhead wished them to be used&mdash;to prevent all those who would ever dream again, as the Fenians and those who came after them dreamt, of achieving the full freedom of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having imbibed the gospel of force preached to them by Ernest Blythe and the rest of them, they believed it was by force and force alone that it could be secured.  What about these men?  What has been their history, the history of the I.R.A. and of the position since the civil war?  They dumped their arms.  Not a shot was fired.  There was an emergency Government formed in October, 1922, for the sole purpose of trying to maintain some sort of control during the fight, which was there and which was inevitable in any case&mdash;to maintain control, to try to direct that fight so that if it were successful it might really lead to the re-establishment of the Republic, and if it failed that there might be some people with some understanding of the things that were involved, who would try to end <Col N="296" /> it on terms not unsatisfactory for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>These arms were dumped.  Why were they kept?  It is easy for people now&mdash;they forget the incidents of the intervening years&mdash;to say these were kept to be a definite menace to peace and order here.  That was not the intention. I know it was not the intention. The intention of keeping the arms at that time was this: There had been no election.  The 1922 election was &ldquo;The Pact&rdquo; election.  The Treaty was not an issue and everyone of you know it.  There was to be an election in 1923, and the Irish people would be given an opportunity of expressing their opinion in that election.  The main idea operating in the minds of those who agreed to the dumping of the arms at that time was this&mdash;that if the Irish people did once more revert to the Republic they should have behind them to maintain that Republic some armed force.  That was the reason.  There were elections held in 1923.  A very large number of people were in jail.  Candidates were in jail.  Those who talk about democracy cannot say, I think, that democracy in the 1923 election got very much of a chance.</P>
    <P>After 1923 the arms still remained; the elected members of that Second Dáil which was suppressed met and one of the first things they did was to record the understanding that because they were not in a position effectively to function, they had no authority at that time to take life.  Therefore, what were they?  They were a kind of nucleus.  The hope was that the Irish people would again revert to the Republican idea.  The idea was the idea of continuity, in order that if at the next elections the Irish people turned back again and did stand by the Republic, that armed force would again be available to defend it.  There was another idea.  I am sure you all remember that miniature General Election in which there were some eight or nine bye-elections at the same time.  When these elections were held there was some gentleman connected with the Executive who proclaimed it aloud that if the Irish people did turn over to <Col N="297" /> the Republic, their elected representatives, although in a majority, would not be allowed to function, and because he said that these young men felt they might have another purpose, that when the majority here proclaimed themselves in favour of the Republic, there might be certain gentlemen who were determined that because they themselves did not want it, the Irish people were not going to have it.  These young men said to themselves: &ldquo;Very good. These people, our opponents, went out and in the name of democracy and in the name of the rights of the people decided to disestablish the Republican State over the bodies of our brothers, and if they proved themselves traitors to that&mdash;perhaps they now might&mdash;and we are prepared to risk our lives again to see that they will not be traitors to majority rule, as they were traitors to the Republican State.&rdquo;  That was the position, and we have this Minister for Finance, this Vice-President of the Executive Council, coming along, and whilst his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, talks about his democracy, this gentleman not very long ago in this semi-official or official organ of theirs, &ldquo;The Star,&rdquo; writes in Irish to the Army.  He speaks of a statement made by an officer addressing the Cadet Corps in Galway.  This officer, addressing the men, said that they were the Army of the people, and that if Fianna Fáil got a majority they would obey a Fianna Fáil Government.  But that is too much for the colleague of our democrat, the colleague of General Mulcahy, this little Cromwell, who thinks in terms of &ldquo;nits may become lice&rdquo;&mdash;who says if there is a rebellion we will have it in our time&mdash; this man whose attitude towards his brothers is this: When he was asked how it was he undertook a civil war and that he did not mind it, although this civil war was infinitely worse than the terrible war which was threatened by Lloyd George, and from which he shrank, he said: &ldquo;This is a war we can win; the other we could not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The trade which he had followed so completely blinded the man that he thought only in terms of the trade and success in his <Col N="298" /> trade, success as a militarist, even though that success was over his brothers.  That was the thing that allured him.  He saw success and indeed it did not require a Napoleon to see success in the conditions that obtained here.  It was a forlorn hope&mdash;I admit it now and always admitted it&mdash;when the Volunteers went out to try and save the Republic: for the majority of the Irish people had departed from it; to save it when the majority of the Irish people had got as their representatives men who had only to beckon their finger and they could get all the ammunition and all the guns and all the support that the British Empire could put behind them.  It was a forlorn hope.  It was only men who had been inspired with the principles which drove them to face the odds in 1916, and who made them a part of their faith, who would have attempted it.  These are the men whom we want to crush now. These are the men who are represented as terrorists, those who never thought of themselves.  They are simply the rats that are to be squelched.  These are the people who were ready to give everything that they had for Ireland, and well we know it, and now they are being deserted by the majority of their people; they have been deserted by old comrades who can no longer see any hope of success in the line they are adopting, by people who were with them originally, but are so far away from them now that the road which they are following is leading diametrically in the opposite direction.  These men are misguided, if you will, but they were brave men, anyhow; let us at least have for them the decent respect that we have for the brave.  They have done terrible things recently I admit, if they are responsible for them, and I suppose they are.  Let us appeal to them and ask them in God's name not to do them.  You sneer at that.  It would be more effective probably than all your coercion and all your threats, all the shame and slime that you tried to pour upon them to-day. These men may say that there is very little hope that their arms can be <Col N="299" /> used to support the people who will revert to the Republic except through the institutions that are at present operating here, and because they cannot become part of these institutions no road or avenue of use is open to them.  They say to themselves, having no other hope: &ldquo;Well, perhaps, again England's difficulty will be Ireland's opportunity, and we will be of use.&rdquo;  They are hugging that vain hope unfortunately to-day.</P>
    <P>It is vain, because, as I told them in Thurles, the situation has changed. The Treaty has been put into operation here.  There are people here to-day vested with whatever authority can be given to them by a majority vote of the people.  Even though we may say that all is not right, as I said before, there must be some authority.  Social order must be maintained, even if there were nothing but a de facto Government.  In the present situation there has to be certain obedience given to that authority if ordinary peaceful, social conditions are to exist.  They are hugging the hope, as I say, that these arms might be used against the only enemy of this country, that is the foreigner. Would it not be a good day's business if we gave these people an opportunity of becoming really valuable citizens here, gave them an opportunity of being effective by being able to co-operate with the majority?</P>
    <P>I have pointed out time after time that if there is to be any progress in this country again, if freedom is to be again achieved it will not be through I.R.B. methods.  It can only be through the leadership that will be given by the elected representatives of the majority of the people.  Any further national advance reason tells us can only be made now under the present conditions through the leadership of the Government that will be elected here.  There is no other way.  Any other way means first of all that you will have to face civil conflict.  I do not think anybody who passed through the anguish of that last conflict wants to see another <Col N="300" /> civil war in Ireland.  Certainly my associations with them up to 1925, and I was fairly closely associated with them up to the time they withdrew their allegiance and reverted to the original Volunteer constitution, made me believe that there was not a single one of them who was contemplating the idea of using his arms against this Assembly here or against the authority of this Assembly.  They had, as I told you, the idea of using those dumped arms.  They thought an occasion might arise in which there would be a conflict between this State and the State that is imposing its will, to a certain extent anyhow, upon it, and then they would have a chance to throw in their lot and fight again for a free Ireland.</P>
    <P>That was their idea then and, as I said, there was also this idea, this very affecting idea, that, perhaps, the gentlemen who had brought off the coup d'etat back in 1922, who at that particular time usurped power and denied the people's representatives an opportunity of meeting in the same assembled Parliament, would do the same again.  When the courts that were established, the courts of the Republic, brought in a habeas corpus decision, the answer of these gentlemen, who pretend they respect the civil law, was to suppress the courts.  Knowing that is the mentality of some of these gentlemen and fearing the possibility that when the Irish people had given a majority vote for a policy other than the policy which is adopted by the present Government, these gentlemen might stand in the way and prove traitors again as they were deemed to have been traitors before, these young men said &ldquo;We will hold our arms for that occasion, too, and stand by the right of the Irish people.&rdquo;  They stood in the past by the established Constitution. They were the Constitutionalists on that occasion.  They were trying to maintain the State and the Constitution which had been established by the democratic vote of the Irish people.  They saw the gentlemen, the gentlemen who went out to fight the civil war in order that <Col N="301" /> majority rule might prevail, coming along and finding fault with this unequivocal statement made by an officer in the Army, when he said that if the Fianna Fáil Government came into power that the Army would be behind the Government.  This gentleman then said: &ldquo;That is only partially true.  I will not accept that.  No, the Army are to be the final arbiters.  The Army are the judges as to whether the people's representatives are acting in accordance with the will of the people or not.&rdquo;  He reveals the mentality that he had, the principles that he had, and that were operative when they brought off the coup d'etat in 1922.  He reveals that same mentality now and in fact he tells that man who has blood in his veins and who is determined that the will of the Irish people, if it does express itself clearly and unequivocally in favour of a new policy, that that will must not prevail.  Let us in God's name not sit down here in Parties. Let us sit down as Irishmen who know the history of our country.  Let everyone of us who sit on these benches remember the principles that animated the people whom we took as our models, remember the principles that drove ourselves into action, action which was condemned.  I will say this now about secret societies, that since the Volunteers were founded they were never necessary&mdash;that if it was required to get examples to prove that the Catholic doctrine with respect to them is right, I could give examples, because every evil that was said to flow from these societies has flown to my knowledge from them.  They brought us success for a certain time, but then they bred division and they made brothers shoot down brothers.</P>
    <P>The people who were taken out and shot on 8th December, 1922, were people who were high in the I.R.B., but they did not follow the dictation of the chiefs.  They knew too much. As one man said to me a month before his death: &ldquo;I, at any rate, am not going to live through this.  If I am caught I know what is meant for me. I know too much.&rdquo;  On one occasion when it was suggested that a secret organisation was necessary in the Army in 1925, I went to the meeting <Col N="302" /> where it was proposed to establish it and told them to look back and consider what had been their own experiences in connection with it, to remember that it was the principal cause of the Treaty being accepted originally, and that it led to murder because of the bitter division that occurred afterwards. And I asked them:&ldquo;Are you going to have the same sort of thing started again?&rdquo; And they decided not to start it.  That is why I said the other day when talking that in my belief the I.R.A. as it stands to-day is not in its constitution a revolutionary secret organisation.  I do not believe they have any oath or secret oath. They may have some general pledge to the original constitution of the Volunteers. We have pledges in parties. We all know it.  I do not know that the pledge involves anything that could be characterised as a secret oath.  They preserve themselves at least from the dangers of a secret organisation. But they had to operate in secret, and because they are operating secretly, the old dangers of secret organisations appear again.  The agents provocateurs are going around in their midst, and you had terrible retribution of the kind that used to come to those who were unfaithful to the promises or to the pledges of secrecy. That is what is happening. Are you as Irishmen who know your own history not going to learn from it a lesson&mdash;are you not going to do something which would give the country a chance of getting on stable foundations? I say that if the present conditions continue, the moment that the period of the operation of this proposed Act is over, it will be no more final than any one of the Coercion Acts of the British was final.</P>
    <P>We remember numbers of them.  We remember that each one of them used to be regarded as final and we found that though they were effective in suppressing those things which they aimed at for the time, the moment there was the slightest relaxation the movement they sought to suppress marched forward again with renewed strength, with increased strength. And that is the position to-day.  Right enough your Safety Act did have a <Col N="303" /> momentary and temporary effect.  But during all that time there was a secret knitting together, there was secret organising, and there was a secret understanding, and all this was accumulating for the first opportunity to give it expression when the pressure was removed.  Is it the aim of the Executive to have a perpetual abrogation of the rights of the citizen?  That is what it means. Is it your aim that anybody who suspects anybody else, that any informer who has a spite against anybody, that anybody who desires to do another harm, that any member of the Guards who has ill-will against somebody else, can bring him before that secret Tribunal and swear away his life?  And what about these lives? These lives are important to the nation too.  We have the duty to protect those innocent lives that might be sacrificed.  I am against this proposal because in all reason it leads to the wrong road.  I am not trying to withhold from any authority any influence that I can bring to bear to make that authority respected.  I am trying to get that authority to look around and see what it may do itself so that its authority may be respected. I have admitted that authority, because there is no other as far as I can see.  In fact I know that there is no other.  I admit the authority.  But then if I may paraphrase what was said about the use of money and of private property: every person has a right to the use of money or of private property, but he has not the right to use it as he wills.  So also the Executive Council has a right to authority, but not the right to use it as whim may wantonly suggest.</P>
    <P>These men may be unreasonable according to our standards, or they may be dense or they may be dangerous. But I am not going to stigmatise them as being vicious in themselves.  Vicious methods are coming in amongst them, and I want to warn them against them.  And if I had my way to do honestly what my will prompts me to do, I would get all these arms throughout the country <Col N="304" /> in.  I would say that there is no further use for them at the present time, because if there is to be a declaration of Irish independence, if there is to be a fight for Irish independence which is to be effective it can only be effective under the leadership of the Government that shall be elected by the majority. I am certain of that.  Every reasonable man must now take up that position.</P>
    <P>What do they hope to do?  Are they foolish enough to think that they can overthrow the armed forces that will be backed by the opinion of the people of this country?  They cannot do it, no matter what doctrines they may imbibe, however mad these doctrines may be.  They cannot do it.  It is futile for them to hope for it.  And even if they did achieve their object they could only do it at the expense of weakening the nation.  Supposing that they were to be successful they could only be successful after a bitter Civil War between brothers in different camps.  Such a Civil War would weaken them and weaken the nation as a whole, and in this weak condition England would have to be faced.  They cannot be successful in a Civil War except they are acting as an Army, behind the organised will of the majority of the people.  That was the secret of our success from 1919 to 1921.  It was not preaching on the vapourings of Ernest Blythe.  It was not such was the cause of our success.  The real cause of our success was that we finally got into the position in which the leadership was given to the elected representatives of the majority of the people; and because the people of the country supported that Government; because the plain people of the country supported them.</P>
    <P>I was not one of those who supported the soldier cult.  It was the gentlemen on the opposite benches who were out for that during the period of the fight from 1919 to 1921.  It was the citizens of the country, the plain people who when an ambush took place had to face unarmed and alone the Black and Tans, these were the most courageous section of our people.  I know it, not the man with the gun in his hand.  I admit it.  I <Col N="305" /> never felt so safe or free from danger in my life as when I had a gun in my hand.</P>

      <P>No, sir; I was not in America at the time; it is a lie.  I came here the moment the Acting President was put into jail.  This gentleman, who knows nothing about it, is only preaching parrot-like the propaganda that was poured out to him.  I came over here when Cork at the time was burned.  I came over here at the beginning of the Black and Tan régime proper.  I stayed in Dublin through it.  I went to the meetings of our Cabinet that were held and when your present President of the Executive Council ran away to England I called him back.  I saved him from the Cabinet that would have kicked him out.  Because I am flabby, perhaps. For a certain position it would be better if I were of the Mulcahy class, who thinks he is a strong man, and does not recognise that the really strong man is the man who conquers himself, and not one who imagines he conquers himself when he freezes every decent emotion and turns himself into a machine.  You do not become strong simply by freezing all those natural instincts that will be in human beings made in the image of God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strong men!  I would not like to have them our judges at the end.  We know these strong men, who simply read some cursed rhetoric as to what is strength and copy it.  The strong man is the man who tries to use his reason and who while using his reason does not dry up all those natural emotions which were surely given to us for some good purpose.  There is the justice I will have.  I know, sir, the sort of justice that would be meted out to some men by General Mulcahy.  When I saw that Bill here the meaning it had for me&mdash;I hope it will not come true&mdash;was that we would have set up the sort of Tribunal where one of the Deputies who is now qualified at law would be brought down again as part of the old I.R.B.  Army Council that he and some others who were serving during the Civil War would be brought back in order <Col N="306" /> that they might again take vengeance on everyone who did not follow the path they indicated for them.</P>
    <P>There is justice and there is mercy.  The mercy that seems to some of us at times to be almost a contradiction of justice.  It is flabbiness according to these gentlemen.  It is flabbiness if you mix a little mercy and human understanding with rigid and strict justice, that in nine out of ten cases is not justice but vengeance.  If you want to do a good day's work for your country reject that Bill.  If you pass that Bill I am willing to stake my reputation for looking into the future&mdash; my reputation if you like for seeing things as they are, that if you pass this Bill and take no steps to remedy fundamental causes you will have a situation in ten years' time that will not be very different fundamentally from the present one.  The same thing holds as to the economic situation.</P>
    <P>We hear one side of Catholic doctrine preached all the time.  That side of it is only half of it.  I could take up some of those Encyclicals and if I read portions of them I would have some of the Deputies on the opposite side, if they did not know where they came from, shouting out Communism at me.  I have been in many difficult situations and I have got as much experience, anyhow, of difficulties as anybody in this House, and I can honestly say that in all these situations, in all these things that I was told as a child, in all these things I accepted as a young man&mdash; in all these things I have never found Catholic doctrine to work out wrong. I never found that there worked out right any matter in which I put my own judgment, as I thought it, before those principles. The fruit of the tree proved I was wrong.  I honestly make that confession. But it is difficult sometimes to put principles into practice.  We are not all Thomas Aquinases.  We are not all able to judge of the extent of the application of principles.  But I do say this, if you follow the ordinary fundamental emotions of the human heart, love for your brothers will never lead you wrong.  If that love is put into operation in the moral, in the political and in the economic <Col N="307" /> sphere, then you need not worry about &ldquo;Asiatic rats.&rdquo;  The Asiatic rats will not interfere with you. You will be immune against any of their inroads, you will have something there which will give real stability to the country.</P>
    <P>And we have a great old country here if we do not pull it to pieces. We have a wonderful opportunity here if we only use it.  There is no country on the earth to-day that has such an opportunity of dealing justly with these things that are worrying industrial States.  If we put these principles into practice we will have that stability.  I was at the office of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; the other day.  There were a few positions going there.  The people looking for these positions were jealous of each other.  Passions were excited which I hated to see in human beings.  What has reduced people to that state of degradation?  What has reduced them to that state is this: the situation to-day is that the opportunity of earning one's bread has become so precious and is so rare for some, it has become so precious that people are almost ready to kill each other for it.  Is not that a scandalous state of affairs?  I think if we only do these things which ordinary humanity prompts us to do, and do it to our brothers whom you are trying to condemn through your secret Tribunal, if we do it politically and do it to our brothers economically, many of whom are starving, you will have all these things done away with.</P>
    <P>I will not forget the pale faces that pressed the window as I got into my car at the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; the other day, telling me that there was a poor man who was employed there and who was disabled.  The poor disabled man was there, and they were jealous of his having got the position.  That was not because they wanted to deprive him of bread but because they themselves were being deprived of bread. That is what modern economic conditions are reducing human beings to and we sit down here and we talk platitudes.</P>

      <P>Yes, we do talk platitudes about law and order and many things.  They are very important no doubt.  But repeated as they are callously repeated they appear to be never more than stupid and futile.  I do not believe the people of this country are excited about the danger of internal revolution except these gentlemen who want again to prove that they are good at their trade, men who want to prove that they are mighty generals, that they are the men on whom Napoleon's mantle had fallen. Thrown up by revolution, they were going to be dictators, men to go down in history.  That is the thought of some of these gentlemen.  Unless these gentlemen are given their way there will be no revolution here. There is no immediate fear of that. There is no danger of Communism here provided, as I said before, that we do the right thing ourselves and that we go and try to give the people who want bread an opportunity of getting that bread by earning it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally very slow to attempt to misrepresent what Deputy de Valera has said. I know his way of making two speeches in one and challenging anybody who quotes him at any time during the debates that that was not the meaning of the speech but that it had another meaning.  If one of the murderers had been in this House while Deputy de Valera was speaking he would be moved with emotion and sentiment at his own heroism in committing these murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other times when, if somebody had just come into this House, he would have thought that Deputy de Valera was the arch supporter of constitutionalism in this country.  In a speech which I consider one of the most subversive that has ever been made in this Dáil the Deputy attempted in every possible way, to defend the murderers in this country.  The Deputy who made the Billingsgate speech before him talked about morality and indicated and implied that these people are not guilty of sin because they are not aware of it. The members of the organisations that <Col N="309" /> we propose to put down are guilty of a crime against the eternal law.  They know that they have permitted and encouraged their consciences to become at variance with eternal truth.  Deputy de Valera's speech has done all that possibly could be done to encourage, contrary to eternal truth, these men in that course.  What is the hardest thing the Deputy can say about these men? He says that they may be unreasonable from our standards, that they may be dense from our standards and wayward. What is the position in this country?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the whole history of this as Deputy de Valera has done and as he has so carefully misrepresented. He did not, for instance, in the enormous peroration that he made mention that after being twenty months in the United States of America, from April, 1919 to Christmas 1920, he came back after Bloody Sunday and after he had received news from us that Archbishop Clune had come over with offers of negotiations for a truce.  He omitted to mention that.  He suggested that arms were dumped.  Why were they dumped? Because these men hugged in their hearts the hope that the Irish people would come together again, that the British would menace our independence and that then these men in their love for the Irish people would take up these arms in defence of Ireland against England.  A short time ago, in the course of this debate, the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted from a document of April, 1925 of Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass's point of view for the continuance of these dumps was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The continued existence of the Free State Government will depend largely on the ability of the Free State leaders to improve the economic condition of the country and to restore stability and security to its industrial life.  They cannot do this with any degree of success while there remains in the country an armed force not under their control and hostile to their State, implying by its very existence the threat of armed action against them at any favourable moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> It was in order to keep that threat of armed force against this Government and State, in order to keep that condition of instability and insecurity amongst the people, and in order to prevent any economic resurrection of the country that the arms were dumped and kept dumped.  In 1926, under the authority of Deputy Lemass, instructions were sent around to bring in a full note of the arms, to see that there were no spare parts missing, and to see that they were kept in good order.  For what purpose?  To prevent this State functioning properly and to prevent prosperity among the people.  Deputy Lemass now tells us how these men hugged in their hearts the hope that they might be called upon again to defend the liberties of the Irish people against a foreign aggressor. I doubt if such appalling dishonesty and such a subversive doctrine has ever been heard preached in any Assembly in the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the members of the Executive Council, we who have been elected by the people, who have been appointed to our positions by the Dáil and received our authority from God above to govern this country.  We received that authority not from the people but from God.  The Deputy talked about morality and Catholic teaching and all the rest of it.  He ought to know that is Catholic teaching.  He refers to us at a time when there is a vast organisation of men through the country, men whose consciences are completely blinded to moral right and wrong, men who go about and by the most insidious means attempt to bring the consciences of the young men and people of the country into complete opposition to eternal truth and right.  At the very moment when these men are becoming more active every day, when in the various counties they have thousands of men drilling and arms dumped all over the country to overthrow this State and subvert all social order that we know is so necessary for the wellbeing of the people, he refers to us who have our authority from God to maintain social order here as those <Col N="311" /> gentlemen who now assume to themselves the power of life and death. We have the power of life and death because God has given it to us.  He has not given it to the people outside any more than He gave it to Deputy de Valera between 1922 and 1926.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to realise the position this country is in.  Here we are with one organisation after another and with arms coming in constantly.  What is the good in Deputy Davin getting up and asking could I say that 70 men marched with arms into some little place or other in the country on a particular date.  I can tell him very well that there are arms all over the country in dumps.  Many of them were put there by Deputy de Valera and his friends and others have been added since.  That is the position you have of men not only seeking to overthrow the State, to overthrow it by every immoral means imaginable, but even seeking to impose on the people of the country a form of State that the moral conscience of our people revolts against.  At that moment you have the leader of the second biggest Party in this Dáil pandering to the blinded.  I admit that they do not know that they are doing wrong because they have consciously encouraged themselves to get their consciences in opposition to eternal truth.  What is Deputy de Valera doing?  Is he trying to bring the truth home to them when he refers to us as the gentlemen who are assuming to themselves the power of life and death?  The Deputy quoted from documents written by Mr. Blythe many years ago.  Mr. Blythe wrote these at a time when this country was governed by a foreign Government, when the Irish people were completely submerged. If the whole Irish people had decided that they wished a certain thing for their country it meant nothing because we were governed from outside.</P>
    <P>We, in our judgment, possibly may have erred somewhat and if we did we are to blame for it, but let us take the blame for it.  We believed it was part of God's economy that as one of the entities of humanity that historically and racially we were a defined nation, <Col N="312" /> that consequently there was a malformation of that economy which God intended by our being governed from outside&mdash;the Irish people being refused any form of State.  We think that there is now a completely different situation.  Deputy de Valera quotes these articles of Mr. Blythe with the clear intimation that he considers the present situation exactly as it was then.  He considers that if Mr. Blythe was right in saying these things at that time that the other people outside are right in preaching exactly the same doctrine in relation to the Irish State now that Mr. Blythe preached to the Irish people in relation to the British State some seventeen years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera says that at that time it was to a certain extent successful, and that it is the same thought that was in the mind of Mr. Blythe when he wrote these articles as is at the back of the minds of the young men now, the young men who go round the country telling the people that they have the right to commit murder, and of the gentleman who pointed out of a window in Suffolk Street at members of the C.I.D., and said: &ldquo;I have only to give the word and these men will be wiped off the streets of Dublin to-night,&rdquo; the man who explained the reasons that caused him and his friends to decide the murder of Ryan, the murder of Curtin, and the murder of Carroll.</P>
    <P>For Deputy de Valera there is no difference whatever between that man in 1931 and Mr. Blythe in 1913. If Deputy de Valera is right, Mr. Blythe and the rest of us must admit that we were completely perverted at that time.  Are we, with the authority, responsibility and duty that we now have, to cover up our faults at that time as Deputy de Valera would like to do?  Are we to go around and say to young men that murder is one of the first doctrines of the Catholic Church, are we to go around and assure them that nobody has the right to obey authority and that authority has not the right to exist?  Are we to go around and assure the man who looks with jealous eyes on his neighbour's <Col N="313" /> property that he has the right to take that property?  Is that the doctrine that Deputy de Valera is preaching?</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy admit that we have all the authority that is innate in the very nature of every Government, that authority over life and death, that authority to maintain social order and that authority to put down all opposition to the State?  Does he or does he not admit that?  He talks about our being endowed with whatever authority can be given by the votes of the majority of the people.  Have we, or have we not, authority?  Will the Deputy make up his mind upon that point instead of pandering to the murderers and the blackguards who are all around the country at this moment, who are not satisfied and who are doing their best, working night and day, to impose their doctrines on the simple-minded youth of Ireland?</P>
      <P>All Deputy de Valera may say is that these young fellows may be a bit wayward, may seem a bit unreasonable and a bit dense, according to our standards; but they are hugging in their hearts the hope that they may be able to serve the Irish people.  They are inspired, he says, with the same motives as inspired us in those days; they are the custodians of militant Irish nationalism.  Are not these men the greatest enemies that Irish nationalism ever had?  Would it not be better for us to be under England, to remain under England, rather than that these men and their doctrines should hold sway in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that the man who wanted to stay under England was a better nationalist at that time than the heroes over whom Deputy de Valera is weeping to-day.  He, in order to encourage these men, has constantly asserted that we usurped power in 1922.  We were elected by the Government in 1922, receiving not merely power and authority, but also having imposed upon us the duty to put down crime. I admit we delayed in doing so.  We shirked our duty, I quite agree, but <Col N="314" /> ultimately we did act against men who were committing murder, men who were robbing the people and making social order impossible in this country. After a long delay we did act.  We were the Government and if we were not, who were?  Because we acted against men guilty of murder, against men who made it impossible for the people to sleep in their beds and lead the lives God intended them to lead, Deputy de Valera describes us as usurpers.  He tells us that at that time he felt it in his bones that he had to take up arms.  When murderers and blackguards were making the names of Irishmen stink in the nostrils of people the world over, when they were making every decent Irishman wish, and sincerely and rightly wish, that the British were back, and when we got after the murderers and thieves, Deputy de Valera felt it in his bones that he had to take up arms in support and in defence of the murderers and the blackguards whom we were putting down.</P>
    <P>He cannot do the same thing to-night. He gets up here and makes one or two nice phrases.  He tells us that if he could have his way all the arms would be given up; if he could only be heard by these men he would urge upon them the foolishness of their ways; but he makes it perfectly clear that we are usurpers.  The Deputy's speech was the most blackguardly, dishonest and subversive speech I have ever heard.  He was playing up to the murderers and Communists and at the same time he was shoving in little phrases that will be quoted in his paper to-morrow to the effect that he has always stood for Catholic doctrines, that he is governed by the noblest and highest motives when he wages war on the Irish people, that he always tried to get these young men to see things reasonably when he was inciting them to murder, as he has done here to-night.</P>
    <P>The I.R.A. is not a secret organisation, said he, putting the little gloss over it.  The young men of the country are inveigled and forced into it and when they do their duty as ordinary people, subject to the moral law, and are called on by the police <Col N="315" /> to give information, they are murdered.  It is not a secret organisation, but if you belong to it and if you do not keep your mouth shut, according to the orders of the Ryans and the rest of them, you are murdered.  But there is nothing secret; you can tell anything you like provided you are prepared to be shot in the middle of the night by the gun bully.  Deputy de Valera kept us a long time and I really want to point to the dishonesty of his speech.  He says that the interview in the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; was probably a most imperfect representation of what took place. Possibly he will also say that the mangled body of Ryan in Tipperary was a most imperfect representation of what took place.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera could find out exactly what took place because one of the men who were there that day took responsibility for the murder, took responsibility for trying to inculcate into the whole youth of Ireland damnably immoral doctrines. One of these men a week or two afterwards had to leave the office because Deputy de Valera had offered him a better job.  The Deputy so much admired his principles and the power of the man who could stand in a room and tell you how he arranged murders and who could say, pointing to a man outside, &ldquo;I have only to give the word and all these C.I.D. men will be murdered to-night,&rdquo; that he gave him a better job.  Deputy de Valera shows his disapproval and at the same time an example of his great human and Christian charity and understanding of these things by giving that man a job immediately afterwards. I hope his words will be understood by the people of the country and I hope it will make them realise that we who are in authority have not only to face these organisations outside, but that we also have to face men who dishonestly get themselves elected, made themselves the second greatest Party in the country, and are now prepared to use their privileged position to shelter murderers and to leave the people at the murderers' mercy.</P>
