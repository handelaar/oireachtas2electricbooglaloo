    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Micheál O Cléirigh Micheál O Cléirigh">

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of hawkers' licences issued since the imposition of the £10 tax on travelling shops, and if the imposition of this tax has effected a reduction in the number of hawkers carrying on business in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of hawkers' licences issued between the 1st of August, 1930, and the 31st of January last at the respective rates of duty was as follows:&mdash; 468 at the £10 rate; 217 at the £2 rate. Total, 685.</P>
      <P>The number of licences issued for the current financial year is greater than the total for any of the three previous financial years, due to the fact that a large number of persons who did not formerly pay any duty were caught by the provisions of Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1930.</P>
      <P>These persons mainly consist of (a) hawkers using motor vehicles who now pay £10 duty and who paid nothing prior to the 1st August, 1930, and (b) hawkers who travel from their usual place of residence to another place and there sell from a booth, stall, etc., on fair and market days. It is thought that the imposition of the £10 duty has probably resulted in reducing the total number of hawkers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>When this tax was being imposed the general impression was created that it was being imposed in order to reduce effectively the number of travelling shops throughout the country.  It seems to be evident from information at my disposal anyhow that it has had the very opposite effect <Col N="822" />&mdash;that the number of travelling shops has increased considerably during the past year.  It is quite evident therefore that this tax has been more or less an indirect charge on the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the reason for the delay in repayment of Dáil Loan, 1919-1920, to subscribers in Donoughmore district, County Cork, and when he will be able to repay these subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No particulars of the great majority of the subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-1920, in Donoughmore District, Co. Cork, were furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance during the period in which the Loan was raised and, in consequence, the names of the subscribers concerned were not entered in the Primary Register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lists of subscribers from the Strike Chapel portion of this area have been received in my Department from two different sources.  The lists are not in agreement with one another and, in addition, there are discrepancies between the particulars contained in the lists and those in individual applications <Col N="823" /> for repayment which have been received from this district.</P>
    <P>My Department is pursuing investigations with a view to clearing up the discrepancies referred to, and until these have been explained in a satisfactory manner it will not be possible to take steps with a view to authorising repayment to the subscribers concerned.</P>
    <P>I may add that a considerable number of subscribers in the Firmount portion of the Donoughmore district whose names were recently added to the Register of Subscribers have been repaid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state what steps his Department has taken to get this matter cleared up?  It is over eighteen months since the original notebook containing the list was handed in to his Department.  Surely there has been sufficient time to have the matter cleared up since?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be in order to ask Deputy Corry a question. There was a book which contained some particulars which I believe Deputy Corry got charge of.  I do not know whether he lost it, or whether he is simply refraining from handing it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

As the Minister has managed to give £400,000 to the Unionists within six months, surely he should be able to pay back these unfortunate people after eleven years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that under existing conditions parcels for Tralee and County Kerry, posted in England and Northern Ireland, are sent to Limerick for Customs examination, and held there for two days, creating a situation that a parcel takes a week in transit from a manufacturing town in England to Kerry; and if steps will be taken to remove this handicap on Kerry traders, and thus give to Kerry people the same facilities enjoyed by Limerick and Cork.</P>

      <P>Parcels for Co. Kerry originating in Great Britain circulate on Limerick for Customs examination, and those originating in Northern Ireland on Dublin.  So far as the Post Office is concerned no delay in transmission occurs.  I am communicating with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to seeing whether it is possible to expedite treatment so far as Customs examination is concerned, although I understand that already the great bulk of the parcels are despatched to destination on the afternoon or evening of receipt at the centres and secure delivery next day. I will write to the Deputy on the matter in due course.</P>

      <P>Information of this kind is not within my knowledge and in the usual course should be sought directly from the Electricity Supply Board.  Having regard, however, to the suggestion of unwarranted delay I have had inquiry made into the position and am informed that after the Greystones undertaking had been acquired by the Board it was found necessary to provide a special 38Kv Transformer Station in order to link up the undertaking with the Shannon Supply.  Technical difficulties arose in respect of the site and type of this station of which a solution has now been found.  The reconstruction of the network has been completed and the erection of the Transformer Station is in hand.  It is anticipated that a supply of Shannon power can be made available in or about July next.  I understand that the Board is about to publish a revision of the former charges.</P>

The general destruction of ivy on the scale suggested would be a matter of considerable difficulty, involving a great deal of work from which little or no return could be expected.  It is to be presumed that owners of plantations realise that ivy, although not a particularly serious cause of injury to trees, may, under certain conditions, be injurious, and that they will take any steps considered necessary for its destruction without State intervention.</P>

      <P>The amount spent since 1st October last has been £360.  The works are part of the general measures for the increase and improvement of the kelp produced under the scheme of collective marketing, and consisted of the erection of enclosures on the Breton model for the stacking of winter weed, the provision of drying sheds, and the making of accommodation tracks on and from the foreshore. The works were confined to kelp-makers being members of or applying to enter the scheme of collective marketing.

After the great hurry with which this Vote was presented to us here in the House last December, when we were asked to pass this grant, we find that there has been scarcely anything done. When this grant was asked for, some Deputies here went so far as to suggest that we were trying to hold it up. That was not so.  Now, after it has been passed four or five months, there has not been any work carried out in our county.  We are not satisfied with what has been done, and we are anxious to know what is holding up the business.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) That sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Finance (Customs and Stamps Duties) Act, 1929 (No. 5 of 1929), shall, in respect of woven tissues imported into Saorstát Eireann on or within three years after the 5th day of March, 1931, be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;two shillings&rdquo; were inserted therein in lieu of the words &ldquo;two shillings and six pence&rdquo; now, by virtue of sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1929 (No 32 of 1929), contained therein.</P>
      <P>(2) That sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1929, shall not apply to any woven tissues to which the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution applies.</P>
      <P>(3) That it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>An application was made last year by the Irish Woollen and Worsted Manufacturers' Association to have the customs duty on woollens and worsted tissues modified by limiting to tissues of a value not exceeding 1s. 6d. per square yard the exemption which now applies to tissues of a value not exceeding 2s. 6d. per square yard.</P>
      <P>The application was referred to the Tariff Commission on the 16th April, 1930, and notices were published in the daily papers on the 19th April. Notices of opposition were lodged by the Irish Free State Wholesale Clothiers' Association, the Merchant Drapers' Association, and by one Dublin firm.  The Commission has since been engaged in considering this application.  It has held fifteen sittings and of these six were open to the public and a large number of witnesses have given evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight or nine witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the Woollen Manufacturers' Association, four on behalf <Col N="846" /> of the Irish Free State Wholesale Clothiers' Association, and three on behalf of the Merchant Drapers' Association of Dublin.  The Tariff Commission, after considering the evidence submitted on both sides and all other material available to them, have made their recommendations.  This Report will be available for Deputies tomorrow or next day, so I will quote only a little out of it now.  The Commission find that while the Irish woollen mills might provide the quantity of cloth required for the clothing manufacturers they could not supply the cloth required in the number of varieties, both as regards type of cloth and pattern, which would be necessary, and they come to the conclusion that if the application were granted the wholesale clothiers, in order to meet the demands of their customers in style and finish of the cloths, would have no option but to continue to import the greater quantity of the cloths they would use, and the addition to their working costs represented by the duty which they would have to pay would seriously impair their ability to compete with imported made-up garments.  It is further stated in the Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Saorstát cap manufacturers would be similarly situated because the applicants did not exhibit any sample of cloth which would be suitable for general use in the capmaking industry.  Indeed, one of the applicant witnesses stated that it was questionable if the orders which would be given in this country for cap cloths would justify the expenditure by any of the woollen mills of the capital required for the installation of plant for the manufacture of such cloths.</P>
    <P>In our opinion, therefore, the case for a modification of the tariff fails in so far as it is based on the claim of the applicants to be able to meet the reasonable requirements of the readymade clothing and cap manufacturers for cloths which they can profitably make up into garments and caps for general wear.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the situation as affecting the merchant drapers the <Col N="847" /> Commission proceed to consider the question of price and they state:</P>
    <P>Since we reported on the original application of the Woollen and Worsted Manufacturers' Association for a tariff on woollen and worsted tissues, there has been a very considerable fall in the price of virgin and reclaimed wool.  This fall has been reflected in the prices of finished piece goods, with the result that some cloths are now being imported duty free which are of such type and quality that they would have been so priced as to bring them within the scope of the duty at the time when the exemption limit of two shillings and sixpence per square yard was adopted.  During the hearing of the present application the applicant association did not advance the lower price of wool, and consequent reduction in the prices of cloths, as an argument in favour of a modification in the exemption limit. In a letter which they addressed to us in September, 1930, they adduced this factor, among others, as an argument for the abolition of an exemption limit based on prices.  Such a modification of the tariff is, however, outside the scope of the present application.</P>
    <P>We have considered the possibility of relating a price exemption limit for cloths to the prices quoted from time to time for wool.  In the manufacture of cloths to meet the Saorstát's requirements, there are used very many classes and grades of virgin and of reclaimed wool, the prices of which do not fluctuate uniformly as between the different classes and grades.  It would, therefore, be necessary to determine what particular classes and grades should be selected to form the basis of an index as to prices.  Further, buyers of cloth would be in a position to defer placing orders when a raising of the exemption limit was to be anticipated because of a rise in the price of wool, and to place orders and take delivery in advance of the usual time when the lowering of the limit, consequent upon a decline in wool prices, was to be expected.  Such <Col N="848" /> practices would seriously detract from any advantages of relating the exemption limit to wool prices.  It must also be borne in mind that wool prices represent but one of the many factors which enter into the costs of production of woollen fabrics.  These are the most important of the numerous considerations involved in the application of a sliding scale to a price exemption limit for cloths, and we are satisfied that the adoption of such a course would be impracticable because of the administrative and other difficulties to which we have referred.</P>
    <P>There is, however, no doubt that, because of the very marked and continuous decline in the price of most wool which has occurred from the time of the imposition of the present exemption limit of 2/6 per square yard, cloths of a quality which we thought, when presenting our Report No. 4 (Supplementary), might reasonably be subject to duty, are now imported duty free because their value has fallen below 2/6 per square yard, and that, therefore, the Saorstát woollen manufacturers are not protected to the extent which we considered desirable.  It seems to us that, in the circumstances, it would be fair and equitable to adopt a lower exemption limit and, accordingly, we have to consider what value would be fair to the woollen manufacturers without imposing hardship on the users of low grade cloths, namely, the wholesale clothiers, cap makers and merchant drapers.</P>
    <P>There is no reliable guide as to the actual effect which the fall in wool values has had on the prices of piece goods.  From such information as we have been able to obtain during the course of our present inquiry, it would appear to us that cloths which cost about 4/- net per square yard in May, 1929, are now being sold at approximately 3/3 net per yard, and that, accordingly, the wholesale clothiers and cap makers have recently been able to purchase the bulk of their cloths at prices not exceeding 3/3 net per trade yard, or, say, <Col N="849" /> 2/- per square yard.  We think, therefore, that the lowering of the exemption limit to 2/- per square yard, which we now recommend, would place the Saorstát woollen manufacturers as well as the wholesale clothiers, cap makers and merchant drapers in the same position as regards the tariff on woollen and worsted piece goods as they were in when the tariff, in its present form, was imposed in May, 1929.  We are unable to make any reliable forecast as to the course which the prices of wool and cloths will take in the future and consequently we must base on general considerations our conclusion as to the duration of the new exemption limit which we have recommended.  In view of the evidence submitted to us with regard to the circumstances in the industries and trades concerned in the present application we feel it is unlikely that conditions will alter to such an extent within the next few years as to render necessary a further revision in the tariff at an early date.  Accordingly, we take the view that the exemption limit of 2/- per square yard should be applied immediately and should continue in operation for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the entire report will be in the hands of Deputies in a day or two.  Having read the pertinent paragraphs from it, I formally move the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, we will have another opportunity of considering the resolution when it comes up on Report by which time we will have received the report of the Tariff Commission upon this application. At the same time, I do not think that it would be right for us to let the motion go through at this stage without drawing attention to some important facts relating to it.  The Minister has informed us that the Tariff Commission decided that the application of the woollen millers should be rejected on the grounds on which they made it, namely, that there should be an inducement to the ready-made clothing manufacturers to <Col N="850" /> buy the products of Irish mills rather than to use imported materials.  The Tariff Commission have, apparently, decided now that although the woollen millers here are in a position to supply the cloth required by the clothing manufacturers in the quantities that they need they are not able to supply all the variety of patterns which the clothing manufacturers regard as necessary in their business.</P>
      <P>Apparently the Tariff Commission have come to the conclusion that because the woollen manufacturers cannot supply that variety of pattern they should not be engaged in the business of producing cloth of this kind at all.  Deputies will remember that the Tariff Commission sat for three years considering the original application of the woollen manufacturers and, as a result of three years' deliberation, they produced a report which recommended that the exemption limit should be not 2s. or 2s. 6d., but 1s. 6d. per square yard, a figure to which the woollen millers now want it restored.  In order to off-set any disadvantage which that tariff might have placed on the clothing manufacturers they recommended an increase in the tariff on ready-made clothing from 15 to 20 per cent.  In making that recommendation they said that they hoped that the manufacturers of ready-made clothing would not be adversely affected, that the manufacture of cloth from reclaimed wool would be encouraged, and that the poorer class of consumers would not have to pay higher prices for their clothes.  They did not realise any of their hopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within a very short time after the Dáil had implemented its first recommendation the Tariff Commission was hastily summoned together again to reconsider it, and as a result of that reconsideration it decided to amend its original recommendation in three particulars, one particular being this matter of exemption limit, which the Commission suggested should be raised from 1/6 to 2/6.  Meantime some of the Irish woollen millers had installed machinery for the manufacture of the cheaper grade cloths required for the ready-made trade.  When they had the <Col N="851" /> machinery installed they were deprived of the advantage of the original tariff, and found that the increase in the exemption limit meant that they were as open as before to competition from England.  In that situation the woollen millers again went to the Tariff Commission with this application, that the exemption limit should be reduced to the figure at which the Tariff Commission itself originally placed it.</P>
    <P>Now, the Commission decided that that cannot be done, not because they do not think that the woollen millers cannot supply our requirements in such cloths, but because they are not, they tell us, in a position to supply us with fancy patterns which some people need.  After three years' consideration, in 1928 they were quite satisfied that the mills would be able to deal with that situation.  What has induced them to change their minds since?  In any case, it should obviously be the duty of the Government to give the woollen manufacturers the necessary encouragement, the necessary grip upon the market, to enable them to improve the quality of their products and to increase the number of varieties that they can produce.  It is not going to remedy the situation to allow foreign cloths to come in untariffed.  If the difficulty which the Government are anxious to get over is that of the ready-made clothing manufacturers, then that difficulty could be overcome in the way suggested by the manufacturers and in the way agreed to by the woollen millers&mdash;by increasing the duty on ready-made clothing to 30 per cent., as the ready-made clothing manufacturers asked.</P>
    <P>The Tariff Commission seem to consider themselves in duty bound never to recommend the granting of any application that comes before them. When the first report was published the ready-made clothing manufacturers asked an increase of duty on ready-made clothing.  The woollen millers were agreeable to the granting of that application.  The Tariff Commission, instead of granting that application, gave what nobody asked for, an increase in the exemption limit.  Now <Col N="852" /> when that mistake of the Tariff Commission is sought to be remedied they have refused to remedy it.  It is true that they are reducing the exemption limits, but they are not altering the measure of protection afforded to woollen millers.  The reduction in the exemption limit effected by this recommendation is merely a consequence of the fall in prices in the last twelve months, but really the degree of protection is unchanged.  We think that the Tariff Commission made the first mistake in their original report when they recommended a mere five per cent. increase in the duty on ready-made clothing. They made a second mistake in May, 1929, when they recommended an increase in the exemption limit.  They are making a third mistake here now in not granting the application of the woollen millers that the exemption limit should be reduced to 1/6.</P>
    <P>This arrangement is going to please nobody or to benefit nobody.  It is a mere attempt on the part of the Government to pretend to be doing something when, in fact, they are doing nothing.  I think, in fact, the Government might have considered the objections to this method of granting exemptions.  We do not know whether prices are going to fall or to rise, and it may be necessary for the Tariff Commission to come together again in six months or nine months' time in order to vary the exemption limit in consequence of a rise or fall in prices.  All these reports from the Tariff Commission, and all the various resolutions that have been brought in here by the Government in relation to the woollen duty are mere attempts to evade doing the obvious thing, increasing the protection of the ready-made clothing manufacturers.  Because this is a step in the right direction we will support it, but we would like to make it clear that we are doing so without any enthusiasm whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I am glad that a further opportunity will be available to discuss this revision of the tariff on woollens.  I am sorry to have to croak but if I were to say that I were satisfied with this revision that is now about to take place, I would not be <Col N="853" /> voicing the feelings of a very large number of workers in the town of Athlone.  It is the nearest approach to a large industrial town in my constituency. In it there are many men out of employment.  There are many others who are likely to be thrown out of employment by reason of this disappointing report.  It will be to them a bitter blow.  They were optimistic enough to think that a coercive case had been made for reducing the limit of exemption to eighteen pence.  I think the Minister stated that this argument about the fall in the price of virgin wool and reclaimed wool and the consequent fall in the price of British cloths, was not advanced in the original application.  That, I am sure, is so, but whenever it was advanced it was very important, and was thought by the workers to be a very weighty argument.  If in February, 1929, 1/6 per square yard was thought to be the highest limit of exemption that the woollen industry would bear, the trend of prices of cloths, consequent on the fall in the price of wool would certainly indicate that 1/6 ought not to be exceeded in 1931.  I feel that if the Minister has power to refer this matter back to the Commission he ought to avail of that power.  If the Minister makes a representation to the Commission, I would suggest that a reasonable matter for their reconsideration would be the &ldquo;stress&rdquo; which they have given to the question of variety of cloths and patterns; on reconsideration they may feel that perhaps they have over-emphasised that objection and under-estimated the force of the argument based on the fall in the price of cloths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking, of course, more or less out of a brief.  I have no personal knowledge of the woollen trade but, so far as I can understand this industry, it is unlikely that within any reasonable limit of time our Irish woollen manufacturers can possibly compete with large British manufacturers as regards number of varieties and choice of patterns.  It is quite a different matter when the Commission was convinced, as I think they were convinced at one time, that Irish mills could not <Col N="854" /> provide the quantity necessary for the clothing manufacturers' needs.  I think if Irish mills can provide the quantity of cloth at reasonable prices that really in the present state of unemployment, and in the present financial condition of this country, far too much force has been given to this lack of varieties and patterns.</P>
    <P>As I understand the statement of the Minister it is not suggested that Irish manufacturers do not provide quite a large number of varieties and patterns, it is merely that in an appeal to mere ideas of fashion they cannot compete with British manufacturers. I hope, either as a result of further discussion of this matter or perhaps before the further discussion takes place, something will be done by the Government to induce the Commission to reconsider the whole matter, and to accede to the very reasonable request made by the woollen manufacturers.  I say that in the interests of the manufacturers, but I say it even more emphatically in the interests of the ordinary workers and operatives in these mills and in the interest of the country generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to enter on this matter at any length at this stage.  We will be better able to discuss it when the report is in the hands of Deputies.  I think when Deputies see the report they will recognise that, as the facts are, it would be difficult if not impossible for the Commission to have gone further than they did go.  This will give protection for very nearly all the cloths that any of the manufacturers would be willing to make.  When I am talking about the kinds of cloth I am referring really to the price.  Deputy Lemass stated more than once that the clothiers had suggested an increase in the tariff on ready-made clothing, and that the woollen manufacturers had agreed to that.  Naturally the woollen manufacturers would agree to it, if it would help them.  But the woollen manufacturers and the clothiers are not the only people concerned.  The ordinary members of the community have to be considered just a little. There is, no doubt, that if the tariff <Col N="855" /> on ready-made clothing were made high enough we could tariff all woollen goods without injuring in any way the clothing industry.  But if there was a substantial increase in the tariff on ready-made clothes there is no doubt that portion, and, perhaps, ultimately all, of that tariff would fall as a burden on a class of people in the community that is not the richest class, which has to wear ready-made clothes.  Generally the fact that the clothiers and the woollen manufacturers are agreed is no argument at all for proceeding with the tariff. On the other hand, it is not possible to put up the woollen tariff regardless of the interests of the clothiers, because as Deputies know, from the point of view of employment the clothiers have the more important industry of the two, and if we had a substantial increase of employment in the weaving industry, and were to lose more employment in the clothing industry, it would be of no advantage to the community.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Good I move: &ldquo;In line 20, to delete the figures 1936 and substitute the figures 1933.&rdquo;  On the Second Reading debate it was urged from a good many quarters that the temporary character of this Bill should be maintained.  It was introduced admittedly as a temporary measure.  The original draft suggests that this Bill should last for a period of five years.  The effect of <Col N="856" /> this amendment is to reduce the period to two years.  I am strongly of opinion that the Dáil should not lose the opportunity of reconsidering the whole question of relief within a period of two years.  There is a difference of opinion and considerable doubt, at any rate, as to whether the incidence of the cost of administering this Relief Bill fairly falls on the city.  I would strongly urge the Minister to agree to take the Bill for two years, and to give the Dáil an opportunity after that period to go into the whole matter.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the amendment before the House.  I agree with Deputy Thrift that when this Bill was introduced originally we were told it was going to be of a temporary character. This Bill proposes to extend the original measure for another five years.  In my opinion, if that is agreed to, the consideration of the main problem that is behind this Bill is going to be shelved.  Nothing will be done. If money is to be voted for the relief of the poor of the city, I think there ought to be an investigation as to how it can be spent more profitably than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good, on the Second Reading of the Bill, referred to the incidence of cost, and expressed the opinion that it does not fall fairly on the Dublin ratepayers.  Speaking from experience, I can say that the cost of this Bill does not fall fairly.  Take the case of a professional man living in a private residence, with a rateable valuation of £20 or £25, and a business man with an establishment in Talbot Street, Henry Street, or Grafton Street.  The latter will have to pay four times as much as the professional man as regards the charges under this Bill.  It is well known that the trade and commerce of this city is passing through a difficult time.  Therefore, it would be most unwise to place a Bill of this character on the Statute Book for five years without giving the question involved in it further consideration. The demand of the North Dublin Union on the area now comprising the city amounts to £307,306 for the coming year.  That means that, without any <Col N="857" /> further examination of the question, this dead weight of expenditure is to be placed mainly on the trading and industrial community of this city for the next five years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the amount of the demand from the North Dublin Union for the coming year.  I have not segregated the different items which make up that demand.  The Minister must know that, taking the minimum figure, this Bill will place a dead weight of at least £125,000 a year on the ratepayers of Dublin during the period of its operation.  That is a charge that they can ill-afford to bear at the moment.  I feel the Minister cannot take up the position that the Government have no other duty than to pass a Bill of this kind and leave the matter there.  I think some share of the burden should, in equity, be borne by the State.  That is my opinion.  It may not meet with agreement in all parts of the House. Speaking on behalf of the city, I feel bound to say that in my opinion the city of Dublin is being treated inequitably in this matter.  If the attitude of the Government be that the passage of this Bill will relieve them of all further responsibility and duty in this matter, then I say speaking from the Government Benches, that I could not possibly agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People must face up to the fact that there is an abnormal situation to be dealt with in Dublin, which is the storm-centre of the unemployment problem in this country.  In view of that, and realising all that has been done by the Governments of other countries to lighten the burden on trade and industry during abnormal periods, I think it is incumbent on our Government to face up to this problem as other countries have done.  I think that something more is required from the Government than merely to pass this Bill and then, Pontius Pilate-like, wipe their hands and leave the thing there. <Col N="858" /> A large party in this House claim that it is the duty of the State to find work for every one of its citizens.  I do not accept that proposition, but I do think that some liability rests on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to deal with a subject that has such wide ramifications without making a passing reference to certain claims that have been put forward from time to time, but I do suggest that the State had a bigger liability in this matter than merely to pass a Bill.  One of the objects of the Shannon Scheme was to relieve unemployment. If the citizens of Dublin are to be asked to bear the whole of the burden that is caused by unemployment, then I say they are not able to bear it.  It is all very well to haggle about the amount, but the total demand on the citizens of Dublin for the coming year in respect of the North Dublin Union is £307,000 odd.  That represents an increase, as compared with the previous year, of nearly £125,000.  If the Government could provide relief schemes on which that sum of money could be employed in a reproductive manner, thereby giving relief to the citizens to that extent, I would be whole-heartedly behind them. Speaking from these benches, I ask the Minister, before this Bill is passed for a period of five years, to have a closer examination than has yet been made of this whole question.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes that this Bill which applies to Dublin should only remain in operation for two years.  Other local authorities have to bear these charges without any limit of time.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument has already been effectively answered by the figures given by the Minister.  I have always held the contrary view to that expressed by Deputy Byrne.  The figures given by the Minister do not bear out the Deputy's statement. There may be a case for an examination into the whole incidence of the burden, whether it should be borne by the ratepayers entirely or partly from the rates and partly from State sources.  But that does not apply any more to Dublin than it does to Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Mayo or any other county.  I do not think anything would be gained by passing the amendment and having this discussion all ever again, with special reference to Dublin only.  If we are going to have a discussion on this particular problem, then let it concern itself with the country as a whole.  I have heard no argument, so far, as to why this should be a temporary measure, or as to why Dublin should be specially treated as against the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>It may be quite true that the consideration of the question, so far as it affects the city, would involve the consideration of this question generally.  My point in moving the amendment was that its acceptance provided a lever for bringing up this whole question again in two years, whereas if the Bill is passed for five years the House loses that lever.  It was urged, when this measure was introduced, that it was only brought in in a temporary way, until such time as the whole question would be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now asked to put that off for five years.  I contend that the question does require examination: whether this is a cost which should be borne by the State or treated in some other manner, whether, in fact, as Deputy Byrne said, the money could not be more <Col N="860" /> profitably expended.  I sincerely hope the House will see the wisdom of not postponing for a longer period than two years the time when that whole question will be considered.</P>

I was listening carefully and wondering whether any sound argument could be put forward for shortening the period.  I have heard none.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell.  I think that no case whatever has been made for the amendment.  The provision in the Bill is putting Dublin in exactly the same position as the rest of the country, and whatever considerations may impel us to seek to have this whole question brought up will apply to the rest of the country as well as to Dublin.  There is no doubt whatever that we will have an opportunity of raising the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of acceptance or otherwise of this amendment, Deputies will remember that I more or less undertook to Deputy Good to consider this question of shortening the period to 1933. I entirely agree with Deputy O'Connell that no good purpose is served by arranging for annual discussions on this matter here when further discussion can be of no practical use.  When this matter was discussed here in 1929, considerable fear was expressed and we made this a Bill simply extending to the 31st March of this particular year.  I do not think it really would be necessary for the House to divide on this amendment.  I suggest that we take the amendment that is down. If necessary, the Bill can be included <Col N="861" /> in an Expiring Laws Bill of the particular year that is involved, if we have not got rid of such a thing as an Expiring Laws Bill by that time.</P>
      <P>On the question of this being a temporary Bill, I think we must get out of our heads that there is anything in this Bill bringing Dublin to the same position as the rest of the country in the matter of outdoor relief to the able-bodied that is in any way temporary. The Bill has brought Dublin definitely into the same position as the rest of the country in that particular matter and it was temporary only because we had hoped that inside the city and county of Dublin the local bodies concerned would agree to a joint scheme and because it related to a temporary Act originally&mdash;the Act of 1923.  The amendment, from my point of view, does bring us over to a new Parliament and that new Parliament can deal with the matter any way it wishes.  I cannot see the slightest use to Dublin or anywhere else in having a discussion on this particular point in this assembly.</P>
      <P>The question is raised as to whether the incidence of this type of relief falls fairly on Dublin.  The people who are dealing with the administration of this particular type of relief in Dublin are the persons best fitted and best positioned to examine it and we cannot examine the question here without examining at the same time whether the incidence of this particular class of relief falls fairly on Cork, Limerick, Kildare, Galway, or any other place, so that as far as the unfairness of the incidence is concerned the Executive Council are certainly not going to initiate any inquiry into that any more than they are going to initiate an inquiry as to whether there is a vast influx into the City of Dublin of people who ought not to go into it.  Reference to table 10 of the census returns will show that there are more non-county Dublin born persons in Dublin and more non-county Wicklow persons in Wicklow and more non-county Meath persons in Meath than there are non-City of Dublin born persons in the City of Dublin.</P>

I think the Minister should oppose the shortening of the period. I think five years means nothing and two years means nothing.  We will have the whole thing over again.  What I was hoping was that, even if we had this Bill on the stocks, the time might come when there would not be such extreme poverty as we have at the present moment.  It is all very well for Deputy Byrne to talk of people from outside Dublin coming here to get relief.

      <P>As I indicated already, we came here with open minds on this point and we were prepared to listen to any arguments that could be put forward for shortening the period. We have heard none whatever.  It seems to me that what is involved here is the question whether Dublin should or should not be treated differently in respect to this particular matter from the rest of the country.  Our view is <Col N="864" /> that Dublin ought not to be treated differently.  The only matter I feel doubtful about is whether or not we should have 1936 or any period mentioned. The excuse that has been put forward for shortening the period to 1933 is that we will have an opportunity of bringing the question forward. The Minister's giving way to what he thinks are fears on this question seems to be ridiculous.  I have seen the Minister stand by the position he took up on a Bill where there was far less excuse for his doing so than there is at present.  I, for one, until a case has been made for the change&mdash;and no case has been made&mdash;will not agree to the amendment.  We shall have to vote against it.  We see no excuse whatever for it.  The Bill simply puts Dublin in the same position as the rest of the country.  My view is that that ought to be done permanently.  If there is any question of undue pressure or of unfair incidence of the rate, let there be a general examination.

      <P>I must press my opposition to this amendment.  As Deputy de Valera has pointed out. there has been no argument in favour of it.  The Minister has stated quite definitely that he is carrying the matter over to another Parliament, but he has admitted that another Parliament can do nothing else but pass this measure.  I do not see why we should put another Parliament&mdash;on whatever side of the House members may then be sitting&mdash;to the trouble of raising this matter if the position will be that they can do nothing except what is <Col N="865" /> being done here.  The Minister referred to the anxiety of some people but I suggest that his action in accepting this amendment will only increase their anxiety because it will lend colour to the view, present to the minds of people like Deputy Byrne and others, that Dublin is in a different position from the rest of the country. That view we cannot agree with.  If the Minister accepts that view, it will only increase anxiety in the minds of the people.  I am in agreement with Deputy de Valera when he says that there should be no limit in the Bill&mdash; 1936 or any other time.  The acceptance of the amendment will not improve matters and I will oppose it.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the reception of this amendment. From all sides of the House, I thought that the idea of this amendment rather got support.  I cannot understand why Deputies who desire that a particular thing should happen will not take every conceivable step to ensure that it will happen.  In my argument in support of the amendment, I did not say a single word&mdash;I was quite careful about it&mdash; about Dublin.  I want this whole question to be considered.  I think that Deputies on other sides of the House desire that the whole question should be considered.  I cannot convince myself that the present system of administering poor law relief, either in town or country, is a rational one or the best that can be found.  Personally, I think that it is an extremely bad one. By making this measure last for two years, we would ensure that the question would be considered in its entirety and dealt with and the new Parliament could not have a better subject to start its labours on.  I appeal to Deputies to accept this amendment.  It will do no harm to limit the period to two years and they can take every measure that can be devised meanwhile to get the big problem attended to.  I think this is one of the most urgent things we have to deal with.  I think we have got a very bad system, generally, of poor law relief.  I do not refer particularly to Dublin.  I refer to the system throughout the country and I ask Deputies to agree to that short period, comparatively speaking, and <Col N="866" /> not to assist in having the matter shelved, more or less.  Deputies know how things can be shelved when the opportunity offers.  If this five-year limit remains, they know that the result will be that the matter will be put off and not dealt with in five years.</P>

      <P>I must certainly say that I cannot accept this amendment on the grounds on which Deputy Thrift now puts it forward.  He is quite wrong in urging that this Parliament, with a small period of life before it, should push itself into the position of having to review the entire relief system of the country or that it should leave such a state of affairs as would compel the new Parliament, immediately on its taking office, to consider this whole matter.  From his last statement, I think that Deputy Thrift's outlook is quite wrong.</P>

I have been listening to this rather interesting debate from its inception and I should like to appeal to Deputy Thrift to withdraw the amendment that he moved.  If he does not withdraw his <Col N="867" /> amendment, it looks as if the amendment will be put to a division and, if it is put to a division, it looks as if the Minister will have to vote for it.  The House will, I think, agree with me that nothing the Minister has said has been in favour of the amendment.

      <P>This section is to put officers of the Department who have been paid out of special funds in exactly the same position as if they were paid out of funds voted by Parliament&mdash;in other words, in exactly the same position as the rest of the Departmental officers.  The special funds referred to were funds such as the Endowment fund.  That fund was to some extent administered by the Board of Agriculture.  There was another fund called The Cattle Pleuro Pneumonia Fund, which was established for dealing with pleuropneumonia, and certain veterinary surgeons were employed and paid for very long periods out of that fund, and remained afterwards as permanent officers of the Department. Then there were the funds of the county committees of agriculture. Certain officers in the service of the Department were paid out of county funds.  These are the three main <Col N="871" /> funds.  Our desire is to put officers who, for a considerable portion of their career, were paid out of these special funds, and who are now regular officers of the Department in the same position as if they were paid the whole time out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  Under the Superannuation Acts, when taking into account the establishment of an officer and settling the years of service which will entitle him to a pension the Minister for Finance is bound by the period of service which that officer has had, and which he has been paid for out of money voted by the Oireachtas. That, of course, gave rise to great hardships in the case of the Department because there were officers paid out of these special funds at the beginning of their career, sometimes for a very long period, and who were, in every sense of the word, permanent officers of the Department, but who because of a special provision in the Superannuation Acts would be debarred from full pension and establishment rights on account of being paid from these special funds.  The purpose of the section is to place all these officers in the same position as other permanent officers, because in fact, they were permanent officers, as if they had always been paid out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes provision in the Bill, by amendment, for certain transferred officers, and I had in mind, when submitting this amendment, the case of a certain officer who had been, up to recently, employed as assistant agricultural overseer in the Department of Agriculture. He was then appointed secretary to a county committee of agriculture. If he had remained in his position as assistant agricultural overseer, he would have been a pensionable officer, but having served as an assistant agricultural overseer, and then, being promoted&mdash;if you call it promotion for a man to be deprived of certain pensionable service&mdash;to the position <Col N="873" /> of secretary to a county committee of agriculture, the years which he had spent as an agricultural instructor have been spent, so far as that office is concerned, in vain, in reference to his pension rights.  I ask the Minister to undertake to see that no hardship will be put upon persons of the class I have mentioned, that their services should be counted as continuous services, and that a man transferred from the Minister's own Department will not suffer any hardship.</P>

The officers the Deputy is concerned with are officers of local authorities, and not officers of the Department of Agriculture.  How can I deal in this Bill with officers of local authorities?  The purpose of the Bill is to establish officers of the Department of Agriculture.  A totally different Bill would be required to deal with the case the Deputy has mentioned, assuming all the merits of the case to be as the Deputy has stated. There is no more reason why you should deal with the officers the Deputy referred to in this Bill than with the officers of technical education committees established by local authorities.  It cannot be done.  This Bill deals with officers of the Department, a branch of the Civil Service of the State, not with local officers.  It only deals with persons who are now officers of the Department of Agriculture. But it is provided that those officers who have had previous service in another capacity will have that fact taken into account.  That does not alter the fact that there is no authority in this Bill to deal with persons who are not officers at present of any Department of Government and are officers of local authorities.</P>

      <P>If you were to consider such a case you would have to take all the circumstances into account and go into the merits.  In this particular case the officer got a big increase in salary.  He was an overseer at a smaller salary and he got a big increase and a much larger salary.  The grievance he is suffering now is that he will not get the years he spent as assistant overseer allowed to him when his pension is being calculated by the local authority, but as against that other consideration would be advanced.  I do not want to prejudice the merits of this case, but it can be said that he was promoted from a small position and given a bigger salary, and he will have, even before this Bill is passed, since the date of appointment a permanency and pension rights on a bigger salary.  That might be advanced on the other side.  But, whatever the merits, you cannot deal with <Col N="875" /> an officer who is not an officer of the State at all in a Bill that deals with the officers of one Department of the State, namely, the Department of Agriculture.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great objection to any Bill going through the Dáil that will tend to extend the powers of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I think <Col N="879" /> if we are going to appoint a committee of agriculture in any county we should give that committee as much power as we possibly can.  I have other amendments later on which will deal with matters other than appointments. I quite realise there are much more important things to be done by the committees than the mere making of appointments, although an appointment in itself is, of course, important. Representatives on county councils and different committees in the country believe that they are as competent to select an officer for any particular post as the central authority here, whether the central authority make the appointment through a Local Appointments Commissioner or in any other way.</P>
    <P>If amendment 11 is agreed to, there would still remain power to the Minister to lay down the qualifications, the conditions of service, the salary, and so on.  If the Minister were to tell the county committee of agriculture to make the appointment, and if he were to point out the necessary qualifications and the regulations applying to salary and pension rights, he could then, I think, safely leave the making of the appointment of any officer to the local county committee.  I do not want to go unnecessarily into the question of the Local Appointments Commissioners, but, as I have said, the people in the country believe they have just as good a right to make appointments as any central authority. They say that nobody knows who the Local Appointments Commissioners are.  Local authorities have been accused in some cases of being amenable to undue influences; but at least whatever appointment they have made, or have been allowed to make, it has always been made in the open, in the presence of the Press, and, generally speaking, they must give their reasons for appointing a particular person.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as conditions now exist, a person is sent to them by the Local Appointments Commissioners and no reason is given why that person has been selected.  The appointments that have been made under existing conditions are made by <Col N="880" /> people&mdash;I do not know whether by men or women&mdash;who have no knowledge of local requirements.  They may have knowledge of the academic qualifications required for the particular post, but they have no knowledge of what the local requirements are.  The members of the local authority have much more knowledge on points of that sort.  After some of our recent experiences in this country I think we should not grant any extension of the powers of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  We had a great deal of trouble during the last few months over some appointments made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  We ought not to extend their powers until we have an opportunity of discussing the matter fully in the Dáil, and deciding whether the legislation under which appointments are now being made could not be amended so as to give local people a little more option. I move amendment 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Ryan.  My experience of local government, and it goes back to the very initiation of local government in this country, is that the appointments made by local authorities have, as a general rule, turned out most satisfactorily. I have heard cases of corruption in local bodies cited, both in this House and outside.  Invariably it happens that the people who start stories about corruption are disappointed candidates.  So far as my experience of the Local Appointments Commissioners and their operations goes, I must agree with what Deputy Ryan stated about operations more or less in the dark; the light of the Press is not thrown upon their proceedings. I do not want to say anything against them, but they are not above suspicion, and a great number of people in this country are not satisfied that the Local Appointments Commissioners are all that they are declared to be; the people are not satisfied that the Local Appointments Commissioners are not directly or indirectly amenable to some little gentle pressure in the making of appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> For that reason, and especially as we are starting upon something new, I think it would be a very wise thing to leave the making of appointments in the hands of the local bodies, along the lines indicated by Deputy Ryan. As the Deputy pointed out, it can be indicated to those local bodies by the Minister, or whoever is in authority, on what lines the appointments are to be made, what the qualifications and salary are to be, and the particular conditions in the county for which the appointment is being made. I think it would be considered a reflection on the newly appointed committees if the Bill made it definite that they were not to be trusted with the making of appointments in future. For that reason I will support Deputy Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know how far this Bill will mean an extension of the powers of the Local Appointments Commissioners, as Deputy Ryan mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my impression&mdash;that it will mean no extension. I would like to approach the question from this point of view: if this principle of the making of appointments through the Local Appointments Commissioners will continue to apply to practically all local authorities&mdash;every local body&mdash;in the same manner as it does at the present time, I do not see any reason why these particular agricultural committees should be exempted. I do not think that is the right way.  If this system of the Local Appointments Commissioners is wrong I do not think it should be attacked in this fashion.  Merely making provision for one small section of the community is not, in my opinion, the proper way to deal with this matter. If the system is to be attacked at all, and if we are to condemn it, we should condemn it as a whole and not attack it in piecemeal fashion.  What is proposed here is to attack that system only in so far as it affects a comparatively small section of the community.  The county council, the board of health, <Col N="882" /> and other local authorities have to make their appointments through the Local Appointments Commissioners, and I think it will lead to a certain amount of confusion, doubt and surprise if one body will be given power to make its own appointments while superior bodies such as the county council have that power taken from them under our existing legislation. If this matter is to be faced at all it should be taken in its entirely and as a matter applying to all local authorities. There was a Bill introduced some time ago by the Party to which the Deputy belongs.  There was afterwards a Commission set up, and the Commission reported.  Both in the Bill and in the report of the Commission, of which Deputy Ryan's Party were members, the principle of appointments being made by the Local Appointments Commission was admitted and accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I must be entirely wrong in my reading of Deputy de Valera's Bill and the report of the Commission.  There was a doubt as to the method.  There was a question as to whether three or two should be recommended. But the question of taking the appointments out of the hands of the local body and giving them to some central body was admitted and accepted.  Does Deputy Aiken deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would recommend him to read the Bill again.  As I understood the Bill&mdash;and I will be glad to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash; that was the principle of it.  Why refer the matter of appointments to the central authority at all?  As I remember it, there was a provision for referring the making of the appointments to the central authority in Deputy de Valera's Bill.  There were powers given to select one or two or three names, send them down to the local authority, who at a meeting would select one out of the two or three.  If Deputy Aiken argues that that was not accepting the principle of the Local Appointments <Col N="883" /> Commission, then that ends it so far as I am concerned.  But I argue it does accept that principle.  The principle is there, and if we are to take this system at all it ought to be taken as a whole and applied to every authority. While it applies to the county councils and other local authorities, the principle is there, and I cannot see what is to be gained by making an exception in the case of this particular body. I think there ought to be uniformity so far as the county councils and the local authorities are concerned, and I do not see any reason for making a distinction in this case.  If the system is wrong, let us attack the system as a whole and get a better system.  But let us have the same system applying to all local authorities.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell forgets that the Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil was introduced for the purpose of doing away with the major objection we had to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  At the present time the procedure is that when a local body wants somebody appointed the Local Appointments Commissioners select one person, and they send that person's name down to the county council or other local body, who must appoint that particular person.  We object to that, and, as time goes on, we are strengthened in our objection. A few years ago we introduced a Bill which would have compelled the Civil Service Commissioners to examine the qualifications of the candidates and send down three names to the local body.  The local authority then would have the power of selecting a candidate.</P>

      <P>There was a very big <Col N="884" /> difference in the principle, but the system we are trying to mend was the appointment and the selection being made by some three persons in Dublin. We tried to get that amended, so that the selection would be left with the local authority.  They would select one of the three fully-qualified persons &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the selection was by the council or the local authority&mdash; that was the principle in the Bill.  Here we are up against a section in the Bill and we are going to stand against that section.  We believe that it is the county committees of agriculture who should make the appointments.  At the moment the county committees of agriculture are appointing their agricultural instructors and their poultry and dairy instructresses.  This section in this Bill is an extension of the principle of appointment by Local Appointments Commissioners.  We are going to oppose that.  That section is giving the Local Appointments Commissioners more power than they had hitherto.  We believe that the people who pay the rates should make the selection.  I am sorry Deputy O'Higgins has gone, because he protested the other day that we were standing for taking the power out of the hands of the county council.  If he were sincere in that, I would make an appeal to him now to stand with us in securing that under this section some little power would be left in the hands of the county councils or in the hands of the bodies appointed under them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of the country as a whole are fed up with the Appointments Commissioners and the way in which they have been carrying on.  If they are going to pay the rates, they naturally want to make the selections. It is a bit too good that a small group in Dublin should throw the nominee <Col N="885" /> of the Minister on the people and compel them to pay him.  Regarding these particular appointments, we believe that many people throughout the country, members of county committees of agriculture and others, know more about the requirements of the agricultural community and about agricultural education than the Minister or any three members of the Local Appointments Commission. Grave difference of opinion exists between the agricultural community and the Minister as to what is best to be done.  We are not going to stand for the Minister and those closely associated with him in Dublin, dumping agricultural instructors and others on the farmers of the country and making the farmers pay them.  I hope that Deputy O'Connell and his colleagues will see that this is an extension of the powers of the Local Appointments Commissioners and that it is going to give them more power than they had hitherto.  I am sure that Deputy O'Connell is not satisfied with the work of these Commissioners and I hope that he will stand with us in supporting the amendment.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some confusion regarding the Local Appointments Commissioners and the local committees.  I do not think that one should be confused with the other. I think that the country will accept the principle that a central Appointments Commission is something that should be supported, but it is different in the case of local committees who make appointments.  The only thing I have to say regarding these committees is that they should be taken from local representatives and not from people who represent nobody locally.  I am prepared to have local appointment committees selected from the elected representatives of the people, county councillors and others, because in that way you will restore that confidence which appears to have been lost.  In many cases I do not know what the qualifications of the people selected for these committees were.  When you have local people at all let them be local people who represent the community at large, rather than people who represent nobody</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment that appointments under the Bill be left in the hands of local committees.  In the light of recent events, particularly in Mayo, this amendment should be treated a a different way from that in which it would probably have been treated a year ago.  Appointments have been made for some time by local committees, and the Minister must admit that they have proved very satisfactory. Local committees feel their responsibility in the matter, and the appointments which they have made have turned out to be very good.  I am sure that the appointments recently made, and those likely to be made in the future, will give more satisfaction to the people concerned, to the ratepayers, and, in the long run, to the Department than any made by the Appointments Commissioners.  This Bill is an extension of the powers of the Appointment Commissioners.  It widens the scope of their authority, but the Dáil, in view of recent happenings in County Mayo, should not give them these extended powers.  We realise that recently one of the biggest blunders that possibly could be made by any Department or Government was made when a certain appointment in Mayo was insisted on.  I am not going to discuss that appointment now, but prominent members of the Government Party themselves admitted that it was a great blunder and a great wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first opportunity since then which we have had of having the matter considered, even in a small way.  In order to check, to some extent, the powers of the Appointments Commissioners, we should all agree to accept this amendment, but, if it is not accepted by the Minister, I trust that Deputy Dr. Ryan will put it to a division.  In order to enlighten the Government on this point and to make them realise that they have gone a <Col N="887" /> little too far&mdash;that is putting it very mildly&mdash;on this question of appointments. I would ask members of the Party opposite to vote for the amendment. As I have said, appointments made in the past by county committees of agriculture have been very satisfactory. Seeing that it is the local people who have to provide the rates, the wherewithal to carry out schemes, and that it is the people who have to pay up who are the people most concerned by the appointments made, I maintain that local committees should be given a little authority in the making of appointments.  We do not object to some authority, the Minister or some commissioners, call them what you like, deciding as to the qualifications of those who present themselves for appointment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell seems to have misunderstood the Bill introduced here dealing with this matter and the suggestions of the members of our Party who went on the Committee to deal with the question of the Appointments Commissioners.  All we were concerned with then was that a certain body, call it what you will, would ensure that none but qualified persons would be appointed, that there would not be a danger of men being appointed who were not fully qualified. Our suggestion was that the names of those who are fully qualified would be sent to the local committees and that the local committees should appoint one of them.  In this case, as I have said, we do not object to the Minister laying down what the qualifications should be and, when he lays down that none but qualified men should be appointed.  The local committees are not given much power when they are confined to the appointment of qualified men only.</P>
    <P>If the full power of appointment were in the hands of local committees to-morrow, they would, as a general rule, lay it down that the best qualified man should be appointed.  The great mistake has been that local conditions are scarcely ever taken into account when local appointments are being made.  If these conditions were taken more into account than they are <Col N="888" /> there would not be so much objection raised to the Appointments Commissioners. Now that we have a chance of leaving a little power of appointment in the hands of local committees, I ask the Minister not to deprive them of that power, and I ask members of the Party opposite, as well as Deputy O'Connell, to reconsider their attitude on this subject.  This amendment is not asking too much and it is not going to re-open the road which would lead back to the old system under which, somebody said, there was corruption. There is a clause which says that the Minister must see that qualified men only are appointed.  This amendment, to me, as a representative of County Mayo, appears to be very important. Deputy Gorey and others may think that it is not very important, but in my view it has to do with a very important question, as we in Mayo unfortunately realised quite recently. For that reason, I am confident that Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies from Mayo, including the ex-Chairman of the County Council, especially in the light of his recent action in Mayo, will vote against the Government on this amendment.  They cannot consistently take up any other attitude.  If the Minister will not accept the amendment, we will force it to a division, and if that happens, Independent Deputies and, I am sure, Labour Deputies, as well as some members of Cumann na nGaedheal who have spoken very loudly in protest against the abolition of the Mayo County Council, will be forced into the Division Lobby in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Then their position has been changed completely since the time Deputy de Valera introduced his Bill and since the time Fianna Fáil Deputies sat on the Committee which dealt with this question.  Are we to take it that that is so?  It would be well if we had a declaration on that point.  Let us see whether we are arguing this small application of the measure to one particular kind of committee, or whether we are actually attacking the whole system of appointments by Appointments Commissioners. In regard to the statement of Deputy Clery about appointing a qualified man, I always understood that it was not a question of selecting a qualified man, but of selecting the best qualified.  You will get a man qualified for a position easily enough, but the Local Appointments Act was an attempt to set up machinery to get the best qualified person out of the number of qualified people who would be applying for the position.  If, as Deputy Dr. Ryan states, it is now definitely their intention to have the whole system of appointments to local authorities by the Local Appointments Commission abolished, we know where we are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputies opposite do not believe in the amendment, because they have tried to defend it by advancing reasons which they must know to be quite unsound. They think they are taking an opportunity of preventing the extension of the Local Appointments Commission system.  That is not so.  There is no extension of the method of appointment by the Local Appointments Commission, direct or indirect, in this Bill. The section reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Every committee of agriculture shall be deemed to be a local body within the meaning of Part IV of the Act of 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> That is the Act that set up the Local Appointments Commission. This section says that the committee of agriculture, so far as these appointments are concerned, shall come within the terms of the Act.  Is it suggested here that the local committees of agriculture did not specifically accept appointments made under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926?  That is what is suggested. We passed this Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act of 1926, and under that Act a certain procedure was established.  That procedure was to make appointments to local authorities by selection boards. What is suggested here now is that there was some section in that Act which expressly omitted committees of agriculture.  That is nonsense and, while I do not give credit to certain Deputies for much intelligence, I find it difficult to believe that they are as ignorant as they pretend to be.  All appointments were made by this Act. system and made under this Act. Now we are setting up a new system. We are re-organising new county committees, re-establishing a new kind of county committee of agriculture and we are specifying, as we should specify, that the new committee, just as the old committee, shall come under the Act for the purposes of local appointments.</P>
    <P>We are not extending the system of local appointments by the Appointments Commission in any way.  If that is clear, I have nothing to add to what Deputy O'Connell has stated. The system of making appointments, both centrally and locally, not by the Executive Council in the case of central appointments and not by the local authorities in the case of local appointments, but by selection boards &mdash;the Civil Service Commission in one case and the Local Appointments Commission in the other&mdash;whatever may be said of it set up a system that was a very revolutionary change from the old system.  That system was a system of patronage.  People talk of power and say &ldquo;what power have we now?&rdquo;  I believe there are Deputies who think that power consists of patronage in the making of <Col N="892" /> appointments.  That is the only deduction you can draw from their language.  The old system gave them that patronage.  It gave the politician who chanced to be a Minister a very extensive power of patronage.  The new system does not.  It takes away all patronage and it transfers the power of making appointments to independent bodies. That may be right or wrong, but this can be agreed upon by everybody &mdash;that it was a revolutionary change. Now it is suggested, as Deputy O'Connell put it, that on an Agricultural Bill, in respect of one small authority with, in fact, very few appointments we should change the whole system. If this system is changed, it should be changed not casually but deliberately.</P>
    <P>It should be changed after a complete examination, and after a very careful analysis of what has occurred since those Acts were passed.  It should be changed after due deliberation, after taking care to make adequate arrangements for the making of appointments in the future.  It should not be changed casually in this fashion, and, above all, for reasons which are entirely unsound.  It should not be changed on the plea that this is an extension of the system.  It is not that in any sense.  It is merely applying the system to a body which we are setting up as a substitute for the old county committees of agriculture.  So far as the system itself is concerned, Deputy Clery need not worry about Deputies in this Party.  We are quite clear on the matter and so is the country.  This system of appointment, not by local authorities, not by the Executive Council when it comes to the Civil Service, but by an independent body is, I hold, a sound system on the whole.  I say that the great body of opinion of all kinds in the country is behind that system.  It is realised by business people and by every person of good will that this system has brought about more and more efficiency.  Of course, there are interests in the country who would like to see it modified in some details, but that is a minor matter. The system, on the whole, as established by us, and with the experience that we have had of it, makes us feel <Col N="893" /> more in favour of it.  We are satisfied that the good sense of the country as a whole is behind it, and we intend to stand by it in all appointments.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputies would give up the habit of talking about corruption.  The commonest way of attacking this system of the making of appointments by selection boards rather than by local patronage is to say: &ldquo;Do you suggest that the county councils are corrupt?&rdquo; We do not suggest that.  You might as well say: Do you suggest that a Minister, we will say a Fianna Fáil Minister, could be corrupt?  For the purposes of the argument, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Everybody who knows anything knows that if public appointments are to be made locally you will have an impossible position brought about.  Influence is brought to bear on every side on behalf of candidates, and it is often very difficult to do the right thing. That is totally different, however, from corruption.  Say that the Executive Council had to make all the appointments in the Department of Agriculture&mdash;and the Executive Council is as representative as a county council&mdash; look at the position that the Executive Council would be in.  It would be an impossible position for any Executive, though each member of it was above reproach.  Say that a girl was going for the position of poultry instructress in a county, under the agricultural committee, a neighbour's daughter whose people were of good standing, while another candidate, a stranger, might be considerably better qualified, the position would be difficult.</P>
    <P>People should not be put into such a difficult position.  It is not a question of corruption, and we are not now taking up the position that the necessity for the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission is due to corruption either locally or centrally.  As far as we are concerned, we believe that the best man or woman should win.  We believe that this is the best method, and we stand by it.  I put it to the Dáil that Deputies would be absolutely stultifying themselves if they abolished that system casually, rather than considering it deliberately.  Do not abolish it in reference to one local body in a casual <Col N="894" /> way for entirely local reasons that no one believes in.</P>

Looking over the matter for a great many years, I am perfectly convinced that the person who has gained by the present system, as opposed to the old system, is the poor man's son.  He never got a chance under the old system, because it was the big faction in the county, the people with influence and pull, who got all the appointments, while the poor man's son, no matter how well qualified or educated, was shoved out because he was not in a position to exercise influence and power.  The county families, as we know them, got all the good jobs in the old times.</P>

      <P>There may be exceptions. I am not arguing about Mayo. Deputy Clery and Deputy Ryan would not take up the position that this House ought to make the appointments to the Civil Service.  That would be the complete analogy.  If a county council is going to claim all these powers, the complete analogy would be for this House to make appointments to the Civil Service.  No one would claim that the House is qualified to do that.  I am quite prepared to admit that there might be exceptions, and I am quite prepared to say that sufficient importance is not attached, as Deputy Gorey said, to the local point of view.  That is a matter of detail.  If we are going to depart from the general principle, the person who is going to suffer most is the person who has ability but who is without any influence and without money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument about the poor man's son without any county pull not getting a fair chance is the sheerest bunkum.  Under the old county councils when applicants came up they were known and could be judged on their merits.  If a family was known to be honest and efficient they had that much influence in the making of the appointment.  At the present time, a man must belong to a national family, to one of Deputy Thrift's organisations, in order to get a pull over the Appointments Commissioners.  The members of the Executive Council who appoint the Commissioners are not angels.  They are not exempt from original sin any more than members of county councils. There is always influence of one sort or another being used when appointments are being made.  At the moment, influence is being worked through national organisations, such as Deputy Thrift's, in order to influence the Appointments Commissioners secretly. We would prefer to see this influence threshed out in the open by the people who know the local circumstances and who have to pay the piper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken has stated that the members of the Appointments Commission are not always angels. That would be one of my reasons <Col N="898" /> for opposing the system of Appointments Commissioners.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that the system of Appointments Commissioners was introduced in order to relieve the members of local bodies of the responsibility of making appointments &mdash;because of the fact that in certain cases they knew the applicants for certain positions, they knew them to be farmers' sons or poor men's sons.  I want to remind the Minister and this House that under the old system all these appointments were made in the open by people who were elected to positions on local bodies. These public men were elected to these positions because the people had confidence in them.  They had confidence in them to make these appointments in the same way, I suppose, that they had confidence in us when they elected us to be members of this House.</P>
      <P>I and some others had a certain amount of sympathy with the Government when they set up the Appointments Commissioners, but I must confess that my views have completely and absolutely changed in regard to that institution.  With Deputy Ryan and other who have spoken, I am prepared to go all out to-day for its abolition. I feel that the argument advanced by Deputy O'Connell with reference to the poor man's son is tantamount to saying that there is corruption in local bodies&mdash;that even though the poor man's son was fully qualified he could not get an appointment from these local bodies.  That certainly is tantamount to saying there is corruption in these local bodies.  I have had some experience of the people who serve on local bodies, and I believe they are just as honest as any people the Minister could find to make appointments.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that the analogy attempted to be drawn between the Dáil and local councils is altogether wrong.  The Minister for Agriculture denies that there is any question of general principle involved.  In practice, the analogy is altogether wrong, because a local council has only two or three appointments to make, and a great deal of care can be exercised by the members in making their selection.  But if we here were to be asked to make the appointments necessary to the whole service we would be in quite a different position.  I hold that, in practice, there is a difference between the Dáil making the appointment and the local bodies making the appointment.  Now, as to getting the best qualified person, there is no way by which the best qualified person for any position can be <Col N="900" /> chosen&mdash;none.  We might all make up our minds to that.</P>

      <P>For certain.  It is all a question of opinion.  Very often we go upon academic or other qualifications. Very frequently, in practice, these work out the wrong way.  Men who, by accident or otherwise, are thrown into positions that would ordinarily be filled by people with certain academic qualifications have turned out, in practice, very much better than the people selected on academic qualifications. I do not say that is always so, or that, as a general rule, these qualifications do not denote ability. We have accepted such tests as the best we can get.  I believe, myself, if you make regulations of as searching a character as you can to provide that those who are selected will be of a class that will have the necessary technical or other qualifications of that particular type, then a body of people locally who know intimately the candidates are more likely to make a good selection than are others, provided that unqualified persons cannot go up, so that undue influence or other pressure cannot be used, and that such cannot have an effect.  In other words, if you rule out those obviously unqualified, then a body of local people, a committee sitting in judgment upon these, knowing them intimately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I presume, in that case, there are some qualifications.  I cannot imagine any local body deciding a position where technical qualifications are involved without having some evidence as to the qualifications. We brought in a Bill which was really only a step on the road as far as the greater part of our Party is concerned. We felt, whatever chance there was of getting that particular Bill through here, that there would be no chance of going further.  Some of our Party were satisfied with that as a first step, but it did not represent by any means the ultimate views held by a large section <Col N="901" /> of our Party.  If you can provide by your regulations that only such as are qualified in this manner&mdash;I am trying to get a term, academic or technical qualifications, educational or other qualifications&mdash;can be considered for an appointment, then the ultimate judgment can be very well left to the local bodies, the reason being that they are much more interested in getting a good appointment than people sitting in Dublin who, no matter what sort of candidate they select, will not have to live, so to speak, with that candidate for the rest of the time.  The local body, if it appoints a bad official, has to suffer from the incapacity of that particular official during the whole period of his office.  The selection committees are sheltered from the consequences.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it seems to me the two things you want to provide are, firstly, that only people fit for the position can possibly be considered as candidates, and, secondly, that those who are most intimately affected will have the ultimate choice.  I think that in the long run this is far the best way.  We have heard about influences that are brought to bear in these cases.  These work in different directions.  What I mean is: they more or less balance one another. If there are two or three candidates, a person being approached from one side or the other has finally to make up his mind to vote for the person he thinks best in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this local pressure, as it is called, really matters so very much.  I believe that the members of the local councils very quickly, when they realise what is involved, learn to stand up against forces of that kind, and there is the great safeguard of publicity.  If there is a local medical appointment, and if the person chosen is obviously not the best qualified person, if in practice, for instance, there is chosen some one who does not attend to his duties, who, for instance, is guilty of a number of things medical men, I am told, are sometimes guilty of, who is going to suffer?  The local people suffer.  They know about it, and when a council is going to make a new appointment, if it knows the history of the person at all and knows <Col N="902" /> his character, it is not going to vote for somebody who is obviously, from his character, not fit for the position. That is so in the case of medical appointments, and largely it is so in the case of other appointments.  I was one of those who more or less advocated the Bill that was brought in here. It represented, to a large extent, my views, but, as time goes on and I see no way of getting publicity for the methods of selection by these selection boards, I, like Deputy Smith, am going more and more every day to the position I have indicated here now.  I believe that in the long run you have got to trust somebody, and it is better to trust those people who will have most to suffer if things go wrong than to trust people who are sheltered from criticism.  Nobody can know what are the principles upon which selection boards act, and, as far as I know, there is a great deal of criticism of appointments that have already been made as being un suitable.  I am not able to give any specific examples, but I believe there is no smoke without some sort of fire. I believe there is ground for some of these complaints, at any rate, and, in connection with this particular amendment here, our attitude is that we want to protest against the continuance of that system and we are using this particular case as an opportunity to indicate that we are not at all satisfied with the existing system and that if we had our way it would be changed.</P>

      <P>I am rather sorry that the whole question of the Local Appointments Commission has been raised in the manner in which it has been raised.  I can quite understand the views put forward by Deputy de Valera.  His Party are pressing that something should be done in connection with it, and I must say I have a certain amount of sympathy with the views put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Aiken.  Knowing, as I do, the operations of the Local Appointments Commission, I certainly know of appointments that have been made by the Local Appointments Commission that were not very desirable.  I feel absolutely certain, from our experience <Col N="903" /> of public bodies, that the best qualified men have not been appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for myself on this matter, I believe that a qualifying examination should be sufficient so far as local bodies are concerned.  If you have a Commission who are prepared to examine candidates for a certain position and this Commission finds that people are qualified for the positions for which they are applying, surely that ought to be sufficient. What is happening at the present moment so far as local bodies are concerned? I have in my mind the question of borough surveyors under urban councils.  I know of cases where men applied for positions in certain areas and they just used these positions as a medium to procure higher positions, leaving the local authorities there after a few years. It certainly does not tend to greater efficiency if local authorities are to have new surveyors every three or four years.  I believe that if there is a local applicant for the position, and <Col N="904" /> if the man is sufficiently qualified to take up the position, and if there is unanimity so far as the local council is concerned as regards his appointment, that man should get the appointment even though there are others who are more highly qualified so far as academic qualifications are concerned.</P>
    <P>I certainly think the whole system requires examination in that connection. With the principle of the Appointments Commission I agree.  I have already voted for that.  I do not think that this is a proper time to raise the matter.  I am of opinion that the section should not have been put in this Bill at all, and that it is a pity to have the matter raised now. I believe the time is ripe to raise the whole question of the Appointments Commission.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Before removing under this section from his office or employment an officer or servant of a committee of agriculture, the Minister shall give to such committee and also to such officer or servant at least one fortnight's notice in writing of his intention to so remove such officer or servant, and if such committee or such officer or servant before the expiration of such notice request in writing the Minister to hold a local inquiry under this Act in relation to the performance by such officer or servant of his duties as such officer or servant, the Minister shall not so remove such officer or servant unless and until he has caused such local inquiry to be held and considered the report of the person who held such local inquiry.</P>
      <P>(3)  A notice of the Minister's intention to remove from his office or employment an officer or servant of a committee of agriculture under this section may be served on such committee by sending it by post to the chief executive officer of such committee and on such officer or servant by delivering it to him, or by sending it by post to him at his last known place of abode.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> 13.  Before Section 23 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may at any time cause an inquiry (in this Act referred to as a local inquiry) to be held in relation to the performance by an officer or a servant of a committee of agriculture of his duties as such officer or servant and for that purpose may appoint an officer of the Minister to hold such local inquiry.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the Minister causes a local inquiry to be held he may make an order directing the costs incurred in relation to such inquiry to be paid by the committee of agriculture concerned, and any such order shall certify the amount of such costs and the amount so certified shall be a debt due by such committee to the Minister and shall be recoverable by the Minister from such committee as a civil debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section the costs of any local inquiry shall be deemed to include such reasonable expenses of witnesses attending such inquiry as the Minister shall allow.</P>
    <P>14.  Before Section 23 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  An officer appointed by the Minister to hold a local inquiry may by summons in the prescribed form signed by him require any person to attend at the time and place (not being a place more than thirty miles from the residence of such person) named in such summons and there and then to give evidence or produce any document in his power, possession, or procurement relating to any matter in question at such inquiry or do both such things.</P>
    <P>(2)  A summons issued under this section shall be served by delivering it to the person to whom it is addressed or by leaving it for him with a person of the age of sixteen years or more at the usual place of abode of such first-mentioned person.</P>
    <P>(3)  If any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on being duly served with a summons under this section makes <Col N="908" /> default in attending in accordance with such summons; or</P>
    <P>(b)  being in attendance at a local inquiry as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required by the officer holding such inquiry to be taken by him or to produce any document in his possession, power or control legally required by such officer to be produced by him or to answer any question to which such officer may legally require an answer,</P>
    <P>such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    <P>(4)  A witness before an officer holding a local inquiry shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he were a witness before the High Court.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>15.  Before Section 23 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>An officer appointed by the Minister to hold a local inquiry shall have power to take evidence on oath, and for that purpose may administer oaths to persons attending before him as witnesses.&mdash;(Mr. Hogan.)</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 22, to delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know if I understand the section rightly, but the Minister can correct me if what I say is wrong.  It would appear to me that under this section if a county committee of agriculture were to submit a scheme, and if the Minister were to reject half of the scheme, he could compel the committee to proceed with the remainder of it.  I think it is hardly fair to a committee to make them proceed with part of a scheme which they had drawn up after the Minister had knocked out 25 or 50 per cent. of it.  The Minister could conceivably change their whole intention by so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is this.  The Minister could approve of 25 or 50 per cent. of the scheme&mdash;pick out a bit of the scheme that the committee would not have on any account if it were to be on its own.  In that way I think it would be going against the spirit of the Bill by having the Minister's will cut across the committee in such a way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point.  The Minister must approve of the scheme. Supposing a scheme is put up and the Minister approves of portion of it and the committee is unwilling to go on with the rest, there is nothing, as far as I know, to coerce the committee into going on with the rest of the scheme.  Of course, they cannot drop all their schemes.  That is all it comes to.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the Minister, on the joint representation of the council of a county and the committee of agriculture for such county, considers it desirable that steps should be taken to preserve existing woods standing in such county, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a forestry scheme order) declare that such county is a county in which it is desirable that a forestry scheme under this section should be put into effect.</P>

      <P>Amendments 17 and 18 were meant to be one amendment as a matter of fact, but amendment 19 is different.  It is more or less the same idea going a little further.  They refer to a scheme being put up by a committee of agriculture with regard to existing woods.  I have an amendment down to a later section, but in case that amendment is defeated I thought that if the county committee were to raise the money in the county for the preservation of existing woods, if the ratepayers were to be responsible for the expenses incurred, and the ratepayers elected the members of the committee, either directly or indirectly, that the committee should have absolute power to look after the preservation of these woods.  That is what the amendments would amount to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments taken together would have the effect of removing the control of the Minister over the county schemes generally. The Deputy's point is that the county is paying for them.  That is not so. They are being paid for out of a joint fund which is fed as to two-thirds of its total out of taxation and as to only about one-third out of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At present and in future, so far as we can calculate.  The present position is that at least two-thirds of the funds required for the service of these schemes is found by taxation and only about one-third by rates, so that the main argument of the Deputy, that <Col N="912" /> the ratepayers are paying for these schemes and should have complete control of them, goes.  The taxpayer is paying in the main for these schemes and should have some control over them.  There is no doubt that it would be entirely wrong administration to give very large sums of money to the counties for specific purposes out of taxation and at the same time to retain no control over the expenditure of that money.  That is what we would be doing if we withdrew the Minister's control over the county schemes.  But there are even more important considerations. This amendment cuts to the root of the whole system of agricultural administration.  The county committees have been in existence for a great many years.  Their schemes have all been thought out with considerable care and have been amended and modified with experience.  At the present moment you have been biggest and moment you have the biggest part of their schemes, which are general schemes, adopted and agreed to in every county; they have the approval of every county in Ireland, and are regarded as fundamental to our agricultural economy.  The scheme would be accepted by nine farmers out of every ten as being vital for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the question of live stock.  You would no doubt get an odd farmer to say we should get rid of shorthorns and get Friesian cows.  Five or six years ago you would get a good many farmers to say that, but now you do not, because they have learned a lesson in the meantime.  In a county you would find people occasionally who would for a short time allow themselves to be rushed off their feet by something new&mdash;by some new stunt&mdash; accepting and adopting it.  That would be all right if the harm done by adopting some entirely unsound scheme were confined to the particular county in question, but that is not so.  It is generally agreed that the large white pig is ideal for this country; that is accepted and agreed by everybody, except certain districts in counties in the North, who say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but they are a small minority.  If there is anything that we can say that is absolutely certain, it is that the large white York pig is ideal for this country as a whole. <Col N="913" /> Now, suppose some southern county comes forward with a scheme, without much consideration, and because of some local grievance offers premiums to Ulster boars&mdash;suppose the Department had no power to prevent that, what would the effect be?  It is agreed by all sane agricultural opinion that that would be disastrous, yet nothing could be done to stop it, and the effect would not be confined to the particular county that brought forward the scheme, but would affect numerous counties.  The progeny of these boars would spread and would injure not only the particular county, but all the neighbouring counties, not only for a short time, but for a long time.  In this way, unless there was some central control exercised over the schemes of the county committees of agriculture, which, taking them on the whole, embody the main phases of agricultural policy, you would have very great lack of uniformity.  You would have counties now and again going off at the deep end and doing things without very much deliberation that they would very much regret afterwards.  I give that one example.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>On the other hand, you may have counties adopting schemes and the Department entirely agreeing, but finding out that while the schemes were quite sound the administration was going to lead to a great many abuses. We have had schemes for the distribution of seed of one kind or another, and while agreeing with the object of these schemes and the distribution, it was found that there was no provision at all made to see that the seed was used as seed and not as food for animals.  We often had that case, and we often had to insist that while entirely agreeing with the schemes there must be arrangements made to see that they are carried out as intended by the county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>You have these two different examples: One class of scheme put up casually by one county which might be urged by a few breeders, at some suitable period when they were easily <Col N="914" /> persuaded, and which would do permanent harm to the livestock not only of the county, but of the neighbouring counties, and it is necessary that somebody would be in a position to prevent that.  You have the other sort of case I mentioned where schemes are agreed upon both by the county committees and the Department and where it is found necessary to amend them in detail.  In a case like that the Department comes in and sees that amendments are carried and sees there is uniformity.  In agricultural policy, whether it is right or wrong, everybody knows you cannot get results for a great many years.  If you are looking for quick results it shows that you know nothing about the business.  A policy may be right or wrong but it cannot give good or bad results unless you keep it in operation for a number of years. You must have continuity of experments carried out in a uniform may for a long time and over the greater part of the country.  For all these reasons it is necessary, in the first instance, to give the Department of Agriculture control over the county schemes. That control has now been in operation for the past thirty years since the Department was established. Here we have an amendment which in fact means the taking away of that control.  Is there any demand for that?</P>

      <P>We are taking the amendments as they stand here and dealing with them along the lines they follow.  Is there any demand for these amendments?  I put it to the House there is no demand for them. There have been some small disputes on details between the Department of Agriculture and the county committees of agriculture.  There are bound to be small disputes as to details for a short time, but taking the long period the Department has been administering schemes in co-operation with the county committees there has been no real dispute as to any big issue that lasted for any length of time.  If this matter was put to the vote of the county committees of agriculture as a <Col N="915" /> whole you would carry the proposal to leave the control to the Minister by a big majority.  You have here the control which I say is necessary, and which, in the abstract, is absolutely essential for the reasons I have given. In addition to that, I advance what I regard as a very strong argument that you have this control being exercised for the last twenty years without any real friction, and I would say that there is no sign at this stage of a demand from any of the committees for a removal of the control.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is just as well that the Minister made a general statement covering these amendments, because we can deal with them altogether. I think there are sufficient safeguards without interference by the Minister.  We have safeguards under such Acts as the Live Stock Breeding Act.  With regard to the cases mentioned about the distribution of seeds, there must be safeguards under the common law to deal with it.  Surely there must be safeguards under the ordinary law to deal with such matters. I have heard over and over again from various counties complaints as to the policy of the Department and as to interference in certain things.  I heard from Deputy Aiken of a case of interference in the County Louth where the local county committee wanted to carry out extensive experiments in the sowing of wheat, and where they were not allowed by the Department to proceed as they say they could.  Again, I knew of complaints from my own County of Wexford in the matter of the type of stallions they were allowed to keep there.  Then you have complaints from Kerry as to the too rigid control in certain areas in the matter of the kind of cattle allowed in.  In some areas they are confined altogether to the Kerry cattle.  In other areas we find complaints as to the general policy of the Department of Agriculture.  It was more or less with a view to giving certain Deputies an opportunity of mentioning their grievances that I put down some of these amendments, but I know that there is no use in pressing the matter further than that.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 54, to delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is quite a different amendment <Col N="917" /> from the others.  This section makes it mandatory on the county council to strike a rate.  I think, in the present circumstances, the House ought not to agree to a principle like this.  We had a considerable amount of talk in the last twelve months about de-rating.  I believe that the agricultural community had their hopes raised that de-rating was very near at hand.  For instance, before Christmas it was announced that the Government were to bring in some scheme of de-rating. They were going to bring in a scheme to relieve agriculture of a million pounds.  Some months later the Government came to a different frame of mind and we had the announcement that there was to be no de-rating this year.  In the meantime, while this discussion was going on in the Press, we have had the rates increased on the agricultural community.  While this discussion about de-rating was going on we had a Bill, the Vocational Education Bill, brought in which put on additional rates on the farmers.  Under the Vocational Education Act it is possible to do many of the things which were sought to be done under this Bill.  I was not present on the Second Reading, but I afterwards read the discussion in which Deputies Good, Fahy and T.J. O'Connell asked the Minister for his opinion on the matter. The Minister agreed that something should be done for agricultural education under that Act.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Vocational Education Act we had a Bill passed through the House here a few days ago&mdash;that was the Local Government (Special Expenses) Bill.  Under that Bill the local authorities will, in many cases, put up an additional rate of 3d. in the £ on the agricultural community. Then we had a Bill introduced a few days ago, and if it is adopted by some of the local authorities it will put on an extra penny on the rates&mdash;that is the Tourist Bill.  In addition to that, we know that many of the counties, in the last year or two, were compelled to adopt certain public health schemes.  They were compelled to appoint a medical officer of health. In that way the rate was increased in many counties.  From what I can learn <Col N="918" /> from the Press, there is hardly a county in the twenty-six that is not increasing its rates in the coming year, and any increase in rates is not very welcome to the agricultural community at present.  If the Government are not in a position to bring in de-rating in the next year they should not pass any Act in the Oireachtas in this session that would make it mandatory on the county councils to strike an additional rate.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and allow the county councils the option they have at present, by substituting the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; as this amendment proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I fancy that this proposal in the Bill is unnecessary.  Surely in the present state of affairs it should be left to the good sense of the county council to say whether they were of opinion that their ratepayers would be in a position to stand another 2d. in the £ under the Bill.  That is a matter that surely ought to be left to their own good sense.  During the past two months we have heard cries all over the country about the relief that was going to be given to the farmers.  We had the President last November telling us that he was going to give immediate relief to the farmers.  Is this increase of 2d. in the £ portion of the immediate relief that the farmers are getting?  It is time we knew where we stood.  During the last week I saw the effect of the Public Expenses Bill down the country.  We have also seen the effect of the £300,000 relief grant down the country.  The effect of these was that schemes that were hung up on the shelf for the last five years, because of the fact that the people were not able to pay for them, were brought up now on the 25 per cent. grant from the Minister, and as a result we have these works being put through, for which the local rates will have to provide 75 per cent.  We have seen some of the blessings bestowed on the agricultural community. We have seen the result of these things on the local bodies, and we can see how they are working out at the moment.  Surely the Executive Council should consider these things for themselves, and they ought to see <Col N="919" /> that it should be left to the good sense of the local bodies whether they consider that the ratepayers are able to bear an extra burden of 2d. in the £ or not.  In fact, it may be more than 2d.; 2d. is compulsory, and another 1d. may be added if they consider they are able to pay it.</P>
      <P>In connection with vocational education, we had some kind of assurance that agricultural education was going to be catered for.  Apparently that has gone with all the other things.  By degrees the rates on the unfortunate farmers will be shoved up to 6d.  It is bad enough to have Ministers making promises about de-rating and then forgetting all about them when they find it convenient to do so.  It is bad enough to see the local bodies writing to the Minister for Local Government looking for sanction for an overdraft of £120,000, as was the case recently in Cork, when the people could not pay their rates.  The interest on that sum will have to be paid, and yet we have the Minister suggesting an additional 2d. on the rates here to-night.  We had 4d. put on the rates last week, and 2d. the week before.  The Government Party must imagine that the farmers and other people in the country have an unlimited supply of money, that there is no bottom to their pockets.  I think that Deputy Ryan's amendment is a perfectly sensible one, and the Minister ought to accept it.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the long list of Bills that Deputy Ryan mentioned as passed here that will place a burden upon the ratepayers. I am surprised that he has introduced an amendment to this measure which has for its purpose the killing of agricultural education in the country.  If there is one burden the farmer does not want to be relieved of it is the money spent for the benefit of the farming community generally.  If this had been introduced in relation to other measures there might be some other reason for it, but I do not think, no matter what our views may be on de-rating, that any of us interested in agriculture would like to see any prohibition placed upon the levying of a rate for agricultural purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy to say that if this amendment were carried it would mean the killing of agricultural education in different counties.  Each council is composed, to a large extent, of members of the farming community, people who are elected by the farmers and people who are looking every day at the results derived from the schemes of county committees. If the power to strike a rate of 1d. or 2d. is left in their hands, it seems to me they will strike a rate in proportion to the benefits that they see accuring from those schemes in their different counties.  I have noticed Deputy O'Hanlon's attitude on other legislation that imposed further burdens by way of increased rates upon the farmers.  I have noticed the attitude of some Deputies towards questions of this kind, and I have also observed their attitude upon such questions when in the country.  I cannot understand where the consistency comes in when a Deputy advocates de-rating for the farming community and at the same time votes here for a Technical Education Bill which imposes a sixpenny rate, and a Public Health (Special Expenses) Bill which imposes an additional rate upon the farming community.  I cannot understand the attitude of a Deputy who advocates de-rating down the country and declares that the farmers are entitled to it and must get it, while here he votes for legislation of the kind I have mentioned.  That is not the sort of consistency I understand. We have the Minister for Local Government refusing to permit local bodies to strike a rate for the improvement of a cul-de-sac, or boreens and lanes, and, on the other hand, we have the Minister for Agriculture suggesting <Col N="921" /> that it should be made compulsory on local bodies to strike a rate for the purposes of the Bill we are now considering. I cannot understand these varying attitudes, and I am not prepared to stand for any inconsistency. In my opinion this is a matter that can safely be left in the hands of county councils, the members of which know the benefits derived from various schemes, and they will be prepared to advocate a rate accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy O'Hanlon that it would be very bad to deprive the farmers or any section of the community of education, and in that connection I advise him to read Sections 3 and 4 of the Vocational Education Act and also study the reply given by the Minister for Agriculture on 18th February in connection with the Second Stage of this Bill.  Some doubts were expressed on that occasion by Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Good, and others regarding the classes to be conducted by instructors under the Department.  The Minister said there was a possibility under the Vocational Education Act of getting agricultural classes.  Taking Section 3 of that Act, we find that the expression &ldquo;continuation education&rdquo; means education to continue and supplement education provided in elementary schools, and includes general and practical training in preparation for employment in trades, manufactures, agriculture, commerce, etc.  Sub-section (3) of Section 4 sets out that the Minister may from time to time, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, by order declare that the expression &ldquo;technical education&rdquo; shall for the purposes of the Act also include instruction in such subjects bearing on or relating to agriculture as may be specified in such order, and wherever any such order is made the meaning of such expression shall, for the purposes of the Act, be extended in conformity with the provisions of such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are complaints through the country that vocational education, continuation education and technical education will largely benefit the towns, but will be of little benefit to the rural districts.  There was a possibility of <Col N="922" /> getting in agricultural classes, but we find the Minister for Agriculture stating here&mdash;and it is in consultation with him that agricultural instruction must be set up under that Act&mdash;&ldquo;But so far as I know there is no agricultural teaching in any of the schools schemes dealt with under the Vocational Education Act.&rdquo;  Therefore, he has not yet been consulted.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Minister went into consultation with the Minister for Education a good deal of the instructional side of the work of these officers could be brought under the scheme of vocational education.  Apart from that, laudable efforts have been made to co-ordinate education, which was a very disjointed thing some years ago, and these efforts have been attended with a considerable amount of success, but there is a danger here of severance again.  I think that the Minister should get into touch with the Minister for Education, co-ordinate these classes and get the agricultural classes going for those in the rural areas who benefit little by the Technical Education Act.  In that way Deputy O'Hanlon's objections to the amendment would be met and agricultural instruction could be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Minister): I have nothing to add to what Deputy O'Hanlon has said except to prove that he is right when he says that there is no demand from the farmers for a reduction in the rate they are paying.  While they may be suffering under high rates of taxation they do not begrudge the amount of the rate for the purpose for which it is made.  We recently circularised every county council and we told them of our intentions in full.  We told them that it was intended to make it mandatory to strike a rate of 2d. in the £ for agricultural schemes.  We did that by a circular letter which was sent out on 31st January, and that letter reached every county council in the Saorstát.  It was before them all and there was not one single dissentient.  The county councils discussed it, and there was no objection of any kind to this particular proposal.  There was one doubt <Col N="923" /> expressed by the Leitrim County Council as to the legality of the steps which we were taking to effect our intention but there was no objection to it.</P>
      <P>Farmers feel the burden of all overhead expenses, and are as concerned about them as any Deputies here, and they realise the advantage it would be to them to reduce the rate.  Deputies can take it that farmers have a very keen appreciation of that fact, but not one suggestion came from any county council that we should lower the rate. That must be accepted as a complete proof that in the opinion of the farmers and county councils this is justified.  Deputy Good shakes his head.  As a rule members of county councils are quite vocal and when they have any grievances, real or imaginary, they are not slow in airing them.  In spite of the fact that they are inclined to be critical on local bodies, not one voice was raised against this proposal.  I do not say that some members of county councils might not have overlooked the matter or might not have seen its significance or the chance of making a protest. There may have been a few exceptions like that to explain the silence and the lack of opposition, but it must be taken as almost certain that the letter which set out the scheme fully reached every county council, that they all accepted it, and that it did not pass through all the county councils by default without the members realising its meaning.  I think we must accept it as a fact that the county councils, as a whole, were convinced that this was a good proposal. How many proposals would have stood that test, even proposals that got the blessing of every Party here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I am making.  We are on this proposal now and not on the others.  How many proposals coming from this House got such a test as this one, which was before the county councils for two months?  I would like Deputies to consider how many proposals affecting the <Col N="924" /> rates of the farmers themselves would have been received so silently as this. They must have seen the reasonableness of the proposals, as otherwise there would have been opposition. There is a rate of 2d. under the old Technical Education Act, and more than three-halfpence of that is spent on agriculture in every county.  What we are asking is a little more than a farthing in the £ in addition for agricultural schemes.  I should say that that is fairly well realised by the county councils and that that is one of the reasons why there have not been objections to this particular scheme.  I suppose that they realise that we have not made our demands as high as have been made in other branches of education. There is a demand, for instance, under the vocational training scheme of 2d., 4d. and, in some cases, 6d. in the £, and I understand, though I was not in the House at the time, that Deputy Good and others were 100 per cent. in favour of it, yet when I looked for an increase of a little more than a ¼d. in the £ for agricultural schemes there is all this ado.  There is another point which justifies the proposal.  No matter what Deputies opposite may say, our agricultural schemes are regarded by the country as sound, and they will not be changed by local farmers, no matter what politics they profess, because they know very well that they are sound.  These schemes cost about £131,000, and we find, of that sum, £83,000 out of taxation and all that the local bodies have to find is £48,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>How much at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the present figures.  The present position is that there is more than 1½d. on an average levied for agriculture.  Obviously the increase in that £48,000 will be very little, because the increase in the rate would be round about ¼d., in some cases perhaps a little more.  £48,000 represents a rate of about 1½d.  Even a slight increase in that amount would not alter the disproportion that exists between the amount found by rates and that found by taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question has nothing to do with de-rating.  De-rating is another question <Col N="925" /> entirely.  If total de-rating is to come, then there would be the problem of finding this money in another way. The real question is whether at present these schemes are sound, and whether circumstances justify an increase of one farthing in the rate for the purposes of these schemes.  I have no doubt the Dáil by a majority will decide whether this increase is justified. Whatever doubt there may be about it, there can be no doubt about this, that the majority of the county councils of the country, who are composed to a great extent of parties differing in political views, but who are closer to the soil than we are, and who have to administer these schemes, definitely agree with the Department of Agriculture.  They have considered this fully, because it has been before them and explained in full to them for at least two months.  There has been no opposition whatever from any quarter to this scheme.</P>

      <P>For my part, I protest against the proposal in this Bill making it compulsory&mdash;compulsion all the time, compulsion in the Department of Agriculture, compulsion in the Department of Local Government, compulsion in everything, driving it down the necks of the local authorities.  When the local authorities want to do something for the people whose affairs they are administering, when they want to do something for which there is a crying demand, the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Agriculture says: &ldquo;You cannot do this. You cannot strike a rate.&rdquo;  It is the compulsion behind this that I, for one, will protest against.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the whole scheme of agricultural education is sound.  There is a very grave doubt in the minds of a number of the most advanced farmers in the country as to whether the whole system of agricultural education is sound.  Very grave doubts have been raised by a number of progressive farmers as to whether we are getting a good return for the money we are spending on agricultural education. I think everybody must admit that most of the money goes to paying teachers and very little gets down to the farmers.  Some people hold that if, instead of spending £1,000 in a county to keep several instructors going round, we divided that up and gave 20 scholarships of £50 each to provide a few years' agricultural education for farmers' sons in an agricultural college, the money would be much better spent.  The difficulty most farmers have is in the matter of their ability to read technical books.  We spend a lot of money in making experiments around the country, but these experiments could be carried on at much less cost in some central place. If a sufficient leavening of the farmers were in a position to read technical books and to take all the meat out of them, we would get ahead much more speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the particular schemes that have been approved and disapproved by the Department of Agriculture, there is a number of agricultural <Col N="927" /> committees throughout the country who think that schemes which have been turned down by the Department should have been approved.  I shall give one instance.  In Co. Louth a year ago, a scheme was adopted to give free seed wheat to small farmers. Even the Minister for Agriculture himself has said that it would be a good thing if the small farmers grew sufficient wheat for their own needs. The County Louth Committee of Agriculture had a scheme whereby they were going to give free seed wheat to farmers with a small valuation.  The Department turned that down and said that they should only spend £10 on that scheme&mdash;£10 on a scheme which the Minister will admit was a good and a sound scheme.  They refused to allow them to go on with the scheme and yet they allowed £15 for a ploughing match in the same week. I think the farmers of the country, particularly in counties like Louth, where the farmers till from 20 to 50 per cent. of their land, are fairly well educated in ploughing their land, and that the £15 spent on the ploughing match would have been much better spent in giving free seed wheat to small farmers to make them self-supporting and to guard against the necessity of buying flour and baker's bread.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the people have grave doubts in regard to a number of schemes approved of by the Department, <Col N="928" /> and by the Department I mean the Minister.  Certainly they have grave doubts as to the system of agricultural education.  Practically nothing, as the Minister admitted here the other night, has been done except to force the local people to keep up an agricultural instructor.  He is going to force them to do it and to strike a rate. These officials will be looked upon in future as the Minister's officials and the people will not have the same interest in them in future as they have had up to the present.  The Minister has been in power eight years, and nothing has been done to start agricultural education in the primary schools.  No scheme has been outlined by him for agricultural instruction in continuation or vocational schools. The whole thing has been allowed to go by the board.  If we are going to do anything in this country to put it on its feet, and if we are going to make the farmers efficient, we will have to start in the primary schools and in the vocational schools.  On some other occasion we can debate that matter more fully.  We do not approve of this section in the Bill.  We think that whatever hope there is of the agricultural instructors getting sympathetic consideration from the ratepayers, if they are forced down their throats the ratepayers of the country will look upon them with disfavour.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 56, to delete the words and brackets &ldquo;excluding any urban districts comprised therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under this section a mandatory rate of 2d. in the £ will be struck in rural areas, while the urban areas will be excluded.  I believe that under the Vocational Education Act urban areas get much more benefit than the rural areas, although the rural areas are contributing towards education in the towns.  The towns, I think, should contribute towards the agricultural scheme.  There should be a flat rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy aware that under the Vocational Education Act urban areas are burdened with a much heavier rate than that borne by the county councils?  If the Deputy turns to the Schedule of the Vocational Education Act, Part I., he will see that county boroughs and urban districts start with a compulsory rate of 3d. in the £, while in Part II. the county councils start with a compulsory rate of 1¾d., with the exception of County Cork, where the amount is 2d. in the £.  He will also see that urban authorities <Col N="931" /> can go to a maximum of 6d., while the county councils only proceed to a maximum of 4d., so that the urban authorities are bearing their share of the educational rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only a difference of 1¼d. in the rates for the urban and the rural areas.  This section is going to make a difference of 2d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum rate in the urban areas is 6d., and in the county areas 4d., showing a difference of 2d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdmondCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the representative of an urban district, I object to this amendment, because if the working of an urban authority is mixed up with that of a county council the whole system of local government will be upset owing to overlapping of Departments. In the urban district a separate rate is struck for vocational training, and a portion of the rate is contributed to the county council.  I think it is unfair to have any urban district brought into this Bill without consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that Deputy Carey is anticipating legislation when he says that he represents an urban district. In view of the fact that the rural areas are at present contributing towards vocational education, which, after all, is of far more benefit to the urban districts than it is to the rural districts, I think that the same rule should obtain here.  If we were to trace back the different Bills brought into this House from time to time, we would find that practically every one of them is in favour of the cities and the towns, while the rural areas have to contribute to the cost of them.  When the Housing Bill was brought in a short time ago, it was definitely stated by the Minister for Local Government that it was intended to benefit the boroughs and the urban districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>An awkward question for you.  At present this kind of legislation is unfair and unjust.  Since the rural areas have to contribute for the benefit of the towns, why should not the towns contribute for the benefit of the rural areas?  This clause is unjust. Up to the present, I have not seen any attempt in this House to differentiate between urban and rural areas.  If the Minister insists on this, he is going to create a very bad precedent for legislation which may come before the House later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally opposed to this amendment.  Certain urban areas have been declared vocational education areas, and they have had their own committees set up.  They are not receiving any aid from the county rates, and this amendment would operate very unfairly against them. There are areas described as &ldquo;urban areas&rdquo; in which no vocational education committees have been set up. They may derive certain advantages from the rural rate, but I do not think that these advantages are sufficiently great to justify the application of this rate to their centres.  I think that Deputy Ryan should withdraw the amendment.  I do not think that it would be well received in the urban centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the arguments, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.  As regards Deputy Good's figures, I should like to point out that the country is at a slight disadvantage.  The towns are only contributing about 1¾d. towards vocational education.  Here, you have the country paying 2d. in the £.  If you take the two charges together&mdash;the agricultural charge and the vocational education charge&mdash;the rural districts will be contributing more than the urban districts.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 22:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 58, to delete the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;one.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have a considerable amount of sympathy with the Deputies from the rural areas who have complained of the heavy burden of taxation.  I was not at all satisfied with the answer that the Minister gave&mdash;that he had written to the different county councils and that he had not received any objection from any of them to the imposition of a rate of 2d.  I am afraid that at the speed at which we are passing legislation here even the county councils cannot keep pace with us.  Under the old régime, the county councils, as the Minister has pointed out, levied a rate of 2d. in the £ for agricultural purposes and for education.  That was handed over to agricultural committees.  The agricultural committees, like all other committees, held on to the product of 1½d. and handed over only the product of ½d. for education. In fact, the Minister said that they did not hand over as much as ½d. for education.  So naturally the Deputies have complained rightly that very little has been done for education in these areas, but on the other hand very little money has been provided from these areas for the purposes of education.  We hope all that has been set right under the Vocational Bill.  Under the Vocational Bill as passed here in the agricultural areas each county council sets up a county vocational committee. Similar committees are set up in the urban areas and similar committees in the county boroughs.  That vocational education committee in the rural areas will have charge of vocational education in that particular area.  It will in addition have the administration of a considerable sum of money, for we find that under Section 2 of the Vocational Bill in the first year, that is the year commencing the 1st April, 1931, the levy in the County Cork, in which Deputy Corry is interested, though he is not here, is 2d. in the £ to start with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the other county areas the compulsory rate from the 1st April <Col N="934" /> next will be 1¾d. in the £ each year following the present year.  That rate would be increased by ¼d. in the £.  It is a mandatory rate until it reaches a maximum of 4d. in the £ in 1940.  That rate will be administered through the county vocational committee, so that consequently the amount of educational activity&mdash;those committees, I might point out, work under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education&mdash; under the jurisdiction of the county council would be very considerable in the future.  It has been, I admit, very small in the past.  When that Bill is passed that rate comes into operation. I am afraid that when these county councils with which the Minister communicated had before them this question of the imposition of a 2d. rate they were not at all clear whether that was for vocational education or for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Minister): Why do you think that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some little difficulty in keeping up with these Acts, although I am a member of the Dáil. We pass Acts so quickly that really we get out of touch with them very quickly. We must not be too burdensome on the county councils, and my proposal is to give the Minister from the county councils practically what he has at the moment.  Under this Bill he proposes that there shall be a mandatory rate under clause 32 of 2d. in the £.  As I pointed out, the Minister only gets at the moment a maximum, that is, the agricultural committees get a maximum, of 2d. from the county councils, and they hand over ½d. for the purposes of education which, of course, is not administered by the Depart ment of Agriculture.  I propose that that 2d. should be reduced to 1d.  This clause further provides that any county council which is disposed to give additional moneys for the purposes of agriculture can do so up to a further penny in the £, so that 1d. would be mandatory, and county councils who are anxious to give more can give a further penny if they so desire.  In addition to that, under sub-section (2) you have a further ½d. where the Minister has made <Col N="935" /> a forestry scheme order in respect of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The council of such county shall in every local financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the wording seems very strange.  &ldquo;Where the Minister has made a forestry scheme order in respect of a county the council of such county shall in every local financial year after the date of such order raise equally over the whole of their county (excluding any urban districts comprised therein) by means of the poor rate a sum ... equal to not more than a rate of ½d. in the £ on the rateable value of such county at the beginning of such year.&rdquo;  I am glad to hear from the Minister that that is not mandatory, because as I read the clause it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision to the effect that the scheme can only be made on the suggestion of the county council.  There must be agreement between the Minister and the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If the scheme is put into operation the rate becomes mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they agree to make the scheme, then the rate is mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>In the opening of the clause you have &ldquo;Where the Minister has made a forestry scheme order in respect of a county.&rdquo;  Then follows: &ldquo;The council of such county shall.&rdquo; However, we will leave that out of the question for the moment.  Apart from that, each county must give to the Minister for the purpose of the agricultural rate 1d. in the £ under this amendment of mine.  The clause is mandatory for 2d.  I say if the Minister gets from that 1d. he practically gets as much as he gets at the moment, and gets sufficient for the purpose.  I am satisfied when it comes to the knowledge of these local authorities that they have to strike 1d. in the coming year for the purpose of agriculture and that they have to strike, <Col N="936" /> in addition, in the coming year 1¾d. for the purpose of vocational education, all the county councils in Ireland will become vocal and will satisfy the Minister on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is right when he says the county councils did not know what they were on.  A letter was written to them, not talking of any Acts of Parliament, but, stating that the legislation under which they struck their rate was repealed and that it was intended to introduce legislation making it mandatory to strike a 2d. rate, a simple letter of that kind which could be understood by any county council. They could not be under any delusion as to what it meant.  So far as this forestry rate is concerned I do not want to get involved in a quarrel about words.  That rate is not mandatory in the real sense.  It is provided &ldquo;Where the Minister on the joint representation of the council of a county and the committee of agriculture for such county considers it desirable that steps should be taken to preserve existing woods and so on.&rdquo;  So no forestry scheme can come into operation unless the suggestion comes from the county itself.  I am afraid the position has been prejudiced by reason of the fact that a certain rate must be struck for vocational education.  I do not think that is the right way to approach this question. I take it the Dáil discussed the question of what rate should be struck for vocational education on its merits when the Bill was before them, and I suggest we should consider what rate should be struck for agriculture on its merits also, and on the history of the case there is a very strong justification for a rate of 2d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this objection to a mandatory rate of 2d. is not justified.  It is not sound enough.  I think this suggestion of a compulsory penny and a discretionary penny to follow is a sort of a suggestion to county councils that they should strike a penny and no more.  The Deputy may say that is not so.  I venture to say that I know the psychology of county councils just as well as he does, and that if you insert any provision to that effect, that <Col N="937" /> they have to strike 1d. and no more, we may assume they will strike no more.  At present they are striking 2d.</P>
    <P>There is a point that I would like to bring the attention of Deputies to. Practically all the counties but three are striking the full 2d. rate for a very long time.  They are giving 1½d. to agriculture, and they are doing all that voluntarily.  They could not strike a higher rate than 2d. under these Acts, and I think it is reasonable to suggest that if they had power to strike more than 2d. they would have done it. They did it voluntarily for a great number of years.  They gave more than 1½d. to agriculture, and at the moment you have the position that most of them are giving 2d. voluntarily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>They are giving 2d. Under my proposal 1d. would be mandatory, and they would have the option of adding another 1d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to have the whole lot voluntary than that&mdash;I am giving my own personal view&mdash;for the reason I have given, that I would be afraid it would be giving a lead to the county councils in the direction of striking a penny only.  To have a penny compulsory and another discretionary, I am afraid, would tend in time to fixing a penny as the contribution from the rates.  It would be a better position to have the 2d. discretionary, because at the moment, where there is a discretionary 2d. for agriculture and technical instruction, all counties except three are raising, and, on the average, they are paying 1½d. for agriculture.  For that reason I do not like the Deputy's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that these county councils are contributing 2d. at the moment for the purposes of agricultural education, and they will be contributing from the 1st April next 2¾.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of education and for the purposes of agriculture. Then from 1st April next, even making a penny mandatory, they will be contributing 2¾d., because there <Col N="938" /> will be 1¾d. mandatory for vocational education and 1d. for the purpose of agriculture under this Bill.  In addition, any of the county councils that so wish can give more for the purpose of agriculture up to a penny.</P>

      <P>Then is it not quite clear that there ought to be considerable opportunity given to the vocational education committees to have in their programme a scheme of agricultural education?  Will the Minister not admit that there is room in it for that in addition to any education that may be given by his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My information at present is that there seems to be some <Col N="939" /> idea in the mind of the Department, whether the Education Department or the Department of Agriculture I do not know, that agricultural education should be confined to the type of education that is provided for in the Agriculture Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be entirely contrary to the spirit of vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>So I believe.  That is why I raised it.  It seems to me that the education provided for under this Bill is quite different from the type contemplated in the Vocational Education Act, and that any educational facilities provided under this Bill should be over and above those which were contemplated in the Vocational Education Act, and that if there is provision being made it ought not to be so as to prevent the local committees from having agricultural schemes embodied in their programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, definitely, the Vocational Education Act includes agriculture.  In the next place &ldquo;the Minister may from time to time, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, by order declare that the expression technical education shall for the purposes of this Act also include instruction in such subjects bearing on or relating to agriculture as may be specified in such order.&rdquo;  So that the Vocational Education Act definitely includes agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that that more or less strengthens my suspicions, because it seems to indicate that before agriculture will be considered as a technical subject, coming under the Vocational Education Act, there must be consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, and that he must agree. In other words that it is not automatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there is a specific reservation made in the case of agriculture.  What I want to be clear on is that the provision in regard to agricultural education should <Col N="940" /> not operate in any sense to exclude vocational committees from having agriculture in their own programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The more vocational education committees take advantage of the Vocational Education Act to provide agricultural education from their funds the better I am pleased. That is our point of view, any extra agricultural education that is given so much the better.  I take it what Deputy de Valera wants to know is, is there any objection on principle or whether there is to be any education given except the education we give.  Certainly.  If there was agricultural education given in any other way and paid for under other Acts we would be only delighted, with this condition; if, for instance, there was consultation between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Agriculture in regard to a vocational education scheme for agricultural education of course the Minister for Agriculture would have certain views on any specific scheme as to whether it were sound or not, but in general the more agricultural education that is given the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I was surprised when this matter was brought to my attention.  A member of a local education committee told me that a scheme had been submitted which involved for the most part a scheme for agricultural education and that it was turned down.  The assumption was that it was turned down not on the merits of the scheme as an agricultural scheme but because it was agricultural, not because the Minister for Agriculture was not satisfied with the particular way in which the scheme for agricultural education was to be carried out, but because it had reference to agriculture.  I thought it very strange, if it were true, that the Minister meant to confine agricultural education solely to the type provided in this Bill.</P>

If a young farmer could take up books and by studying them find out how certain things could be done in the line of agriculture, that certain things could be grown under certain conditions with certain manures, etc., there would be no necessity for striking a 2d. rate and having agricultural instructors going round simply giving demonstrations to farmers of things that are contained in these books.

If a minimum number of councillors were on the county committee and one of the minimum were to resign, he would not be eligible for re-election.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the financial resolution for putting a tariff on butter.  I do not want this resolution to go through without making our position clear on the matter.  It will he remembered when the first resolution putting a prohibitive tariff on butter was moved in the House no objection was taken from these benches, because it was explained at that time that there was no reason why the price of butter should be raised.  On the second occasion when this resolution which is now being reported to the House was moved, it will be remembered that our support, or rather our failure to object, was indicated because we had not at that time sufficient particulars before us as to the effect of this particular tariff. Since then, however, we have had a full opportunity to consider the effect of the tariff on the consumer, and its advantages, so far as we can discover, to the agricultural community.  As a result we have come to the conclusion that the circumstances are not such as would warrant our support of this particular tariff, and, therefore, we propose to vote against it.  I do not wish to go into this matter at any great length, but it seems to be clear from any indications we have that those who are supposed to benefit particularly by this tariff are not in any way enthusiastic about it.  There is no shadow of doubt, however, that this tariff has placed a very great burden indeed on the consuming public.  Let us not forget, in this respect, that many farmers themselves have to purchase butter and pay a higher price for it because of this particular tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time that this motion was moved I pointed out, and it was admitted by the Minister for Agriculture that a sum of £40,000 to £45,000 would be paid directly into the revenue as a result.  That was the effect of this particular proposal, and there was no indication whatsoever that this money would go specially to the relief <Col N="954" /> of the farmers.  We have had the report of the Tariff Commission before us, and everybody has had an opportunity of examining that report since this resolution was first moved.  I think there is nobody who will say that any tariff has ever come before us for which a weaker case was made on the merits than was made for this particular tariff on butter.  On the main issue on which the tariff was claimed the case broke down.  The reason on which the Tariff Commission decided that a tariff was to be given was that it would lead to an encouragement of winter dairying, but they have given no argument to show that it will lead to an encouragement of winter dairying.  There is nothing to show that it will induce the farmer to extend or increase his winter milk supply. There is nothing to show that that is going to happen.</P>
    <P>We have had a case made that farmers will always do what pays them best.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here, because the one thing that the Minister always impresses on the House is that farmers will do what best pays them, that the farmer knows what pays best, and that you cannot very well force him to do anything else except what he knows from experience will pay him.  We had the position for a great number of years that there was a very marked difference in the price of butter as between the winter and summer time&mdash;a very marked increase.  Still the farmer did not go in for winter dairying. He would have done so on the Minister's theory if winter dairying paid him.  Now the position is that more and more it is coming to this, that owing to imports from Australia and New Zealand, where dairying is carried on under summer conditions during our winter period, the price as between summer and winter has become more equable.  The difference between winter and summer prices tends to disappear. I think it is clear to anyone who has studied the Report of the Tariff Commission that there is not sufficient inducement in this tariff to get the farmer to increase his winter milk supply or to go in for winter dairying.  I do not think that there is <Col N="955" /> sufficient inducement.  We had some remarkable statements from Senator O'Hanlon in that regard.  I think they are worthy of being quoted as the statements of a man who has some practical knowledge of this matter, knowledge which I do not personally claim to have.  Speaking in the Seanad on 18th February, Senator O'Hanlon said:</P>
    <P>The price of milk in summer&mdash;I am talking of the creameries&mdash;is anything from fourpence to fourpence-halfpenny per gallon.  In the best years it was 5½d., 6d., and 6½d., but take it that the producer is to get an extra 1½d. per gallon for his winter production, does anybody who knows anything about the subject think that he is going to do it for that? There is no man keeping cows who for the sake of an extra 1½d. per gallon is going to be induced to produce a single gallon of milk more than he is producing at present.  Even 2d. or 3d. a gallon extra would not be a sufficient inducement to him.</P>
    <P>That is how I feel about it.  What are the advantages to be gained from the heavy burden that has undoubtedly been placed on the consumers?  We had the Minister for Agriculture speaking when this resolution was moved on 22nd January last.  He said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware of this, that the imposition of this tariff now will put up the butter until the opening of the butter season by about 1d. per lb., and it will be sold round about 1/6 here.</P>
    <P>I wonder where the Minister would get butter at 1/6d. per lb., now.  It has gone up to 1/9d. and 1/10d.  On the last occasion, I said that we would want to be sure that the farmers were benefiting by this extra price which the consumers are paying.  Now we know that they are not.  There is nothing to show that they are.  We know that a very considerable burden is placed on the consuming public. Fourpence or fivepence per lb. extra for butter in a working class family is a very heavy tax indeed.  We feel that the only effect which this tax <Col N="956" /> has at present is that it is a method of increasing the revenue for the Minister for Finance.  That is what is happening.  We see no evidence, no enthusiasm, for it on the part of the farming community.  It was, I think, Deputy Nolan, himself a farmer, who said that the effect of the tax would be to feed the farmer with a considerable section of his own tail. There is no doubt about that and there is no doubt that the proposition is one which has not got the consideration that it should get from the point of view of helping the farmer.</P>
    <P>There may be a need&mdash;I am not saying that there is not&mdash;to help the farming community, and to go to the extent of doing something to encourage winter dairying, but I maintain that this is not the way to do it and that the people who are paying this heavy tax are asked to pay an undue share of whatever burden may be necessary to secure an improvement in the farmer's condition.  When I refer to the consuming community I would point out that there are many small farmers in non-dairying areas who have to pay for their butter. I do not think that it is necessary now to go into the whole question of the marketing of butter or to argue that this particular proposal was caused by circumstances arising out of the marketing of butter in this country.  The first proposal, the prohibition proposal, may have served a useful purpose, and I think it has to the extent that it prevented a panic and possibly the selling out of dairy stock which might have occurred if such measures were not taken, but on examination of this particular proposal and on weighting up the arguments for and against, it seems to me that the arguments are all against the continuance of this particular tariff and, because we feel that, we propose to vote against this motion.</P>
    <P>We spoke here before as to the necessity for some control in prices. There has been no control, not any suggestion of it, so far as this particular commodity is concerned.  It is a commodity which enters very largely into the budget of a working-class family, and if the price of butter is <Col N="957" /> made prohibitive to the ordinary working-class family they will have to turn to an inferior article, margarine. I raised the point on 22nd January, and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to what is likely to happen.  I feel that what will happen in regard to this tariff is that there will be a good deal of overholding of butter during the summer months. There is no way which I can see that that is going to be controlled, because, whatever measure of joint action prevailed up to recently, it would look, at least from the newspaper reports, as if that is going to disappear, that everyone will be on his own, and that every creamery will paddle its own canoe.  If that is so, how will the Minister, or anybody else, regulate the amount of butter to be put into cold storage and the amount to be put on the market?  I feel that there will be a tendency, not alone on the part of creameries, but on the part of business men, to overhold butter, and that will counteract any tendency there is to encourage winter dairying or to increase the production of milk in winter by the farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are either going to do it for that purpose or for the encouragement of winter dairying.  I feel that there may be no encouragement for winter dairying if overholding is allowed to continue, and it will continue, because there is no way of controlling it.  Although there has been a good deal of criticism of the I.A.C. marketing scheme, I would be glad to see, because it is essential, in my opinion, for the butter trade of the country, some scheme of combined marketing, and I believe that we are not going to make much national progress until we have some such scheme. When the I.A.C. was first brought into operation it would, in my opinion, have been much better if the Minister had taken his courage in his hands <Col N="958" /> and brought all the creameries into it because I feel that if there is anything more than another responsible for the failure of that scheme, so far as it has failed, it is the fact that others were allowed to lie out and to be encouraged, naturally, by people who were not anxious, to say the least, for the success of the combined marketing scheme.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the question of the tariff, I may say that I am depending largely on the report of the Tariff Commission itself.  As I have said, I have never read a report of the Commission in which there was a weaker case made for the imposition of a tariff than in this case.  On the main issue the application failed, and on the question of the encouragement of winter dairying there is nothing to show that this particular scheme is going to encourage it.  I would suggest to the Minister that what should be done is not to impose a tariff, but to examine the whole problem with a view to seeing what positive action might be taken in the way of subsidy, if you like, or any other way, for there may be many other ways of encouraging a better milk supply and the better marketing of all our dairy products. I submit that you are not going the right way about it by simply clapping on a tariff, by getting the consumer of butter to pay a sum of £45,000 into the Exchequer, and leaving it at that without giving a guarantee that what the consumer pays is going to the producing farmer.  There is no evidence that that is what is happening.  I am satisfied that the tariff is not warranted by the circumstances of the case, and I therefore intend to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>While we agree with Deputy O'Connell as to the unsatisfactory nature of the report presented by the Tariff Commission in regard to this matter, nevertheless we do not think that this report, which we are prepared to give effect to, any more than some of the reports which we have criticised and opposed in this House, gives a fair presentation of the case for the butter tariff.  We, like Deputy O'Connell, criticised the manner in <Col N="959" /> which this proposal was put before the House.  We know that if it had not been for the difficulties in which a certain organisation in which the Minister is interested but for which he disclaims responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though now that he has decided to bury the baby he is accepting responsibility for it, if it had not been for these difficulties, we are very doubtful whether this tariff would ever have seen the light of day.  We feel that one of the charges, one of the criticisms which can be levelled against the Government in respect of this matter is that the tariff was imposed so late in the year that the butter producers reaped little or no advantage from it, and that the only person who, at the present stage and probably since the 1st February, derived any benefit from it has been the Minister for Finance.  But the fact that the Government has been dilatory in imposing the tariff, the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has been equivocal in his support of it, does not at the same time make us close our eyes to the justice of the farmers' case.  While we admit that possibly during the next year a certain section of the farmers will reap some benefit and advantage as a result of the tariff, possibly benefits and advantages, if you like, at the expense of other sections of the community, nevertheless we think that this issue is not to be determined merely by the fact that that advantage would be derived to a certain extent at the expense of other sections.  We have got in this matter to try to look at the question entirely from a national point of view.  One of the advantages the nation has secured as a result of the tariff has been at least that £355,000 which would otherwise have gone out of the country during the past year has remained in it, to the benefit of the whole community, and that furthermore that industry, in which the Minister for Agriculture only three years ago sunk no less a sum <Col N="960" /> than something like £500,000, has been preserved from the scrap-heap.  We think that fact in itself if no other would be a justification for a tariff.  Undoubtedly if the position which existed when the tariff was first imposed had been allowed to continue, the dairying industry in this country would not have been able to stand up to the shock and would inevitably have gone down and the State as a whole would have been faced with a very much more serious problem than that with which it has to deal to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy O'Connell that the tariff in itself is not going to save the industry.  I believe that there must be a complete re-examination of the whole question.  Speaking as a layman and, of course, as one not familiar with all the details, I am not satisfied that we are going to be able to develop the dairying industry in this country much further.  I may be wrong, but I see, particularly as far as the market in Great Britain is concerned, that the production of Australian butter has been almost doubled in one year.  That butter is coming on the market now in the winter-time, and possibly because there is going to be a surplus over the requirements of that market, in due course it will be overheld to bring down our prices in the summer-time.  For that reason, unless a really serious examination of the problem is made, not at the eleventh hour as was done in the case of the tariff, we are going to be faced year after year with recurring crises in the dairying industry.  It would seem that in presenting this report the Tariff Commission laid particular stress upon the encouragement which this tariff would give to winter dairying.  I can see it giving a certain encouragement to it.  I think it is not going to encourage creameries very much at the beginning to go in for winter dairying, but I think indirectly it will stimulate the winter production of farmers' butter in this country.  I think possibly that will be the principal way in which winter dairying will increase.  I cannot see how the creameries as a whole are going to secure any benefit from the operation of this tariff or, to put it in another way, how this tariff is going to <Col N="961" /> increase the summer price for the creameries unless there is a certain amount of over-holding for the winter time.  Unless that over-holding is very judiciously carried out, unless there is just enough held over to meet the winter requirements of the home market, then inevitably what the creameries gain by over-holding from the English market in the summer, they are going to lose by having to dump it on the winter market.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil disapproves of the decision of the Executive Council accepting the recommendation of the Tariff Commission that a Customs tariff should not be imposed on fish barrels.&rdquo;&mdash;(Seán F. Lemass.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems rather strange that whenever the Tariff Commission reports, after having examined the pros and cons of a case as regards the imposition of a tariff on some commodity, the Fianna Fáil Party should automatically table a motion of this kind.  One would imagine from that that the fact that the Tariff Commission reported against the imposition of a tariff was an argument for its imposition.  There must be a thousand and one articles coming into the country free of duty about which we never have a motion such as this.  As far as this question is concerned, I would say that when the Tariff Commission reports against the imposition of a tariff on fish barrels it has, at least, very good arguments against such an imposition.  Unless stronger arguments were brought forward in favour of the imposition of a tariff, then the report of the Commission should be accepted.  No one, I think, could say that in the speeches so far made any such arguments were made. All the arguments brought forward by <Col N="962" /> Deputy Lemass and Deputy Cassidy were considered by the Tariff Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass says that the Tariff Commission were more influenced by the difficulties of the Scotch drifters and the Scotch curers than they were by the difficulties of the Free State curers or the Free State barrel manufacturers. I do not think so for a moment.  I think their chief concern, and rightly so, was for the working fishermen, because they are the basis of our fishing industry.  Any proposal that would have the effect of putting them in a less favourable position than they are in at present would be ridiculous. At present their position is very far from being good.  Anything that would increase the cost to them of putting their catches on the market would be reflected in the prices they would get.  There was undoubtedly, as was pointed out, an assurance given by some of the principal firms engaged in barrel-making that the imposition of this 33? per cent. tariff would not be followed by any increase in the price of the barrel.  At first sight it is hard to see how that could be, but, assuming that it is so, the fisherman's lot would still be disimproved because of the peculiar circumstances prevailing in the fishing industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that the herring curing in this country is already in the hands of non-Saorstát curing firms.  That, of course, is an unfortunate position, but we must face up to the fact that it is so.  No one has suggested that it would be desirable to drive them away.  They have a very considerable value under present circumstances.  They are of value not only to the fishermen but to the particular port to which they come.  We are more concerned with their value to the fishermen.  They are undoubtedly welcomed by the fishermen because of the fact that they create a considerable market in the port to which they come and there are, therefore, competitive prices for the fishermen's catches.  They have a value which is of a lesser kind also to the fisherman in that large fleets of boats more easily locate shoals of herrings than a small number of boats could.  When <Col N="963" /> any portion of the fleet locates a shoal the word is passed round and everyone avails of the fact that a shoal has been struck.  Their value to the port is due to the local earnings provided for gutters, cleaners, carters, hotel keepers, and so on.  It has been suggested that this tariff would not, in fact, drive out these Scotch and English curers.  I am afraid that if that were to be acted on it would be taking an undue risk.  The fact is that the margin of difference which influences these curers to operate in the Saorstát as against operating elsewhere is very small.  When the shoals move, say, thirty or forty miles from the Saorstát coast it would be just as economical for them to operate from Oban as from Donegal or from the Welsh coast as far as Howth is concerned. The fact that they will get cheaper coal there would make it more economical for them.  The present position of the herring curing industry is fairly precarious.  The fact is that at the moment there are over 200,000 barrels of the last curing still unsold at Yarmouth and Lowestoft.  It is estimated that the curers have been working on a net profit of about 1/6 or 2/-a barrel.  I believe that is so.  That would leave no margin for a tariff of this kind.  Either it would wipe out the profit or it would lower the price that the fisherman would get for his catch.  The position across Channel as regards herring curing is so bad that it is suggested that the close season this year should be extended to a period later than has ever been adopted before.  In the &ldquo;Fishing News&rdquo; dated February 7th, the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A Scottish herring crisis of the first magnitude is foreshadowed regarding the summer herring fishing. From current talk in fishing circles on the Moray Firth coast, the conclusion seems to be inevitable that unless, in some at present unexpected form, a market be found outside the usual Continental channels for 30 to 40 thousand barrels of Yarmouth-cured herring, it will be necessary to postpone the opening date of the summer fishing to an <Col N="964" /> unheard-of late date, perhaps even to July 1.  The summer close time ended last year on June 10, and the latest date previously has been June 23; but, should the opening be set back as far as indicated, the hardship to fishermen will be extremely serious.  Indeed, already many herring fishermen are dependent on relief works, and there are hundreds in distress for whom work cannot be found.</P>
    <P>That is the present position as far as herring fishing is concerned, and I think we should be extremely careful not to do anything that would worsen that already serious position.</P>
    <P>The mackerel curing in this country is in a different position to herring-fishing, in that it is entirely in the hands of Saorstát curers.  I was rather amused at the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, on finding that one of the principal opponents of the tariff was a mackerel-curer from Kerry who is a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, whereas two of the supporters of the application from Kerry were supporters of the Government.  The mackerel-curing industry is already in a very critical position.  Up to 25 years ago the United States of America could easily absorb about 100,000 barrels of mackerel.  To-day there is great difficulty in disposing of 20,000 barrels there.  There are various reasons for that.  One reason is that after the war the Americans themselves concentrated a great deal on fishing.  Many of the boats that came off war service were converted to that use.  A good deal of mackerel is now caught off the American coast.  A difference also is noticeable in the taste of the people, very possibly due to the fact that better transit and better methods of cold storage have made fish of a different type available for them, and that they prefer it to the salt fish which they formerly consumed.</P>
    <P>At any rate the position in the mackerel business at the moment is pretty bad.  A considerable quantity of mackerel cured last autumn is still in the hands of the curers here.  Many have realised their stocks at a loss. <Col N="965" /> If we do anything that would increase the cost to the curers here, I think it would hasten the tendency that seems to prevail of cutting out the cured mackerel trade altogether. Much as one would like, and I would like barrel-making to continue and to thrive here, still it would be rather a useless business to do that at the expense of the fishermen, because eventually the fishermen would go and, of course, barrel-making would go with them.  I think the report is a very good one.  The Tariff Commission went to very considerable trouble to find out the whole position of the industry, they examined all the implications of a tariff very thoroughly, and I think the report should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the Government decided to justify in the Dáil their acceptance of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in relation to the application of the fish barrel manufacturers.  The manufacture of fish barrels is a very minor industry in this State and under any circumstances would not give a considerable amount of employment. The anxiety therefore of members of the Cabinet to explain their reasons for permitting that industry to die out is in startling contrast to their silent vote on the much more important report from the Tariff Commission concerning the coach-building industry.  I wonder is the explanation of the different attitude of the Government in this matter due to the fact that they think they have a case capable of examination in relation to fish barrels which they had not got in relation to the coach-building industry. Even though the Minister for Fisheries did think fit to explain the reasons which prompted the Government to accept the Tariff Commission's recommendation, I do not think he has given us a very convincing explanation.  He assumed that members of Fianna Fáil came naturally to the conclusion that anything the Tariff Commission did was wrong, and that the best case that could be made for any application that came before it was the fact that the Tariff Commission recommended against it.  Judging from the experience <Col N="966" /> of the reports which we have had from the Tariff Commission I think that would be a very safe method of deciding a Party's attitude, because, as I said in moving the motion, the attitude of the Tariff Commission is this: that the small market and other circumstances existing in this country make it impossible for any industry here to develop the same standard of efficiency that they find in England, and that therefore the whole case for the protection of such industry by tariffs falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>They have most decidedly a wrong outlook in these matters, and we have found that in every case in which they recommended against a tariff they recommended against it on grounds which anybody with a different outlook would have considered the strongest grounds in its favour.  The same thing applies here.  The fish barrel-making industry in the Free State is at present in a very weak condition because, as I pointed out, it is only supplying a very small percentage of the total demand for fish barrels.  It is capable of supplying our entire demand.  Its productive capacity is such that it could supply all the barrels required in the fish-curing business in this country, and the contention is that if it was given the entire market it would be able to supply these barrels at prices much lower than it is now in a position to do, because, of course, the overhead charges per unit would be decreased as production increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries laid particular stress on the position of the fishermen.  We are also particularly concerned about the fishermen, and if we thought that action along lines suggested in this motion would prejudice in any way the precarious position of Irish fishermen we would be very slow to take it.  But the Minister did not show us that the imposition of this tariff would, in fact, prejudice them in any way.  In relation to the herring fishing, he is accepting the statements made by representatives of the Scotch drifters, the Scotch curers, and the Six County barrel manufacturers on their behalf, that <Col N="967" /> the imposition of a tariff would result in Scotch curers vacating Free State ports.  I am satisfied&mdash;and I have discussed this matter with a number of people concerned in the curing industry, who are also satisfied&mdash;that that was only bluff, put up by these Scotch curers and Scotch fishermen on behalf of their friends in the Six Counties. There is a very large importation of fish barrels into the Free State from the Six Counties, and if the Government were not prepared to do anything else except to ensure the substitution by home production of these barrels, they would be giving a very considerable advantage to Free State cooperages.</P>
    <P>The Scotch curers enlarged upon the difficulties that arose out of the fact that many of them were barrel manufacturers as well as being curers.  I explained in moving the motion that it is essential for a curer to have in his service skilled coopers.  The Scotch curers, in order to ensure that they will always have at their command skilled coopers, keep them in continuous employment, using them in the production of barrels which are stored until the commencement of the fishing season. The Free State curers cannot do that. At present they are able to secure the services of skilled coopers from the Free State cooperages.  If those disappear, as it seems inevitable they will if this tariff is refused, the Irish curers will not be able to carry on, and we are facing the question of whether we want to see fish-curing develop in this country under Scotch or under Free State control.  If we decide to reject this motion then we are definitely deciding that the Scotch curer is to triumph, because its rejection will mean the inevitable disappearance of the Free State curer.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, necessary to point out that the Free State curers are rather an important body and do control a considerable proportion of our trade in cured fish.  The Scotch people undoubtedly predominate in such ports as Buncrana, but in other ports such as Dungloe, Burtonport and Kincasslagh, and other places of that kind, there are, I think, no Scotch curers at <Col N="968" /> all.  There is, perhaps, one at Burtonport, but the curing business in those places is in the hands of Free State curers, many of whom are very strong supporters of this application for the tariff.  I do not believe, in any case, that the imposition of this tariff will result in the Scotch curers leaving our ports.  In fact, I have seen letters written by some of these Scotch curers stating that if they could be satisfied that they would have at their disposal a regular supply of barrels produced in the Free State at prices which they consider satisfactory they would not import any barrels.</P>
    <P>The whole question centres around price.  At present the price of the barrel produced in Free State cooperages is higher than the price at which imported barrels can be obtained.  That is due to two causes: first, they are a better barrel, and, secondly, cooperages are working only up to a very small part of their capacity.  The difficulties of the mackerel-curers in recent years have been accentuated by the fact that many of them were induced to use Norwegian barrels in consequence of the low price at which they were offered, and did not find out until too late how inferior these were.  A number of mackerel-curers were involved in a considerable loss through the use of defective barrels, and they will not buy Norwegian barrels now at any price.</P>
    <P>The herring-curing business is a particularly risky one.  It is no argument for the Minister to say that at the present moment the industry is finding it difficult to dispose of its products.  A different situation undoubtedly may exist next year.  A different situation existed a couple of years ago.  The business is very largely a gamble, and those engaged in it endeavour to set off the losses of one period against the profits of another.  The practice is, as I pointed out, to sell the fish by auction, and those who are selling it cannot be certain of the price they are going to get for it until the auction has been completed.</P>
    <P>Our concern for the Scotch curers and the Scotch fishermen is in very remarkable contrast with the attitude <Col N="969" /> of those Scotch people in their own country.  Not very long ago a cargo of Norwegian barrels arrived at a Scotch fishing port, but the workers on the quay refused to unload them, and the fish-curers refused to handle them.  The cargo had to be taken back to Norway.  If that attitude is considered praiseworthy in Scotland, why is it not considered praiseworthy here? We are in the position that it is not necessary for us to import these barrels. We are in the position of being able to supply more than our requirements. In that connection I would like to deal with the only argument of any importance raised by Deputy Myles. He referred to the fact that the principal Free State cooperage was in Dublin, and maintained that the cost of transporting the barrels from Dublin to the fishing ports in Donegal must be very considerable.  In fact, he said that the carriage alone on Dublin-made barrels would be worse than any tariff.  Deputy Myles's contention is, however, in conflict with the report of the Tariff Commission.  On page 17, paragraph 29, the Commission say: &ldquo;Though the principal Saorstát cooperage, engaged in the making of fish-barrels, is situated in Dublin and is, therefore, relatively remote from the chief Saorstát curing stations, we are satisfied, as a result of our investigations, that the effect of freight on barrels is considerably in favour of the home manufacturers as against their Scottish and Norwegian competitors.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no word about Donegal in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, that particular statement of the Tariff Commission is made in relation to the price at which Saorstát barrels could be obtained at Donegal ports.  That situation arises out of the fact that cooperages have been able to make particularly favourable terms with the railway companies for the transportation of barrels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that I want to emphasise was not mentioned by the Minister for Fisheries at all.  He is engaged in his capacity as Minister for <Col N="970" /> Fisheries in endeavouring to get people trained as apprentices in cooperages.  In fact, I think that he himself took some part in the movement for the establishment of cooperages in this country in 1924, a year in which, in consequence of heavy catches, there was a considerable scarcity of barrels.  A number of Saorstát curers were unable to get barrels in that year, although they were willing to pay, and did in fact pay, 14/- and 15/- for them.  A situation may easily arise again in which because of the disappearance of the cooperages here the curers in the Free State will not be able to secure barrels to enable them to conduct their business.  They will be dependent upon the surplus stocks available in Scotland and England.  If there are no surplus stocks then they will have to go out of the trade.  The cooperages now existing in the Free State were started in 1924 by people interested in the curing business who wanted to be in a position to have a regular supply of barrels at their command in all circumstances.  The curers were also, of course, interested in having the services of coopers at their command.  That is the concern also, I take it, of the Department of Fisheries. Is the Minister for Fisheries satisfied in the event of this tariff being denied that there will always be at the command of the fish-curers a certain supply of barrels and the services of skilled coopers?  If there is not that certain supply of barrels and the services of skilled coopers available I think the Irish fish-curers will also in time disappear.</P>
    <P>I think these are the main points that I want to deal with.  I do not want to waste the time of the House in this matter.  I put down the motion, as I explained, because I think it was right that the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing every report of the Tariff Commission.  I think it is a defect in the Tariff Commission Act that no machinery is provided for bringing to the Dáil reports either unfavourable to tariffs or not acted upon by the Government.  I hope that if the Tariff Commission Act is being revised at any time that defect will be remedied, but until it is remedied <Col N="971" /> I hope I, or some other private Deputy, will continue to produce <Col N="972" /> motions of this kind to ensure that every such report will be discussed.</P>

      <P>Two distinct questions arise.  First, there is the question put by Deputy de Valera: when a motion is on the Order Paper, can it be moved by another Deputy in the absence of the Deputy in whose name the motion stands?  Standing Order 40 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a Deputy does not move the motion which stands in his name such motion shall lapse unless moved by some other Deputy authorised by him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the point, I think, that Deputy Law made.  The question as to what constitutes authority would have to be decided, in each particular case, by the Chair.  There is no question, at present, of any authority having been given.</P>

      <P>That is not the point of order.  At any rate there must be authority from the Deputy who put the motion down and that, of course, must be conveyed to the Chair by some method.  Deputy de Valera asked another question which <Col N="977" /> was: Did not the withdrawal of a motion require leave?  A motion cannot be withdrawn until it is actually moved and seconded, and the question proposed from the Chair.  Then it is necessary to get the leave of the House to withdraw it.  The motion here&mdash;No. 21 on the Order Paper&mdash;is not, in fact, before the House at all.  It is merely a notice on the Order Paper, and the Standing Order is clear.  The only precedent I have in mind or to my hand at the moment is that in the absence of the Deputy tabling the motion another Deputy can, by arrangement, move the motion for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am under no misapprehension about the difference between being on the Order Paper and being moved as a motion.  What I suggest is that the same principle ought to apply.  There is a certain reason obviously for that rule because Deputies who are interested in the motion and supporting it may not be prepared to allow the matter to lapse.  Here is a matter in which a number of us are interested.  The fact that it is here in one Deputy's name means that we could not put down a motion of the same kind.  This matter has come before the House and I submit that the Standing Order while it refers specifically to a case where authorisation is given, does not preclude the House from dealing with cases that are not mentioned there. It is not a prohibition.  The Standing Order does not run on this line &mdash;&ldquo;no motion shall be taken or shall be moved except by the authority.&rdquo;  It simply indicates that if these conditions are fulfilled the motion will come forward but it does not say that it cannot come forward in other circumstances as well.  I think that it is a very serious matter to have a motion of this sort down and, then, to find that it is allowed to lapse because the member in whose name it stands does not move it.  It is put down to the end of the Order Paper. Then when the time comes again for it to be moved the same Deputy may absent himself.  I think it is a very bad procedure to permit that.</P>

      <P>It is a complete misapprehension to say that this motion is before the House.  It is not.  This motion cannot come before the House until somebody moves it.  Under the terms of the Standing Order nobody can move it without authorisation from the Deputy in whose name it stands.  While, if desired, it goes to the end of the Order paper now, any Deputy who is afraid the occurrence will be repeated has open to him certain steps which will make a repetition impossible.

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the discontent prevalent amongst the lower grades in the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should set up a Commission of Enquiry to investigate and report on the present method of computation of the cost-of-living bonus and its application to civil servants' salaries and wages.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any subject about which there has been so much misconception, and in many cases misrepresentation, as there has been in regard to the so-called or the mis-named bonus paid to civil servants.  This ignorance is not confined to the ordinary man in the street, and on occasions it is made very manifest and evident at public boards.  We have on occasions noted in the Press that many members of public boards have worked <Col N="979" /> themselves almost into a frenzy at the mere suggestion of the words &ldquo;cost-of-living bonus.&rdquo;  This frenzy becomes more intensified when they hear of this cost-of-living bonus being applied to civil servants.  To those who are not familiar with the system the word bonus suggests something for nothing &mdash;a free gift, something suggestive of a gift of money paid at the end of a successful year by some public company. It suggests to them the case of a company which, after having paid the usual dividends, is enabled to add to the dividend something in the nature of a large bonus.  That this is not so in so far as it relates to the Civil Service I shall proceed to demonstrate, in the hope that if there are any members of the House who in any way share the opinion of the type of persons I have mentioned, I shall be able to dissipate, in some measure, these views and enlist them on the side of the lower paid servants in the Free State.</P>
    <P>The claim for the cessation of cuts in the cost-of-living bonus has been the subject of much correspondence between the associations representing the various grades of civil servants and the Minister for Finance.  This correspondence has extended over a very long period.  The civil servants, particularly those in the lower grades, now claim that there should be a cessation of the cuts, pending an inquiry into the method of their application. That, on the face of it, is, I say, a reasonable suggestion.  They ask that these cuts shall cease until such time as the Minister and his Department have inquired into the whole method of applying the bonus.  I do not propose, as is customary on these occasions, to give anything in the nature of a history of the events that led up to the establishment of the cost-of-living bonus.  But it would be just as well to recall to the House that this cost-of-living bonus, as applied to civil servants' salaries, came into operation in 1920 as a means of partially compensating civil servants for the increase in the cost during an abnormal period.</P>
    <P>All of us who have lived through <Col N="980" /> that period will, I feel sure, agree that it was an abnormal period. Most of the Deputies, too, will agree that at that particular period many of those civil servants were very badly paid, particularly those in the lower grades.  It was recognised then, and it is recognised now by every fair-minded person in the Free State, that the lower grades of the Civil Service then were inadequately remunerated. I have had a fairly long association with at least two branches of the Civil Service.  I have been in contact with them for the greater part of my life.  I do know, particularly in the Post Office, that many of those civil servants of the lower grades had to supplement their ordinary wages by means of overtime. The only way by which the civil servant who was a married man with a family could manage to make ends meet was by thus supplementing his ordinary wages.  As a matter of fact he was willy-nilly compelled to work overtime.  There was a fairly good scale for overtime paid to him and this it was which enabled him to keep his head above water.  As a result of changes made that avenue of revenue is cut away from him.  I do not believe that many of the officials in the Civil Service think that overtime should be worked, if it could be avoided.  But I want to make it clear that those men worked inordinately long hours in order to maintain themselves and their families in reasonably decent comfort.</P>
    <P>I have stated that this cost-of-living bonus was established in 1920 owing to the abnormal conditions then and the very high cost of commodities, particularly of the necessaries of life. Even then there was some injustice.  I do not want to harp back on the injustice then.  I prefer to deal with the hardships and injustice of the present. At the present moment the bonus is only paid in full on the first £91 5s. of salary.  The next £108 15s. per annum gets only 46 per cent. of the bonus.  A salary above £200 gets only a bonus to the extent of 35 per cent. It will be seen that the greater hardship falls on the lower paid civil servants, <Col N="981" /> a state of affairs which I hope that this House will remedy in as short a space of time as it possibly can by giving the necessary support to my motion.  Without wanting to delay the House unnecessarily I may say that I feel the terms of my motion make it almost imperative that the Minister should not make this a vote of no confidence or a vote of confidence, but that he should use his influence with his Party to let us have a free vote of the House.  I would not take it as a triumph if this motion goes through.  Rather would I look upon it as an awakening of conscience on the part of certain members of the Government, notably in the case of the Minister for Finance, an awakening intensified.</P>
    <P>It is not admitted by any of those persons affected, the persons for whom I am pleading, that the index figure is a true indication of the civil servants' cost of living.  Even granting that that is so, I submit, and the civil servants of the lower grades&mdash;in fact, of all grades&mdash;submit, that the present method of application to salaries does not fully compensate for the increase over the pre-war cost of living.  We all know that the largest single item of expenditure in every household is rent.  That is particularly true in the case of the married man.  In the case of the single man the largest expenditure is for board and lodging.  I speak for Cork City and I can also speak for Dublin, though I do admit that I do not know the conditions in Dublin as well as I know them in Cork; but at the same time I can speak with some authority. I think the view will be shared by every Deputy here that so far as these items are concerned the cost of housing or rent in the case of the married man with a family, and the cost of board and lodging to the single man, have not changed within the last decade or so except in so far as the figures have gone up somewhat. I know that is true of Cork and I am sure it is equally true of Dublin.  I know of rentals in Dublin which have been nearly doubled within the last couple of years and <Col N="982" /> I know of rentals in Cork that have nearly quadrupled in the same period.</P>
    <P>It is contended, and with a good deal of truth, that so far as the Civil Service organisation is concerned, before the last cut came into operation in September, 1930, the time had arrived when the already inadequate remuneration of the vast majority of these employees had reached a point below which there could not be any reduction without inflicting a very grave hardship and causing further and more widespread discontent amongst a very deserving body of civil servants.  In recognition of this we have the action of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer when he agreed last year to suspend the reduction in bonus when the British figure fell from 70 to 65.  I want Deputies to mark and digest what follows.  The Chancellor agreed to regard the figure as 65 for bonus purposes when it had actually fallen to 60, notwithstanding that the economic conditions as we all know are not so very rosy at the moment in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have shown that in consequence of the method of computing the bonus of civil servants from the index figure the lower grades suffer in a greater degree than those in the higher paid branches.  The main complaint of the staff with regard to the cost of living bonus machinery is that with their low pre-war wages the cost of living bonus does not provide them with an adequate wage in view of the responsibility of the work and the prevailing high cost of living.  The primary purpose of the cost of living bonus was to insure that so far as these officials were concerned their positions should not be changed or at least not worsened because of the fluctuations in the index figure. However, we find in practice that it has had very serious results in so far as it relates to the salaries of the lower paid civil servants.</P>
    <P>Under the present system of applying the cost-of-living bonus to basic wages, I will illustrate what occurs to a postman in Cork, Dublin, Waterford or Limerick.  I will deal with some of the other lower-paid branches at a later period.  Under the present system <Col N="983" /> of applying the cost-of-living bonus to basic wages, a postman in Dublin at his maximum wages receives 66/2 per week, and the earliest possible age at which he can receive this wage is 31 years.  A postman at Cork at his maximum rate of wages receives only 62/2 at 30 years of age, and a postman at Waterford can receive a maximum wage of only 57/10 at 30 years of age.  A Grade B post Office clerk at Dublin receives £4 13s. 11d. at his maximum, and the earliest age at which he can receive that wage is 35 years.  In Cork a similar officer receives £4 0s. 6d. at his maximum, obtainable at 34 years.  At Waterford such an officer would receive £3 18s. 1d. at his maximum at 33 years.  I will give you an example of how the cost-of-living bonus is applied to some of these grades.  I will quote only two cases.  I have a table here which gives you the minimum, the mean and the maximum in each case.  I will content myself with the minimum and the maximum.  In Dublin a postman receives a minimum wage of 34/- There is for the cost of living a 70 per cent. increase.  The mean is 51/- and the maximum 66/2. A Post Office clerk, Grade B (male), receives a minimum of 30/8, a mean of 65/6, and a maximum of 93/11.  I submit that the maximum wages in all cases are low, having regard to the responsibilities and the very onerous duties these men have to perform.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any further comment upon that matter.  I could do so if I wished, but perhaps it might be misconstrued here.  At any rate, I believe that it does not tend towards good, efficient, or honest service that such low maximum rates should obtain in this country.  A case was made by the British Treasury for limiting the amount of the cost of living bonus on basic wages in excess of 35/- a week when the index figure was 130.  I would like Deputies to grasp the position fully, because this is a matter on which, apparently, there is a good deal of misunderstanding.  Usually when these things are seen in the newspapers in a tabulated form very few people take the trouble to make any <Col N="984" /> analysis of the figures.  A case was made by the British Treasury for limiting the amount of the cost of living bonus on basic wages in excess of 35/- a week with the index figure at 130.  Having regard to the fact that the index figure is now about 70, you will quite understand the position now as compared with the time when the index figure was 130.  There appeared to be no logical reason at that time for a limitation, and there can be no possible reason advanced for the limitation to-day when the index figure has fallen to 70.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how an officer on a pre-war wage of 50/- which, with the cost of living bonus added, means 79/5, has a margin over and above his ordinary expenses; yet the illustration of the payment of the full bonus on basic wages of 35/- a week does make that untenable suggestion. The present position of most of these Post Office workers is that they are financially much worse off than they were in 1914.  What I say now applies not alone to the staff of the Post Office, but to every other branch of the Civil Service.  The staff claim that their present financial position is such that they are hardly able to bear any further reduction in the cost of living bonus in view of the high cost of living.  It will, of course, be readily admitted that the application of this cut is a greater hardship on lower paid servants than in the higher grades.  As I have indicated, this cost of living bonus machinery was devised to meet war-time conditions.  As time went on it was found that that machinery was becoming obsolete and, consequently, ineffective.  A rather unfortunate thing, in my view, is that our Government did not see fit to emulate the example of the Government across the Channel, which set up Whitley Councils to deal with Civil Service matters. The Minister may reply that a certain council was set up here.  I think he called it a representative council.  That council was set up by our Government to deal with such cases, but I do know that even the departments in the Civil Service which are represented on that council, and whose representatives attended its meetings from time to <Col N="985" /> time and had conferences with the Minister, are not satisfied with the machinery.  I also know that representations have been made to the Minister to discuss the whole position of the service.</P>
    <P>On the 23rd October, 1929, the Minister for Finance was requested to receive a deputation from the Cost-of-Living Bonus Joint Committee.  That request was refused.  Further correspondence ensued without any result, and an appeal was addressed to the President in July, 1930.  The President, as we all know, was then rather unwell and was recuperating in the country, but the appeal was forwarded to the Minister for Finance, again without any result.  In consequence of the refusal of the Minister to meet a deputation from the Civil Service organisations, representations were made to members of the Oireachtas.  I shall mention their names, as I want to show how catholic in taste civil servants are, and how they do not discriminate between one Party and another.  They went to such people as Deputy P.S. Doyle, Deputy Lemass, Deputy G. Boland, Deputy T.J. O'Connell, Deputy Dr. Hennessy, and Senator Thomas Johnson.  These gentlemen, all members of the Oireachtas, waited on the Acting Minister for Finance on Thursday, 28th August, 1930, for the purpose of advocating the suspension of a further cut pending inquiry, but the Acting Minister for Finance was not prepared either to suspend the impending cut or to promise an inquiry.</P>
    <P>While it was very good of those members of the Oireachtas to take up the cudgels for the Civil Service organisations, at the same time I feel, and I know that a good many Deputies of all Parties with whom I have discussed this matter also feel, that these organisations should have been heard and their case considered by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance in this country is no more, and I suggest no less, than the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, and when the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain is prepared to receive representatives of the civil servants, either through the <Col N="986" /> Whitley Council or some other organised method of expression which civil servants have, I do not see why the Minister for Finance of this State should not do likewise.  I do not suggest that he should imitate everything that people do on the other side.  I do not say that there are any great differences in practice here as compared with the Civil Service across-Channel where they have an older and longer tradition of service, so far as it relates, at any rate, to the staffs about whom I speak.</P>
    <P>I have said that the cost-of-living bonus machinery was devised to meet war-time conditions.  Whilst it may, perhaps, have met those conditions in so far as they related to 1920 and some of the succeeding years, it is generally felt that its application now over a period of eleven years has shown that it is merely an instrument for inflicting grave hardships on a very deserving body of civil servants, greater hardships, in fact, than have been inflicted by private employers on their employees.  I will give a concrete case which has been brought under my notice where a member of one branch of the Civil Service, who had to submit to the cut brought about by the operation of the index figure in this country and whose combined wage, that is to say, pre-war wage and bonus, amounted to £5 1s. 6d. per week in March, 1921, has now had his weekly pay reduced to £3 6s. 1d., a loss per week of 35/5.  I think that any fair-minded Deputy will readily concede that that is not a fair, adequate, or proper wage to offer to any civil servant in this country, all the time having regard to the responsibility of his office and to the fact that too much temptation must not be put in the way of persons who are charged with heavy responsibility. Surely the Minister for Finance will not contend that any member of this community who has to shoulder such responsibility as I have just mentioned, an employment which necessitates trustworthiness, probity and honesty, could maintain a decent standard of living, particularly if he be a married man, on 35/5 per week less in 1931 than he had in 1921.  I would <Col N="987" /> like when the Minister is replying if he would try to solve that riddle for me.  It would be quite interesting to the persons concerned who have to try and live now on a considerably reduced wage while the cost of living <Col N="988" /> has not been reduced in proportion to that wage.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
