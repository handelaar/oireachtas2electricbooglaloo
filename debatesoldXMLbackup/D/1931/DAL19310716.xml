      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that great hardship is at present being experienced by many men and their dependants in the Raphoe (County Donegal) area, due to a prolonged period of unemployment; and whether he will arrange for relief work to be commenced in that district in order to provide much-needed assistance.</P>

      <P>I have no information bearing on the suggestion conveyed in the first part of this question.  With regard to the second part, I may say that approximately £17,000 has already been allocated for expenditure on relief works in Donegal by the various Departments responsible for the supervision of expenditure from the Relief Schemes Vote.  In addition, a sum of £4,200 has been allocated from the Road Improvement Grant for expenditure in the Raphoe area, and this work is at present in progress.  I regret that I cannot make any provision for further relief works in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <P>I must refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy Killilea on the 25th March last, in connection with the joint scheme for the Dalgan and Sinking rivers in Counties Mayo and Galway, which was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Commissioners of Public Works have had the Dalgan and Sinking rivers district inspected by an engineer.  On consideration of the engineer's report they wrote to the Galway County Council regarding the effect which a drainage scheme for the district would have on the lower reaches of the Clare-Dalgan river, especially in the Dunmore drainage district, and pending a reply have postponed the detailed investigation of the proposal.  In any event, until a drainage scheme has been prepared and submitted to the votes of the occupiers of affected lands, it will not be possible to state when, if at all, drainage works are likely to start in the district.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A copy of the Commissioners' letter to the County Council was sent to each Deputy from County Galway, on the 21st instant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are in communication with the Galway County Council relative to a petition in respect of the existing Dunmore drainage district, which has been presented to them.  The County Council have not yet fulfilled the requirements of the Act in regard to the petition. When they do so, the Commissioners must complete detailed inspections of the rivers in the two counties, Galway and Mayo, and these investigations will occupy a considerable time.  There <Col N="2167" /> is no likelihood that the works can be begun in the near future.</P>

      <P>My Department has been advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that, on the 1st April, 1931, the total amount of grants for school building purposes which had been notified to them, and which have not yet been discharged, amounted to £160,524.</P>
      <P>The compilation of the returns asked for in the remaining portion of the question requires some time.  I will communicate the information to the Deputy when it is available.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have also intimated to my Department that the total amount, on their Vote, for the building and improvement of National Schools for the financial year ended the 31st March and for each of the three previous financial years, was fully expended.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the reply to the previous question, the amount of grants sanctioned by my Department prior to 31st March, 1931, which have not yet been expended is considerably in excess of the amount appearing on the Vote for Public <Col N="2168" /> Works and Buildings to make provision for the building and improvement of schools in the current financial year. Consequently, no further additional grants for the building of new schools or the improvement of existing schools have been sanctioned by my Department since 31st March, 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state (a) how the Council of Trustees to the National Library of Ireland is appointed; (b) if any society, body or organisation has the right to elect trustees; and, if so, to what number; and further, will he state if he is satisfied with the present method of election, or is it his intention to make any change in the method, and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The Council of Trustees of the National Library is appointed in accordance with the provisions of clause 15 of the agreement made on the 1st March, 1881, between the Science and Art Department, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Royal Dublin Society.  (b) The agreement provided that &ldquo;The National Library shall be under the superintendence of a Council of twelve trustees, eight of whom shall be appointed by the Society and four by the Department....&rdquo; Under this provision eight members of the Council are appointed annually in December by the Society.  Vacancies occurring in the Government representation on the Council are filled by the Minister for Education, with the approval of the Executive Council.  (c) The National Library of Ireland was formerly under the control of the Royal Dublin Society, and the arrangement whereby the Society appoints eight of the twelve trustees of the Library was a condition of the transfer of the institution to the State.  The agreement providing for this representation of the Society on the Council of Trustees was made under Section 16 of the &ldquo;Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not intend to seek authority to make any change in the method of election, nor does it seem necessary or desirable to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Proinnsias O Fathaigh Proinnsias O Fathaigh">
      <NameTxt>Proinnsias O Fathaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware of the fact that there are in Saorstát Eireann two hundred Múinteoirí Gaedhilge, of whom the great majority are anxious to attend courses of instruction designed to fit them to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish, and will the Minister state (a) what steps he proposes to take to enable these teachers to acquire fuller qualifications for posts under the new scheme of Vocational Education; and (b) to what extent non-attendance at the course now provided in Cork for forty of their number will prejudice the chances of continued employment for those not fortunate enough to be called to the said course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A course is at present being held, with a view to provide for whole-time Irish teachers training in the teaching of subjects other than Irish in a continuation school programme.  To this course 40 whole-time teachers have been summoned.  The course is to some extent experimental.  The organisation of further similar courses will depend on the results shown, and on the fitness of the remaining teachers to profit to the required extent from such additional training.  I may also mention that courses of the kind suggested must be held during the holiday season and are difficult to organise; they call for the services of persons of very special qualities and exceptional qualifications as instructors and these are not always available at holiday times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the course being, as already stated, to provide training in other subjects of a continuation school programme, I see no reason why this effort to extend the qualifications <Col N="2170" /> of a certain number of Irish teachers should imperil the position of the remainder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is the intention to have further courses of a similar nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that, apart from the difficulty of organising the courses, that depends principally on two considerations: (1) the success with which the present experiment meets and (2) how far the individual whole-time teachers who have not been called are capable of receiving instruction to fit them for teaching another subject.  A number of them may be quite good as teachers of Irish, but may be too old to learn another subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to &ldquo;whole-time teachers,&rdquo; which is more or less a technical term.  There are teachers whose whole-time occupation is the teaching of Irish, but who are not reckoned as whole-time teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as stated by the Deputy in some respects. That is why I did not give my assent to the number 200, one way or another.  If you took whole-time teachers, there would be somewhere about 106.  If you took teachers of Irish of all kinds there would be over 300.  That is why I did not refer to the 200 that the Deputy mentioned in his question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information available to my valuers the damage done on the land was confined to part of one acre.  Three poles only were erected on it, two of them near the boundary ditches.  The amount <Col N="2171" /> offered as compensation was £1 in respect of poles and for damage to crops £3, a figure in strict accordance with the compensation generally accepted in similar cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Killilea, who is ill, I would like to ask the Minister if he is aware that Flynn was offered 30s. when an estimate was being made.  Later on he was offered £4.  Is the Minister aware that this man's land, to the extent of eight acres, was so badly destroyed that he could not get any crop out of it; that in fact the Department of Agriculture which had given him special seeds to plant there, would not put up their usual placard because the field was so much damaged?  Further, is the Minister aware that in this field in 1925 this man had seven acres tilled on which he made £73; in 1926 he also had seven acres of it tilled and he made £81, and out of the same field in 1927 he made £86, and in 1928 he made £90?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident that this man is an industrious farmer.  How it could be thought that he would be compensated by offering him a few pounds for the destruction of his field in this way, cannot be understood by Mr. Flynn or by Deputy Killilea apparently. I would ask the Minister to have the case reconsidered.  Apparently some city fellow who was well able to drive a lorry but knew nothing about tillage, thought that he had freedom from the Electricity Supply Board to do what he liked when he had permission to enter the field.  He destroyed the whole field by driving the lorry over it.  He did not even follow the one track twice.</P>

There is no legal power to pay benefit in the Saorstát on contributions paid in Great Britain, nor has the British Ministry of Labour power to exempt, or to refund contributions to insurable workers on the ground that they are not permanently resident in Great Britain.

    <P>&ldquo;To delete all words from and including the words `Two Million Pounds' to the figures `1930' and substitute the words `one million, one hundred thousand pounds, as may be required by the Electricity Supply Board for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions under Section 12 (3) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.' &rdquo; (Mr. Lemass.)</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was pointing out the extreme difficulty there is in getting a simple answer, or what seems to be a simple answer, to a perfectly simple question, and how much it depends upon the form in which the question is put as to how the answer can be given.  In the thirty-second interruption made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the speech of Deputy Lemass he has given us an epigram which I hope will go into the currency of this House.  He said, &ldquo;The truth depends upon the way it is said.&rdquo; We were dealing with the question of whether or not, because the Minister had appointed a Board, he could be held responsible for every defect, and what defects, in the conduct of that Board.  We had reached the stage of recognising that in relation to a Board of seven two people had been dismissed; that one of the people who had been dismissed was a person who had previously &ldquo;been put propositions&rdquo; which required his resignation; who had been told, and who, this House has been told, would, if he had not resigned, been dismissed; and who was reappointed by this Minister after this Minister had told him that he was incompetent to perform the functions for which he was appointed, with a gratuity of £1,250, to continue on a Board in which his previous <Col N="2194" /> conduct had been such that the Minister had effected his resignation, would have demanded his dismissal, and said he was incompetent.  We had reached the stage of saying that the Minister who had reappointed such a man whom he had so defined could not escape the responsibility for any further acts or defect of such a member.  We had further examined the case of three of the remaining five members who had been appointed as part-time or ticket-of-leave members, in spite of the fact that they have declared publicly, have declared to the Chamber of Commerce of Cork, for one place, that they were severally and collectively responsible for every major decision upon policy which was taken, and which constituted what the Minister has declared to be a most hopeless and impossible mess.  We had reached the stage of saying that the Minister, who had in good faith and after proper examination appointed men to take a part in an independent Board, so long as they performed their function within the Act, and so long as it was within his knowledge that they were competent people, was not to be held responsible for the defects; that the Minister, who had appointed and reappointed men, whom he had declared to be incompetent, or who themselves declared themselves to be responsible for what the Minister said was a complete mess, had a responsibility that was a continuing and inescapable responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back for a moment upon the history of this Board.  If I have ever used strong language in relation to politics, I have used it in commendation of the Minister in relation to the setting up of this Board, the ingenuity, the broadmindedness, and the foresight which he showed in constituting that Board, and the frankness and the clearness with which he has declared its independence to this House.  Such a Board was set up, independent under the Act.  &ldquo;When this Board is set up I wash my hands of it,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;I have nothing further to do with it.&rdquo; By that means the Minister effected two things.  First, he gave something in the nature of a simulacrum of private <Col N="2195" /> enterprise and private management to a big State concern.  The second thing he did was to remove from the purview of this Dáil and from day-to-day criticism in relation to its activities of the members of this Dáil, that Board and its activities.  In my opinion two very excellent things, very excellently and well done.  The Minister constituted the Board.  Of whom did that Board consist?  This perfectly independent Board, which was now clear of supervision and criticism by this House, consisted of the closest possible friend and associate of the President of the Executive Council, an old colleague, a life-long friend, Town Clerk and Treasurer of the City of Dublin, Mr. J.J. Murphy.  It consisted of Dr. Thomas McLaughlin, then in the closest possible association and intimate relation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These two people might be regarded as alternatives practically to the two Ministers whom I have mentioned.  It consisted of Mr. J.C. Foley, then the king pin of Cumann na nGaedheal in the City of Cork.  It consisted of Mr. Patrick Egan, an old friend and school-fellow of mine, an ex-Parliamentary Secretary to Cumann na nGaedheal, and a defeated candidate of Cumann na nGaedheal at the last General Election.  It consisted of Dr. Kennedy, Secretary to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, and brother-in-law of the Minister for Agriculture.  If you could pack a board, which was independent, with a personnel more directly calculated to be in close and intimate and exact touch, and to be representative of the feelings and emotions of that Government, tighter than that, I take off my hat to you as a very clever person.</P>
    <P>I am emphasising the political associations, the personal associations of these men, not for the purpose of attacking them, but for the opposite purpose.  What I am now saying I have said in several places and before now.  I am not saying this ad hoc.  I am saying it to emphasise the fact that this House owes to those men for the independence they have shown of that association, thanks and credit.  What <Col N="2196" /> was now the position?  You had a Board cut away from and independent of this Dáil.  You had a Board packed as tight as a sardine can with the personal associates of the Ministry.  The Ministry had it both ways.  Now, was that the scheme?  And did that scheme break down?  Did they create a Frankenstein without thinking of it?  The facts are inescapable.</P>
    <P>What is the further history?  These gentlemen are all responsible men, are all politically opposed to myself as far as I know their politics.  I have no reason whatever to hold a brief for them, or to speak a word in their favour, but from the day on which they were appointed they acted as responsible men who, being offered a great opportunity and great responsibility, as far as was in them rose to that opportunity and accepted that responsibility. They had an Act of this Dáil. They had a charter under which they were to work, and it is in evidence that from the day they came together as a corporate body they took that charter as their orders from this Dáil, independent of party and politics, and that they tried to carry it out, not merely in the letter, but in the spirit of the independence which this Dáil and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in their very great wisdom and patriotism created this Board. You have heard earlier in this debate the first incident in the history of that Board; they met and decided that they should set up an organisation.  They asked for money.  In accordance with the Act they sent in a request, nay, a demand for money to the Ministry for Finance, a demand which that Ministry is not accustomed to receive.  That is a body which every member of this State and Ministers of this State and this Dáil itself must approach &ldquo;with bated breath and whispering humbleness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems this particular Board, taking this charter as meant to mean in reality what it was upon the face of it, went there as of right and demanded money.  And after their right to do so had been questioned they got it.  But a straw shows how the wind blows and that was the first straw that showed where the gale blew that has <Col N="2197" /> wreeked the Electricity Supply Board. From that good day to this the fight has been on by the officials of the Ministry of Finance to get control of, to sap the independence, and to break that independent body, which was showing the way and the line upon which other independent activities in this State could be developed without their consent, without being submitted to them in every possible detail.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Daily Express&rdquo; of Saturday last, in what I have frankly to say is a very well informed article, comments as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>When I discussed Mr. McGilligan's disclosures with a prominent official of the Ministry of Finance to-day he said to me: &ldquo;The public has always been clamouring for the introduction of business men into State controlled or semi-State controlled activities and undertakings. I hope that the latest episode in the industrial life of the Free State will teach the public a different lesson.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the issue.  The Ministry of Finance over all! How dare the business men of this country, how dare the ordinary people of this country, how dare the people who pay the salaries to the people to whom the Minister for Finance is the over-paid office boy&mdash; how dare they! The impudence and the insolence of the suggestion that we who provide the income of the State, that we who are the State, should dare to be associated with an enterprise of a State or semi-State character! Surely this Dáil and country will learn a lesson from the success which has attended the efforts of the Ministry of Finance to smash the most promising industrial experiment that has ever been tried in this State.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the history of the particular Estimate which you have before you.  There was introduced for Second Reading, the other day, the Electricity (Supply) Bill, and in that it was claimed that the Minister should be provided with a sum of two million pounds, or rather that this State should provide two million pounds <Col N="2198" /> which the Minister for Finance should issue to the Electricity Supply Board as and when and how the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall specify. The tragic recollection of that debate will be in the mind of this House.  But what will not be in the recollection of the House is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce told it what the two millions were for.  On that subject we received no information, except negatively.  Every member who spoke put up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a problem in subtraction and asked him what he was going to do with the remainder.  Deputy Lemass, Deputy Thrift, Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Briscoe, myself, everybody who spoke put up to the Minister in set terms the same problem in subtraction. Everybody in turn said: &ldquo;There is £850,000 that we know of as a liability. That money has got to be found.  What are you going to do with the remainder of the two millions?&rdquo; I turn to column 1656 of the Official Debates for the 8th July, 1931, and to a speech in which Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>He said, as far as he had been able to discover, the Board had overspent to the amount of £600,000, and that it had entered into liabilities amounting to a quarter of a million pounds, and that if we add those figures on to the original £2,500,000 we get a total of what it has been responsible for, taking into account the undischarged liablities of the undertaking, but the Minister has not accounted for the balance of the two million pounds.</P>
    <P>Therefore Deputy Lemass had put the £850,000 figure to the Minister and asked him to account for the balance. In the twenty-second interruption made by the Minister to Deputy Lemass in that speech he said: &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo; In column 1657 Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>That accounts for £850,000.  Under the circumstances the Dáil cannot refuse to give that £850,000, but what about the £1,150,000 the Minister is asking the Dáil for?</P>
    <P>In the twenty-fourth interruption the Minister said: &ldquo;Accruing liabilities and developments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" />&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: What developments?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGilligan: The Board has other liabilities that have been mentioned.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: I am anxious to get from the Minister information that he does not seem anxious to give.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGilligan: Because I cannot get it from the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he cannot get it from the Board and he is not in a position to reconcile the difference between £850,000 and two millions.  He is not able to account for the difference of £1,150,000, because he has no information from the Board.  That is typical of what went through the whole debate. Though the Minister 116 times interrupted without protest two speeches delivered from this side which continuously referred to that figure, though he continuously interrupted every Deputy who was speaking who was dealing with these figures, and though he made his speech at the beginning and his speech at the end, he never disclosed to the House what he was going to do with the balance of £1,125,000 of the two millions.  He never told the House that the £825,000 was not included in that sum.  Now the whole debate the other day on every side went on the basis that that money had to be found.  I will quote what Deputy Thrift said:</P>
    <P>I do not see how anyone can get behind that.  It has been stated that firms are waiting to bring the Electricity Supply Board into court.  They cannot get their accounts paid.  We cannot stand for that.  I think every Deputy will admit that we must provide the money which is required to enable the Board to pay its debts.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on:</P>
    <P>The whole issue, it seems to me, is that a sum must be provided.  The debts must be paid.</P>
    <P>He went on to estimate on the same basis, allowing £300,000 for reserve over and above the amount, that with the £850,000 there is required a million and a quarter to discharge that liability. Deputy O'Connell does the <Col N="2200" /> same.  Why did the Minister not disclose? Why did he allow the whole debate to go on that basis and never disclose that he intended to invent at a later date a perfectly different series of figures to cover the two millions? There has been no hint in the whole of the debate, in the hundreds of his interruptions or in his two speeches, that there was any other basis for that except to do something over and above paying that £825,000.  In a speech made by the Minister on the Electricity Act of 1929 he said: &ldquo;There is one phrase I want remembered against Deputy Flinn.  It is that he has said that I have not been frank.&rdquo; In July, 1931, I say that the Minister has not merely not been frank, but has been of careful and deliberate calculation, reticent of the truth and suggestive of what is false.</P>
    <P>Now let us turn to the next stage of that particular estimate.  It was mentioned in the motion we are now discussing that two million pounds was required.  He had behind him the whole of the debate, the whole of the misunderstanding of every member of the House&mdash;if we put it that way&mdash; the result of the deliberate deception of the House by the Minister in the whole debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we will withdraw them then.  We will leave the facts to speak for themselves.  Yet, what did the Minister do?  Not one single word of introduction! Deputy Lemass was permitted to rise and move his amendment.  Deputy O'Connell and others were permitted to talk to their amendments under the impression, under which he had allowed the House to remain, throughout the whole of the most significant debate which has taken place in the Dáil. No disclosure! Then he produces for us a sheet of paper.  I think in this particular case he did quote from a document and I think it is time that that document was tabled, with the date of its preparation, with the names of those responsible for it and with the history of its excogitation <i>ad hoc.</i>  He gives a series of items <Col N="2201" /> which he admits are utterly indefinite but which are interchangeable.  Any sum in this can be changed into any other category.  A sum of £270,000 for the acquisition of the electrical undertakings of certain unnamed towns can be interchangeable with the stand-by plant in the Pigeon House, in Fleet Street, or in improved transmission. The only thing that is at all interesting and of the faintest significance in relation to this document is that it does total up, roughly speaking, two millions of additional money in relation to a scheme which was supposed to cost £2,500,000.  That was the whole fund on which the Electricity Supply Board were to live and develop their lines.  We have added overnight the sum of two million pounds under a whole series of headings.  On what authority?  Has the Board met?  Have the ticket-of-leave part-timers been consulted about this?  Have they been called to the meeting at which it was considered?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want an answer. What is the responsibility behind the statement?  Is it that of an ex-principal officer of the Revenue Department? Is that the electrical expert who has laid down a scheme of two million pounds for us to be spent in addition to the £2,500,000 scheme which the Minister says is in a hopeless mess?  Does anyone suggest that the particular and peculiar qualifications of the Revenue Department constitute a man entitled to say that, of two millions, £133,000 shall be segregated for improved transmission, for the improvement of supply, for the stand-by plant in the Pigeon House and Fleet Street, while £37,000 shall be spent on the reconstruction of net works in new areas?  Is there any suggestion whatever that behind this Estimate there is any qualified opinion so long as it is the opinion of that particular officer?  Mind, he is a very estimable official.  He was so estimable and so efficient in charge of what you might call the shock troops of the Income Tax Department that that Department had to be dissolved in the interests of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash;<Col N="2202" /> that is very greatly to his credit.  He was doing the job he was paid for.  He was doing a job he knew, but what is his competence to tell this Dáil how to spend two million pounds on the further development of the electricity supply of this country?</P>
      <P>The only other person upon that Board is Mr. Fay.  I know nothing about him except that he is not an electrical engineer.  Now you know why the Minister comes with a great sense of uneasiness and disquiet to put before us an estimate for two million pounds, put forward in the name of a Board, which, as far as I know, did not meet to pass it, and certainly could not possibly have met to give it the consideration which was necessary to enable it to be put forward responsibly, and which is now put forward through a Minister who does not profess to know anything about either engineering or electricity by an inner corps of that body, neither of whom&mdash;and I say it with all respect to them&mdash;can reasonably be produced in this House as a competent authority to advise this House in the sound economic engineering expenditure of two millions of money on the distribution system of the Irish Free State.</P>
      <P>I said we have no date.  We have no authority, but that is only the beginning of the indictment.  It is indefinite in time and in detail.  The Minister complained the other day that the Electricity Supply Board had used such a phrase as &ldquo;a reasonable programme.&rdquo; He said he did not know the meaning of &ldquo;a reasonable programme.&rdquo; One of his complaints, I think, was that they had not defined &ldquo;a reasonable programme,&rdquo; but the Minister tells us this will be expended in &ldquo;a reasonable time,&rdquo; and any item of it can be transferred to any other heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion there has been a complete change in the Minister's mind and in the Minister's information in relation to this two million pounds between the time he demanded it under a Bill and the time he produced this <i>ad hoc</i> computation of the amount under a financial resolution.  Let us take, for instance, Deputy Thrift.  Deputy Thrift says: &ldquo;We cannot stand for not having <Col N="2203" /> their accounts paid.  I think every Deputy must admit that we must provide the money which is required to enable the Board to pay its debts.  The whole issue, it seems to me, is that a sum must be provided.  The debts must be paid.&rdquo; Will Deputy Thrift find in this computation of two million pounds, in favour of which he has got to go into the Lobby with the Minister or the Government falls, payment for the debts?  The one thing upon which every member of the House was agreed was that an amount must be provided and provided immediately&mdash;whatever the amount might be&mdash;which would meet the liquid debts of that institution, that the bailiffs must be got out of the place, that the writs must be got out of the place, that the E.S.B. must not have to send £10 in cash with a £10 order to a foreign firm.  That is what we did agree to.  Yet, what does the Minister say?  The Minister says: &ldquo;As to the debts, I have got nothing to do with them.&rdquo;&ldquo;He hopes they will be paid, but he takes no responsibility for them.&rdquo; What does the House think of that?  We were asking what he was going to do with £1,125,000 after he had paid the debts.  He says: &ldquo;I have made no provision for the debts, but I have got a scheme here which, over a period which I shall not say and under a segregation I cannot stand over, on an authority I shall not declare, some time, somehow the money may or not be spent.&rdquo; If that is the kind of way this State thinks it can get on with its finances it is certainly well represented by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, that document is a  on the face of it.  I believe it was created <i>ad hoc.</i>  I believe that the items were made to total up to an arbitrary figure.  I believe there is no engineering, no scientific, no economic, no administrative and no financial authority behind that particular segregation of that particular sum. It is on that ground that I say to the House that they must not vote that sum unless and until they are satisfied that that sum, or whatever sum they do vote, has behind it an authority which this fake lacks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2204" /> Under what conditions are you asked to give a judgment on this matter?  Are you asked to give a judgement in the spirit of responsible men handling the finances, for which you are responsible, of the State to which you belong, with a clear responsibility to do what is right without fear of consequences?  No.  You are told that if you do not vote this precise sum, in this precise way, then, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will cease to function in this matter. In fact he will cease to function as Minister for Industry and Commerce. That is the threat, and you had better face up to it.  You may be prepared to accept that challenge.  You may be prepared to accept the consequences of that challenge, or you may not be prepared to do so.  You may say that Patrick McGilligan, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and as Minister for External Affairs, is so valuable to this country, and so irreplaceable in Europe, that you are not prepared to take that responsibility. That is a position which you are entitled to take up.  You are entitled to say that two million pounds is better thrown down the gutter than that this State, and this Continent should lose the services of such a man. But that is the only ground so far as I can see at the moment, as disclosed by any explanations given by him, as instinct in any internal evidence in the document itself, which would induce you to do so.  There may be an alternative.  What may happen may be the elimination of the Minister from Industry and Commerce while he would still remain as Minister for External Affairs.  That matchless tact, that kindliness of disposition, that genius and diplomacy which he has shown in this matter, will no longer be wasted in the narrow sphere of the Electricity Supply Board, but will be a present and a tribute to the whole world.</P>
    <P>With maiden palms he lifted up</P>
    <P>The sick world's blood embittered cup</P>
    <P>And in his maiden garment furled</P>
    <P>The faint limbs of a wounded world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> You can take that risk.  Are you going to deny Europe, at this most critical hour of her life the whole-time service of Patrick McGilligan, Minister for External Affairs?  Of Course, there is a risk.  There is the very grave risk, the almost cosmic risk that you may lose him in that capacity as well as in the capacity of Industry and Commerce if you decline to face up to his threat and give him £2,000,000 of other peoples money to play the fool with in the same way as he has played the fool with every other sum of money which has been put in his possession.</P>
    <P>Now let us deal with the amendments. The first amendment was that this money should be segregated to the purposes of Section 3 of Article 12 of the Act of 1927.  In that particular case, I think the defence put up by the Minister was a good defence.  I think there is a lot to be said for it. He says: &ldquo;I accept in principle this amendment but there may be doubtful cases on the edge which it may be necessary to deal with.&rdquo; There may be a certain number of questions, he says, on the fringe with which he would be enabled to deal if he was not held up in this manner, while he does give the assurance to the House that as long as he occupies his present position and the clouds do not fall upon us, he will, broadly speaking, act in the spirit of the amendment I think that Deputy Lemass might very well consider that and see whether the position could not be met. The second amendment was to limit this money specifically to such purposes and to prevent its being used for Shannon works and things of that kind&mdash;to prevent any portion of it being used, for instance, to pay Siemens Schuckert for that portion of the underestimated expenditure for which the Minister or his successor will have to come to this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to that is that under the Act it will be illegal for him to use any of this money for that purpose.  In the ordinary way, were we dealing with an ordinary Government and with people who had shown a less reckless disregard of the written laws which they themselves had passed, that would be an absolutely <Col N="2206" /> inescapable defence.  He says, &ldquo;I am not allowed in law to use this money in such a way, and, therefore, it is unnecessary to prohibit.&rdquo; Unfortunately, that is not a sound argument in relation to this Government. The Minister has on his records that he did take surreptitiously out of the Contingency Fund a sum of £10,000, that he did hand that money over to private individuals for a purpose for which he was not authorised to use contingency money, that he did surreptitiously put back into that fund the sum of £5,000 being part of that money returned by conscientious people who thought that he was wasting it, and then had to come to the Dáil for misusing, technically mis-using, that money.  In my opinion, that was a purely technical misuse.</P>
    <P>We have always felt that in entering upon that particular scheme the Minister did it with good faith and with good intentions, and when he did come to the Dáil for absolution in the matter we not merely gave him absolution, but something more&mdash; benediction as well.  But the House has to recognise that he did do that with moneys which he was not entitled to use for that purpose.  Deputies have to take into account that this particular Government, of which he was a member&mdash;I am only giving this as an illustration&mdash;when it got a grant from this Dáil of £12,000 for a specific purpose, did, in fact, turn surplus funds it had under other headings to the extent, I think, of £247,000, to the giving of gratuities and pensions to able-bodied supporters of theirs.</P>
    <P>Now on that record the Minister is not entitled to say that money which is in his hands for a specific purpose will not and must be assumed not to be liable to be used for any other purpose.  Further, we have to face the fact in relation to this Act, whose amendment we are now discussing&mdash;the 1927 Electricity Supply Act&mdash;that the Minister has threatened to come to this House and, over the heads of the Electricity Supply Board, to alter the law as defined to them by their legal advisers, to take from them and from their legitimate use under that Act the sum of £835,000, which under the law <Col N="2207" /> was segregated for that purpose. Deputies have to face the fact that in the last few days we have discussed in this House a Finance Bill, in which it was declared by this Dáil that the law in relation to certain financial transactions &ldquo;was and was to be deemed always to have been&rdquo; the exact opposite to what the courts of this country had stated it was.  Under these circumstances there is no what you may call prima facie case for the Minister to say, &ldquo;My record is so clean, I am so virtuous in relation to financial affairs, I am so upright, that the mere fact that the law compels me to remain upright, is sufficient reason for not examining into the question as to whether further safeguards can be provided.&rdquo; The further safeguard is provided in the declaration made in the debate by the Minister, a declaration which will stymie him when the time comes to play tricks with it, the declaration that this money is not to be used for this purpose, which will prevent him coming to the Dáil or going to the Electricity Supply Board or to the Department of Finance and saying: &ldquo;The obvious intention of the Dáil was the exact opposite to what the Act says, and therefore it must be done as I want it.&rdquo; The only safeguard that we have is that we have on the records means to convict the Minister of flagrant dishonesty and illegality if he does, in fact, malversate this particular money.</P>
    <P>The two statements before the House&mdash;the amendment on behalf of the Labour Party, and the amendment moved by Fianna Fáil&mdash;are in different forms, but they amount to the same thing.  One represents the sum of £1,000,000, and the other the sum of £1,100,000.  We are not going to quarrel as between the amounts, so long as it is perfectly clear both from the Labour side, and from our side that the first claim, the inescapable claim upon that money, is the payment of the existing debts, and clearing the credit of the Electricity Supply Board from the slur and cloud under which it has been put by the maladministration and insolent disregard of the law by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2208" /> I come now to the attack which has been made upon the Board.  It lies under a variety of heads.  The first is the mysterious &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo; in which some calculations were made, some figures were produced on the authority of some unnamed people indicated to some unnamed people, and for unspecified purposes which is supposed to dominate this whole question of the credit of the Electricity Supply Board.  I have never seen that memorandum.  Deputy Thrift has never seen it, and, as far as I know, no member of the House has ever seen it.  There is no evidence that the Electricity Supply Board ever saw that memorandum.  There are Deputies present who were members of the House when that particular Bill was passed.  I was not.  Was that memorandum submitted to the House at that time?  Of course, it was not.  And yet the intention of the Bill, and the intention of the Dáil in relation to the Electricity Supply Board is held to be directly contrary to the written word of the Bill, in so far as it conflicts with the mysterious, unproduced memorandum.  We want the memorandum, and it is time that we had it, if it is a document which the Minister can produce.  It was never within the knowledge of the Dáil that passed the Bill.  It was never within the knowledge of the Board that was set up under the Bill, as far as my information goes, and yet, the Board is to be held guilty because it has transgressed some undisclosed, unknown provision of that unknown, and entirely unauthenticated document.  That was the first portion of his statement.  But we do know something about it.  We have had two witnesses.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, on coming here as the principal witness to indict others in their absence, with the knowledge of the impossibility of their defence in this court, has put himself in the dock in the process of his testimony.</P>
    <P>That is the evidence we have.  He says that it did contain certain things. And someone else who has seen that document says &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but he also says &ldquo;that is not all it contains.&rdquo; Dr. MacLaughlin says it did not contain other expenditure, which the Board in <Col N="2209" /> its wisdom, in the exercise of its independent judgement thought it was for the economic and administrative benefit of the scheme to spend.  What is the use of pleading a document of that kind in that indefinite form?  Is there any honesty or decency about it?  Is it not time that we had that document if it is a document that can be produced, if it is a document which the Minister has authority to produce?  Let us examine that particular document a little further.  This document, as far as I can gather from the Minister, was drawn up by someone who was considering the possibility of coming in and running this scheme as a private enterprise. The idea, I suppose, would be that in consideration of putting up the sum of £2,500,000 or such other sum as the Minister was satisfied was sufficient for the scheme, they would have obtained a charter somewhat of the order of the Electricity Supply Board.  And it is suggested that on that £2,500,000 this independent, privately owned and therefore efficient concern would have been able to do all these things. Foreign cows have long horns.  If it got the Electricity Supply Board charter and if it had £2,500,000 only to pay interest on, it could have done the work.  We had a discussion on the Electricity Supply Bill on 5th June, 1930, and in column 597, Volume 35, the Minister is getting after me.  Here is what he says: &ldquo;The Deputy has also spoken about changing the charter of the Electricity Supply Board, and he raised the analogy of a sale to an outside corporation.  The analogy is unsound.&rdquo; And yet that is the very analogy which we have been asked to stand over in the last few days.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on: &ldquo;No corporation would have taken over on the terms of the 1927 Act.  There is no corporation living that would have taken over under a clause which says that the charges shall be such as just to meet the annual expenses.  There is no corporation in the world that I have ever heard of that would be willing to take over on the basis simply that they are to meet their expenses.  The analogy of a commercial concern is stymied right at the start by that consideration.&rdquo; He concludes by saying: <Col N="2210" />&ldquo;Under the 1927 Act the Board are prohibited from making profits,&rdquo; and then there follows immediately: &ldquo;Mr. Flinn: There are the expenses of the interest and sinking fund on the capital...&rdquo; In other words notwithstanding this £2,500,000 in this mysterious memorandum, this private company that was supposed to take over, even if it got the Shannon charter and even if it were only required to pay the interest and sinking fund on this capital, could not, according to the Minister, have functioned.  And yet that is precisely the document on which this particular Board is indicted.  That is, with the resources they had and with the charter they had the Minister said that with the same resources and the same charter no corporation could possibly have carried on.  I have put to you the unreliability of the memorandum and the suppression of details. Suppressio veri et suggestio falsi seems to be the standard of the Minister's contribution to this particular discussion. What I am saying to you is this &mdash;neither the Board nor the Dáil has a right to consider in any way a memorandum of that kind which is in conflict with the law, and no secret arrangement and no secret understanding and no previous conversations of any kind between the Minister and any individual in relation to that memorandum frees the Board or any member of the Board in any act of the Board from the obligation to carry out the law strictly, to carry out the law and nothing but the law.  If any one wants to take that proposition up, this is a meeting in Committee and we can deal with that when it is done.</P>
    <P>Now in column 598, volume 35, we have the Minister's authority for that. The Electricity Supply Board refused to do what their legal advisers told them was illegal for them to do in the payment of rates in the City of Dublin and in the City of Limerick, and in the payment of income tax, and this is what the Minister says about it.  &ldquo;Because the Board had not legal opinion to the contrary, it would be a strange thing to insist on the Board paying where they were legally advised that they were not bound to pay,&rdquo; or to do anything else where they were <Col N="2211" /> legally advised to the contrary.  &ldquo;If they were to do that, then they might indulge in all sorts of fancy payments. The Board must be tied up.  It is rather a good thing to see the Board sticking to the legal opinions given to them, even though they know that these legal opinions cut across the expressed wishes of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; How much more binding it is on them to carry out the law when they know that there is no evidence in their possession, in the possession of the Minister, or in the possession of the Dáil, that the legal advice that they had received cuts across the expressed wishes of the Oireachtas.  Has the Minister the Attorney-General's fiat? Has he any legal authority to say that these people were wrong?  What he said was, &ldquo;If you do not do this, if you do not turn this money, which under the law has been set down to be put in a particular way, if you do not malversate £850,000, then I will come to the Dáil and get a Party majority under the whip to say that the law is and always has been different to what it is, and you will be responsible retrospectively for mis-using money which you were legally entitled to use in a way in which the Dáil will then make it an offence to have used it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take the next portion of their indictment&mdash;large issues of policy. These large issues of policy are represented by the fact that the Board, in their independent judgement and the exercise of their commercial knowledge, did use the funds within the law in the way that they thought was best and most economic for the development of electricity in the Free State.  The Minister said a lot of things, but God knows what he really meant.  Sometimes he says one thing and sometimes another.  The buying out of the Cork undertaking was contemplated, and extraordinarily penal provisions were put into the Bill, which, in my opinion, could only have applied to one particular institution in Ireland, the Cork electricity undertaking.  Before they bought out they consulted the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They got the consent of that Minister and the Minister for Finance to the actual transaction.  They carried through the <Col N="2212" /> transaction of buying out the Cork electricity undertaking, and now the Minister says it is all gone wrong.  He does not know whether they should or should not have bought it.  He has a &ldquo;philosophic doubt&rdquo; about it.  He does not know whether they should or should not.  The Minister's indefinite state of should or should not constitutes in the Board a bad policy in relation to the administration of their affairs, for which they should be lampooned all over Europe on the authority of this heaven-sent Ministry!</P>
    <P>What judge of policy in relation to the economic administration of a national scheme of electricity supply is the Minister?  I have paid tribute to his ability on many occasions.  I know no man who can get up a case quicker or better.  I know no man who can state a case better.  I admire the Minister very much as a debater.  I have defined him in this House before as a man with a leader-writer's brain.  One has to know a good deal about a subject with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce deals before one can realise that the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows nothing about it beyond what he can get from documents.  Will the Minister claim that he is a judge, that he has a competent knowledge, that he has the professional training, and that he has the background of experience which enable him to come here as arbiter in this matter?  What competent knowledge has he which makes him think that his ipse dixit is to go, and when he says a policy is bad it is bad, and when he says a policy is good it is good?  I do not think the Minister is in that position.</P>
    <P>You are going into the lobby, every one of you, under threat of the resignation of the Minister, to say that he is so competent that he should be allowed to get away with the attack which he has levelled upon these absent men, because he has that experience, because he has that competence, because he has that background of knowledge.  There is not one of you who can follow the dictates of your own conscience as decent men and take the responsibility of the cruel wrong which is being done in condemning, without <Col N="2213" /> trial before a competent tribunal, professional and business men who have given their services honestly, enthusiastically and successfully to this State.</P>
    <P>The accounts&mdash;that is all it boils down to in the end.  All he has got are the accounts; all the rest is a matter of opinion, a matter of incompetent opinion, of an <i>ex-professo</i> incompetent opinion, incompetent in the sense that it is irrelevant.  My opinion upon the flora of the fixed stars is as important an opinion as is the opinion of the Minister on what constitutes a sound scheme in relation to the administration of an electricity supply undertaking. The rest is simply a matter of accounts.  I do not know anything about the accounts.  I do know that great institutions are often in arrear in these matters.  I do know that a building in course of erection is one of the things in regard to which you do not as a rule be able to produce a balance sheet&mdash;a profit and loss account.  I am prepared to accept as a fact that when this thing is cleared up you will find stray ends and scrags.  There will be here and there those little things which are inevitable.  I accept that in advance but unless and until some competent authority, some less interested authority, some impartial authority will, on full examination of the facts, state that there has been neglect and chaos, I certainly am not going to condemn any man unheard in circumstances in which I myself would demand a trial before competent people. These people, he states, have exceeded their estimate.  We have heard reference to the sum of £2,500,000.  That was not merely to provide the immediate capital but, like the widow's curse, it was going to be self-renewing.</P>
    <P>Apart from the mystical and mythical &ldquo;memorandum,&rdquo; the only justification the Minister has put forward is a calculation as to what he calls equal thirds.  He says that it is a sort of average that in a big electricity supply system of that kind&mdash; distribution, transmission and generation shall be represented by equal thirds of the capital cost.  He says their original figure for the transmission and generation of the Shannon was £5,200,000, and therefore, <Col N="2214" /> £2,500,000 being a third of the total, was a reasonable and proper sum. The original estimate was £5,200,000. Half of that being one-third of the total would be £2,600,000.  If the Minister looked up the records he would find that we added £600,000 to that £5,200,000, and a further sum of £156,000.  Therefore the scheme has gone up from £5,200,000 to £5,900,000, and there is a liability never disclosed to this House, a claim which, according to the Minister, is good, according to his own definition, in relation to contingent liability of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;good in the sense that it can be pleaded in law. There is a contingent liability, and a claim by Siemens Schuckert to the amount of £1,100,000.  The total cost of the Shannon generation and transmission, according to those figures is really £6,900,000, and the figure that ought to have been provided on that basis for the Electricity Supply Board is not £2,500,000 but £3,450,000.  Now we know the reliability of the checks and tests which the Minister offers to this House.</P>
    <P>What we have put before the House from the very beginning, and what we put now, is not a defence of the Electricity Supply Board.  Not a single word has been said by me in defence of the Electricity Supply Board, and except in so far as the Minister has given evidence against himself in his own examination-in-chief, not one single word has been said by me against the Minister.  I have simply used the evidence which he has given us.</P>
    <P>Our claim is that the issue shall go to trial, that the issue as between the Minister and the Electricity Supply Board shall be tried by a competent court, that these young engineers, who gave their energy, their enterprise, their brains, their enthusiasm and patriotism to this job, these civil servants who came out of their sheltered jobs, where they were free of criticism, and involved themselves with the Minister in the limelight, and the driving rain of criticism which is apparently bound to follow anybody who is his associate; these business men whose reputations are <Col N="2215" /> at stake, shall have the right to go to trial, not before a Party majority, not through a vote of no confidence and the resignation of a Minister, but that they shall have the right to go to trial by a competent professional court capable of ascertaining the facts and rendering a sound judgement upon them.</P>
    <P>There are two methods of inquiry. One of them is on the accounts.  The accounts which are immediately or proximately available are a thoroughly insecure ground upon which to form a judgement.  Take the year 1929-30, for which the figures in a draft form are now available.  I put it to Deputy Murphy, I put it to any other commercial man in the House, that when we get draft accounts of a business of which we have good reason to be doubtful we do not wait for them to be copper-plated by an auditor or anybody else before we get down to the job of seeing what is wrong and dealing with it.  The Minister has the accounts now in that particular form&mdash; he had them a month ago.  There may be an odd halfpenny stamp here and there and three half-inch insulators missing, but the broad facts are there. If that was all that was necessary, then it would be possible now on those draft accounts to form a very reasonable and sound judgement.  But, as a matter of fact, the most accurate, the best audited accounts of 1929-30 are useless for the purpose.  The Dublin Pigeon House was only shut down in March, 1930.  The Leinster Loop was only in partial operation for the last six months of that year.  It was a year of active construction.  It was not in any way a year which was normal from the point of view of administration or income. The accounts are now available. They will be complete in the autumn. Ten thousand accounts of that time, though they will be necessary material to be used by anyone who does investigate the matter, do not cover the amount of material required to enable us to get a conspectus of the whole position.</P>
    <P>The year 1930-31 was also a year of partial operation.  The Cork and Dublin tramways, representing <Col N="2216" /> 30,000,000 units, twenty-five per cent. of the total, were only linked up in December, 1930.  That was not a normal year of income.  The southern and western towns were being connected week by week right up to the end of 1930.  Here you have a house in course of construction, and you are asked to show it is a going concern on the principle of rent, rates, and taxes, and all the rest.  Those accounts will be available at the end of 1931. Now, if you get the two of those together you certainly have something more material than the one set of accounts.  They are not normal years, and they are only part of the material which, if it is available, will be very useful to the investigators.</P>
    <P>The first normal year we are going to get is 1931-32.  They will have settled down to administration, they will have settled down to the de-centralisation of their staffs, they will have a proper co-ordination of their selling and collecting organisations, and all the rest. You will be able, on the basis of that, to get something in relation to a fair view of it, both as a productive and administrative unit.  These accounts will not be available until, say, June, 1932.  If we had these three sets of accounts complete they would be very valuable material, but June, 1932, is too long to wait to deal with a house which according to the Minister is on fire.</P>
    <P>The reason why we think that a body of competent experts, men who have a broad knowledge of electricity supply and its finances in this and other countries, and who are capable of comparing facts, of estimating tendencies, are required is because they have that knowledge.  What is the ordinary auditor's work?  He will give you facts as to what is being done.  He is not at all in a position to forecast.  He most certainly is not in a position to dictate or suggest policy in relation to a highly technical matter of which he has no more knowledge or training than the Minister for Industry and Commerce. What knowledge will we get from accounts immediately available, or available within any period to which we are prepared to put off that investigation of the organisation and management to <Col N="2217" /> decide whether that organisation was wisely or economically designed?  What were the qualifications of the Board themselves?  If you neglect the three part-timers who were only there on tolerance, what is the qualification of the Board as at present constituted to express an opinion broadly as to the economic organisation, administration and management of that scheme and its development?  In my opinion, none. It therefore brings me to the fact that we have to get some such body, quite impartial, clear of prejudice and party and personal affiliation to go into this matter and I am going to suggest the terms of reference of such a body.  The terms are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  This body shall inquire into the actual present position of the Electricity Supply Board, in relation to expenditure, income, commitments, assets and liabilities.  For that they will require the auditors' accounts, and that is the only information of the auditors which would be of any use to them.</P>
    <P>(2)  To provide estimates of future income and expenditure and capital commitments required therefor.</P>
    <P>(3)  They will report on the present rates of charges, and whether same are economic, having regard to the existing commitments of the Board, and to the present and prospective demands for electricity.</P>
    <P>(4)  They will report on the existing organisation and staff distribution, and whether same or what staff and organisation are most conducive to economic organisation.</P>
    <P>(5)  They will report on the future lines of development and organisation of staff, plant and policy, and they will report specifically whether the policy of the Board up to the present has been sound (a)  in the specific use of its capital, (b)  in the prices charged for electricity to different classes of consumers, (c)  in forming the electrical supply monopoly in generation and distribution.</P>
    <P>(6)  Whether they have been sound in not selling electricity in bulk to existing or new undertakings.  That will raise the question of whether they should or should not have bought the Cork electrical supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> (7)  Whether they have been sound in engaging in the wiring and installation business.</P>
    <P>(8)  Whether they have been wise in engaging in the wholesale and retail trade in appliances.</P>
    <P>I believe that a very useful and valuable report, from competent men, could, within two months from the date that they arrived in Dublin, be in the hands of this Dáil.  I think whatever the expense incurred, having regard to the size of the issues concerned it is well worth while.  I say to the House deliberately that the actual capital now engaged, the value of the charter, the pre-existing assets sunk in the Shannon scheme, and its acknowledged capital up to date, and including this two million, amount to £16,700,000&mdash;I am of opinion that if such a body is brought together that they will give to this Dáil a report that will enable them to deal with the matter, and enable them to solve the double problem&mdash;just the problem of how that £16,000,000 of the assets and rights of the people of the Irish Free State can be best and most economically used for the benefit of the people of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Secondly, they will provide a tribunal before whom can be brought, and from whom can be got, a verdict which we are in honour bound to see they have an opportunity of obtaining, of guilty or not guilty in relation to those men whose professional careers have been imperilled, whose personal honour has been impeached, whose business future has been imperilled by the recklessly foolish scandal-mongering of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter.</P>

      <P>The amendment on the Paper in the name of Deputy Lemass is: &ldquo;To delete all words from and including the words `Two Million Pounds' to the figures `1930' and substitute the words `One million, one hundred thousand pounds as may be required by the Electricity Supply Board for any purpose arising in the performance of its functions under Section 12 (3) of the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927.&rdquo; If the amendment were put in the form in which it <Col N="2219" /> appears on the Paper it would preclude a discussion on one of the amendments as it appears on the Order Paper to the Bill in the Committee Stage and I therefore propose to put the amendment in two parts.  I propose to put <Col N="2220" /> the first question in this form: &ldquo;That the words `Two Million Pounds' proposed to be deleted stand part of the resolution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let us see how the Minister contemplates operating the section.  Are we to understand that he will only advance to the Board as much money from day to day as is required to meet immediate commitments and liabilities, or, does he contemplate that the Board, having carefully thought out a scheme involving the expenditure of a substantial sum of money, will present the scheme to him?  Having had it examined by his competent advisers he will then place at the disposal of the Board, as and when required by them to be drawn upon, a certain substantial sum of money.  Has the Minister clearly marked out in his own mind in what way he proposes to handle this money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it to the Minister this way: Does he favour the supposition that from day to day he would dole out to the Board such sums and just such sums as will meet their liabilities as they accrue, or does he think the proper course would be for the Board, having carefully surveyed a project &mdash; say a proposal to ensure a better service of electricity for Dublin, to put up to him a comprehensive scheme with fully detailed estimates showing the cost of such scheme? Having received the advice to his competent technical and financial advisers, he will then say to the Board: &ldquo;I <Col N="2223" /> approve of this scheme and I will advance to you for the purpose of this scheme a certain sum of money.&rdquo; Is that how the Minister proposes to operate the section?  I think it is essential the House should know that.</P>
      <P>The Minister asks us to table an amendment expressing the ideas we have in mind.  We are anxious, if we can, to accommodate the Minister. We do not want to waste the time of the House by putting down an amendment which he will not be disposed to accept.  Before the section goes through I think the Minister ought to give the House some clear idea&mdash; at least, his own idea, whether it is clear or vague, as to how he proposes to operate under the section.  I think that that is a reasonable request, and that the Minister should meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking quite frankly to the House I cannot give any information, at the moment, as to how it is going to be distributed.  I can see one very big disbursement immediately. I think that ordinarily the Board will not ask for money except it has a programme ready for the application of the money, because the Board has to pay interest from the moment any advance is made to it. It is not so much my view that will be taken into account as the method by which the Board will make submissions to me for money.  I can conceive the Board asking for small sums occasionally but ordinarily the Board would have a comprehensive programme and then we would have the disbursements on which that programme was based.  What will happen in the circumstances in which I am, at the moment, I cannot exactly say. Quarterly returns have been asked for. If quarterly returns are asked for merely for the purpose of informing the House as to how the scheme stands, that may be well and good, but quarterly returns on which a debate can be engineered on every occasion is certainly a prospect that I would not look forward to with any relish.  If it is merely for the purpose of supplying information to the Dáil a paper can be laid on the Table of <Col N="2224" /> the House giving the disbursements for the quarter some weeks after the quarter has ended.  I have had a similar scheme in operation in connection with moneys guaranteed under the Trade Loans Act.  I could follow a system of that kind, but if I do I would do it on the understanding that these returns will not be required or availed of for quarterly debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was something similar to the quarterly returns furnished in connection with advances under the Trade Loans Act that I had in mind showing the amount advanced, the date and the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is going into details.  I do not believe these returns will be furnished in that form.  The details of the advances, and the purposes for which they will be required will, if given at all, be under a very general heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Minister that the headings should be general.  Of course, I would not ask the Minister to make a detailed statement as to what each particular sum was expended for, but he could give it under three or four main headings&mdash;say the provision of a new generating plant, the extension of the distribution system, the provision of consumers' service material, in the shape of meters and things of that description.  I do not say definitely that such headings should be adopted, but I am suggesting that the Minister might look at it from that angle. If we had three or four main headings the total amount advanced to the Board for expenditure under each of these three headings might be stated quarterly or half-yearly.  While I agree with the Minister that it would be extremely undersirable from the point of view of the House, and the point of view of the electricity supply undertaking itself, that there should be quarterly debates, nevertheless, I think the House ought to have freedom to ask for a debate on any one of these returns if the return on its face would seem to justify such a request.  We would be prepared to meet the Minister that it should be extremely undesirable that there should <Col N="2225" /> be quarterly debates but, nevertheless, the House should not be limited beyond its own sense of discretion and responsibility, in having a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take one heading I gave yesterday.  Clearly there is going to be a quarterly debate if expenditure under that head is given.  One item I mentioned was provision for joining up certain towns to the Shannon scheme.  We are going to have a kind of Land Commission debate on that every quarter. Deputies will ask: &ldquo;Why was not a named town in my constituency joined up?&rdquo; When a certain sum of money has been advanced every town that has not been linked up will immediately want a Deputy to raise that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will then get two or three sub-headings.  I do not know what information you are going to get in that way.  Let me leave it at this point.  The first disbursement will be a very big one and will have to be met. I do not know whether Deputies want a return of that.  It will be simply the accrued liabilities which will have to be met.  That would be approximately three-quarters of a million.  After that is over, I can start some system of quarterly returns of a type that will probably have to be changed before final form is presented.  The first one may not be satisfactory, but I will produce what I think is a satisfactory return later.  After that there can be private conferences with Deputies as to whether that return is giving suitable information.  By degrees we will arrive at the proper type of return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no authority to discuss it on any basis whatever, but we have a right to know on what basis the Minister arrives at this sum of £2,000.  I could understand it if it represented full salary for the unexpired period.  I take it that this represents a judgment by the Minister&mdash;we cannot regard it as anything else&mdash;as to the sum to which Dr. MacLaughlin is entitled.  My own belief would be that <Col N="2227" /> the proper sum would be such a sum as would cover the salary during the unexpired period of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that we pay £2,000 without any question.  The resignation has come in and has been accepted and we simply make a free gift of £2,000.  If there is any question of giving more, let it be raised afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is: why should we give anything?  We want to know exactly where we are as regards this matter.  The view of the Minister might have been, &ldquo;This sum is to be paid because circumstances arose in which the man felt he had to tender his resignation&rdquo; and in which the Minister said, &ldquo;I accept your resignation under the circumstances, but I take into account all the details and, therefore, I give you the salary to which you would have been entitled if you had served your full period.&rdquo; I could understand that.  But why give exactly a year's salary?  Why estimate it at that amount? Obviously, that is a judgment on the part of the Minister.  There has been no trial and I would like to know what is the basis on which the Minister arrives at this £2,000.</P>

      <P>If Dr. MacLaughlin gets £2,000, will it still be open to him to take proceedings against the Board in respect of the unexpired portion of his term, as outlined by Deputy de Valera, if he had a five years' agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any agreement there was in this case was not with the Board but with the Executive Council.  The Executive Council have received a resignation.  I cannot conceive of circumstances in which an action would lie for payment of money for the unexpired portion of a term when the person in question has resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite clear that no action can be taken by Dr. MacLaughlin since he tendered his resignation.  The point, however, is that there is down here a sum of £2,000 to be paid to Dr. MacLaughlin. <Col N="2228" /> I should like to have some basis for that payment.  I could understand payment for the unexpired period of the appointment.  I could understand if the Minister said, &ldquo;He has resigned under force of circumstances.  I have not judged the case and because I have not judged it, I do not propose to deprive him of any salary to which he would be entitled if he had served. I propose to give him the full sum he would have got if he had served the full term.&rdquo; I could understand that, but the moment you depart from that and try to fix a lesser sum, or mention a round sum, like £2,000, we should have some basis for it.  It indicates a judgment on the part of the Minister.  If Dr. MacLaughlin's appointment was one on a year's notice, I could understand £2,000 being given but in this particular case I think it would be very much better, if a sum is to be voted by the House at all, that it should be voted on the basis of full salary for the unexpired period of office.</P>

      <P>I do not like the idea of taking the Report Stage of a Bill immediately in this way, but I think the circumstances are rather special in this case.  In connection with this Bill there were two main points in dispute, the amount of money provided in the Bill and the giving of control to two Ministers.  As a result of the two divisions just taken these two points seem to have been disposed of.  If the postponement of the Report Stage meant that members would have to come back next week for no other business than to take the Bill then I think most Deputies would not be anxious to agree to that.  I would like <Col N="2231" /> to get some idea of the type of amendment that could be moved on the Report Stage.  As I have stated, the two main points in dispute have been decided.  I understand there was practical agreement between Deputy MacEntee and the Minister that quarterly returns would be made available.  That seems to meet the point as to the kind of information that we would require. If there was to be no other business next week except this Bill and if we can get no idea as to the possible type of amendments that can be moved on the Report Stage, most Deputies I think would be inconvenienced if they had to come back next week.  Many Deputies believed that the adjournment would be taken this week.</P>

This is the most important Bill that has come before the Dáil in the present session, and whether Deputy O'Connell wants to come back next week or not we do not think that the Report Stage should be rushed through now immediately after Committee.</P>

      <P>There is one point that the Deputies opposite seem to have overlooked.  If the Report Stage is left over until next week there will only be about seven days for the Seanad to consider the Bill before the 1st August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the President is not going to try on that in the Dáil. We know quite well that the Dáil will decide exactly as the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce determine.  A free choice in the matter is not going to rest with the Dáil.  The responsibility for the decision taken is going to rest with the President <Col N="2232" /> and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This Bill, as Deputy Flinn pointed out, relates to a concern in which about sixteen million pounds of public capital has been sunk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it is very much larger than the five million pounds which was formerly in the public mind in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said in connection with the scheme.  Surely, in connection with a Bill of such importance we are entitled to the usual facilities provided by Parliamentary procedure&mdash;that is, that as between the Committee and Report Stages adequate time should be allowed for the consideration of amendments to be moved on Report.  It is unfair of Deputy O'Connell, and he knows it would be unfair as well as grossly wrong for him to challenge the principal Opposition in this House to state immediately on the conclusion of the Committee Stage what amendments they propose to introduce on Report.  No serious and responsible Opposition could proceed immediately on the conclusion of the Committee Stage to draft and put in amendments for Report.  Deputy O'Connell knows that well.  If the Deputy had more concern for the public welfare and less for the private convenience of himself and his Party he would get up and ask that adequate time be given for the consideration of this Bill after it had emerged from Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it lies with Deputy MacEntee to lecture me in this House as to what my duty is.  In matters of this kind I do not think it has yet come to the stage when he can deny me the right to express my views and the views of my Party as I see them.  They may not be in agreement with what Deputy MacEntee thinks ought to be done, but that is no reason why they should not be expressed.  The request I made was, I think, a reasonable one.  I suggested that before we are asked to <Col N="2233" /> make up our minds definitely as to how we are to vote on this question we should have some indication from the Deputies opposite as to the kind of amendment that could possibly be moved on Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose there was no amendment at all, as very possibly there may not be, should we not have a week to consider the Bill, and the discussions that took place on the Committee Stage before the Report Stage is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the indication that I have asked for was given, then I could come to a decision on the matter.  I took it for granted that when the request was made to have the Report Stage taken next week that it was made with a view to putting in amendments.  As I pointed out, the two main issues in the Bill had already been decided, and I wanted <Col N="2234" /> to know the type of amendment that it was proposed to move on Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked with regard to the type of amendment that could be moved on Report.  Take for instance the statement as regards the returns.  We may consider that there is a better form of return which the Minister should be required to make.  There are a number of other things too that may possibly arise.  In any case, supposing, as Deputy Lemass has pointed out, that there was to be no amendment moved, it is not fair, we say, to rush a Bill of this importance through without allowing a reasonable interval between the Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. This Bill is now in the Fourth Stage. No amendments were made to the Bill in Committee.  The Bill is therefore exactly as it was discussed on the Second Reading and passed.  Is there any room for discussion on it now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly no room for a discussion on the motion which has just been decided. That is what Deputy MacEntee seems to be proposing to carry on.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>All that the Deputy has already stated has relation to the motion which has just been passed.  The practice is that on the Second Stage of a Bill a Deputy can discuss what is in the Bill and what he would like to see in the Bill.  He can go into details on Committee, and on the Report Stage he can discuss what has been done in Committee.  In this instance nothing has been done in Committee and therefore there is no room for a discussion.  On the Fifth Stage we discuss what is in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the House having done nothing to the Bill in Committee, not having cured its imperfections but having decided without having heard one of the parties to this issue, having heard only the accuser who has in his possession the proof and the documents that would vindicate not only the late Managing Director of the Board but also the former Chairman of the Board as well as the part-time members who are associated with them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not criticise the decision of the House.  There is no room for a discussion on the Fourth Stage of this Bill.  On the Fifth Stage there is a certain scope for discussion but no amendment having been made in Committee it is difficult to know what can be said on the Fourth Stage except by way of relevant amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the purpose of the Minister is to prevent an opportunity being given to put down amendments.  The Minister did not desire that the House having done nothing to amend the Bill in Committee, should mend its hand on Report.  I would like, having elicited that fact to have it on record that if we are not in a position to discuss this Bill on the Report Stage it is because of the action of the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to relax the rules about notice of amendments in the circumstances. The Deputy may be in a certain difficulty about a discussion on the Fourth Stage of the Bill, but he will have an opportunity on the Fifth Stage.  The only opportunity arising on the Fourth Stage is an opportunity for offering amendments and there are no amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not ask you to agree with me, but I put it to you that it would be quite impossible to table amendments on the Report Stage of a Bill of such far-reaching importance as this Bill which departs largely from the principle of the original Act.  This is a Bill which makes the Electricity Supply Board <Col N="2238" /> much more dependent on the Minister and which brings it more under his control than it originally was.  It would be impossible to table amendments and I am not prepared, without due consideration, to suggest amendments. In view of that, of course, it is not possible to have any reasonable discussion on the Report Stage of the Bill.  I will admit that.  I do not know whether the President or the Minister is the driving force in this matter at the moment.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly certain the President does not want to rush a measure of this importance through all its stages. If he is prepared to give us an opportunity upon another day for a discussion on the Fifth Stage, I will be prepared to allow the Fourth Stage to go through now.</P>

      <P>In view of the present feeling in the House, it is difficult for the Chair to make a suggestion.  As Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, what does remain in connection with this Bill is an opportunity for a considered statement on the Fifth Stage.  I do not think there is any room for discussion on the Fourth Stage, but there is an opportunity for presenting a considered statement on the Fifth Stage.  The question as to when the Fourth Stage will be taken has been decided.  Of course, if there is any possibility of accommodation it would be much more satisfactory.  The Deputy could make a statement on the Fifth Stage which may be taken, as far as I understand the President, to-morrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the President would decide to adjourn for a couple of hours to give us an opportunity of considering what amendments could be tabled on the Report Stage.  It is quite impossible for us to submit any amendments now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I offered every possible accommodation on this measure. I believed I was met, or almost met, and subsequently it was found that I would not be met.  I then offered to-morrow. It was refused and now, when Deputies find themselves in a difficulty, they make all sorts of appeals.  They were domination the situation a half an hour ago, and then I found that I could not allow that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not get back to the original point.  The House has decided that the Fourth Stage will be taken now and we shall then go on to the Fifth Stage.  That is what in practice it amounts to.  Deputies could take the Fifth Stage to-morrow and have a considered statement presented on that Stage, or take the Fourth and Fifth Stages to-morrow, postponing the Fourth Stage in order to permit amendments to be submitted. There is not, however, very much scope for amendment.</P>

There is no question of domination or anything of that kind.  We think it is not in the public interest to rush this Bill, and that is the basis of our action.  We are being forced by a majority to take this measure in a shorter time than we think it advisable in the interests of the public.  There is no use in having another division.

      <P>I had proposed originally on this Estimate to consider the conduct of the Minister for Finance in relation to a number of undertakings and responsibilities which he has, and particularly I had proposed to discuss the circumstances under which the Agricultural Credit Corporation had made its last issue of stock.  I will, however, reserve what I have to say in that connection for another occasion, because I understand that the House is anxious to discuss the motion which stands in the name of the Minister for External Affairs in relation to the Imperial Conference, and is anxious to have as much time as may be required for that matter.  For that reason I do not intend to do more than formally move the amendment which stands in my name, that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>There is a question I should like to ask the Minister under sub-head G, with regard to the payment for services rendered by the actuary in connection with the Teachers' Pensions Fund.  I am anxious to know what is the present situation with regard to that fund.  The Minister will recollect that he had some interviews with the representatives of <Col N="2245" /> the teachers' organisation, and on the occasion of the last interview, which took place in February or March, 1930, there was a promise given that the Minister would make certain inquiries, and thereafter would call the teachers' representatives together again and make certain proposals to them.  I understand that there have been very great delays in getting the necessary information from the Minister and I asked him questions a couple of times in the House as to what the position is.  Many people are interested to know what progress has been made in the matter and how soon the Minister hopes to carry out the promise which he gave in March, 1930, namely, to place definite proposals before the representatives of the teachers.</P>

      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy O'Connell, as he has already been informed the report of the actuary has been under consideration in the Department of Finance and the Department of Education, and in the course of that consideration it was felt necessary to ask a further question of the actuary with regard to the peak load.  It is not that we have any reason to reject or to doubt the accuracy of the estimate given by the actuary on the peak load, but in fact, his estimate was very much higher than the Departments anticipated it would be, and in connection with that he was supplied with additional figures, and he was asked a further question, and his reply is being awaited.  There was also another question in regard to a minor point, which the actuary had not answered in his first report.  That also is an answer that is expected very shortly.  It is hoped that when these two points put to the actuary have been replied to, nothing will remain in doubt, and it will be possible for us to put into final form the proposals which have been under consideration, and to submit them in whatever way we think best, both tactfully and otherwise, for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister can he exercise any superior powers over the Revenue Commissioners in one particular case of the greatest possible hardship.  It is a case I referred to at least twice in the House already.  It is the case of a man in Waterford who had two businesses on which he was charged income-tax.  There was a loss upon one business and a gain upon the other and he disputed the return made by the Revenue Commissioners to him. And while his accountant was working on the accounts he was taken away and employed on Government service. Another accountant was engaged but while he was being employed this man had a serious family bereavement which caused his own illness and he has been ill ever since.  In consequence of that the time lapsed and although the Revenue Commissioners had power under their old Acts of a more or less vague nature, they did not exercise their influence in his favour by giving him a further period of time.  He appealed in the matter, but it went against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently there was further legislation making the powers of the Revenue Commissioners clearer, and extending the time in cases where there was a reasonable cause for delay.  I <Col N="2247" /> made an appeal to the Revenue Commissioners to try to have the matter re-opened and I was informed that it was not possible to re-open it.  There was here a question of extreme hardship where illness, death and delay, caused indirectly&mdash; unconsciously no doubt&mdash;by the Government having taken away the first accounts.  I think the Minister should exercise whatever power he has in order to alleviate that position.  The sum in question amounted to £300. It was paid, and I think the Minister should consider the case and see if anything could be done in it.  I can give the Minister the name of the person privately.</P>
    <P>The other matter that I would like to refer to on this Estimate, and that I hope the Minister will look into, concerns the office of Customs and Excise. I do not know if the suggestion I am going to make has been brought to the notice of the Minister before, but very considerable savings could be made in this Department.  It is an old Department carrying with it the evil effects of its earlier history.  The Customs and Excise was formed originally and was developed along the lines of the British Government.  At present reports pass sometimes through the hands of eight persons before a matter is decided.  There are too many higher paid officials and too many surveyors in the Department. According to my information there could be a saving of from £20,000 to £50,000 in that Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J. Wolfe Mr. J. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>When these Estimates were last being discussed I drew the attention of the Minister for Finance to a practice which was growing up, as I suggested, in the Estate Duty Office.  I told the House that the Estate Duty officials in the case of a deceased trader were asking for duty, not merely on the cost price or the saleable price of goods of the deceased but, in addition, were asking that the net retail profit be added.  They asked for duty on the net retail profit which had not been realised, and which the executor or the administrator, even if he had any power to carry on, could only get by <Col N="2248" /> breaking the terms of the will and by breaking the terms of the bond.  The Minister gave me a very queer answer to that.  He stated that &ldquo;no such practice exists.&rdquo; He said unfortunately that it did occur in a case that had been considered but that it had been adjusted.  I rather suggest that it occurred in a case in which my firm was unfortunately concerned.  At all events, the Minister gave a clear and emphatic denial that such a practice existed.  On another occasion since then the same firm unfortunately found the same practice existing despite the declaration of the Minister for Finance and a similar demand was made.  The demand was insisted upon until a copy of the Official Debates containing a report of the Minister's undertaking was produced when, without comment, explanation or regret, it was withdrawn. Perhaps it was suggested that that was another slip, but I have in my possession at the moment a case which I am sending to the Minister where, in defiance of the Minister's undertaking in the House, they are still insisting on measuring the net retail profit at some ten per cent. which in this case a draper is expected to get after paying overhead expenses.  I wonder is there any use getting an undertaking from the Minister when his officials openly defy it?  It is clear to the meanest intelligence that the suggestion that estate duty should be paid on a profit not yet earned, and which can only be earned by carrying on the retail trade, is absurd and would not be tolerated in any other country or from any officials save officials who are at present occupying the Revenue Department of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commented, when the Estimate was last before the House, on the fact that for three years running, I had to draw attention to the loss of human life. My constituency during three successive years was robbed of one of its largest ratepayers and one of its largest employers of labour as a result of these demands.  In one or two instances they were people who were personally known to the Minister.  I ask the House and the Government officials to stay their hands and not to continue methods which would send <Col N="2249" /> men to their graves.  I am glad that for the first time for four years I am now in a position to say that I do not know of any fatal case following income tax demands.  It is true that during the year I did give the Minister instances in which I had to serve notice that if these methods were continued they would, in my opinion, be fatal. Up to the present the people concerned are alive.  I would again ask the Minister to pause and to consider the loss and injury that is being done to the State by charging men broadcast with fraud, by threatening them broadcast with penalties and with jail.  Surely a little moderation might be used.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would only consider the loss of revenue that has occurred to Saorstát Eireann by reason of the methods that are being used by officials of the Revenue Commissioners, apart altogether from the question of humanity, I think he would ask the Commissioners and the officials to stay their hands.  As far as I know there have been no imprisonments in my constituency during the last year, but with the events coming on I see that they are getting ready again to imprison working men and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I drew attention last year to the case of a man whose salary, owing to the bad times has been reduced to something like £2 5s. or £2 10s. and who, after paying for his board and lodgings is left with 5/- or 10/- a week. I suggested that that was not a proper case in which the man should be sent to jail for the sum which had accrued. It was a debt due to the British Government of something like £200, and under happier circumstances this man incurred it.  He is now utterly unable to pay it.  That case occurred in the City of Cork.  When it went before the judge it was adjourned from time to time, in order to give the Revenue Commissioners an opportunity of considering whether they were going to clap this man into jail. Some friends offered on his behalf £25 or £30, which is more than the authorities will be able to get if the man is sent to jail.  The order went out that the law must take its course.  The Revenue Commissioners appear to have <Col N="2250" /> no other decision in their vocabulary beyond this one &ldquo;that the law must take its course.&rdquo; That man, I understand, is to be cast into jail as an example to all other men who owe income tax, but who have no money to pay it.  Of course it is a form of blackmail, pure and simple.  It is done with the object of shaming this man's relatives into paying money which he is unable to pay, and which the Revenue Commissioners think they will get the relatives to pay, rather than face the shame of seeing this unfortunate man cast into jail.</P>
    <P>I had to draw attention on the last occasion to a case in which an unemployed man in the City of Cork, who had paid a very considerable sum in arrears of income tax, had been thrown out of employment.  He was sent to jail, not because he had no money to pay, but because it was hoped&mdash;and in result the hope was achieved&mdash;that this man's brother-in-law would be blackmailed into paying the money.  They did blackmail him and compelled him to pay the money. When I drew attention to it the Minister gave me a most crushing reply on the authority of the income tax officials, who, I am sorry to say&mdash; and I say it advisedly and as moderately as I can&mdash;are trained and expert liars.  The Minister said that in the case referred to by me, the man had £500 in War Loan.  That is untrue. I could not contradict it at the time, but I went and got the particulars and ascertained it was untrue, that the man had never a cent. in war loan in his life.  It is understood the man was living on a very paltry income, the property of his wife, to whom he had not been married at the time the income tax debt was incurred. The Minister did not stop there, and on the instructions of his income tax officials, he said the man was the owner of the house in which he lived. I knew and was positive that that was untrue.  There is not a word of truth in that.  He also said the poor law valuation of the house in which the man lived was £42.  That last is a statement that could only be made by a deliberate liar, coming from the income tax collector, because the income tax collector knows better than <Col N="2251" /> anybody else the valuation of the house in which the man lives, I tell you that was a deliberate lie.</P>

I think he should not use that language about officials who are not here to defend themselves.  He should attack the Minister who is responsible in this particular instance.  The Minister is the cock-shot, and not the officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to attack him at all, not even at the suggestion of the Chair.  What I do want to point out is that when these officials do tell what is directly contrary to the facts&mdash; that is the right way to put it&mdash;that should not be glossed over.  I only put this before the House because I put the facts before the Minister, and he, in the exercise of his discretion, ignored my letter as he was quite entitled to do.  I am daily waiting to hear that the official who supplied this incorrect information on which the incorrect reply of the Minister was based, has been promoted to high office.  I have no doubt that he will get it.  In that way I feel I am doing no harm in suggesting that when information which is without foundation is supplied to the Minister, such an official is picked out for sure and certain promotion in the Income Tax Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2252" /> On a former occasion when I drew attention to the fact that I had seen cases where officials had been looking back over accounts for as lengthy a period as 42 years, and pointed out that that was entirely wrong, the Minister told us that that did not happen at all.  I knew, of course, it did. I have seen requisitions to go back 42 years.  When the man expostulated, and said that he could not go back for 42 years&mdash;incidentally his books had been burned during the trouble, and he rather objected to going back for 42 years to prepare a set of accounts which did not exist&mdash;he was told in reply that the officer saw no reason why he should not go back for 42 years.  My recollection is that the Minister said that people are not asked to go back for lengthy periods now, but it is a fact that they are still going back for 20 years.  I suppose we must regard it as somewhat of an improvement that they do not now require accounts for 42 years, but only ask them for 20 years.  I suggest that the Minister might usefully still further reduce that period to one within the law.</P>
    <P>I have protested here before against claims for compound interest being sent out against tax payers and against the estate of deceased persons. There is no statutory authority for it.  The Minister has a nice little answer ready, in which he will say that interest was charged in lieu of penalties.  He forgets that he told the House the other day that no penalties were incurred by executors, and that the question of penalties did not apply to them at all.  I have the right to ask the Minister then under what authority executors are being charged and asked for compound interest? I wonder will one of his officials say that that is not so?  Will the Minister be in a position to tell me that claims for compound interest against the estates of deceased persons are not being made by his officials down to the present time?  I do not think they will venture to say that.</P>
    <P>There is another practice growing up in the office to which I would like to draw attention.  I have seen these instances myself and I only speak of cases which I have absolutely seen <Col N="2253" />&mdash;cases which have been shown to me.  I have no information except information secured in that way.  I have seen a case in which an agent for two persons was corresponding with Dublin Castle at the same time. In one case a man had owed some small sum for interest on deposit receipts. He had not disclosed it but he had paid income-tax on everything else for a period of thirteen years. He did not disclose the interest on the deposit receipts and a sum amounting in all to £100 had accrued. He did not plead the Statute of Limitations.  He did not say &ldquo;I will pay you for six years.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I will pay you for the full thirteen years, whatever it is and the Commissioners reply &ldquo;You will do nothing of the kind, you will pay something in lieu of interest in addition.&rdquo; The agent protested and later on he had to deal with the second case.  The Revenue Commissioners then said to him &ldquo;Because you have not agreed to our claim in A's case, we will now send B's case to the solicitor for the Revenue Commissioners in order to commence a prosecution against you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Minister stand over treatment of that sort.  Will he allow an individual taxpayer to be threatened with proceedings and penalties simply and solely because that taxpayer's agent did not agree with the Commissioners' officials in another case and contended that a man who pays thirteen years' arrears&mdash;a forgotten item&mdash;is not doing at all badly?  However that may be, what I want to know is why a man should be victimised by reason of the fact that his agent did not agree with the Commissioners' officials in another case.  There is no doubt about the case, and if the Minister wants to see particulars he can. In any service or in any department but the Department of the Revenue Commissioners an official guilty of conduct like that would be severely dealt with.  The man who does that is absolutely unfit for his job.  He does not realise the duty that he owes to the State or the duty he owes to the taxpayer. I submit that that should not be done.  With the new powers that <Col N="2254" /> the Revenue Commissioners have, and seeing that they now have got, apparently, the right to retrospective legislation, I look with a great deal of misgiving to the future.  I am familiar with the cases of men who have gone to them.  They have complained to me.  I was not present, because I would not go to an office where business was conducted on those lines.  I know that they still have been threatening the public that they will get this legislation. The Revenue Commissioners need not care one rap what the decision of any court is, because this Dáil has approved their action.  They care nothing about the law.  They are above and beyond the law.  The Minister has yielded to them in that, and they look on the Minister as one whom they have beneath their feet, and for whom they have as much contempt as they have for me.  I suggest that that is an improper practice and that these officials ought to be told that the sooner their methods are changed the better it will be for them and for everybody else.</P>
    <P>Another practice is going on still in the Revenue Office which is a scandal and which ought to be stopped.  I called attention to it before.  Those people who are threatened with a does of income-tax treatment are told that the first thing they have to do is to employ a firm of accountants, whose name is to be submitted by the officials in Dublin Castle, so that they may be suitably instructed as to what they are to do.  Would that be tolerated in any other Department?  The officials in Dublin Castle call the tune.  The taxpayer has got to pay the piper.  The dice is loaded against him, because if the accountant selected and approved of by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue does not do what he is asked &mdash;if he does not prepare the accounts up to the taxable views of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue&mdash;he will walk the plank.  He will be blacklisted, and future taxpayers will be told: &ldquo;We will take no accounts prepared by this accountant.  You must get an accountant who is ready to bend the knee to us.&rdquo; That is going on at present.  It has cost taxpayers a lot of money.  There is no doubt that these accountants are making a considerable <Col N="2255" /> sum out of income-tax practice.  It has become a substantial source of revenue, and these accountants are absolutely under the thumb of the Revenue Commissioners. They cannot prepare honest accounts or be impartial.  The penalty to which they are subject is as great as, if not greater than, the penalty meted out to the taxpayer.  It would not be going too far to abandon once and for all this practice of suggesting the names of special auditors.  If a man has to employ an accountant, he ought to be allowed to employ his own accountant. If the accounts are found incorrect, then let the income-tax officials deal with them as dishonest accounts.  But under the present system, I have seen taxpayer after taxpayer in fear and trembling of these accountants, about whom, as a rule, they know nothing. They are sent down to the limits of West Cork at enormous cost from the City of Dublin to people who never heard of them.</P>
    <P>I know one case in which a man has done everything possible to prepare accounts for six or seven years.  He is only at the commencement of his torture.  He has got a further order to go back in accordance with the new statute and we may expect that the Commissioners will receive statutory power to go back twenty years which they are doing at present without statutory power at all.  They might add that to Section 2.</P>

      <P>I suggest that illegal methods should be done away with by somebody.  Even retrospective legislation is preferable to what is being done at present in an utterly illegal manner.  Who does approve of the present system of income-tax collection? No Party in this House. I do not believe that there are five Deputies on the Government Benches who approve of it.  It is true that there is one Party who believe in putting the out-of-work taxpayers into jail.  That is the Labour Party.  The Revenue Commissioners were nobly defended <Col N="2256" /> by Deputy O'Connell.  He could not understand me when I raised a protest against unemployed men being cast into jail.  The Labour Party&mdash;I understand Deputy O'Connell spoke for them&mdash;are the only Party in this House who approve of the methods of the Revenue Commissioners. I think Deputy O'Connell was one time associated with the teachers.  The teachers of my constituency do not approve of the present income-tax methods.  No section of the community approves of the present method of income-tax collection. The result is disastrous to the revenue itself.  Year after year, men come to me and say they were driven, if you like, into dishonest practices by the events which culminated in 1921: They are now anxious to get back on the straight path. Men have come to me over and over again and asked me a question like this: &ldquo;Would I be safe in showing an increased capital of a couple of thousand pounds?&rdquo; What answer could I give to that question?  &ldquo;The moment you do you will have let loose on you all the dogs of the income-tax kennels.&rdquo; No man can make a true discovery who has got anything in the past hidden.  If he does, he will pay heavily for it.  He is not allowed to do it, with the result that he takes his capital into another country and there, by means of settlements evades income-tax here.  It is all humbug to say that it cannot be done.  It can be done and done in defiance of all statutes, <i>ad hoc</i>, retrospective and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that that is being done.  We have to-day thousands and thousands of pounds going out of the country which is paying income tax at the rate of 4/6 because people are afraid to make a disclosure with regard to the tax they owe to this country where the rate is 3/- in the pound.  That represents a substantial loss to the revenue.  If the Minister for Finance could only realise the loss to the revenue caused by the present-day methods of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue he would be the first to put an end to it if for no other reason than that the duty which people are anxious to pay to this country should <Col N="2257" /> be paid.  If the Minister were to take steps in that direction it would result in a substantial increase to the revenue of this State.  My submission is that it is foolish and wrong absolutely to turn our backs on funds that are there waiting to be collected.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I wish to refer to.  It is a practice in connection with the Probate Court.  Probate now, in most cases, has to be taken out in England and in the Saorstát.  If taken out in one country a copy of the probate and of the will has to be extracted. Certain fees have to be paid for doing this.  The probate officials now insist upon the grant being first taken out in England, or at least if it is not taken out first in England it means that they will not grant the usual facilities.  When a man knows his job he takes it out in the place where it is most economically done.  A will and probate is now taken out in the first instance in England.  The amount of revenue involved is not very large, but still it is fairly substantial and it is a foolish thing to turn it away.  It is a matter that easily could be put right.  There is no reason why a premium should be put on the taking out of a probate firstly in England.  A premium does exist.  I suggest that the matter could very easily be rectified and ought to be rectified.</P>

      <P>There is a matter on which I should like to have some information from the Minister for Finance. It is in connection with the repayment of claims.  In the case that has come under my notice it appears to be the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to hold up amounts of money which are due for repayment early in the year.  For example, amounts due for repayment in March are held up and put against income tax which is not due until July. I would like to know from the Minister what exactly is the position?  In the particular case that has been brought to my notice it appears that in 1929 the inspector acquainted the taxpayer of the fact that he proposed to apply the repayment which was due in the early portion of the year towards the payment of income tax due in July. The taxpayer wrote back pointing out <Col N="2258" /> that he did not cousent to this procedure. In 1930 the same inspector wrote to this taxpayer stating that he was going to adopt the same procedure in that year.  The taxpayer then wrote to the Inland Revenue Commissioners. They did not reply to the question asked as to whether they were, in fact, empowered to do this.  A reply came from the Claims branch simply enclosing the statement of accounts, but not denying the circumstances I have stated.  There was no explanation given.  I want to know from the Minister if the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to withhold repayments due in March until July; not to repay it, but to hold it for income tax that falls due in July.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that this Department is one of the worst offenders we have.  Deputy Wolfe described the sending of men down from Dublin to West Cork.  That, perhaps, accounts for the enormous amount spent in travelling expenses. The figure for that item in the Estimate is £20,000.  I would like to have an explanation from the Minister with regard to that.  Speaking for the farming community, there is another matter in connection with this Department that I want to refer to.  This Department appears to be paved with officials enjoying salaries of over £1,000 a year.  I find there are 46 of them.  I would like to have some explanation as to why it is necessary to have 46 men in this one Department with salaries of £1,000 a year.  In addition, the so called cost of living bonus paid to these men amounts to £187,000, which is two-thirds of the total amount collected under the sugar tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We frequently hear statements from the Minister that he has no money for many purposes that are discussed in this House.  He has no money for the old age pensioners or for widows and orphans, but he is able to provide a huge sum in the form of cost of living bonus for the officials in one Department. Apparently, the work of the Department cannot be done with less than 46 men at £1,000 a year.  Surely it is time that kind of thing were ended. Neither the Minister nor any member of the Executive Council can contradict <Col N="2259" /> the statement made in this House within the last week that the farming community, comparing the prices they received last year with the prices obtaining this year, stand to lose this year the huge sum of £5,000,000.  While that is so, we have this Department costing this vast sum of money.  Everything that the farmer is producing has to be sold at pre-war rates.  Money for the relief of agricultural rates could not be found except by putting an extra tax of ½d. in the lb. on sugar, and two-thirds of the money so raised goes to meet the cost of living bonus paid to the officials in this one Department. I would like to have an explanation from the Minister as to why it is necessary to have 46 men in this Department at salaries of £1,000 a year each.</P>
    <P>I would like to have another statement from the Minister as to how this enormous cost for travelling expenses reaches £20,000 in this one particular Department.  I would like to hear some honest explanation as to the causes for that and how it comes to be that £187,000 is paid in cost of living bonus in that Department.  On behalf of the farmers of this country who cannot pay their way I would like to be told that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Little I have only to say that the matter is not really a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, but for the Special Commissioners and was, I presume, determined by the Special Commissioners at the hearing before them in court.  If Deputy Little supplies me with the facts of the case I will have an inquiry made and let him know what they are.  I know that the Special Commissioners even before the existing legislation was passed took a fairly lenient view of appeals which were not made in time, where illness was alleged.  Even where illness was hardly serious enough to explain the failure of making appeals in proper time, the tendency was to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J.T. Wolfe dealt at great length with the administration of the Revenue Officers.  I think that for him <Col N="2260" /> his treatment was lenient.  At any rate, having in previous years accused the revenue officers of causing serious loss of human life by their methods, the Deputy gave a testimonial when he said that this year there have been no fatalities.  He referred to one mistake and accused the officials of wilfully supplying me with false information. There was an error in what I said in reply to Deputy Wolfe in that case, and it serves as an illustration of the difficulty of dealing with alleged cases of hardship which are introduced here in debate for the first time.  What happened was that a year or so ago the Deputy mentioned a case one evening here.  I was replying on the next morning and such information as could be obtained about the case was sought for in the Castle in the meantime. It was not possible to refer to the officers in Cork with a view to having that information checked.  The result of the haste with which the information was obtained was that certain property which belonged to the man's wife was ascribed to the man himself, and also certain house property which his wife owned was thought to be the property of the men and to be the house in which he lived.  The information, however, which was obtained from insufficient documents was incorrect in that I said that the man owned property which in fact his wife owned.  Nevertheless, my statement that it was not a case of the sort of hardship that Deputy Wolfe had described was quite correct.  The man in that particular case, though not employed, was not at all by way of being an unemployed working man. He was a man who had had a good salary.  He was a man who, if not directly employed, was, at any rate, engaged in business, and if he was not able to pay, his wife was able to pay, because immediately on his arrest the amount was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe suggests that the revenue officers should be severely dealt with for all sorts of faults that he finds with them.  Of course, if we were to take Deputy Wolfe's advice on these matters, it would be impossible for any revenue to be obtained.  The whole machine <Col N="2261" /> would stand still.  I think that Deputy Wolfe probably should be satisfied with his own efforts in the constant war which he wages with the officials in the revenue without appealing to me to take any special steps in the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, of course, that the suggestion he has made that accountants whose names are approved by the revenue officers for the examination of various cases where disputes arise or where the facts have to be ascertained, are under the thumb of revenue officers, is not only without foundation, but, as I think, an absurd and unfair suggestion.  The suggestion is that these accountants are under the thumb of the revenue officers, and cannot prepare an honest account.  Men of the highest reputation in the accountancy profession are employed on these things, and they are not in any way under the thumb of the Revenue Commissioners.  Nobody in the Revenue wants them to do anything more than to ascertain the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe ascribes a sort of diabolical zeal to the revenue officers. That zeal does not exist and there is no advantage to the revenue officers in obtaining anything for the revenue that is not due.  A revenue officer has a certain scale of salary.  He gets no advantage from getting additional revenue.  He is liable if he only conducts his work with ordinary zeal to have a good deal of abuse levied at him and to get very little thanks for his efforts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry asked something about the number of officials who are on the higher ranges of the salary scale.  It is necessary to have men of great ability and great experience in this particular work.  They have to fight revenue cases before the Special Commissioners and before the Circuit Courts.  They have to fight against accountants and against lawyers and barristers on the other side.  They have to discuss these cases, a task which I think exceeds in difficulty the task of any other type of public officials, and moreover the revenue officers or a great many of them are isolated.  They have to act on their own initiative and on <Col N="2262" /> their own responsibility.  They cannot receive advice or assistance that an official operating at headquarters knows is available for him.  Moreover they have the class of task which must necessarily displease many people. They have to withstand attacks and pressure which other officials have not to withstand.</P>
    <P>Moreover we have frequently had revenue officers taken away from us by banks and other institutions and given salaries very greatly in excess of what we were able to pay.  There was a period during which we were short of qualified inspectors and in that period three of our inspectors were taken away by the banks, in one case the salary given was double the salary we were paying and in the other cases there was a substantial increase over what we were paying.  It would not be possible for us to retain the right type of officer or to get work done which is difficult and unpopular work and to get it done efficiently if reasonable scales of salaries were not paid. As regards travelling expenses first a good deal of inspection is necessary. Then certain officers have wide districts over which they must travel.  I do not think there is the slightest foundation for the suggestion of Deputy Little that there is too much inspection and too much supervision.  I know that these establishments just like other establishments were carefully reviewed after the establishment of the Saorstát and in addition they are reviewed from time to time.  Every effort is made to keep the establishment expenses down to the minimum that will secure the work being done efficiently.</P>
    <P>A debate such as we have heard this year or, for that matter, in past years in connection with the Revenue Commissioners' Estimate, should convince Deputies that it is very necessary to have a strong supervising staff in order that all the problems that may arise may properly be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a question. The Minister states that those men have to fight cases before the Circuit Courts.  There is a special solicitor's office for that work, costing £3,900.

      <P>With regard to repayments, if the Deputy will supply me with particulars of cases, I will make inquiries.  I know it is not the practice. I had only one other complaint of such a thing happening, and, when the facts were examined, it was found that the tax which the repayment was held against was due months before. Possibly that is so in the case to which Deputy Derrig refers.  It certainly is not the practice to hold over repayment of money against tax that is not then due.  With regard to Deputy Briscoe's case, I could not tell the Deputy at the moment.  I know, however, that he made himself a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether any other Deputies have made themselves a nuisance in the same way I am not sure.  I certainly do not approve much of Deputies undertaking this work, or of the Revenue Commissioners dealing with Deputies in these cases.  People who are fined and who want to plead something can do so by way of their solicitors, if they have solicitors; if they have not solicitors, they can plead by way of some of their <Col N="2264" /> friends and acquaintances.  I do not think there is any need for bringing any sort of political influence into the matter.  I would not ordinarily object to Deputies who do not abuse their privileges, and who do not, more or less, haunt the offices and make themselves a nuisance.  Broadly speaking, while I do not object to the thing happening a little, I certainly would not encourage any sort of wholesale activity on the part of Deputies who, so to speak, would be really taking the bread out of the mouths of solicitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is intended to inaugurate a scheme for scholarships for children of Irish-speaking families in the Fior-Ghaeltacht.  We have had considerable difficulty in getting candidates to come forward from the Fior-Ghaeltacht for some of our public examinations, even for the preparatory training colleges.  We actually reserved a number of places for those who got 75 per cent. qualification in oral Irish.  It has been found difficult to get the number of pupils that we would like from the Irish-speaking districts proper.  That is more marked in the case of some of the Irish-speaking districts than in the case of others and, consequently, it will probably be necessary to have some sort of a geographical allocation of the scholarships that we now propose to establish.  We are not only anxious to get, for the purpose of general education in teaching, the pupils from these particular areas, but we are also anxious to influence the areas themselves. Consequently, it may be necessary to have a certain geographical division of the number of scholarships that we intend to offer.</P>
      <P>It is intended to take a number of pupils each year from the Fior-Ghaeltacht, members of Irish-speaking families, and to send them to secondary schools, in the case of girls to schools in which with the exception of English, all subjects are taught through the medium of Irish, and, in the case of boys, to one school.  There will be offered ultimately 18 scholarships each year, of which 9 will be reserved for girls.  In the case of girls, 6 free places will be reserved in the Kilmacud Training School of Domestic Economy, if the girls care for that particular profession. We are anxious to start as soon as possible and that is the reason for introducing this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Estimate is passed.  we intend to choose six girls this year from the Fior-Ghaeltacht.  There is a reason for that.  Owing to the difficulty we have <Col N="2266" /> found in getting native Irish speakers for the position of domestic economy instructress, we hope to be able to make a start, utilising the last preparatory scholarship for the purpose.  The scholarship will consist of free education at the types of school that I have mentioned for the chosen boys and girls and a certain amount each year will be allowed for necessary expenses and equipment.  We realise that in the case of many families the parents will not be able to supply necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>The sum asked for this year is only £300.  It covers six scholarships for six months beginning next September.  The ultimate cost in four or five years' time &mdash;the scholarships may be tenable for four or five years&mdash;will be £5,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Deputies will welcome this scheme.  It will be realised by Deputies on all sides of the House that, by reason of the schools in the Gaeltacht being in the main small and poor schools, the pupils there find it difficult to compete with pupils from the Breac-Ghaeltacht, or even from the Gaeltacht, in many examinations. In those circumstances such a scheme as this is necessary.</P>
      <P>It is also gratifying to learn from the Minister that the scholarships will include not only free education, but necessary expenses and equipment.  The fault that has been found with county council scholarships is that they are often not available for the poor boy, that they do not enable him to live at the same standard as the others, say, in the school or elsewhere, or even avail of the scholarships at all, on account of these other necessary expenses.  For that reason, it is gratifying to learn that these things are included, as well as free education, so that even the poorest, if they have the ability, will be able to avail of the scholarships. The Minister said that there will be six scholarships this year.  Does he mean £100 each?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection a matter occurs to me.  We know that where there are public scholarships and tests for scholarships a system of preparation generally grows up in certain particularly well-equipped schools for that purpose, and the people whom we are anxious to help in that matter must have an opportunity to go to schools of that kind.  It struck me that it might be possible for the Department to arrange some system with the national school teachers, so that there will be an opportunity for preparation afforded to likely pupils in the various areas.  Most of us know that long ago national school teachers who were particularly well qualified were able to prepare students locally for the Civil Service and other examinations.  It seems to me, if we are to achieve what we have in mind here by the institution of these scholarships, there must be some means provided by which the clever students will be given locally the amount of training that will enable them to compete successfully.  I think that the whole scheme will more or less be a failure unless we are able to bring it home to the people who are too poor to send their children to institutions which might be regarded as grinding institutions, if you like, for preparation for these scholarships.  The only way I can see of doing that, if there are to be any tests of this kind, would be to make some arrangement by which <Col N="2268" /> such a training would be given in the national schools locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can satisfy the Deputy on that.  The idea is to take them from the national schools in the Gaeltacht, as at present.  They go in for the preparatory school examination, and on the entrance to the preparatory school they will be taken in, so many from the Donegal Gaeltacht, so many from the Western Gaeltacht, and so many from the Southern Gaeltacht.  They will be taken from the pupils actually attending the national schools in the Gaeltacht, and not from grinding institutions in Dublin or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the results I hope to achieve by this is to stimulate the schools in the Gaeltacht by taking the pupils from the schools there.  I find that at present, although we have, along the lines I indicated, tried to stimulate them by reserving 50 per cent. of the places for those who get 85 per cent. in oral Irish, it has not worked.  We hope practically to force them to take an interest, so as to prepare for this examination in the Gaeltacht itself.  One of the results I hope to achieve is not merely to get the pupils from the Gaeltacht, but also to affect the schools in the Gaeltacht.</P>

It seems to me there is a far better environment there for the purpose of keeping up the Irish atmosphere than in some of the schools even of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; type he has referred to, but the Minister has to take other circumstances into consideration in that again.  Personally, I think it would be better to put them into the preparatory colleges in Dublin that have been so successful. As to the question of the Irish-speaking families, I am anxious that these scholarships should be confined to the poorest class in the Gaeltacht and that they should not be given to people in receipt of fairly substantial incomes and who ought to be in a fair way to educate their children, particularly as these people, as a matter of fact, have at present the facilities under the ordinary preparatory scholarships.  I think that this amount of money ought to be reserved very strictly for the types of cases that I think the Minister has in mind, that is poor people who are just living on small holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This sum of £1,000 is for the purpose of a grant to the Irish Aero Club.  That Club was founded in 1928 for the purpose of furthering civil aviation in this country. At present its income is derived from the subscriptions of its members and certain fees collected for instruction and flights.  Its expenses are heavy. The Club had to purchase machines and there is a certain amount of expense in connection with the maintenance and depreciation of these, and also with operations.  The Club has also to fee instructors from the point of view of tuitions for flight purposes.  The membership has fallen very considerably since its first foundation and it is represented that this is due to the fact that the Club has not sufficient machines and that it has only been able to secure the services of a part-time <Col N="2271" /> instructor.  We accept that the existence of some such Club as this is a necessity, seeing that the Government has accepted the International Air Regulations and has become a member of the International Commission for the purpose of carrying out these regulations. Secondly, we want to have something in the nature of a governing authority in the country acting in conjunction with the Ministry for the purpose of seeing that the regulations issued under the Air Navigation Code are kept.  If the Club is to function, it has been represented to us that it must improve the facilities that it gives to members and it seems most likely that this can be done by securing at least one other machine and by the payment of such monies as will provide them with an instructor on a full-time basis. There is the further point that if the Club is allowed to lapse, certain people who are now training and who are desirous of taking out a pilot's licence will have to get this elsewhere, and we want to prevent that.  If the money is granted we will have to make certain arrangements with people connected with the Club to see that the money is vested in such a way as will enable men to get certain guarantees with regard to the air regulations being carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested when this Supplementary Estimate was submitted to the Dáil on account of various references to it that have appeared in the Press from time to time.  As Deputies will remember, it was announced here at one time by Deputy Esmonde who is, I think, chairman of the Aero Club, that he had received a definite undertaking from the Government that such an estimate would be introduced for the year 1930, and that he had a written undertaking from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to that effect, but that that undertaking has been broken and consequently that Deputy Esmonde's position as a member of the Dáil was giving him very grave concern and he announced that he would have to reconsider it.  The Deputy read at the time a letter Deputy Esmonde received from the Department of Industry and <Col N="2272" /> Commerce.  Subsequent to that a sub-head was introduced in the Estimates for the Department of Defence I think to enable discussion to take place upon the matter in the Dáil.  No discussion did take place. Deputy Esmonde attended in the House when the Estimate was before it, but he failed to speak.</P>
      <P>Some time later at another function in Dublin he spoke again and referred to the failure of the Government to fulfil the written promise it had made, and described it in his opinion as a very serious breach of honour.  Now the Estimate is before us.  The Minister has given some explanation of its purpose, but it is not clear that that is the whole explanation.  The expenditure of £1,000 in the development of civil aviation in this country will produce very little result.  The giving of that £1,000 to the Aero Club does not seem likely to produce any fruitful consequences either.  It would seem that the sole reason why this Estimate is introduced and the money is to be expended is to get Deputy Esmonde out of an awkward situation.  He announced his intention of reconsidering his position as a member of the Dáil if the Estimate was not introduced.  It is now introduced.  Is this Estimate for £1,000 introduced for the purpose of keeping Deputy Esmonde here?  Is he worth it?  That is a question which members of the Dáil have to consider. There is no doubt what the answer from these benches would be, but what the answer from the benches opposite will be we do not know.  We are anxious to find it out.  Do they consider Deputy Esmonde worth £1,000? That is apparently the purpose for which the Estimate is introduced and that is a question which must be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether I would be in order on this Estimate to go into the question of the Government's general attitude towards the development of civil aviation in the country.  That was a matter that we thought we would have an opportunity of expressing our opinion upon some time on the motion down on the Paper in the name of Deputy Esmonde.  But when the motion was called Deputy Esmonde was not here, <Col N="2273" /> and it was not discussed.  Deputy Esmonde again put the motion back on the Paper and now it is not likely to be discussed for another twelve months.  If this Supplementary Estimate would give us an opportunity of ascertaining the Government's attitude towards civil aviation in general and particularly towards the projects referred to in the Press it would serve our purpose equally well.  I think the Minister in introducing this Estimate proposing to provide £1,000 for the Aero Club formed for the purpose of developing civil aviation might give some indication of the Government's attitude on the whole question.</P>
    <P>We must remember that from time to time announcements have appeared in the Press concerning projects for the development of an aviation service between stations in this country, continental and other countries, all of which disappeared after some time silently and mysteriously.  Some years ago it was even announced that the Cabinet had met and decided to establish a special department of civil aviation and to embark upon a large development scheme involving considerable cost.  Nothing more was heard about that.  Various continental firms have come here and investigated the possibility of developing an air service based on Galway, Cobh, Ballincollig and other places. Press references in connection with those activities have appeared and then no more was heard about them. What influence is at work delaying or preventing the development of civil aviation in this country?  Can the Minister give us any information on the matter?  I think he could.  We are very anxious to see the unique geographical position of the country in respect to aero service properly developed. We want that development to take place under native control.  If it is not to take place under native control we would prefer no development to take place at all.  We know there are strong military and political reasons why Great Britain should desire to exercise effective control over any civil aviation lines established here.  In that connection we would like if the Minister would tell us what <Col N="2274" /> is the position concerning the Convention referred to in the annexe to the Treaty of 1921.  Have any attempts been made to draft that Convention, and, if so, with what result?  Is the delay in the development of civil aviation here in any way consequent on the delay or failure to prepare that Convention or to the existence of that particular clause in the annexe to the Treaty?  I would be glad for some information on those matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand from the Minister's statement that the sole purpose of this £1,000 is to provide a governing body in order to fulfil certain international obligations?  If so, I think the Minister should tell us what arrangements he is going to make to see that the Aero Club will act in a responsible way and fulfil his intention.  Does he intend to be represented on the committee of the club? I am afraid as it will look in the newspapers, and as one would be justified in looking at it at the present time, it is really £1,000 to provide recreation for a certain number of wealthy people&mdash;chiefly Sunday afternoon recreation. The people who will avail of this additional machine and of this whole-time instructor, are not people who are interested in the question for any national purpose, or from any desire to see Ireland strengthened by having this service established.  They are people who have exhausted all other amusements, and they are simply out to see if there is any stimulus in this.  It is rather a strange thing if the Dáil is to be left under the impression that they are voting a large sum of £1,000 for aviation when it is simply to encourage a situation of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes no reference whatever to the attitude of the Government towards civil aviation, and whether the Government think there is any future for civil aviation in Ireland apart from international services.  One would think that that would be one of the necessary things that he would have dealt with, because it is a question on which there is great difference of opinion.  Most people hold that <Col N="2275" /> there is no future for civil aviation within Ireland, as the country is too small to allow for internal services. With regard to international services, that is a question I take it on which we would have very little to say, as it is very unlikely that international services will be organised within the Saorstát.  At least, we are entitled to some information as to what is in the mind of the Government and to more than what the Minister has stated.  To my mind, the Minister gave an inadequate reason for voting this money.</P>

      <P>I have said all that I intend to say about the sum of money for which I am asking.  I did not mention the bigger question of civil aviation, because I did not think it appropriate to this Vote.  As it has been raised, I can answer briefly that I have never yet got any scheme of civil aviation that promised a future in this country.  Any scheme that was put up was based on the experiment of paying subsidies, which this country would not be able to afford, and, as far as I am concerned, I will look for no new money for the development of civil aviation.  I do not know where Deputy Lemass gets his information about meetings being held and about all sorts of people coming forward with schemes.  Very few people have put forward schemes.</P>

      <P>I thought it was the Press, as usual.  The Deputy is very much in the air when he confines himself to Press reports.  He raised the question of the Convention annexed to the Treaty.  It has not been made yet. That Convention has nothing to do with civil aviation.  It is tied on to a particular Article of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular type of civil aviation that we are concerned with is ordinary civil aviation.  Aviation for commercial purposes is not in any way attached to the Treaty.  There is not, therefore, any hindrance to a scheme being developed here by reason of the failure to make a convention on that point.  If and when schemes are <Col N="2276" /> brought forward that seem to have a future they will be considered seriously.  Very few were put forward. I think I only knew of one that came to a point, and that demanded a subsidy that I would not take the responsibility of coming to the Dáil to ask. The club, I think, is on a good basis now.  I had actually this Vote ready for introduction, and I got leave to introduce it last year when I discovered certain things with regard to the Irish Aero Club which made me hold my hand for the time being.  I had meetings since with the board of management and with the directors, and everything is going harmoniously now. I have no reason to believe that there will be any difficulty in the future.  I intend to make certain arrangements with some of the prominent members to see that the money will be properly expended.  I do not intend at the moment to look for direct representation on the board of the club, as I do not think that could be allowed under the articles of the club.  It is desirable to keep civil aviation in a limited way, at any rate, going, and this club is doing very useful work in that way We are getting it done much more cheaply, by voluntary service and by the fees paid by the members, than we could get it in any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will not be out of order if I mention a matter that arises in connection with the debate we had yesterday on the beet-growing subsidy.  Much play was made by the Minister for Agriculture when replying about breaking agreements and on the need for honouring the national word.  An attempt was made to misrepresent our position and to make it appear that we were suggesting that an agreement which was entered into with the Sugar Manufacturing Company should be broken.  At the opening of my speech on that particular subject, I was at pains to make it clear that any proposal coming from our side would not have that effect. With regard to the particular proposal that I put forward, it should be obvious to anyone that doing what I asked should be done in the interests of our own people would not have the <Col N="2278" /> effect of breaking any such agreement. The Minister for Agriculture did not at any stage refer to the particular proposition which we put forward, and I would like to know what is his opinion upon it.  It is true that one of the Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;Deputy Heffernan&mdash;did make some reference to it, and he suggested that our proposal meant the breaking of some contract.  I hold that it did not.</P>
      <P>The proposition was this: That as the average of the normal subsidy paid for the last three or four years, since the Sugar Manufacturing Company began to operate, would not be needed this year on account of the fact that the factory would not have received as much beet as in former years, the unexpended balance should be made available for the purpose I mentioned. That is that the beet-growers who were prepared to grow beet if an economic price were given them, would not suffer any loss through having to change at the last moment to barley or other cereals.  They are going to suffer a very serious loss. There is no doubt about that.  The loss will be the price they would have to pay for organising themselves to defend their rightful interests against an unfair advantage which they feel was taken of them by a company that was being subsidised by Irish money.  I think we have a duty towards these people, and that we ought to discharge it.  The whole purpose of this scheme was to get our farmers to grow beet, to supply a factory which was ultimately to give us a portion of our necessary sugar requirements.  They came whilst it was profitable for themselves, no doubt, as co-operators. They co-operated in this national scheme.  If we are going to desert them, and if, as a result, they find themselves cut out of growing beet, it is going to mean ultimate damage to any hope of anything useful in a national way coming out of this experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this was an experiment.  Taking it as such surely if this sum of money, a sum which, I think, is estimated at £2,000,000, were going to be given and spent on that experiment, we want to see the experiment <Col N="2279" /> a success.  We do not want to stand idly by and see it wrecked. We have another experiment&mdash;the Shannon Scheme&mdash;and we, at any rate, see a tremendous danger that through mishandling by the Executive at a critical moment this scheme may be injured.  The Sugar Beet Factory is the same kind of experiment.  It is a definite experiment and we want to see it made a success.  If it is to be a success we want to get our people to grow beet.  They will not grow beet unless they get an economic price for it.  The way to secure for them an economic price is to put them in a position in which they will be able to put up a fight against the company which has, according to the Minister's own words&mdash;I am not quoting his exact words&mdash;which he has admitted to be acting at the present time in a way that the figures would not justify. We take it that an unfair advantage is being taken of the beet growers. We take it that it is our duty, giving this money for a certain purpose, to see that an unfair advantage is not taken of them, and the only way that seems practicable, within the bounds that are set by the contract, would be that we should stand by our own people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was speaking, approved of certain remarks which the Parliamentary Secretary made.  The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to imply that were we in that way to see that the beet growers, who turned over to growing corn, should not suffer loss, that somehow or other, action of that kind would be breaking the contract, or acting unfairly towards the Sugar Maufacturing Company. I cannot see how the Minister could agree with a statement of that kind.  What would we be doing in the matter except seeing that a section of our own people, who are going under present circumstances, to suffer a loss, do not suffer a loss because they have been co-operating and are prepared to co-operate in the national experiment? As I say, I have availed of this opportunity to get from <Col N="2280" /> the Minister his views on the matter.  It seems to me to be a practical proposal.  The only way we can see that an unfair advantage is not taken of our people is to say to them, &ldquo;Very well; you would not be given an economic price for your beet. You have land prepared to sow beet. You had to turn over to a crop which you would not probably have taken to if you had a choice of letting the land lie fallow or putting some crop into it. You will suffer a loss on this account.&rdquo; We think, as the Minister said, that that they had the equities in this case. Why should not we stand by them and see that they do not suffer a loss, to see to what extent it is practicable to come in and aid them, and see that the loss is not heavier than it need be? That is my position.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear that our proposal does not imply breaking the contract, that we have no wish to break the contract.  Whatever contracts are made we may dispute, whether they are good or bad, but I have not suggested that we should break them.  I do hold, however, that we should stand by our own people and see that they do not suffer a loss, and that the Minister should say to the Sugar Manufacturing Company: &ldquo;Very well, our opinion is that you could pay this price to our people for beet.  They are not prepared to grow beet at the price you offered.  It would be uneconomic for them, and we cannot see them suffer the loss that would be imposed upon them, and we will therefore have to come to their aid.&rdquo; The value of that aid would be this, that then the Sugar Manufacturing Company would realise very quickly that they were not going, on account of the circumstances that have been created, to squeeze our people into accepting an uneconomic price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy de Valera, one of the first things that would have to be determined, if we wanted to do anything of the kind, would be to establish what was a fair price.  It would be quite impossible for the Minister to determine what loss the people would have suffered unless he knew, or could determine, what was a fair price for <Col N="2281" /> beet.  Therefore, the Minister for Agriculture would constitute himself an arbitrator as to what was a fair price for beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Moreover, if the Minister for Agriculture determined that all growers were to be compensated for any loss, if the factory did not offer what he thought was a fair price, the position would be that nobody would grow beet, and everybody would claim compensation from the Minister.  The position then would be that we would have compulsory arbitration forced on the factory.  We would have the Minister determining the price that the factory ought to pay.  We would have the Minister offering compensation to everybody who would not take that price.  Thereby the Minister would deprive the factory of the possibility of getting beet at any price other than at the price which he would have determined.  We would, therefore, have arrived at the position of compulsory arbitration.  It seems to me that compulsory arbitration in that form, whether you call it a breach of contract or not, would be morally a breach of contract.  It would involve the Minister in creating a situation which was not contemplated in the contract.  That is what I say in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has another leg.  There is no question of patriotism or anything of that kind in this, it is a matter really of business.  Would it be said if it happened that the beet growers got a big organisation and refused to grow for any price other than an impossible price for the factory to pay, that we should give the factory the subsidy, even though they made no sugar?  I am looking at it now from the Finance point of view.  I would not contemplate giving the factory a penny if they did not make sugar, no matter what the causes were that prevented them from making sugar.  I do not believe that we should let money flow out of the Exchequer in connection with the beet sugar subsidy for beet that is not given.  This is only the beginning of an experiment.  This dispute is only one <Col N="2282" /> of many disputes.  Assume we have the subsidy period ended.  Assume we had the factory in any hands you like.  There is going to be every year more or less of a dispute between the factory and the growers.  You will have the factory saying that beet should be a certain price and you are going to have the farmers saying that that price is not an economic price.  I believe myself that instead of ensuring the success of the enterprise by intervention which would force the hands of either side we would prevent the industry ever taking root by doing so.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, while we may use persuasion to try to bring people to a more reasonable frame of mind, what we have really got to do is to let economic factors come into play.  There are two sides, one depending on the other.  The farmers cannot make a profit out of beet-growing unless the factory can carry on. The factory cannot make a profit unless it can offer a price which will induce the farmers, when all sorts of organisations have been carried on, to grow a sufficient quantity of beet.  I think that is how the matter must be regulated.  There is no doubt that the factory this year&mdash;this is the general opinion of those who have examined the figures&mdash;could have paid a greater price than they did.  If they had paid a slightly greater price, they would probably have got all the beet they wanted and made a profit.  Having overreached themselves by offering a small price, instead of making a profit, they are going to incur a loss. There you have the ordinary economic factors operating.  They will have to continue to operate as long as the industry goes on.  If we are to start butting in and treating this industry on a basis different from all the other industries of the country, we are going to have not only an impossible position, but, ultimately, to have extraordinary and unnecessary burdens thrown upon the taxpayers elsewhere throughout the country.  It was a misfortune that this dispute occurred, but it is a misfortune which, I think, is not without compensations.  It certainly serves to bring home to the factory-owners, if it were necessary to <Col N="2283" /> bring it home to them more definitely, that the co-operation of the farmers is essential.  I have little doubt that negotiations will be resumed, and that the whole question of beet-growing will be settled.  I do not think that we can undertake to pay anybody a subsidy for not being able to strike a bargain.  It would lead us into all sorts of difficulties.  In fact, the proposition is so absurd, it would not have been made but that this matter got a lot of electioneering discussion, which distorted people's views about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the Minister's argument was based on future years.  I am talking about the loss being incurred in the present year.  As the Minister knows, the Sugar Manufacturing Company waited until the last possible moment, expecting thereby that when the farmers had their land prepared, they could force them to take a price which was regarded by the farmers generally as uneconomic.  I take it the position is this: we have either to allow our people, who were prepared to co-operate, to suffer, or we have to come to their assistance. As they were prepared to co-operate in this experiment, we should not leave them in the lurch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this matter which I do not wish to be entirely forgotten.  I should like to say a word on behalf of the taxpayers of the non-beet growing counties. I should like the House to look at the matter from the point of view of the county I myself represent and many other counties which are in the same position.  While I do not want to press this aspect of the question&mdash;I prefer to look at these matters from the broad national point of view&mdash; there is something to be said for the taxpayers of these counties.  As I understood Deputy de Valera's argument, there is a vote of £160,000; assuming that only £60,000 goes to the beet factory, what would be left over <Col N="2284" /> should go to the people in these particular areas who are suffering a loss this year because of the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of how much of the £100,000 would go&mdash; whether it would go in whole or in part&mdash;would depend on what would be regarded as fair compensation, so that the farmers of these areas would not suffer a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>So that they would be compensated for the loss they incurred this year because they did not grow beet.  I think that farmers in the non-beet growing counties might say: &ldquo;These beet growers have done fairly well in the last four or five years. During that period we have subsidised them.  This year they are making a loss.  But we were making a loss ourselves in the last three or four years when they were doing well.  The money necessary to enable the beet grower to do well was paid by us and we are finding it difficult enough to struggle on and keep our heads above water.&rdquo; While I do not want to press that point of view, I think it has to be considered.  If this sum is not all to go to the factory, the balance which remains will go into the National Exchequer and the ordinary taxpayer throughout the Twenty-Six Counties will have, to that amount, less taxation to pay.  It may not be very much but relief in taxation will be afforded to that amount.  The ordinary farmer in Mayo, Kerry or Donegal, if this question were put to him, would probably think he had some reason to complain and would say that these beet growers got so much during the last five or six years.  I am sure he would complain.</P>

The amendment refers to Section 23 which gives the Minister for Agriculture power in certain circumstances to exercise the functions of the Veterinary Council in cases where the Veterinary Council was not carrying out its functions properly.  It was suggested in the Seanad that the Minister's powers to take over and control the Veterinary Council should be limited to those things which the Council was required to do, and should not apply to those things which it was given leave to do.

      <P>I move that the Dáil disagree with the Seanad in this amendment.  The amendment cuts at the heart of the whole Bill.  It means that for the future the only offence possible in this country with regard to veterinary practice is falsely representing oneself as being a registered veterinary surgeon, or as being a veterinary surgeon, or by the use of any colourable imitation of either of these terms representing oneself as being a qualified veterinary surgeon. The amendment really does away with the idea of a register.  If the amendment were to stand there is no reason why any one in the future should go on the register.  In fact, the best way that a man could practise as a veterinary surgeon in this country in the future would be by getting a degree in some country other than this, and by putting up a plate with the inscription &ldquo;Veterinary Surgeon, not registered in the Free State.&rdquo; That would take him out of the law.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the Report of the Commonwealth Conference, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take such steps as they think fit to give effect thereto.</P>
      <P>On account of the matters that have been occupying my attention during the week I propose in moving this motion to refer much move copiously to notes than is my custom.</P>
      <P>This House has had before it the Report of the Conference held in 1929. That Conference dealt with the operation of Dominion legislation.  Part 6 of the present Report deals under (a) with the report of that Conference.  It indicates that the Conference of 1930 approved of and adopted it as part of this Report.  I do not propose at this stage to examine again the details of the Report of the 1929 Conference. I would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that those comparatively few&mdash;twelve or thirteen&mdash;pages of this Report which relate to those relations of Great Britain to the other members of the Commonwealth which were formerly regulated by a central Executive and a central Parliament mark, definitely and clearly, the end of an epoch. They are the last chapter in the history of one of the most highly organised and effective legal systems of which there is any record.  I stated to the House two years ago that it was the purpose of the Conference of 1929 that the whole legal machinery of the old Colonial Empire should be taken asunder in so far as the Commonwealth of Nations was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1930 I submitted to the judgment of the House that the recommendations <Col N="2291" /> of the Conference of 1929 had carried out that purpose. The Conference of 1930 approved the recommendations of that of 1929, and that approval closes the story.  The system which it took centuries to build up has been brought to an end by four years of assiduous concentrated collaboration between the lawyers and the statement of the States of the Commonwealth.  I say four years, because the beginnings of this task were made at the Conference of 1926 at the instance of the late Vice-President of the Irish Free State and his colleagues at that Conference. Let me, for one moment, advert to what precisely this Part of the Report means.</P>
    <P>You cannot approach the consideration of this subject&mdash;the subject of the relationship between Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;as if it had no history, no genesis, no development, no chequered background of alternate controversy, constraint, concession and ultimate progress.  When the Irish Free State came into existence in 1921 we happened to strike in at a definite stage in the evolution of the other members of the Commonwealth.  But their evolution, though politically rapid, had been slow from the point of view of the legal expression of the political facts.  There was a whole hinterland of highly anomalous law to be cleared out of the way, and an elaborate system of administrative practice to be transformed or discontinued.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree with me when I say that there can be no two views on the question that when this country accepted the status of Canada in certain respects in 1921 the status of Canada then accepted was not a stereotyped legal formula.  Therein lies the kernal of the whole Treaty position and the key to the progress that has gone on&mdash;I will not say at our whole behest, or even always at our instance&mdash;since 1926.  How well the founders of this State builded the developments which have since taken place go to show.  The task begun in 1926&mdash;the first Commonwealth Conference <Col N="2292" /> since the Treaty, in which we took an active part&mdash;is completed in the paragraphs written down in Part VI. of this Report.  What will be the result when the enactments referred to there are passed into law?</P>
    <P>[<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Let me take, first of all, the declaration set out on page 18 of the Report: &ldquo;No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested and consented to the enactment there of.&rdquo; I should point out that there is a slight misprint in the declaration as it appears in the Report: the words &ldquo;in force in&rdquo; should be deleted and the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; inserted instead.  That declaration amounts to an act of renunciation by the British Parliament to legislate for the members of the Commonwealth.  If any Deputy has doubts about it let him consult the text of this Report on page 18 itself. So sweeping was the declaration that it was feared that it put the British Parliament in a worse position vis-a-vis the members of the Commonwealth than that in which the Parliament of any State (not a member of the Commonwealth) stands in relation to other States generally.</P>
    <P>I should explain that in more detail. The House is aware that although the Parliament of the French Republic does not legislate for the German Reich, nevertheless, the laws of the French Republic can have effect in respect of acts done in German territory. The United Kingdom delegates at the Conference of 1930 feared that if the declaration stood in the form first set out on page 18, the effect would be to prevent any statute of the British Parliament from having &ldquo;the operation which the legislation of one State normally has in relation to the territory of another.&rdquo; In other words, they feared that the effect of a declaration in the form referred to would be to prevent an Act of the British Parliament which declared bigamy unlawful <Col N="2293" /> having any effect if the bigamous act took place in, say, Canada or South Africa, whereas the bigamous act would be an offence punishable under its law if it took place in France or Germany.  That view was met by the insertion of the words &ldquo;as part of the law of the Dominion&rdquo; in the draft declaration in the place where it now occurs in italics.</P>
    <P>The result of the amendment is that while the declaration will now have the effect of preventing a British statute from operating in the territory of any of the States of the Commonwealth proprio vigore, i.e., in the manner in which such an Act had effect previously, and still has in the British colonies and dependencies, it will, at the same time, not expire on the frontiers of those States, but will operate to enable the British courts to take cognisance of acts done either in accordance with or contrary to the statute within the territory of those States as they do acts so done within the territory of, say, the United States or Japan.  In a word, the principle of international comity is preserved.</P>
    <P>But apart from this difficulty of interpretation, what is the essential doctrine fastened into that declaration?  That declaration will not remain merely as a record in the report of a conference of delegates from the various parts of the Commonwealth.  It will become at the end of this year an enactment in a British statute.  And its effect then will be to destroy as a matter of law what has already been destroyed as a matter of practice, the legislative sovereignty of the British Parliament in the Commonwealth in the sense in which it existed and functioned since the foundations of the Colonial Empire were laid.  The importance of that achievement is beyond question.  I do not want to overstress it, but I do not want to have the effect of it minimised.</P>
    <P>If I am asked why this result could not have been achieved in another way, by an agreement, for example&mdash;an agreement resembling the Treaty of 1921, I will say that it could have been achieved in that way and that an agreement to effect the same result was in fact discussed.  But so long as the <Col N="2294" /> result aimed at was secured it did not matter much how exactly it was carried out.  But if I am asked why was it proposed that the declaration referred to and the other declarations in this part of the report should go into a British statute at all, my answer is this&mdash;a very simple answer&mdash;that you would have had a British statute in any event, a statute ratifying the agreement, but that, above all, you had to have an Act of that particular Parliament by which the powers now taken away, the rights now denied, were exercised.  One has not heard of a Canadian statute applying to South Africa in the same way&mdash; i.e., of its own force and with the authority of a sovereign Parliament exercising jurisdiction in South Africa behind it&mdash;as that in which a British statute applied to Australia or Newfoundland. It was the British Parliament only which legislated in that way. Hence this declaratory British statute. Or, to put it in another way, this declaration must be understood in two senses, or rather, it must be viewed from two angles.  It must be viewed from the point of view of the history, which it ends as well as from that of the history which it begins.  The last words in the long story of British legislative supremacy occur nowhere more fittingly than in a statute passed as its own deliberate act by the assembly most closely associated with that phenomenon.  Lastly, there were the courts&mdash;you had to put an end to speculative judicial thought, you had to coerce the judicial mind, I do not say here, but in those States of the Commonwealth where the Imperial statute&mdash;as it was called&mdash;ran for so long, and where the swift sword of the Colonial Laws Validity Act had been wielded so frequently and dealt such quick disaster to the laws of their own Parliaments.  And the House will agree that the only way in which to coerce the judgment of lawyers trained in such a tradition was by putting an end once and for all to the principle upon which it rested, putting an end to it in a definite legal way, a way which would leave no margin what ever for those amazing speculations in which judges sometimes indulge&mdash;in a word, by an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2295" /> I do not hesitate to say that the constitutional status of Canada would have advanced far beyond the stage which it had reached when the statesmen of that country had to exact the right to sign the Treaty of Versailles, had not the distinguished and learned judges of that Dominion failed to read aright the measure of her independence. But that chapter also ends in the declaration here made.</P>
    <P>In the schedule on page 19 of the Report the first clause is that containing the declaration that the Parliaments of the States of the Commonwealth have full power to pass laws having extra territorial operation.  I dealt fully with this clause last year and endeavoured to reply to some criticism of it from the benches opposite. The declaration is quite clear and I do not think that Deputies can have any doubt either as to its meaning or its importance.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that the theory that the old-time colonies of the British Empire as formerly constituted could not pass laws having extra-territorial operation rested upon a judicial decision and not upon any express statutory limitation in the Acts by which those colonies were constituted or governed.  The validity of that decision was always a matter of doubt, and the principle of it was broken in upon by some&mdash;but not many &mdash;subsequent decisions.  I do not propose to reopen the discussion (now as a result of the Report of 1929 and this Report of interest only to the constitutional historians of the old British Empire) as to the validity of that decision&mdash;McLeod's case&mdash;here. I want to say that upon a foundation so uncertain a vast structure of theoretical law and administrative practice was superimposed.  Laws so fundamental to a nation's political and economic life as the Nationality Law and the Merchant Shipping Law were affected by it.  A Canadian citizen ceased to be a Canadian citizen when he left Canada to spend the week-end in New York; an Australian vessel ceased to be legally Australian when she sailed the waters of the Pacific or the Indian Ocean.  All that <Col N="2296" /> sort of consequence followed from the decision that McLeod was not a bigamist because his second marriage took place outside the colony of New South Wales in a territory which the statute of the New South Wales legislature under which he was tried was held not to reach.</P>
    <P>All that sort of consequence was, of course, in direct conflict with the new status of the members of the Commonwealth. The States of the Association of which we became members in 1921 refused to regard the principle of a thirty years' old legal decision as consistent either with the sovereign rights of their Parliaments or the international position which they had established, and which called for legislative powers commensurate with their individual responsibility in respect of their own nationals abroad and their responsibility to the other States of the world in those matters where by international law or usage responbility &ldquo;is engaged.&rdquo; To confine the jurisdictional horizons of the legislature of the old British colony to its territorial boundaries was perhaps, although doubtful in law, wise Imperial policy in the days of a unitary Empire with undivided responsibility and undistributed control by a central Executive and a central Parliament.  But it was a policy which was at once overwhelmed and overborne by the pressure of political events.  And the function of the 1929 Conference was to make the law square with the events which had subverted it.</P>
    <P>But let me advert to an aspect of this question which the House should not lose sight of.  When I say that the policy of what I must call for purposes of historical accuracy the Imperial Government was to confine the jurisdiction of the colonial assemblies to their own confines, and that that policy was broken by events, and that the purpose of this clause is to make the law square with the new political facts, I do not mean that the object or effect of this statute is, or will be, to write a new legal Constitution for the Commonwealth of Nations.  Let there be no mistake about that.  This clause illustrates very clearly the declaratory <Col N="2297" /> character of the whole statute.  The House will observe that the clause is cast in a form which assumes the existence of the extra-territorial power at the present time.  This statute will confer no new legal powers so far as the Irish Free State is concerned. It merely declares the pre-existence of the other States of the Commonwealth.  It is a direction; a definition, and a demonstration and proof in the most solemn form possible by the British Parliament that an entirely new situation has come into existence and that the former legal unitary State has gone the way of the former political unitary State and of the former diplomatic unitary State so far as States like Canada and ourselves are concerned.</P>
    <P>A Deputy last year asked what interest we had in these things.  He acknowledged that, so far as, say, Canada and South Africa were concerned, these clauses had a significance having regard to the historical background&mdash;the legal background&mdash;on which, so far as those countries were concerned, these events were going forward. That is precisely what I meant a moment ago when I said that you cannot approach the consideration of this subject as if it had no history, no genesis, no development and no background of that kind.  It had such a background, and if it because it had, that this statutory method, so far as those countries are concerned, was regarded as desirable and necessary.  I must tell the House that the question of method was discussed and explored.</P>
    <P>How was the whole story to be ended?  Should it be ended by Agreement? Or should it be done by Statute?  Or should it be done by a record in a report?  Those States, like Canada and South Africa, where the territorial limitation was imposed and recognised, where the Colonial Laws Validity Act applied, where the legislation of the British Parliament extending to them was frequent and far-reaching&mdash;those countries were not satisfied with a record in a report&mdash;a report without legal authority or significance or force.  They wanted something more, something to end a legal situation in a legal way.  Should <Col N="2298" /> it be an Agreement?  That method also was discussed and I will tell the House why, so far as we are concerned, it was undesirable.  It was undesirable because we were unwilling to suggest in any way that the territorial limitation applied to the Irish Free State, or that the Colonial Laws Validity Act applied to the Irish Free State and so on, and we felt that a certain type of Agreement would imply the previous application to us of those doctrines and those laws; and that it was by virtue of the Agreement that they ceased to apply.  But we take the view&mdash;an uncontroverted view&mdash;that those doctrines and those laws did not survive to us as a result of the Treaty of 1921, and we were, therefore, unwilling to have them dealt with, so far as we were concerned, in that way.</P>
    <P>We came to the third method&mdash;the Statute.  I think Deputies will agree that that was the correct method for those members of the Commonwealth to which I have been referring.  Will the House not recollect that when the Statute of 1779 was passed enacting that the British Parliament had no right to govern the North American colonies, it was passed in the form &ldquo;be it declared and enacted&rdquo; used in this text?  And will any Deputy say that that Statute has not marked the termination of British rule in that part of the world?  And has that Statue ever been quoted as part of the Constitution of the State which succeeded those colonies on that continent?</P>
    <P>That, then, is the position.  I do not propose to delay longer on that aspect of the matter.  I think that it will be agreed that the statutory method was the best in the circumstances in which other members of the Commonwealth found themselves, and which go to the root of this whole question.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell last year raised the definition of the word &ldquo;Dominion.&rdquo; He asked why it was expressed to include the Irish Free State; why, if all those rights and powers referred to in these clauses were already inherent in our status under the Treaty, it was necessary to include us in the definition of the word &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; at all.  I hope the <Col N="2299" /> Deputy did not mean that by the inclusion of the Irish Free State in that definition the rights and powers referred to were for that reason and by virtue of that definition being conferred upon the Irish Free State by this Statute.  That, as the Deputy must know, is not the case.  He must not deduce a conclusion so fundamental&mdash;and so fundamentally wrong&mdash; from the insertion in these clauses of what is no more than a rule of interpretation.</P>
    <P>We in our own statutes have frequently to refer to the United Kingdom. We have to define the expression &ldquo;United Kingdom.&rdquo; We will frequently in future have to refer to the States of the Commonwealth generally, including the United Kingdom, and we will have to define the expression &ldquo;States of the Commonwealth&rdquo; also. The British Parliament in their Act, and this statute will be theirs purely and simply, need to define the word in which they propose to refer in future statutes to the States of the Commonwealth. No constitutional doctrine whatever follows from, or is created, or assumed by that definition.  It is an interpretation clause merely.  If I have made that point clear I wish, before passing to the clause on the Colonial Laws Validity Act, to make one other observation, and it is this.  The power of this Parliament to pass laws having extra-territorial operation has nowhere been denied, because it is undeniable. The matter has not come on a direct issue before our own courts, but in the only case in which it has fallen to be judicially considered the following language was used by Judge Fitzgibbon: &ldquo;I am not prepared to hold that legislation in this country making it a crime for persons to conspire against the peace, order, and good government of this country, or to defraud our customs, or to violate our laws necessarily invalid because of the secondary opinion in McLeod's case, nor that our courts would not have full jurisdiction to deal with such offenders if they should happen to come within the limits of the Saorstát.&rdquo; (Alexander v. Circuit Court Judge of Cork, 1925, 2 I.R., p. 170).  I refer to this dictum-a dictum which is significant although <Col N="2300" />&ldquo;obiter&rdquo;&mdash;for one purpose only, namely, to show that the form of this clause was advisedly declaratory, advisedly drawn in words which assume the existence at the present time of the powers to which it relates so far as the Irish Free State is concerned.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, Deputies will observe that the repeal of this statute is absolute and unconditional in respect of those members of the Commonwealth to which it was held to apply.  It may be asked why the Act was not repealed in words such as these: &ldquo;The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, shall be and is hereby repealed&rdquo;; but it will be borne in mind that the Act is to remain so far as the colonies and dependencies are concerned, and the proper form to adopt was the form found in this clause.  There is a clean-cut repeal so far as the members of the Commonwealth to which I have referred were affected by the Act at any time.</P>
    <P>There follows the declaration contained in sub-clause (2).  The House will at once observe the effect and the object of that sub-clause.  The first sub-clause would have been sufficient. But the whole policy of this method of ending the former legal position called for something more; it called for a declaration in the contrary sense of the principle to be abolished.  That principle was taken and the direct negative&mdash;in the very words of the Colonial Laws Validity Act itself&mdash; was set up as the principle of the new position.  The Conference was dealing with something more than an Act of Parliament.  It was dealing as the terms of reference show with something more than the principle embodied in that Act; it was dealing with the principle underlying it as well. In one enactment it destroyed the Act itself and the legal principle it embodied; in the other it asserted a contrary principle which bore down upon the principle that lay at the very foundation of the statute repealed, namely, the principle of the super-sovereignty of British legislation generally. The whole notion of &ldquo;legislation repugnant to British legislation&rdquo; disappears from Canadian or South African jurisprudence.  In ten years' <Col N="2301" /> time Canadian or South African law yers whose eyes have been trained to look for some lurking and obscure inconsistency between Canadian or South African statutes and British. Acts of Parliament extending to Canada or South Africa will not know or care&mdash;except in the sense in which they know and care what laws are made in the United States or the Netherlands or in the States of the Commonwealth or of the world generally&mdash;what law runs in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the clause set out in paragraph 3 of page 20. It is reprinted there from page 18.  The clause set out in paragraph 4 does not relate in any way to the Irish Free State.  The definition clause contained in paragraph 5 I have explained to the House.  And that contained in paragraph 6 is a special subject matter to which I will refer in a moment.  The clause set out in paragraph 7 is special to New Zealand.</P>
    <P>We come then to the recitals to be inserted in the proposed legislation. The first recital relates to the non-application of future statutes of the British Parliament to the States of the Commonwealth.  I want the House to look again in this connection at paragraph 55 of the Report of 1929. &ldquo;Practical considerations,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;affecting both the drafting of Bills and the interpretation of statutes make it desirable that this principle should also be expressed in the enacting part of the Act.&rdquo; That is another way of putting the point which I have been endeavouring to emphasise all through. A recital would have been sufficient in so far as we were concerned.  But you had the other States of the Commonwealth with a long tradition of British legislation operating in their territory. Those States wanted a legal termination of that situation.  They wanted something more than a recital in the statute&mdash;which had to be passed anyway to repeal the Colonial Laws Validity Act, e.g., they wanted an actual enactment.  I think that Deputies will agree that having regard to the legal background of the whole matter in Canada or Australia this was the proper course for those States to adopt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> The second recital is that relating to the Crown.  I stated to the House last year the reason for this particular recital.  But I should like to restate it in a very few words.  The legal ties that bound, say, Canada and Australia to the United Kingdom will disappear when this Act becomes law. The legal restrictions upon the powers of the Parliament of Canada and the Parliament of Australia will be removed. There will be no limitation, no restriction whatever.</P>
    <P>The House will notice that that fact is repeated in various ways through the Report of 1929.  The frequency of the phrase &ldquo;the new position&rdquo; is not accidental; it is deliberate.  There is the ending of a chapter, an epoch&mdash; a history in which the legal and legislative predominance of the United Kingdom Parliament is plain to be seen.  But &ldquo;by the removal of all restrictions upon the legislative powers of the Parliaments of the Dominions,&rdquo; says paragraph 58 of the Report of 1929&mdash;&ldquo;and the consequent effective recognition of the equality of those Parliaments with the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the law will be brought into harmony with the root principle of equality governing the free associations of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo; The House will notice the emphasis throughout upon what is being done.  The law, the legal position, is being made to square with the central and predominant political fact of absolute freedom and unequivocal co-equality.  And in the light of that conception of the matter the recital relating to the Crown is inserted.  The States of the Commonwealth control the Crown and the prerogatives of the Crown absolutely. But the Crown function is accepted in the arrangement to which we have become parties.  You could not, therefore, have a series of Acts of Parliament throughout the Commonwealth dealing with, say, the succession in different ways.  That would be undesirable. The function of the Crown may be exercised in a different way here from that in which it is exercised in Canada; that is a matter of the substance and form of the advice given here and that given in Canada.  You <Col N="2303" /> could legislate for the Crown, here in a way different from that in which it is legislated for in the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom might, e.g., restrict a certain royal prerogative by statute.  The Oireachtas might abolish the same prerogative so far as the Irish Free State is concerned. There is no doubt whatever about that.  But there had, in the nature of things, to be some arrangement to prevent the whole association from being confused within itself by conflicting legislation as to such a matter as the succession.  The association is a free association.  Freely, therefore, the members of it undertook this arrangement relating to the Crown which is the symbol of the free association of them all.</P>
    <P>I do not fear that the House will deduce from this arrangement any doubts as to the several capacities of the King, or draw any erroneous conclusion to the effect that the States of the Commonwealth are a political or diplomatic unit.  When a Heads of States Treaty is ratified by the King on the advice of the Government of the Irish Free State the whole transaction is the transaction of the Irish Free State.  The King acting on the advice of the British Government can no more contract for the Irish Free State than can the King of Italy or the Mikado of Japan.  The conclusion of the Treaty in the Heads of States form is merely an old-established international usage.  In its binding force it differs in no way whatever as a matter of international law from an inter-governmental agreement.  But what I want to emphasise is the fact that no argument whatever is open on the agreement as to the King to the effect that for diplomatic purposes, or political purposes or purposes of international life and action the Commonwealth of Nations is a single entity.  When we agreed to this recital in the form in which it appears, the form which says that &ldquo;the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; and went on to say that &ldquo;any alteration in the law touching&rdquo; the matters referred to in this context would require <Col N="2304" /> the assent of all the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, we were simply stating that in the exercise of our sovereign legislative powers which exist apart from and over and above all other considerations, which are supreme, paramount and uncontrolled we would have regard to the desirability for uniformity of reference to the symbol of the Association and the desirability for avoidance of legal confusion in regard to the succession. That is the extent of the meaning of this recital.  It assumes the absolute inherent right of each of the Parliaments to legislate for the Crown without regard to these considerations.</P>
    <P>In the matter of Merchant Shipping you had a legal situation to deal with, so far as the States of the Commonwealth were concerned, in which the restrictive provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts and the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, were in force. You had to get rid of those provisions in a recognised legal way, by enacting that they ceased to apply.  I examined the effect of the clause relating to merchant shipping legislation last year. I then stated my views on the Report of the 1929 Conference in this particular. I do not propose to reiterate those views now, except to say that shipping regulations are obviously matters upon which general uniformity is desirable, consistent with national interests and requirements.  The House is aware that shipping regulations tend more and more to be governed by international conventions. You have the eight international labour Conventions, dealing with a number of matters which it is not necessary to go into in any detail now. You have the Convention on regulations relating to safety of life at sea signed in 1929; you have again the Convention respecting Load Lines signed at London on the 5th July, 1930.  More and more there is an approach to international standardisation in regard to the regulation of matters relating to the protection of life and property borne in ships upon the oceans of the world.  Where that is so, where there is such an approach and progress is made at international discussions on matters of that kind we will come into the international <Col N="2305" /> arrangements made.  Meantime, certain standards have been laid down under the law heretofore passed for the whole Commonwealth and these will be preserved.  They will be preserved not by virtue of the Consolidation Act of 1894 and the Acts amending it, but by our own laws, the provisions of which will conform in so far as conformity is agreed to be desirable to the provisions of the &ldquo;Agreement as to British Commonwealth Merchant Shipping.&rdquo; That Agreement will not itself be ratified by statute here or in Great Britain or elsewhere.  It will remain as a standard to which the various statutes on this subject will conform in so far as it states the matters on which uniformity is desirable.</P>
    <P>On the matter of Nationality the Report affirms paragraphs 73 to 78 inclusive, of the Report of 1929.  It says that &ldquo;it is for each member of the Commonwealth to define for itself its own nationals.&rdquo; The law of each Nation of the Commonwealth will henceforth confer a status on its nationals which will be recognised throughout the Commonwealth and outside the Commonwealth.  Paragraph (4) on page 20 says that &ldquo;the possession of the common status in virtue of the law for the time being in force in any part of the Commonwealth should carry with it the recognition of that status by the law of every other part of the Commonwealth.&rdquo; In other words our law will confer the status and the law of Canada and South Africa, etc., will recognise the status thus conferred. Similarly our law will recognise the status conferred by the Canadian or the South African statute.  This arrangement is based upon two things: the separate and distinct nationhood of this country from Great Britain, of Canada from New Zealand, etc., and the desirability for mutual recognition of the status of the nationals of the various countries of the Commonwealth.  The essential point is that you have not a single Commonwealth nationality based upon a single law.  It is not a single Commonwealth nationality at all, or even a dual nationality.  The Irish <Col N="2306" /> Free State national will be that and nothing else so far as his nationality is concerned.  His own nationality law will rule him and his own State, through its representatives abroad, will protect him.  The treaty benefits of our treaties with other countries will accrue to him by virtue of his Irish nationality.  And the recognition of his Irish nationality will be Commonwealth-wide and world-wide.</P>
    <P>The short paragraph on the subject of nationality of married women needs no elaboration.</P>
    <P>The trend and direction of the general argument contained in the Report of 1929 and this Part of this Report has already arrested the attention of those international publicists and lawyers who have made the evolution of the new world system of State relationships their special study. The significance of this Report will not, therefore, I am sure, elude the notice of this House.  When we came into existence as a separate State in 1921 the new system of State relationships under the aegis of the League was hardly two years old.  We came into it during its formative period. The Nations of the Commonwealth who sat at the Peace Table in 1919 were beginning their international life.  The founders of the Irish Free State were quick to see the course of world events and the inevitableness of the developments which were to make Canada and South Africa and the others co-sharers in the international destiny of the post-war States of the world.  The very method chosen for the creation of this State was the international method of a bilateral treaty.  If we came into existence untrammelled and unimpeded by so many of those legal forms and anachronistic practices which remained to Canada and South Africa and so on, nevertheless, these things had by reason of their different origins and history survived to those States with whom we had entered into relationships and we accordingly played our part in removing them. The Principles laid down in 1926&mdash;or rather formulated in that year&mdash;were applied with ruthless logic to the whole field of inter-State relationships <Col N="2307" /> within the Commonwealth. And this Part V1 of this Report shows where the cables strained and where, by force of the political facts and the pull of international events, they smashed right through.</P>
    <P>I want to add a personal word as to the pride I have in being associated with the later stages of this Report, because I regard this Report as being the end now achieved to the work which the then Vice-President of this State (the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins) started in 1926.  And I want to confess to a great happiness at having been allowed to be associated with the end of the work which he started so well in that period.</P>
    <P>There was one big task before the delegates who went to the conference in 1926.  They laid down certain lines. The principles were accepted.  They were even accepted as having for some time previously ruled the existence of the States of the Commonwealth, but it was declared that certain laws were still not in harmony with the particular facts, and certain laws were passed over to what was described as a committee of experts in 1920 to decide upon, and their report showed that the law should be brought into harmony with the facts.  We who were not experts, but who, as representatives of the Governments of the different parts of the Commonwealth, met together and agreed that the principles of 1926 should be applied right down even to the very small pieces of legislation that were caught up by the conference of 1929, and this Report, when it is carried further by statute for these countries that want it carried further, will have at last, as I said in the beginning, brought to an end the whole chapter of the single legislative sovereignty and the central Government of the old Empire.</P>
    <P>We had one purpose in 1926, and that was that there must be uprooted from the whole system of this State the British Government; and in substitution for that there was accepted the British Monarch.  He is a King who functions entirely, so far as Irish affairs are concerned, at the will of the Irish Government, and that was the summing up of the whole aim and the whole <Col N="2308" /> result of the conferences of 1926, 1929 and 1930: that one had to get completely rid of any power, either actual or feared, that the British Government had in relation to this country.  In substitution for that under the Treaty there was accepted the monarchy, as I say, a monarchy in every respect in relation to Irish affairs, subject to the control of an Irish Government.  That is the result of the 1926, 1929 and 1930 conferences.  For these reasons, and because that is the result aimed at, and the result achieved, I ask the House to pass the resolution that is before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. S.T. O'Kelly Mr. S.T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of his pride in being associated with the work inaugurated by the late Vice-President of the Free State at the British Imperial Conference of 1926.  He speaks, I presume also with pride, of this Report as ending an epoch, an epoch, I suppose, in the history of the Free State as well as in the history of what is now called the British Commonwealth of Nations, formerly known and still known in some places, as the British Empire. The Minister, as I said, in discussing the 1929 Report last year, looked at this whole matter from an entirely different standpoint from that from which we envisaged it.  He may see pride in his work and in the work that he states he has accomplished of associating us, as far as he can do, by the free will of this State, more closely with the British Empire.  We definitely see no pride in that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, consideration of this Report cannot be approached without taking into consideration the history surrounding it, and the history of this Report in so far as it has a history might be said to begin with what the Minister of the Free State generally call the Treaty of 1921. These Articles of Agreement for a Treaty gave to Ireland Dominion status.  It says, in the first paragraph: &ldquo;Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> We have, as I have already said, no pride in that status and, therefore, no pride whatsoever is being associated, so far as we are obliged to be associated in any way, with the work of the present Minister for External Affairs, or his predecessor, who attended the Imperial Conferences at different times as representing this Free State.  We felt, and feel still, that Dominion status was a derogation of the dignity of this ancient nation.  We objected to it as such and did our utmost to prevent its acceptance by the Irish people.  Since the Free State got control&mdash;I was going to say of this country&mdash;of the twenty-six counties of Ireland, it has done everything in its power to confirm and make more binding this objectionable status, this Dominion status that the Minister takes such pride in.  Those of us whose memories go back to the debates on that Treaty, and those who were not so closely associated but who remember the discussion, will remember that those gentlemen, some of them dead and gone, who were, I might say, primarily responsible for imposing the Dominion status on Ireland, those who might be called the fathers of the Free State, promised&mdash;I do not think it will be denied that they promised&mdash;that the political power, such as it was, that was given to Ireland with the acceptance of the Treaty, would be used to work for the complete independence of all Ireland.  I do not think it will be denied that some of the most prominent of those leaders declared that the Treaty would be used as a stepping-stone towards complete independence and towards the restoration of the Republic as the symbol of that independence.</P>
    <P>The Free State Government, as we know it now, and since 1922, has repudiated the Republic and has repudiated the fathers of the Irish Free State itself.  Instead of carrying out the promise made by these founders of the Free State to use their power for the final liberation of the country, as a whole, they have used their power to fasten for ever upon us, in so far as they can do so, this Dominion status. They have worked with all their might to bind us more closely to the British <Col N="2310" /> Empire, politically, economically and financially.  If this Report, and the principles and recommendations it contains, be approved of here now by this House, the policy of fastening Dominion status upon us will have been carried a step further.  The aim of those responsible for this Report, as I think is clearly demonstrated by the Minister again in the statement that he has made in introducing this Report, and even in the pride that he says he takes in the decisions arrived at by these conferences, and particularly this last conference, is, as I say, to nail us, to copper-fasten us, for ever to the British Empire and its King.  In so far as it attempts to do this we on these benches repudiate it as Irish Nationalists and Irish Republicans. We adhere to the traditional and inalienable rights of the old Irish nation, the old nation of 32, and not 26, counties.  We repudiate the principles of this Report also because, along with Dominion status within the British Empire which it imposes upon us, it recognises and confirms the partition of our country.  We promise to do our utmost, by whatever means may in the future be available to us, to undo the new chains that are in this way being forged to bind us to the British Empire.  We stand for the unity and independence of the country, for the restoration of the Republic, and, as suitable opportunities arise and as, and when the power to do so is given us, we will do all we can to restore Ireland's proper national status and to undo the work of those who, in the last ten years have, in my opinion, degraded and partitioned Ireland, bound her to Britain and forced her into the British Empire.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to paragraphs in this Report, to paragraph 3, wherein it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend or be deemed to extend to a Dominion as part of the law enforced in that Dominion unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2311" /> Again, paragraph 7, which is a recital intended to be inserted in the proposed legislation which will be passed in the British Parliament, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any of the Dominions as part of the law in force in that Dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister took pains to impress upon us that by the adoption of these agreements, the proposed resolutions that were agreed to by the Imperial Conference and by the agreement to that recital which we are told will be passed into law by the British Government, that that ended in a legal way the right of Britain to pass laws for this Free State.  But it strikes me that while these paragraphs purport to affirm the legislative independence of the Free State they seem to me, in reality, to be a recognition of the hegemony of Britain in the Commonwealth. That is the impression it makes upon me, that while the Free State and other colonies or Dominions associated with the British Commonwealth, are to pass resolutions to this effect that it is agreed that Britain is to pass a statute law and in that way there is, to my mind at any rate, what is tanta mount to a recognition of hegemony, a recognition of the inferior status of the Free State and other Dominions vis a vis the Imperial Parliament. The Minister, I know, has his view and stressed his view on that matter and his view does not agree with mine; but my view is not his, and I am satisfied in my own mind, at any rate, that there is a recognition of the superiority of the British there, whatever the Minister may say to the contrary. In paragraph 2, page 21, there is a further recital set out which we are told is to be inserted in a statute to be passed in the British Imperial Parliament.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas it is meet and proper to set out by way of preamble to this Act, that inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free <Col N="2312" /> association of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the Members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That paragraph starts with the assumption that there is a free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I am not concerned with Canada, South Africa or Australia, or with any of the other States or Dominions associated with, or joined in, this Commonwealth. But certainly I do repudiate the suggestion that is contained in that recital in so far as it maintains that there is free association of this State, even without going further, with the other members of the British Commonwealth. Some may have forgotten the fact which was stressed and agreed to by those who were chiefly concerned, as I said earlier, who were primarily responsible for forcing this Dominion status on us.  That is the recognition of the fact that this association with the British Empire was not a free or willing association.  Those who signed the document by which this Dominion status was adopted here, or certain of them, publicly declared that they signed that document under a threat of war.  They signed it, they said, in public, because they were obliged to, because they were told that if they did not sign it the Black and Tans that England had in Ireland would be sent back to the awful atrocities they were committing in the country before the Truce period.</P>
    <P>If there was no other evidence of unwilling association these declarations are sufficient to show that acceptance of that preamble as it stands and acceptance of the declaration of free association would be, in my opinion at any rate, acceptance of a lie.  There is no free association so far as we are concerned, at any <Col N="2313" /> rate, with the other members of the British Commonwealth.  There is no freedom for Ireland and even for the part of Ireland that we are concerned with politically in so far as this status is concerned, or so far as association with the British Empire is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the same paragraph he talks or common allegiance to the Crown, of free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as they are united by a common allegiance with the Crown.  We owe no allegiance to the British Empire and we give none.  The Minister was not, so far as I am aware, associated with the Republican movement officially.  If he was a worker in any way in that movement I do not want to take away any credit that may be coming to him.  I do not suggest that, but so far as I know, publicly he was not associated with it and perhaps he would not have the same feelings on this matter that others have.  His colleague on the bench beside him now was associated with that movement, and if anybody had suggested to him a few months before that Treaty was signed, that he would ever in the remotest years of his life be found accepting membership in the British Empire and giving allegiance to the British Crown his wrath would be worth witnessing.  Deputy Batt O'Connor would, I am sure, in those days have been very loud voiced in denunciation of anybody that would suggest that he would ever be a loyal son of the English King.  I mention these two just to mark the difference that there is between those who stand for this Report and the principles embodies in it and those who stand for our position.  We have not changed since the days of 1921. Others have.  We owe no allegiance to the British Crown or King and we will give none.  I hope those who adopted that position in 1921 and have since foresworn their allegiance to the Republic will reconsider their position. This paragraph again is interested in and seeks to interest us in succession to the Crown of England and matters relating to the Royal Style and Title.  We are not interested in these matters.  In so far as we can get rid of allegiance to the British <Col N="2314" /> Crown, we would like to do so and we intend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The King of England is imposed upon us in this agreement.  It <Col N="2315" /> is not a matter on which we have any freedom to declare our will.  It is accepted by the Minister in the name of the Free State that the King is part and parcel of the Free State Constitution. We are not asked whether we want that or not.  He is accepting him. It is understood that he is there, that we cannot get rid of him, and that we must be interested in his style and title. That is the established constitutional position and, so far as I know, the Minister did nothing to enable us to get rid of the King.  He is satisfied with the King, and I presume that he is acting for his colleagues in the Ministry and for his Party, who want the King. Let them have him.  They are welcome to him.  We want none of him.  We are no Colony of England.  We are no Dominion of England&mdash;so far as we can help it.  What interests have we in common with Australia, Canada, New Zealand or South Africa?  Considered economically, some of them are our greatest competitors in the produce market.  Our interests&mdash;speaking not at all politically&mdash;are very far apart from those of those Dominions or Colonies with which we have co-equal status. We have very little common interest with any of them.  It would probably be better for us economically to be dissociated from them and to be as far apart from them as possible.  There is one matter to which I would again refer in this connection.  On page 15, and again on page 18 of this Report there are certain declarations.  On page 15 there is the following:</P>
      <P>Message to their Majesties the King and Queen&mdash;As the first official act of the Conference a message of greeting to their Majesties the King and Queen was moved by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, seconded by the Prime Minister of South Africa and passed unanimously by the Conference.  The message was in the following terms: &ldquo;The Prime Ministers and other representatives of the Governments of the British Commonwealth assembled in conference at their first meeting and as their first official act desire to present their respectful duty to the King.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2316" /> They join in thankfulness for your Majesty's restoration to health and earnestly hope that your Majesty and Her Majesty&mdash;</P>
    <P>they forgot about all the little majesties&mdash;</P>
    <P>may be spared for many years to inspire the feelings of love and affection which unite all the peoples of the British Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown.</P>
    <P>What hogwash! They are the people who are supposed to represent this ancient nation of Ireland.  I wonder did the Minister wear the black silk knee-breeches that Mr. President Cosgrave had to wear on one occasion, when presenting this resolution to His Majesty and Her Majesty and all the little majesties at Buckingham Palace. What an indignity for this nation to be associated with rubbish of that kind! What allegiance do we owe to the British Monarch or his family? What have they ever done for us?  It is good enough if we do not keep, as I hope as a Christian people we do not keep, bitter hate in our hearts for those responsible for what they were responsible for even in recent times in this country.  And then we are told the Minister of the Free State acted in the name of decent Irish people, decent Irish Catholic people, and was very much concerned in presenting his respectful duty to the King, joining in thankfulness for His Majesty's return to health and earnestly hoping that His Majesty and Her Majesty may be spared for many years to inspire the feelings of love and affection which unite all the peoples of the British Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown.  Did anybody ever hear anything more ludicrous&mdash;to say that the people of Ireland are one bit concerned as to how long or in what way these people rule their own people?  Is there any greater lie the Minister could tell than that we are inspired by feelings of love and affection in this regard?  Love and affection for what?  Is it love and affection for the Black-and-Tans?  Is that what inspired Mr. Minister McGilligan to present his dutiful respects to His Majesty in our name?</P>
    <Col N="2317" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he spoke with his tongue in his cheek.  It would not be the first time and I am sure it will not be the last.  Let us look at page 80:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following Address to His Majesty was moved by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the concluding meeting of the Conference, seconded by the Prime Minister of Canada and unanimously adopted.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, as Chairman of the Conference, was asked to submit the Address to His Majesty:&mdash;&ldquo;To His Majesty the King, Emperor of India.&rdquo; Emperor of India is worthy of notice in view of present conditions.  The Address reads: &ldquo;We, the Prime Ministers and Representatives of the Governments of the British Commonwealth of Nations, who have been assembled during the past few weeks, desire, at the conclusion of the Conference, again to present our respectful duty to Your Majesty.  We pray that under Divine Providence Your Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen may long be given health and strength....&rdquo; I have no objection to them having all the strength and health that they want and that God may give them as far as their individual persons are concerned. It is no concern of mine. What I object to is what follows: &ldquo;to preside over the destinies of all the nations of the Commonwealth, and that the assurance of the devotion and affection of your peoples may support you in this great task.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We repudiate any right in the Minister to speak for us, and certainly to speak for us so far as we represent and can speak for the vast majority of the people of Ireland.  We are not concerned to preserve the authority of the British King over this country.  We are concerned more to get rid of it so that our people may be able to live in prosperity in the country, a thing which the British King or Queen or Princes will never help them to do.  I think I have said enough about the lying statements, for lying I believe <Col N="2318" /> they are&mdash;to which the Minister added his name in the name of this Irish Free State, this partitioned part of Ireland.  Probably the Minister believed that 90 per cent. of the people would never hear of that, that they would never bother their heads about it, and that even if they did they would realise that he was not sincere.  That would be the excuse that would be offered by many of the gentlemen on the benches opposite.  They would say, &ldquo;Oh, what harm was it to send to the King a declaration of that kind? Were not the others signing?  We know very well that the Minister spoke with his tongue in his cheek.&rdquo; On matters of that kind we on this side do not intend to speak with our tongues in our cheeks.  It is not our habit to do so.  We intend to be honest and straight.  We do not intend that anyone should have any misunderstanding of our position on that matter.</P>
    <P>This Report, in so far as it can do so, endeavours to bind us more closely to the British Empire and more closely in love and affection, as the Minister would put it, to the British King and the British Throne, to the Queen and, I suppose, to the Princes as well.  I will put them all in.  We have no idea of allowing ourselves to be associated with that work which is the very antithesis of the work that we should be doing for Ireland.  This Report excludes in every way the idea of a sovereign Republic and of complete Irish independence.  Everything that could be done to block progress along that road, the road towards complete independence and the unity of Ireland, everything that could be done to block that road is being done by the Minister in this Report.  He is binding us as fast as he can to the British Empire. He is repudiating all those who, down through the history of Ireland, stood for complete independence for our nation and our people.  Instead of approving of this Report, we stand by those who adhere to the principle enunciated by Parnell.  Speaking in Cork in 1885, he said: &ldquo;No man has the right to say to his country `Thus far shalt thou go and no further.' We have never attempted to fix the ne plus <Col N="2319" /> ultra to the progress of Ireland a nation and we never shall.&rdquo; Those are Parnell's words, and they express our attitude.  We are out not to put any obstacle in the path of Ireland's progress towards complete independence. On the contrary, we are out to do everything we can to open that road and to encourage people to march towards complete freedom and independence for all Ireland, the old Irish Nation that for the moment we have not the right to speak.  We intend to do everything that we can to encourage people to walk on that road, and anybody who seeks, as the Minister has done, by proposing the adoption of this Report, to put obstacles in the way we intend to oppose.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly in his opening statement said that whilst listening to the Report read by the Minister he got certain impressions.  I would say that after listening to the Deputy speak I also got certain impressions.  Certain memories came back to me.  The Deputy went over a good deal of ancient ground. He spoke of the Treaty and mentioned stepping stones.  He referred to me personally.  I would like to remind the Deputy and those who sit beside him of the days in which they were discussing that same Treaty when one of their great leaders said: &ldquo;Why not make the King Managing Director?&rdquo; What about that day?</P>

      <P>And the leader, Deputy de Valera, said that he would be inclined to pay the King a yearly tribute.  I would also like to remind Deputy de Valera, who has interrupted me, that he stood out for what he called external association.  Well, if the Treaty is not external association, and if the document read by the Minister is not external association and is not equally as good as Document No. 2 I am surprised.  Of course the people across the floor are a hundred per cent. patriots.  We have let down the Republic and they have kept it up.  They referred to <Col N="2320" /> partition and so on.  The Treaty was a Treaty made for the whole of the Thirty-two Counties with the right of Six Counties to opt out.  There was the statement always made that Northern Ireland would not be coerced.  I am only going over this ground, sir, because it was mentioned when you were not in the Chair and perhaps you do not know.</P>

      <P>I am only making a short reply to Deputy O'Kelly because he has mentioned my name.  He said he got certain impressions from the Minister's speech and I just stood up to give him my impressions of his speech.  Of course Deputy O'Kelly can belittle the Treaty position now. But the Treaty has allowed the Deputy to stick his chest out and to be a brave man now and to say he stands up for the Republic.  Batt O'Connor was quite willing and helped to accept the Truce when it came. He did not raise his voice when the Plenipotentiaries were going across to negotiate the Treaty and did not insist that they would go there and negotiate for a Republic and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I think the Treaty position is all right.  Many of our people were in such a hurry in the early days against accepting it that they could not wait to see what the Treaty would give them, and to see what the country got in the Treaty.  At that time when I asked some of my greatest opponents now what their objection was to the Treaty, they replied that the Governor-General would be an English Lord and they also told me that the Curragh of <Col N="2321" /> Kildare, the greatest training ground for the British Army, would never be handed over to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I never interrupt whilst the Deputies across the floor are addressing the House.  But we all know the temperament of the Fianna Fáil Party now, and whenever anybody from this side of the House gets up to speak the policy of that Party is to shout him down.  But as far as Batt O'Connor is concerned he does not mind or fear that sort of thing.  But Deputy O'Kelly set me thinking when I heard him speak so bravely for the Republic and when he told us how he, at least, had always stood up for it, and how he was unlike us, and that he would not lower the flag.  But Deputy O'Kelly was not here when the flag was lowered, and when we had to accept the Truce.  The Deputy was not then in Ireland.  He was sheltering in one of the grand hotels in Paris or Rome and we had to do the best we could here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this, however, that it is making little of the fight that we put up to make little of the Treaty position.  Had we more forces at our command, perhaps the Treaty settlement would have been better.  We had to accept the best settlement we could get.  In the words of the leader of the Opposition, we were in the position of the man with the cow for sale, and we made the best bargain we could.  But I warn the Deputy that in making little of the Treaty position he is making little of the fight which the men put up here, because if there had been more force at our command we might not have accepted the Truce.  Had we enough fighting men and munitions here we could have gone on and hurled the English into the sea.  But all that time <Col N="2322" /> Deputy O'Kelly was not here fighting by our side.  He was safe in Paris or Rome; we had to accept the Truce and do the best we could for the country. I consider it is not helpful to be going back on the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the report of the Imperial Conference put before us here this evening by the Minister is all right.  And I think it is something that we should be all proud of.  We should forget the disputes about the past and try and strengthen the position we now hold.  If we do that the future of this country is bright. Deputy O'Kelly has referred to stepping-stones. I tell him that as great a man as he used those very words, and Deputy O'Kelly knows it, I am sure.  It is hardly fair to the Deputies to be going back on those things and referring to those matters.  All that matters now is the future of our country. Things are going on all right.  But at times it is hard to have patience when we hear Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Benches flinging across the floor that we are not as good Irishmen as they are, and proclaiming that they are 100 per cent.  Republicans whilst we are Imperialists.</P>

      <P>Since I came into this House I never heard such a lot of tripe as the speech just delivered by Deputy O'Kelly.  Unfortunately it is in my opinion a most damaging speech from the point of view of the best interests of this country.  We have heard this speech at a time when the people of the country are anxiously waiting to see the ports of Great Britain that have been closed for a few weeks open to our live stock.  I say that the speech of Deputy O'Kelly will not in any way help to open these ports sooner than they would otherwise have been opened.  I protest in the interests of ninety per cent. of the people of this country in the strongest possible manner against speeches like that of Deputy O'Kelly's, the only effect of which will be, obviously, to injure the interests of this country.  People who have their cattle, sheep, pigs, butter, eggs and bacon to sell to the country <Col N="2323" /> of which we have heard such vile abuse here from Deputy O'Kelly this evening will have nothing for which to thank the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The chief matters of interest in this Report are the recommendations made arising out of the Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion legislation of 1929. Deputies will remember that in 1926 the first meeting of the Imperial Conference took place.  It was attended in state by Free State Ministers and it was for the purpose of considering the constitutional status of the Dominions and their relationship with the British Parliament.  The Report of that Imperial Conference declared in relation to the United Kingdom and Dominions that &ldquo;they are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any respect of their domestic or external affairs though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo; The members of that Conference, including the Free State delegates, having produced that formula, sat back to consider it and in their consideration were forced to recognise that there were many aspects of the existing relationship between the Dominions and Great Britain and between the Dominions and one another which did not conform to that definition at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Bill which is to be passed by the British Parliament this year, the whole purpose of the resolution which is before us and the whole purpose of the 1929 Conference, was to bring the actual relationship between the British Dominions and Great Britain and between the British Dominions and one <Col N="2324" /> another into conformity with that Declaration or, at any rate, to attempt to do so.  The 1926 Conference did not attempt that job itself.  It delegated it to a Committee which met in 1929 and which drew up a report which was submitted to us here last year, a report of which we approved by resolution. That Report was of course submitted to the Parliaments of the other Dominions as well as to this Parliament and was, I think, approved of by them all.  We approved of it &ldquo;gladly and proudly&rdquo; as the Minister told us and without reservations. In South Africa they were not quite so sure what it meant and they passed a resolution of approval with an amendment to the effect that &ldquo;the adoption of the Report must not be taken as derogating from the right of any member of the British Commonwealth to withdraw therefrom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the discussion which took place in the South African Parliament that they were not quite so sure as the Minister for External Affairs is that the Declaration of 1926, as implemented by the Conference of 1929, established our status as an independent State.  Since that formula was first made various interpretations of it have been produced in Great Britain and here and in other Dominions, and attempts have been made to explain it away.  We are told that the Act which will be passed by the British Parliament, if all the Dominions Parliaments adopt resolutions such as that which is now before us, is going to give legal significance to that Declaration and is going to establish in law what the Minister says already exists in practice.</P>
    <P>This proposed Act deals with the matters which were discussed at the 1929 Conference.  As I have said, the 1929 Imperial Conference discovered particular aspects in the relations between the Dominions and Great Britain which did not conform to the formula they had produced: these were the powers of Governors-General, the ex-territorial operation of Dominion legislation, the operation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, and the operations of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  The 1929 Conference met <Col N="2325" /> and prepared its report.  Its report was approved by the Parliaments of the Dominion.  It was submitted to the Dominion Conference of 1930 which framed this draft Act which is to be submitted to the British Parliament this year.  It is that Act of which we are now asked to approve. The question before the Dáil is whether we ought to approve of it. It is not whether Deputy Batt O'Connor was the best fighting man that Ireland ever produced.</P>

      <P>I know nothing about Deputy O'Connor's past.  I was agreeing with the Ceann Comhairle, who has emphasised my agreement that it is not Deputy O'Connor's past that is under discussion now.  I am particularly anxious that this question should not be side-tracked as Deputy O'Connor has attempted to side-track it.  I want Deputy O'Connor and every other Deputy when voting in the Division Lobby on this matter to know what they are doing.  The question whether or not we should approve of this Act can be answered only after we have got decisions on two other questions: first, what do we consider the national aim to be; and second, what does this Act achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan, the Minister for External Affairs has made a number of speeches, and written a number of newspaper articles concerning the national status.  Each one of these speeches and articles seems to contradict the one previous to it.  It is as hard to reconcile the speeches of the <Col N="2326" /> Minister for External Affairs on this matter as it is to reconcile his speeches upon the Electricity Supply Bill.  At the Imperial Conference he spoke big and bravely.  He said: &ldquo;For us the recognition of our position as a free and sovereign State comes before all other considerations.&rdquo; That was a brave declaration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputy has said &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo; Does he know what the Minister meant by it?  The Minister has been making other speeches since from which it is quite clear that every word of that declaration has for him a different significance than for the ordinary man.  The Minister did not mean at all what others understood him to mean.  If he did mean it, if he went to that Conference as a representative of the Irish nation, not as the representative of a limited part of Ireland, and there stated that the recognition of our position as a free and sovereign State came before all other considerations, then he was speaking the mind of this Party.  It is impossible to understand what exactly the Minister is driving at, except we understand the state of his mind, his conception of the events that led up to the present position of the country and that preceded the establishment of this State.  His whole position, his whole political philosophy, if I might use that term, seems to depend upon the misunderstanding of Irish history and the misrepresentation of the manner in which the Irish Free State came into existence.  He wrote an article for the Cumann na nGaedheal organ in which he said: &ldquo;When the Treaty of 1921 was ratified by the Provisional Parliament and the British Parliament there was established in this country a new State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said other things in that article from which it was quite clear that for him, at any rate, the history of Ireland began on 6th December, 1921.  He ignores everything that happened before that date.  It has no significance for him, no lessons to teach him in the present time.  Everything was dark before 6th December, 1921, when a new State was established.  The Minister <Col N="2327" /> does not know how it was established, and he does not care.  He merely knows that a new star came into the international firmament at that time, and it is with the fortunes of that star that he is concerned.  He said: &ldquo;Politically and legally the establishment of this State was complete when the Treaty was ratified by the Parliaments of the two contracting parties.&rdquo; Mark the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;by the Parliaments of the two contracting parties, namely, the British Parliament and the Provisional Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Deputy O'Connor agree that the Treaty was negotiated between the British Parliament and the Provisional Parliament which a British Act had attempted to establish in this country?  Does not every Deputy know that the Treaty was negotiated by men claiming to speak for all Ireland in the name of a Parliament that claimed to act for all Ireland?  It was as such, and as such only, that they had any right to negotiate at all.  The Treaty, as Deputy O'Connor has told us, was made between the British Parliament and all Ireland.  It included all Ireland, and that fact is not disguised by the obnoxious contracting-out clause which operated subsequently to deprive us of six counties.</P>
    <P>At the Imperial Conference the Minister said: &ldquo;Ireland became a member of the British group because she believes her national aspirations can be realised in full within that group.&rdquo; Does any Deputy believe that such was the thought in the minds of Deputies who voted for the Treaty?  Does any Deputy pretend, as the Minister attempts to pretend, that it was considerations of that kind which weighed with the majority of those who voted for the agreement of 1921?  If any Deputy labours under that delusion, let him read the report of the debate on that occasion.  Does Deputy O'Connor, or any other Deputy who was associated with the national movement in those days, pretend that it was the belief that Irish national aspirations could be realised in full within the British Empire that prompted the majority of the elected representatives of the people to vote for inclusion in <Col N="2328" /> the Empire, or was it other considerations&mdash;considerations such as have been referred to by Deputy O'Kelly, consideration of the fact that the Black and Tans were in the country and that the British Government had publicly and definitely stated that refusal to ratify would mean that the Black and Tans would be let loose to commit atrocities similar to those they had already committed?  Deputies know what the nature of these atrocities was.  The Minister, when in London, was reported in the Press as having joined enthusiastically in singing &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo; Men were shot in this country because they would not do that.  The Black and Tans came round at night, put revolvers to men's chests and said to them: &ldquo;Sing `God Save the King' or you will die,&rdquo; and they preferred to die rather than sing it.  The Minister, who claimed to be our representative in London at the Imperial banquet, joined, as the Press told us, enthusiastically in singing that anthem.  Thus have the mighty fallen!</P>
    <P>If it is the view of this Dáil that it is the aim and always has been the aim of our people to develop and evolve in a constitutional manner as a component part of the British Empire, then this Report and this Resolution that we are discussing may have some importance.  The Minister for External Affairs talked at the Rotary Club here about the ties of blood and sentiment that are binding us to the British Empire&mdash;ties of blood and sentiments which it would be lunacy to ignore.  There are other ties and other sentiments equally strong binding us to the old tradition of nationhood, the old idea, the old conception of what the status of our nation should be and what the rights of our people are, and we cannot ignore these either.  It was never the accepted aim of the Irish people to develop and evolve as a component part of the British Empire.  It was always our aim that we should get outside that political combination altogether, to abolish the last vestige of British domination.  It is because this Act not merely fails to do that but has the opposite effect that we do <Col N="2329" /> not think the Dáil should give its approval to it.</P>
    <P>Let us examine it from the position of those who think, as the Minister for External Affairs thinks, that our destiny can be worked out as a member of the British Empire, and let us see what the Act will achieve.  The declaration of the Imperial Conference of 1926 purported to express our legislative independence.  The principal flaw in that declaration is the theoretical legislative supremacy of the Imperial Parliament.  The Minister has told us that this Act, set out in this Report, is in the nature of an act of renunciation by Great Britain.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is carefully phrased so that it could not be mistaken for anything of the kind.  We have learned the lesson in the last few days that we must not accept the Minister's word as to what an Act intends to do.  We are concerned with the cold, hard phrases therein contained, and there is nothing in these words which justifies the description of that Act as an act of renunciation by the Imperial Parliament.  The Imperial Parliament always has claimed power to legislate for the whole Empire, and that power is not being destroyed by this Act.  It is carefully drafted in every phrase to preserve that theoretical supremacy of the British Parliament. I ask Deputies to take it and read it for themselves, to look at the phraseology used in every particular:</P>
    <P>No Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested and consented to the enactment thereof.  Is the theoretical legislative supremacy of the British Parliament destroyed by that section?  Is that the section which is in effect an act of renunciation? Let us read them all and find out where it is that the act of renunciation is contained, by what particular clause is the legislative supremacy of the British Parliament destroyed:</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a Dominion <Col N="2330" /> has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operations.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us we are not concerned with that clause, that we always had in theory the power to pass laws having an extra-territorial operation. We never attempted to do it, however.  It has been pointed out here that a Nationality Act was required, that there was no definition of Irish Nationality.  That Act has not been produced, and I suggest that it has not been produced because the position was not, in fact, as the Minister declared it to be:</P>
    <P>The Colonial Laws Validity Act shall not apply to any law made after the commencement of this Act by the Parliament of a Dominion.</P>
    <P>Is that the act of renunciation, is that the clause which destroys the legislative supremacy of the British Parliament?</P>

If Deputy Sheehy knew what we were talking about he would not make ignorant interruptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in the recital that the Minister referred to that the legislative supremacy of the British Parliament is destroyed and the act of renunciation made?</P>
      <P>And whereas it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any of the Dominions as part of the law in force in that Dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and whereas we are united in this loyalty to the British Crown which Deputy O'Kelly referred to.  These <Col N="2331" /> are the two recitals.  In what section or clause or part of that act is the declaration of renunciation made to which the Minister referred?  What part of it, or what section of it destroys the theoretical legislative supremacy of the British Parliament which has always existed, and which I maintain will continue to exist even if this Act is passed?  The Minister has told us the purport of this Act is merely to establish as a matter of law what ought already have been established as a matter of practice. If that is so, it would be much better if this Act were never passed because the process of definition is a process of limitation.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the method by which these old legislative anomalies were to be destroyed did <Col N="2332" /> not concern him.  He was so little concerned about the method, that in the method he lost the principle. Remember that this Act is to be passed by the British Parliament. What one British Parliament has passed another can repeal.  If our position is to be that whatever legislative independence we possess is to depend in law upon the passage of that Act by the British Parliament, then another British Parliament or this British Parliament can completely reverse that position by repealing the Act and by passing this resolution which is now before us we admit their right to repeal the Act.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
