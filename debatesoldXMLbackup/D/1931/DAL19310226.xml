      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a large amount of unemployment and poverty exists in the towns, villages and rural districts (including the Islands) of County Donegal; and whether he will state the total amount which he intends to allocate for the relief of unemployment in that county out of moneys provided by the Relief Schemes Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clancy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the amount of money which he intends to allocate to County Limerick from the moneys provided by the Relief Schemes Vote in order to provide employment in that county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer questions numbers 1 and 2 together.  The sum of £300,000 provided in the Relief Schemes Vote was provided for the relief of unemployment and distress. Accordingly the main considerations governing the distribution of the Grant were the extent of the needs of a particular locality from the point of view of the amount of unemployment or distress existing there and the possibility of putting useful schemes into operation without delay.  It will, therefore, be appreciated that the amount voted by the Dáil could not properly be allocated on a county basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various classes of Relief Works have been undertaken under the supervision of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the Land Commission, the Office of Public Works, and the Department of Agriculture. <Col N="588" /> It is not yet possible to give a final figure for the amount which will be spent in either of the counties to which the questions refer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether the Department of Fisheries, apart from the Land Commission, has been granted any of this money for distribution?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received a complete list of subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Loan (Internal), 1919-20, for the Cloonacool district, in the old Parliamentary Constituency of South Sligo, which list has been certified as correct by the original collectors; and, if so, whether he will state the reason repayment has not been made, and if it is intended to accept this list as correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>A list of subscribers to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919/20, for the Cloonacool district has been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>The list, however, does not appear to be complete, and there are a number of discrepancies between the particulars contained therein and those given in individual applications for repayment which have been made to my Department.  Further, it has not been found possible to establish that the sums collected in this district were duly forwarded to the Dáil Eireann Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing inquiries with a view to clearing up the position.</P>

      <P>I have here a letter which I have received from the Department of Finance, dated 21st November, 1930, in which it is stated that they were communicating with the person who furnished what purported to be a complete list of subscribers, but I ascertained a week ago from this person that he was never written to, although I have here a letter from the Department stating that a letter was being sent to him.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider introducing legislation putting the subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Loan on the same basis as the landlords are being put in the new Land Bill?  Under the Land Bill no matter how many people have paid for the land, if the owner comes along eventually he will get the money.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount awarded by way of compensation in respect of the <Col N="590" /> destruction of Wexford Court House was £5,000.  £4,600 with accrued interest has already been paid.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether, in the case of Corbett v.

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has quoted only part of the material portion of the judge's observations, as <Col N="593" /> reported in the Press.  As so reported, the judge, having made the observation to which the Deputy refers, went on immediately to say that &ldquo;he would have the power if he thought any party had committed perjury&mdash;an offence which was very common, unfortunately, in their Courts&mdash;to refer the matter to the Attorney-General to take what steps he liked.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Judge has not referred the papers to the Attorney-General, and I think it is a fair assumption from his not doing so that in his opinion a charge of perjury against the Guards could not be sustained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Bill, 1931.  The proposal is to continue for a period of five years the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act of 1929.  That Act applied to the City and County of Dublin the statutory provision which had previously been applied to the country as a whole that outdoor assistance could be given to the able-bodied, thus bringing Dublin City and County into line with the rest of the country as far as that was concerned.  In addition, it contained certain provisions by which persons applying for relief in Dublin and not having two years continuous residence in Dublin, while being prevented from getting outdoor relief, could get relieved in the Dublin Union.  The Act provided that certain relief works could be organised and that persons applying for relief who were not entitled to relief under the Act might however have their travelling expenses paid to some district outside Dublin City or County where they had a prospect of getting work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the cost of that relief is concerned the number so applying was comparatively few.  For almost the eleven months involved in the present year the total cost is only £28 10s. 0d. in the matter of paying the travelling expenses.  With the exception of the relief works which were in operation when the Act was being passed and continued until the end of 1930 on the development of lands near the Albert College Farm at Glasnevin, near the Home Farm Road&mdash;no relief works have gone ahead with under the Act. But I understand that there is cooperation between the Union authorities <Col N="606" /> and the Dublin Corporation, so that on the Dublin Corporation schemes certain of the men employed are men who are recommended for employment by the Union authorities &mdash;that is to say, men who are out of work and who are in receipt of assistance.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of anxiety was expressed as to the burden which the 1929 Act would put on the rates in Dublin.  I argued that it was very difficult for anyone to give an estimate as to what the cost of this might be without practical experience of the working of the schemes, while at the same time refusing to admit that the expenditure was going to be as high as some of the people suggested.  In fact, at the beginning of the year it was estimated that the total cost of this relief for the year would be £132,000, amounting to approximately a rate of 1s. 7d. in the £ on the City. I speak now of the Dublin Union, because it is the main problem in the matter.  Deputies will recollect that as far as the present Dublin Union is concerned, two areas of charge were contemplated; that there would be one area of charge for this class of relief for the area which would contain the County Borough of Dublin at that time and the Urban Districts of Rathmines and Pembroke.  That would be one area which would support its own burden in the matter of this particular class of relief.  The rest of the Union &mdash;the rural portion&mdash;would be another area of charge.  The total amount that was estimated for the whole of the Dublin Union was £132,000, or approximately a rate of between 1s. 6d. and 1s. 7d. in the £ as far as the City was concerned.</P>
    <P>A revised estimate, prepared in January, 1931, shows that the expenditure for the whole area up to the 31st March next will be not £132,000, but only a sum of £81,000, involving, so far as the different amounts are concerned, an amount equivalent to a rate of 1s. in the new County Borough of Dublin, and about 6d. in the rural part of the Dublin Union.</P>
    <P>As far as this particular class of relief is concerned, the figures are not available for Balrothery or the Rathdown  <Col N="607" /> Union, but so far as the rates for Union charges, that is for outdoor relief and all classes of medical charities and institutional relief&mdash;that is to say, Union charges generally are concerned, the rates for the recent years in Balrothery, Rathdown, and Dublin City are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For 1929-30 in Dublin City the rate was 2s. 3¼d.; in the same area in 1930-31 the rate was 4s. 1d.  That includes an excess of about 7d., as a result of over estimating for the relief of the able-bodied.  The estimate for 1931-32 is 3s. 6d. in the £.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin rural the estimate for 1929-30 was 2s. 8½d.; for 1930-31, 3s. 4d. which figure involved the same type of over-estimation; and for 1931-32 the estimate is 2s. 6d.  In Balrothery for 1929-30 the estimate was 3s. 6½d.; 1930-31, 2s. 4½d., and in 1931-32 it is estimated at 3s. 2½d. which will involve a rate of about 6d. to make up for existing liabilities perhaps due to under-estimation last year.  The rate in Rathdown for 1929-30 was 3s. 2d.; 1930-31 3s. 9¾d., and 1931-32 3s. 5¼d. So that in fact as between two years ago in Balrothery there is a reduction but an increase of 3¼d. so far as Rathdown is concerned.  So far as these areas go no considerable burden has been thrown on them as a result of the Act of 1929.</P>
    <P>When discussing the Act of 1929 I said that I hoped the Act would run for two years instead of one.  I think I asked to have the Act an Act that would run for two years instead of one.  I simply surrendered to the opinion of the House in making it one year.  I said that before the expiry of that Act I hoped to have a Consolidated Poor Assistance Act.  I have not been able to produce that Bill and I now have definitely given up the intention and hope of introducing such a Bill before the next General Election. I do not think that the work that is involved in it from the Department point of view or from the point of view of the Dáil could, satisfactorily, be done between this time and the next General Election.</P>

      <P>We are asking to have the existing arrangement extended for five years.  Before this Bill was brought in I approached the Union authorities in Dublin and in Balrothery and Rathdown as to whether there were any amendments they considered it necessary to suggest. There were no amendments suggested.  I quite appreciate the time that has elapsed has been too short to propose any amendments to the Act that might be of any real value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will understand that generally, on the principle upon which poor law administration has been organised since the Act of 1923, County Dublin ought to have a scheme for itself and, possibly, both Dublin City and Dublin County ought to have a joint scheme. Several approaches have been made to the bodies involved with a view to getting a joint scheme approved, but further thought is required to be given by the bodies involved before a joint scheme can be produced, so that this class of relief will therefore continue to fall on the four separate areas of charge in County Dublin.  Rathdown will still continue to be a separate area of charge and also Balrothery. The present Dublin Union area will consist from April next of the newly extended County Borough, including Rathmines, Pembroke and the added rural areas.  That will be the third <Col N="609" /> area of charge for this particular class of relief.  The fourth area of charge will be the rural parts of the Dublin Union, that is, that part of the County Dublin that comes within the present Dublin Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputies can pretend to be satisfied with the Minister's explanation as to why a Bill to consolidate the poor law has not been introduced by him. When the Poor Law Relief Dublin Bill was brought to the House it was brought purely as a temporary measure and the Minister stated that he expected to be in a position to introduce a codifying Bill before the period of operation of the temporary measure expired.  He stated that the Bill was in draft at the time in his Department.  That was two years ago but the Bill has not yet been introduced and the Minister appears to have abandoned all hope of introducing it.  I had occasion in the past to refer to what I called the unconstitutional laziness of the Local Government Department.  Is this another example of it or are we to take it that the views of the Minister in 1929 as to the necessity of introducing codifying legislation have been changed?  If so, we want to know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anyone will be satisfied with the present method of administering poor law relief.  The Poor Law Commission which was established by the Government produced a voluminous report, in which they recommended many alterations, but effect has been given to none of them.  Anyone familiar with the conditions knows that the amount of relief given in necessitous cases is altogether inadequate.  The highest amount which the largest family secures is fifteen shillings a week, and it is only in a few cases that that amount is given.  The report of the Commission showed that in the case of 65 per cent. of the persons in receipt of relief the amount given was less than 7s. 6d. a week.  Is it seriously contended that it is possible for a destitute person to support himself and his family on 7s. 6d. a week?  I do not think that can be contended, and I do not think <Col N="610" /> that the Dáil can be satisfied that it is discharging its obligation to provide some form of maintenance for these victims of the present system who cannot provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary for some one on this side of the House to emphasise the necessity for this Bill, because Deputies opposite have been influenced by the prosperity talk which we have recently heard in considerable volume from the President of the Executive Council and other prominent members of Cumann na nGaedheal.  We have been repeatedly told that the Irish Free State is enjoying a measure of prosperity unknown throughout the rest of Europe, and unequalled in our previous history.  I do not know if members of Cumann na nGaedheal believe these statements when they read them in the reports of Cumann na nGaedheal meetings, but in case there is a danger that any member of Cumann na nGaedheal believes these statements, and thinks that this Bill is unnecessary, I would ask him to read the statements of another nature that also appear in the Press.  Deputy Doyle, who is on the Committee in charge of the Dublin Union, could tell us a different story if he choose, judging by the report in the papers yesterday, which showed that the conditions in the City of Dublin are by no means as satisfactory as the propagandists of Cumann na nGaedheal would have us believe.  It was revealed there that there are no less than 6,000 families maintained out of public funds in the city at present, and the number has shown a tendency to increase in recent months.  No doubt that tendency to increase is partly explained by the trade disputes which are in progress, but the situation is such that there is a strong case to be made for drastic action on the part of the Executive Council to deal with it.  I do not think that they can claim to have dealt with it merely by proposing an extension of this provisional measure for another five years.</P>
    <P>The only cure for unemployment and the destitution which comes from unemployment is the provision of work. When the original Bill was introduced I said that it was a fitting condemnation <Col N="611" /> of the whole policy of the Executive Council.  The continuance of the Act for another period of five years is a similar condemnation of their policy.  They have failed to produce in this country the opportunities for employment which would make it possible for people, who are anxious to make their own living and to maintain themselves out of their own labours, to do so.  That is why we have to come here periodically to discuss Relief Votes and measures of this kind for extending the legislative provisions for poor relief.  No doubt this Bill will be passed, and it is necessary that it should be passed, but I think it is important that the necessity for it should be emphasised and that the various members of Cumann na nGeadheal who vote for it on this occasion will do so, making a mental vow to themselves that they will not again engage in the task of humbugging the people by talking about prosperity which does not exist.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct the statement of the Deputy that anyone in the Department of Local Government gave an estimate with regard to expenditure.  In spite of very many challenging and aggressive invitations here, I absolutely refused to do anything to contradict the estimates that were produced here and elsewhere, and I speak for the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to be an authority on the subject of the liability that accrued under the Dublin Poor Relief Act but in another place I had the privilege of listening to an official who had all the figures before him and he estimated 5s. in the £ as the liability that would accrue under that particular Act.  I accept no responsibility for the estimate but I say again that it will be welcome news to the ratepayers of Dublin to learn that even the figure of £132,000 that was estimated last year is considerably beyond the liability that the ratepayers will be called upon to discharge in the future.  I trust that even the figure of £80,000, which the Minister has given us this afternoon will be further reduced when this problem has been inquired into and explored.  We have pointed out that we are in the unfortunate position in the City of Dublin, that the poor and needy from all parts of Ireland gravitate to Dublin in the hope of getting employment here with the result that we are burdened with the support of many whose support should be carried by other areas.  That is the aspect of this particular question which we are anxious to have inquired into at the earliest possible moment.  It is only right to point out that as far as the citizens of Dublin are concerned they never offered any protest or objection to assisting the poor and destitute. They did offer an objection to assisting the poor and the destitute from other areas outside Dublin.  We still offer that objection and we are still hopeful that in the near future that particular portion of the burden, which is falling heavily on the ratepayers of Dublin, will be moved to other areas and that in that way we <Col N="613" /> will get the relief to which we are entitled.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extend for a period of five years the operations of the Relief Act that was introduced here and passed only last year.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that it was the intention of those putting forward that Bill that in the immediate future the whole problem would be carefully considered, and that a Bill would be brought forward here dealing with the question in its entirety.  The Relief Act of 1929 was only an Act for twelve months.  Now we are faced with a Bill extending for a period of five years the life of that Act which was only intended for twelve months.  I say on behalf of this House that that is not fair to us.  I say on behalf of the overburdened taxpayers of Dublin it is unreasonable to ask if they are compelled to carry a burden at the moment which should be carried by other areas, that a Bill should be brought in here continuing that liability for a further period of five years.  It is unfair to the ratepayers, and I say it is unfair to the House, because it was distinctly understood, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, that this whole problem should be considered in the near future and dealt with.  I admit we are dealing with a very big problem, and, may I say, a difficult problem?  I do not want in any way to rush those on whom the responsibility for dealing with the problem rests.  They require to have certain data and certain experience before them to enable them to deal fairly and reasonably with this difficult matter.  For that reason, while I would hope that it would be only necessary to extend the Bill for the same length as the original Act, that is to give it a life of twelve months, I would be willing to go as far as a period of two years, and to agree to extend the Bill for a further period of two years to enable the whole problem to be fairly dealt with.  That, I think, should be adequate, and for that reason I will not vote for an extension of the Act beyond a period of two years, owing to the circumstances I have already explained.</P>

      <P>There are two points, and they arise mainly out of <Col N="614" /> what Deputy Good has stated, with which I should like to deal.  He has expressed a hope that there will be a reduction even on the figure mentioned. In that hope we all join, but I should like to say, and to express the further hope, that that reduction which he contemplates, and which we would like to see, will not be brought about by a parsimonious policy in the distribution of the help given by this Bill, but rather by a diminution in the number of unemployed people who are so unfortunate as to have to seek assistance under this measure to enable them to live.  That is the ideal method of reduction which I am sure Deputy Good, as well as all of us, would wish to see.</P>
      <P>A point was stressed by Deputy Good which formed the burden of a great many speeches last year and of some newspaper articles, that most of these people who are in need of relief are people who have wandered or strayed in from country areas to the city.  I would like to see some figures to prove that.  I would like some figures to prove the case that is so often made, to show that people who come from the country to Dublin are always people who are bound to be looking for assistance in this way. I venture to say that if statistics were compiled to show the place of origin of the people who are helped in this way that they would not be found to bear out Deputy Good's contention.  I think that that is evident to anybody who knows the country and the city even fairly well.  There are some people who would argue that the city benefits by the people who come from the country to the city and that the class of people who come from the country are fairly well able to make their way in the city here.</P>

      <P>The majority or them.  I believe that there is no justification for that complaint and that no special burden is placed on Dublin any more than on any other local authority in the country.  Every other local authority has to provide for the able-bodied people who are in need of assistance and up to last year Dublin <Col N="615" /> was not doing that.  Dublin is now asked to do it and Dublin representatives here speak as if they had some special grievance in that.  I do not believe there is.</P>
      <P>I say again that I hope measures will quickly be found to remove the burden not alone from the Dublin ratepayers, but from the ratepayers all over the country.  It is no compliment to us that we have to use this method of keeping in existence able-bodied people who are able and willing to work if work were provided for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Deputy can object to the passage of this Bill.  When the original Bill was introduced the House was more or less given to understand that it was to be of a temporary nature.  We are now asked to re-enact that measure for a period of five years.  I, like most Deputies, believe that a Bill of this kind is absolutely necessary, but the question is: is it necessary for a period of five years?  As a rule I do not find myself in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Good, but on this I agree with him that it is a mistake to pass this Bill for a five year period without a further exploration of the whole question.  May I say, in answer to the Party point of view urged by Deputy Lemass, that if there is one thing Deputies ought to refrain from doing it is attempting to exploit the miseries of the poor for Party advantage. We all know, as well as Deputy Lemass, that there is a certain proportion of poverty and unemployment in the City of Dublin.  Perhaps the Deputy knows, too, as well as most of us, although he will not admit it, that the policy of Fianna Fáil of always painting the country blacker than it really is reacts with more harmful effect upon the unemployed than perhaps he realises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin City is the storm centre of the unemployment problem in this country.  If Deputy Lemass compares the condition of this city with that of any other great city across the Channel the comparison, I think, will be found to be very much in favour of <Col N="616" /> Dublin.  The Deputy knows that at the moment some of the wealthiest countries in the world are passing through a very difficult economic period.  We have an instance of that in the case of the United States.  He knows, too, that there are more unemployed in Northern Ireland, in Liverpool, Manchester and other cities across Channel than there are in the Free State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy tell us how many unemployed there are in the Free State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for the Free State is 25,000, while for Northern Ireland it is 29,000.  I suggest to the members of the Fianna Fáil party that this policy of theirs of always blackening the economic and financial position of this State is a harmful one not alone to the country, but to their own party.  Before this Bill is passed for a further period of five years I would be glad if the Minister for Local Government would adopt some means of going into the question of seeing whether the money to be spent under it could not be employed reproductively or partially reproductively. We have been told that certain rates will be levied during the coming year. The sums involved, as I learn from a document from the City Manager, are of very great magnitude.  The demand for the Dublin Union during the financial year 1929-30 was £151,000. For the present year 1930-31 it has risen to £273,208.  This is a result of the coming into operation of the Dublin Poor Relief Bill.  That represents an increase of £123,000 odd. How much of that is going to be expended in such a way as to bring any advantage to the ratepayers of this city?  I think, before this Bill is passed, some effort should be made either by the Government or the Dublin Corporation to see that some return is made for such a big expenditure of money.  No one objects to providing for the needs of the unemployed and destitute in this city. At the same time it appears to me to be a scandal that all this money should be spent without some effort being made to get back as much of it <Col N="617" /> as possible for the benefit of the ratepayers by the carrying out of schemes of work.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Town Clerk that relief schemes are at present in operation in which the labour costs will amount to £40,000.  Surely there could be an enlargement of that particular method of spending the money. Those who take an interest in the social welfare of the people can see that those most in sympathy with the poor and destitute object to this method of spending money.  A very eminent churchman in the course of a sermon the other day referred to the degrading effect it has upon the general body of the people.  I would ask the Minister to see whether means could not be found of applying portion of this money to a development of the relief schemes at present in hands by the Corporation and involving labour costs to the extent of £40,000. If two-thirds of the increased Union demand on the ratepayers this year were spent on relief schemes what a difference it would make to the ratepayers of this city and to the morale of the unemployed.  Is there anyone who will contend that the dole which is paid in England has helped to improve the morale of the English people?</P>

No one, I am sure, will contend that the giving of this relief has any sort of beneficial effect on the morale of the people. Many decent men have come to me and have asked me if there was any possibility of getting work.  I say there is a responsibility on the Government or on the Corporation, or both, to endeavour to frame a scheme of work on which some of this money could be expended.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it is not to the advantage of the people who obtain it, and certainly not to the advantage of the ratepayers, to have <Col N="618" /> the money expended in the way that it is at present.  I know that Deputy Lemass is always ready with a cheap quip, but during the time he was speaking I did not hear a single constructive suggestion from him.  It was simply the old policy of tearing up, with no idea of how to create, develop, or improve.</P>

      <P>I have no need to go to Deputy Lemass for a suggestion.  I consider my intellect superior to his. As a business man myself I know the difficulties under which business people are labouring at the moment.  Business is bad and turnover is small.  It is a very serious matter for them to have this extra burden of nearly £125,000 the difference between the Union demands last year and this year clapped on to their shoulders as well as to have this Bill renewed for a further five years.  In my opinion, this Bill is being passed too lightly through the House.  I think that those who it on the front Benches in this House should set themselves the task of finding a solution for this difficult problem, of providing, if possible, reproductive, or partially reproductive, work for those who are to be given assistance under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I remarked yesterday that it was a long time since we had the privilege of hearing Deputy Byrne making a contribution to the debates. I am glad to see that he is back to his old form.  The Deputy, as far as I can judge his attitude on this question, wants us to be like the ostrich, to put our heads in the sand and not see what is going on all around us. Because this unfortunate situation exists his idea is that we are not to speak about it, because it might re-act against the good name of the country or the city.  His idea is that as long as the eye does not see the heart need not grieve.  We have ample proof of the unemployment that exists in the figures that we have before us, showing the amount of money that was spent in giving meagre relief to the <Col N="619" /> destitute.  Perhaps Deputy Byrne would go to the Dublin Corporation offices occasionally.  If he does I guarantee that he will come back with a different point of view.  He will discover that the Party of which he is a member supports a Minister who interferes with local authorities, to the extent of prohibiting them putting into operation schemes which to a large extent would absorb the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The £40,000 that the Dublin Corporation has spent came out of the Relief Grant that was recently passed in this House, and has nothing whatever to do with what is spent on outdoor relief.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Byrne is prepared to make that assertion and to prove it, I will withdraw what I have said.  I am a member of the Corporation and I know what I am referring to.  Time after time schemes have been put up to the Minister by the Corporation.  He examines them, sends them back with queries, and we may get some of them through for small amounts.  The Corporation, not being allowed to use money for such purposes has been forced to borrow it, and to put the schemes into operation in the interests of the unemployed, thus reducing the expenditure on nonproductive work.  The Minister does not interfere however when he appoints Commissioners.  There is no harm in having an Act of this kind on the stocks.  If the Government was out to establish industry, and to create work which would absorb the unemployed, there would then be no necessity to take advantage of the relief works.  There would be no danger to the type of mind represented by Deputy Byrne if all the people who might benefit by relief work had employment. Perhaps Deputy Byrne will think the matter over and reconsider his attitude.</P>

      <P>When he had Commissioners in the city of Dublin the Minister allowed them to anticipate legislation and to spend £57,000 on relief.  If there was a locally elected body there he would have stopped them doing so, and they would be surcharged. On the other hand, the offences of his agents, the Commissioners, were remitted.  I am not opposed to the fact that relief was <Col N="621" /> given in that way, but I want to show the Minister that if an elected body or a Corporation sought to give relief under existing legislation every impediment would be put in their way, while his agents could anticipate legislation and spend the ratepayers money without having any Act of Parliament authorising them to do so.</P>

      <P>I will come to that.  I am glad that the Minister is not quibbling with the fact that the Commissioners were his agents, even to the extent I stated.  No local body would have dared to spend money in anticipation of legislation, because the secretary of any such body would have read the section of an Act of Parliament indicating that they would be surcharged if they did so.  On the other hand, the Minister's agents, the Commissioners, could do so.  That is a procedure that we hope will not be repeated.  I would also like to show the difficulties that local bodies have to face when they send up schemes for the Minister's consideration.  Inspectors are sent down to examine them.</P>

I cannot in a way prove by the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle the interference of the Minister in the starting of work which would give employment to a number of people and the relief that is ruled out.  But the Minister knows his Department does hamper it.  Deputy Byrne gave figures of 25,000 unemployed people in the Free State.  I wrote to a firm who recently opened a factory here&mdash;Messrs. Gallaher&mdash;and they told me they had 45,000 applications for jobs.  I have the letter in my bag if Deputy Byrne would like to see it.

      <P>An unemployed person does not need to be either a man or woman.  Is Deputy Byrne not satisfied with that?  Deputy Byrne wants to make out that a girl who is unemployed is not unemployed because she is a female.  Deputy Byrne also stated that it is either the Government who is to blame or the Corporation.  I say it is both.  We do not accept responsibility for the mal-administration of affairs in this country by the Government nor do those of us on the Corporation accept responsibility because first of all, the Corporation has, as the Deputy is aware, very limited powers &mdash;practically none&mdash;and on the other hand, the few powers they have if put into operation are controlled by the Government under the different name of the Constitutional Group who have the majority on it.  So whether Deputy Byrne is correct in blaming the Government or the Corporation he can have it as he likes.  As far as we are concerned it is either the Constitutional Group or it is his Government. Deputy Lemass pointed out that there were 6,000 families who had qualified for relief.  I know of cases under the Act where persons who have not sufficient money to pay for rooms and have not therefore an address cannot qualify.  These people are not included because first of all, you must have a permanent address to qualify for relief.  If you have not got that you can go and live in the Park and get your relief there.  Deputy Good spoke&mdash;I do not attach much importance to it and I am glad to see that Deputy O'Connell did not attach much importance to it&mdash;of the percentage of non-Dublin people who are being supported by the Dublin ratepayers. Does Deputy Good dispute the fact that when country people come here to Dublin they are always given priority by the Master Builders' <Col N="624" /> Association as labourers?  If they are good enough to come here to build the city they are good enough to be considered for the purposes of relief.</P>

He has heard frequent complaints that these five are not sufficient in number to cope with the demand on their time and the people who require their assistance.  Balrothery, which deals with much less has twelve such Commissioners, and Rathdown has twelve.  But Dublin City which has to deal with as much as the rest of the country put together has five Commissioners to administer this relief, and the Minister has not in the meanwhile seen the mistake he has made in the Bill and has not thought fit to bring in <Col N="625" /> amending legislation to enable the City of Dublin to have that number increased from five to fifteen.</P>
      <P>I was trying yesterday to include it in this Bill, but the procedure of the House would not permit of it and I will have to bring in a special Bill to amend the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether he is prepared to bring in that legislation so as to make it possible to administer this relief.  I spoke before of agents. Perhaps I used the wrong term.  The Minister was anxious to know what I meant.  I mean the Minister's restrictions not only in the Bills that he puts through this House and which Deputy Byrne, who objects now, supported, but the restrictions he also puts from time to time through the members of his own Department.  Those are his agents&mdash;people who threaten for five months to surcharge an elected representative if he happens to make a mistake in the interests of humanity and the people who will remit such charges in the case of his own Commissioners if they stretch the point too far whether it is in the interests of humanity or not.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Deputy two questions.  The Deputy started on a question of agents and said that because a person gets something from the National Health Insurance or has income in some other way that a Minister's agent interfered with the discretion of the Union Authorities in Dublin as to whether they would give a certain amount of money or some other point.  The Deputy does not persist in that statement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will put the most lenient interpretation I can on the Minister's explanation.  We hope that there will be no interference when full relief is given to a person drawing national health insurance.  I hope the Minister will not find occasion to repudiate what he has said now.  I do not want to delay the House longer, but I want to say if the Government had accepted, of their own volition, the suggestion of this Party in trying to judge the housing situation as a national scheme they would probably have got nearer to solving the unemployment problem.  At the same time, they would be able to solve to a certain extent the difficulties which the ratepayers of Dublin are faced with due to the administration of this poor law relief.  If the Government will facilitate and not impede works they will then be going a step towards what Deputy Good wants and what Deputy Byrne wants, namely, that any money spent even by way of relief goes to help local bodies to build <Col N="627" /> houses and will be on a reproductive basis.  I hope the Minister will definitely indicate that if he finds the number of people in need of outdoor relief increasing from 6,000 to 12,000 there is going to be no reduction in the amount of relief given.</P>

      <P>Any difference of opinion that exists is not, I think, on the question as to whether the destitute should be relieved or not, but it is as to whether the cost of that relief, according to this Bill, is falling fairly or not, and whether Deputy O'Connell or Deputy Good is right on that point can only be determined when there has been that inquiry for which Deputy Good has asked, and when, in fact, the whole problem of poor law relief is investigated.  In the temporary character of this Bill this House retains the power of applying pressure to get that inquiry from time to time, and if it gives away that power for five years I think it will be making a great mistake.  I think the very most it ought to do is to do what Deputy Good has asked for, and insist in the Bill not being extended for a greater period than two years.</P>

      <P>I am supporting this Bill primarily because I believe it is merely an extension of poor law relief Bills.  With other Deputies, from all parts of the House, I regret that the occasion has arisen for the introduction of such a measure.  I believe that some attempt should be made by the Government of the day to deal with this question not by way of recurring relief grants but by tackling the problem as it ought to be tackled in a national way.  The Minister for Local Government asked that some concrete suggestions be put up as to how this inquiry should be brought about.  After all that is a matter of Governmental responsibility.  It is not for members of the Opposition Party to indicate to the Government in office the ways in which these economic problems should be tackled. We can, of course, from time to time, make suggestions.  I would make this suggestion to the Minister for his information and future guidance.  It is an easy matter for him to suggest a committee of the whole House to inquire into this problem of unemployment and to accept some responsibility. I am glad to say that Deputy Byrne also suggested that the Government should accept some little responsibility for the unemployed and for providing useful and reproductive employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said, particularly by Deputy Good, with regard to the burden on the ratepayers of Dublin and the gravitation of people from provincial areas into Dublin. Deputy Good must know as well as I do that that is common to the metropolis of every country in the world. Certain economic and other forces will have operated and will continue to operate to attract persons from the provinces towards the metropolis. It has been found on examination that that is one of the great <Col N="629" /> advantages possessed by a metropolis. Let us take Dublin as an instance. You find that these provincials have brought into the City of Dublin a good deal of business capacity and in other ways have improved the whole position of the City of Dublin.  It would be as well for Deputy Good to remember his own place of origin.</P>

We find that most of the successful business men&mdash;I know that there are unsuccessful business men in Dublin&mdash;came from the counties. That is true of every metropolis.  I am not a biologist, but I know something about what might occur if Dublin City had not been fed by the provinces.  Of course, we have heard the old story reiterated about Cork, about the man leaving Cork not taking a return ticket.  Possibly it is a very good thing for Dublin, because we find in the Government and in the State departments of this country the best intellects come from Cork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of this Bill is one that I do not agree with, as I have said. It is a national disgrace that we have from year to year to consider relief Bills.  At the same time, we must remember that this economic depression is not confined to this country&mdash; it is fairly general.  Here we see an attempt, at any rate, at relieving the unemployed.  I agree that it is only a <Col N="630" /> paltry attempt.  But it is a tentative measure, and as such I give it my support.  I would, however, prefer to support a measure which would give some kind of permanent relief in the shape of employment. I agree that it is demoralising to people to have to come along for these relief grants and I hope that at some period of their existence the Government will evolve some scheme that will bring about a greater measure of employment and reproductive work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interfere in a matter concerning the City of Dublin but like Deputy Anthony I regret the occasion has arisen for this Bill.  I am principally concerned with the statement made by Deputy Good with regard to the gravitation of country people to Dublin.  Deputy Good knows very well that he and some of his associates are principally responsible for that because we repeatedly see advertisements in provincial newspapers from building firms in Dublin for country boys to work as builders' labourers, to be brought up here so as to pull down the wages here to Deputy Good's satisfaction.  After bringing them in, when they are unemployed, Deputy Good does not want to feed them.  I would not like to be a country boy who would come up here trusting to the tender mercies of Deputy Good or anyone like him. Then we have the statement of the Minister that the estimate for this was £120,000 and that only £81,000 was used.  Is Deputy Good aware of the reason for that?  The reason this money was not used is that a large number of the unemployed went down to Ford's factory in Cork looking for work and perhaps they are now a burden on the ratepayers of Cork. Deputy Good does not look at it from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Good wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If he would consult Deputy French he would find out from him how many people from Dublin have applied to him to get them employment in Ford's and it would <Col N="631" /> open his eyes.  Deputy Byrne talked about a constructive effort on the part of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Byrne was one of the dumb-driven cows who sat there last night when Deputy Lemass was pleading for a tariff which would give employment to a large number of people.  Deputy Byrne sat there dumb and had nothing to say and then walked into the Lobby and voted against it.  We do not want to see relief given; we want to see employment given in the country.  There were sneers from the Government Benches some time ago when I pointed out that £133,000 was sent out of this country last year for foreign malt to give work to malt-house workers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  That money was taken from the labourers of the Free State and handed over to these people.  We saw Deputies opposite walking into the Lobby against a proposal to have that industry supported here and to prevent that foreign malt coming in.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne and Deputy Good and the rest of these Deputies want to see nothing in this country but what they can gather into their own pockets. They are afraid that any employment will be given that will increase the workers' wages.  We are sick of this complaint.  I was expecting to see the Minister arise in his terror and withdraw the Bill, when I remembered that the very same opposition was given to an amendment which he proposed to a Relief Bill here before. That amendment was opposed, just as this Bill is opposed, by Deputy Good and Deputy Thrift, and the Minister not alone offered to withdraw his amendment but when leave was refused walked into the Lobby and voted against it, under the whip of the real rulers of the Free State.  I expected therefore to see the Minister to-day withdrawing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Briscoe's allusion here to the Minister's idea of anticipating legislation, because on Tuesday last I was present at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the Cork County Council when a letter was read from the Minister asking the Council to anticipate legislation <Col N="632" /> by making an estimate for another work.</P>

      <P>We are sick of arguments of this description.  Deputy Good apparently thinks that because an unfortunate man is unemployed here he and his family should die of hunger.  Apparently the influence of Deputy Good and those who think like him succeeded in preventing for a number of years a Relief Bill such as this being brought in for Dublin when outdoor relief was being paid to able-bodied persons in other parts of the Free State.  The idea of Deputy Good and of Deputy Byrne was to let these people die of hunger rather than give them anything in the way of relief. When I take up the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; to-morrow I hope I shall not see any advertisements from the Dublin Master Builders' Association looking for strong country boys to become builders' labourers in Dublin in order to bring them up here and offer them the wage fixed by the Minister for Local Government for road work&mdash;29s. per week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Corry is fully convinced that he is going to be ashamed of me until he dies.  First and foremost, the discussion here to-day affords an indication why I think this Bill should be extended for five years so that we shall not be discussing, through four stages, a Dublin Relief Bill here and, though, perhaps, with less discussion, nevertheless through four stages, the same Bill in the Seanad, year in and year out, to relieve the situation in Dublin, simply because when legislation dealing with the matter of relief of the able-bodied was being dealt with for the country as a whole, Dublin City and County, because of special considerations, were left out, and because later in 1929, it being made clear that it was desirable that that legislation should be extended to Dublin City and County, it was extended only as a temporary measure because of the fears raised in the minds of some people that this was going to be an imposition on the city.  We are doing nothing in this Bill but extending to the City and County of Dublin the ordinary poor relief legislation that exists throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been emphasised that this is a temporary measure, and was a temporary measure.  It was made clear originally that it was a temporary measure, but Deputies should not get it into their heads that the extension of outdoor relief to the able-bodied had been brought into Dublin City and County simply as a temporary measure, because that is attempting to live with the idea that you are going to cut off that particular type of relief in Dublin City and County or in the rest of the country. It has been suggested here that this whole matter needs inquiry; but no one has made it clear what inquiry is wanted.  Deputy Good wants inquiry as to whether Dublin is not flooded out with non-Dublin people coming into it.  Deputy Lemass, I think, wants an inquiry that will result in a different <Col N="634" /> system of relief entirely being brought about.  He wants this Bill to be got rid of, and some other form of maintenance provided for persons other than relief of the able-bodied.</P>
    <P>Now we are convinced that the change that was made in the system of institutional and outdoor relief in the country as a whole, including Dublin City and County, provided the country with the most satisfactory possible system for dealing with the poor requiring relief.  And we are certainly not going to set up any inquiry to consider, at this stage, whether a change should be made either in the incidence of or in the way outdoor relief is given either to the able-bodied or to the unemployed.  As far as Dublin City is concerned, I am convinced that the poor in Dublin never before were better relieved than they are to-day, and that never was there more effective machinery for ascertaining their needs and bringing them relief than there is to-day under the present system.  In the administration of the present system the officers engaged in it have the closest possible connection with some, at any rate, of the charitable societies in the City.</P>
    <P>When dealing with this matter before I think Deputy Lemass wanted all charitable societies to be a thing of the past.  Now he wants that type of relief to be a thing of the past. In spite of the opinion of the Deputy, I make the statement that the poor have a better system and are better dealt with, in the matter of relief, to-day than they were in the whole history of the City of Dublin.  As to the fears of those who think that the unemployed from all parts of the country are coming in here to the City, and being relieved at the expense of the Dublin people, that is not so.  Those engaged in this particular class of work are convinced that that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The employers in Dublin could, perhaps, give evidence as to that.  But, apart altogether from the opinions of those close up against this particular class of relief, the fact that there have been so few acceptances of indoor relief by persons not having two years period of living in Dublin, and that the expenses that have been incurred in the matter of removing persons not entitled to relief to other parts of the country have been very small, something like £26 or £28 for the whole eleven months, goes to emphasise that.  The question has again been raised that the Government should be responsible for providing employment that would absorb all the unemployed.  The Bill of 1929 made provision by which local authorities responsible for relief were given every possible opportunity for organising that work as part of their relief scheme.  There was a lot of chipping and chopping of words and a tremendous amount of passing of amendments was gone on with lest the ordinary employment in the city should be disturbed by works organised for relief purposes.  I was driven to say that the most magnificent words possible might be found, and enshrined in the Act, but I did not think they would assist materially those responsible for administering the Act to find work, and the difficulty, again, is to find work that can be organised for the purpose of absorbing people that require relief. It is for the local authorities close up against the problem, dealing with the individual persons, and who know the possibility of organising the work in their areas, to consider how work may best be organised, and if we get any suggestions from local bodies involved in this particular class of work or duty, whether in Dublin or elsewhere, the different departments of the Government will certainly co-operate with them and help them to turn into work the energies and money spent on relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of work, as against monetary assistance, in the matter of relief, is one that agitated poor law authorities for centuries past. <Col N="636" /> Opinion has swung between one practice and another, from time to time.  However, in so far as the local authorities in Dublin are concerned they are close up against the situation. They have the opportunity of consultation with members of the Dublin Corporation and officials and experts as to how the work can be organised, and they can do that more satisfactorily than any one not directly charged with the responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe told me that I have heard repeatedly that the Committee dealing with Dublin Union affairs is too small.  I have not.  I understand that the Union Committee propose seeing me in connection with the matter and then I may hear something about it, but I do not think that a committee of five is too small a committee to deal with Dublin Union matters in the City of Dublin and I do not see, as the question has been raised here now, that a committee of fifteen would be anything but a less satisfactory number as a committee to deal with it.  That is my view at the moment whatever I may think after I discuss the matter.  On the one question&mdash;the question of extending it for five years&mdash;what I am anxious about is, that we here will not be discussing, with as little help to relief in Dublin as we are discussing it this evening, the question of relief in the city next year, the year after that, and the year following that.  I said that normally in the county at any rate an arrangement might be made, and it might be accepted that within the City and County of Dublin you could have a joint scheme.</P>

      <P>I must say that I do not contemplate that within the next five years either in Dublin or in any part of the country you will be able to do without a scheme of outdoor relief to the infirm and to the able-bodied of the kind at present enshrined in our legislation.  But what may happen in Dublin and what I would like to see happen is a joint scheme arranged between the local authorities in the City and in the County of Dublin.  I am open to persuasion on the question as to what is to happen in five years.  I do submit that we are not assisting in dealing with the relief position in Dublin by arranging to have an annual discussion on the Dublin relief question here on a temporary Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister just touched on one matter on which I was anxious to get more information&mdash; that is, the operation of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 1929.  That is, the part of the Act dealing with the power of the Local Authorities to pay the expenses of people to where they would expect to get employment, and also the question of the provision of work. Has the Minister been examining that situation or has he any report to give the House on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House that very little was called upon to be done in the matter of paying removal expenses of people who applied for relief in the city to enable them to go to other parts of the country.  After the Act has been in operation for practically eleven months the total cost under this head was £28 10s.  As far as work was concerned, the Union authorities were not able to organise any work except the work that was in progress at the time that the 1929 Bill was going through the Oireachtas. That work was in connection with the preparation of the ground for building near the Home Farm Road.  But I understood that the present Union authorities had arranged to co-operate with the Corporation so that the Corporation would give employment on some of their relief schemes to people applying for and in receipt of home assistance.  That is, some schemes that have been organised under the grants <Col N="638" /> given from the Relief Vote to the Dublin Corporation.  This work is being done from the moneys of the Corporation and this Relief Grant.  The Corporation have arranged to take from the Union authorities a certain number of men in receipt of outdoor relief and put them at this work.</P>

      <P>The work was in progress in Drumcondra at the time when the 1929 Act was passed, and it was discontinued before the end of 1930.  At no time were there more than 300 persons employed on that scheme.  The numbers varied.  The men were employed for three days a week, and for those three days' work they were in fact paid 35s.  There was an arrangement by which, I think, in the beginning, they were paid 30s., but then a bonus was arranged and the payment was 35s. for three days. What the total amount involved in that work was, I could not say.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section applies only to works complying with both the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the work consists of the provision of sewers or sewage disposal or the provision or improvement of a supply of water for a place situate within the county health district of the board of health by which the work is executed; and</P>
    <P>(b)  that the capital cost of the work is defrayed out of borrowed moneys and the expenses of the repayment of such moneys are raisable as special expenses under the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1919, as amended by the Local Government Acts, 1925 and 1927, of an area less than a county health district.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4) (a), line 47, after the word &ldquo;provision&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or improvement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down because it is not quite clear from the terms of the <Col N="640" /> Bill whether improvement is understood here.  Is it the opinion of the Minister that improvement, say, of a water supply will come under the facilities provided by this Bill, whereas the improvement, for example, of a sewer or of the method of disposal of sewage will not come within its provisions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was drafted explicitly because of the difference between sewers and sewage disposal on the one hand, and the supply of water on the other.  I am advised that the Bill, as at present drafted, fulfils the necessary requirements and that there is no improvement of sewers or sewage disposal that would not come within its provisions. Where you deal with the provision or the improvement of a water supply you are dealing with a different thing.  I am advised that the additional wording is not necessary, but if the Deputy thinks that it would tend to make the position safer than it is I have no objection.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for the lay mind to see the full implications of this measure; it is difficult to see why, if you extend a water supply or a sewerage system and make improvements of various sorts, there should be a difference between the one and the other.  It seems to me that the inclusion of these words is advisable if the Minister has no special purpose in excluding the improvement of existing schemes.  I do not know much, I am sorry to say, about this particular type of work, but it is conceivable that a new system of sewage disposal or an improvement in existing systems could be got.  If there was an existing system and an improvement was anticipated, the work necessary in that respect should come under the facilities of this measure. If there is any question about the matter why not make it clear here? I would be better satisfied if the change were made so as to make it quite clear that improvements in the ordinary acceptation of the word <Col N="641" /> could be made under this measure, just as well as new works.</P>

      <P>I am emphasising that when Deputy de Valera speaks of the lay mind being satisfied, I am prepared to satisfy the lay mind.

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

You might have the position where there is what is termed a built sewer and certain members of a county council might say that that sewer fulfils requirements in the event of a particular locality advocating a pipe sewer in its place; they might regard the pipe sewer as a new sewer, whereas it would really be only an improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

I say that it is very difficult to the lay mind to understand why you can improve a water supply and you cannot improve methods of disposal of sewage or you cannot improve a sewerage system.  I would be quite satisfied if the Minister got his draftsman to draft this amendment in such a way that the ordinary lay mind would understand the matter.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4) (b), page 3, line 1, delete the words &ldquo;the capital cost of the work&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;there is involved only such portion of the capital cost of the work as.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is more or less of the same character as the first amendment.  It is intended also to satisfy the lay mind.  There seems to be a difference of opinion amongst legal men&mdash; at least they are not quite certain&mdash; that capital cost here would cover what the amendment is intended to cover, namely, &ldquo;such portion of the capital cost of the work as...&rdquo;  The section would then read: &ldquo;...only such portion of the capital cost of the work as is defrayed out of borrowed moneys...&rdquo;  Suppose a grant is made by the Minister for certain works, the facilities under the Act ought to be made available for such portion of it as would not be met by the grant.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I think, some mistake in this, because the whole thing is governed by the unfortunate phrase that introduces the section.  I had to try to work the amendment in with the phrase that introduces the section: &ldquo;This section applies only to works complying with both the following conditions, that is to say&rdquo;&mdash;and then follow paragraphs (a) and (b).

      <P>Here again I am advised that the section completely covers what is intended and what, no doubt, arises even where a relief grant is given.  If it is necessary to make the matter more clear perhaps the Deputy would like something like this: &ldquo;that the capital cost of the work to be defrayed by the Board of Health is so defrayed out of borrowed moneys.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The question is whether the board of health would not be defraying the whole lot.  It would get money from two sources, from a grant and borrowed moneys under the facilities in this Act.  I do not mind how the Minister drafts it so long as he brings out the idea that the facilities of this Act are available for whatever portion of the capital cost of the work has to be met out of borrowed moneys.  If that is done I am quite satisfied.  The introductory words make it difficult to get in any suitable amendment.</P>

    <P>It will be remembered that under the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930, certain moneys had to be paid into either the Treasury or the Central Fund in respect of leasings of workhouse lands from the time of the passing of the 1924 Act.  Provision was made that they would be paid to the Minister for Local Government, who would pay them to the areas in respect of which they were raised.  The sum of £439 is part of these moneys.  The additional sum required under the School Meals Act is £685.  That is partly in respect of <Col N="645" /> school meals in two towns in which there are town commissioners, Mullingar and Ballyshannon, and which availed during the current year of the provisions of the School Meals Act, 1930, which enabled towns of that kind to come in.  A sum of £655 out of that amount is to cover the excess anticipated in the State grants for the provision of school meals to other school authorities showing an extension of the school meal system.  A sum of £2,648 is in respect of school meals in the Gaeltacht arising out of the passing of the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930.</P>

Arrangements have been made and are in operation for the provision of meals, consisting of cocoa, milk, sugar, bread and butter or jam in all the national schools of the scheduled area of the County Kerry Board of Health.  The number of schools participating is 56, with an average daily attendance of 3,792.  Meals are provided in 99 national schools in Galway County Health District, with an average attendance of 4,492.  The standard meal consists of cocoa, milk, bread (white and brown), sugar and butter or jam.  A similar scheme operates in five schools in the Adrigole area of Cork County Health District, with an average attendance of 291.  In the case of three other national schools involved in the Cork Board of Health District which will come under the scheme, arrangements have not yet been made.  The Donegal Board of Health originally submitted an estimated expenditure sufficient to qualify for the maximum amount of the grant, but subsequently decided to postpone its operation for a year.  In Mayo the Commissioner, who is acting as the board of health and public assistance <Col N="646" /> board there, decided not to adopt the scheme until the coming financial year, So far as the general scheme is concerned, I do not know whether there has been any addition to any of the towns.  I gave a list of them when dealing with the Local Government Estimate at the beginning of the year. If the Deputy would like a list of the towns in which school meals are given under the original Act, and if he puts down a question, I will have a list furnished.

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,450 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1931, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including Sundry Grants-in-Aid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The form of this Estimate makes it somewhat difficult to follow.  The Vote is for a net sum of £11,450.  The first item is for a sum of £3,300, a grant-in-aid for the new Sea Fisheries Association to put it at once in funds.  This grant relates to the period up to the 31st March next only.  The Association was registered on the 20th November, 1930, and it has already begun to function.  Particulars of the sum of <Col N="649" /> £3,300 will be found in page 2 of the Estimate.  The first item is £1,800 for the expenses of the formation and administration of the Association, including the salaries of the manager, secretary and other staff, the cost of premises, stationary, printing, and so on.  The directors themselves are acting voluntarily, and no expense will be incurred in that way, except mere out-of-pocket expenses of those who have to come from a distance to attend meetings of the directors.</P>
    <P>The second item is a sum of £1,000 for allowances for boats and gear, and the third an item of £500 for development. The directors have already made a survey of all branches of the industry. because, as Deputies who are interested will know, sea fisheries comprise, in fact, about half a dozen entirely different industries, and they have begun to move in more than one direction. As to the manner in which they propose to deal with different aspects of the industry, I will be in a better position to go into that on presenting the Estimates for the Department for the coming year.  There remains, in addition to this sea fisheries grant-in-aid, a sum of £8,150.  Of this about £4,000 is required in connection with cottage industries and the other £4,000 in connection with the sub-heads relating to kelp and carrigeen moss.  The sum required in connection with the cottage industries represents the expenses of accumulating at the central depot in Beggar's Bush a number of pieces of hand-woven tweed so as to enable prompt and regular supplies to be made to the trade.  Deputies are probably aware that a certain number of travellers have been appointed by the Department.  These carry patterns of all the materials which are stocked, and it is necessary to keep in stock at least one piece of each pattern.  In fact, there is at the moment at the central depot a stock of tweeds of the value of about £6,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from this consideration, the expansion of the industry has been somewhat slower than was anticipated when the original Estimate was introduced 18 months ago.  In the tweeds, for instance, weavers came in at the outset more slowly than was anticipated. I am glad to say they are now <Col N="650" /> coming in greater numbers.  Six months ago there were only about 20 weavers, whereas at the moment we have 70 weavers working and in training. There are four training centres in Donegal and another one is to be opened.  There is a centre also at Carrowroe in Connemara, one at Ballydavid in Kerry, and one is about to be opened at Tourmakeady in Co. Mayo.  In machine-knitting the difficulties of organisation have been greater than was anticipated.  It has been found necessary to bring up nearly all the manageresses of these industries to Dublin for a course of instruction.  It is desired to bring the standard of workmanship up to a certain high level which will enable the products to be given the trade mark of the depôt.  This reorganisation and the taking away of the instructresses has limited the output for the time being.  The abandonment of the old standards and the realisation of the new has not been a very easy task. We have achieved a new standard in a good proportion of the materials and garments turned out, and hope soon to realise it in the case of the others.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate for kelp and carrigeen was a token vote of £10 for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the House for certain steps which it was proposed to take.  In the case of carrigeen the sum required is £300. This represents portion of the sums paid for the gathering and grading of about ten tons of carrigeen which have been specially cured and graded and which are now in hand for the purpose of sale in packets as food. That was specially good carrigeen. Most of the carrigeen moss was sold for industrial purposes.  It was sold for something like £16 per ton, as against the £8 per ton that was generally paid formerly.  The carrigeen that is in hand will, it is estimated, fill about 100,000 boxes.  It is hoped to have it on the market during the middle of next month.  The receipts from it will not appear in this financial year.</P>
    <P>In the case of kelp there are certain lots around on isolated portions of the coast which have been bought and paid for, but which are not being collected because of the difficulties of shipment. These will be gathered with the coming <Col N="651" /> season's weed and shipped with it. The total amount is about 200 tons, and the value about £1,200.  In connection with the operations of last season it was necessary to buy weighing machines, 25,000 boxes, metal labels, chemical outfits, and other stores, costing about £1,700.  It would not be fair to charge this against one season's operations.  It represents capital expenditure on equipment which will last over a number of years.  There was a loss on the operations last season due to several causes.  For instance, there were cases of kelp which for various reasons was of very poor quality.  During the war the kelp was bought principally for its potash content rather than its iodine content.  Some of that weed is of very poor quality from the point of view of iodine content.</P>
    <P>This year the persons accustomed to gathering that weed in the past acted in good faith and gathered it thinking that it had the value now that it formerly had.  We intend to stop the use of that weed altogether.  In other cases the weed was not stacked and saved in the best manner or was not burned in the best way.  We had to decide whether we were going to refuse to take this kelp, or whether we were going to pay a very small price for it.  We decided, especially in the cases which I have been speaking of, where the kelp was gathered from the wrong weed, that as those who had gathered it acted in good faith we would pay them roughly £4 or £5 a ton for the kelp.  In most cases the price paid was £4 a ton.  In some instances this kelp that I am speaking of was taken elsewhere and purchased at very good prices, indeed at prices very much beyond its actual value.  The state of things that prevailed last year for the first time in the history of the industry produced a very abnormal condition that I should say is unlikely to recur.  The better the kelp and the higher the prices the Department was able to pay, the more satisfactory was the financial result.</P>
    <P>Tory Island was the brightest spot in the whole business.  This is a place where the kelp produced in the past has been of rather poor quality, but <Col N="652" /> the kelp makers there paid the closest attention to the advice given to them by the Department.  For this result I think a great deal of credit is due to the priest who was stationed there at the time, Father Gallagher.  The average price paid for the kelp on the Island was £9 16s. 10d. a ton.  The highest price paid was £14 a ton.  From the point of view of the kelp-makers and of the Department the transactions carried out there were very satisfactory indeed.  I do not wish the figures I have given to be taken as anything like the average price that one might expect in the future, because the kelp on Tory Island was made from the sea rods gathered during the winter.  These made kelp of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>There was no May weed washed up in Tory last season owing to the absence of storms.  As Deputies will remember, last May was probably one of the finest months we had during the year.  From the point of view of the kelp gatherer, storms in May are welcome. But last year we had storms and a lot of bad weather in August and September&mdash;at a wrong time from the point of view of the kelp gatherer.</P>
    <P>Six Irish-speaking instructors, who are practical kelp makers, have been appointed.  These instructors are working under an Irish-speaking organiser. At the moment they are taking a laboratory course as well as practical instruction.  The position, therefore, is that next year every place around the coast will have an opportunity of conducting kelp-gathering and burning on the lines carried out in Tory last season.  There are other reasons why the expenses last year were larger than will normally be the case.  One is that it was rather late in the year when we decided to go on with the undertaking.  The question was whether we should go on with it last year or wait and make all the necessary preparations by way of providing stores and so on; that is to say, to postpone the thing for a year in order that proper preparations might be made, or to tackle the thing last year and see what could possibly be done in the absence of these facilities.</P>
    <P>For instance, we purchased weighing <Col N="653" /> machines and got chemists.  At any rate we decided to go on last year, and that is the reason why the cost is a bit heavier.  We decided that whatever disadvantages there might be in proceeding without the very best facilities at every point that that would be outweighed by the experience gained in tackling the problem. The bad weather also involved us in additional cost by way of shipment. It was a long time before we were enabled to charter a Saorstát boat at any reasonable freight.  Eventually we had to go to the Clyde for a steamer, and in the case of certain small consignments we were forced to use a couple of the Department's motor boats which were not engaged in fishing at the time.  These boats were not entirely adapted for this particular job, and at any rate that is not an economic way of shipping the weed. In future seasons there will be more time to make arrangements in regard to all these matters.  In some places, owing to the absence of storage, we had to stack the kelp and cover it with tarpaulin pending shipment.  That does not help to improve the quality of the kelp.  In future we hope to be able to make more satisfactory arrangements for storage.</P>
    <P>Taking the result of last season as a whole, and the information which I have with regard to the kelp handled by the Department, and other information that I have in regard to kelp sold elsewhere, it is estimated that the total output was increased by about 40 per cent., while the total sum received by the kelp-makers was increased by about 80 per cent., or an additional sum between £12,000 and £13,000.  In the figures which formed the basis of the total estimate I had budgeted for a much larger increase in the total output. I expected to have an output of 5,000 tons.  The actual output, due to the fact that the May weed was not washed up, was 3,500 tons.  That was about 40 per cent. of an increase on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I budgeted on the fact that the whole of the kelp output would be handled by the Department. That did not turn out to be the case. Some buyers did not see fit to make <Col N="654" /> purchases through the Department, but preferred to buy direct from the kelp-makers.  I am glad to say, however, that the prices which they paid were in most cases much in excess of the prices they paid in former years. The proportion of the total amount of kelp handled by the Department was, I think, something over two-thirds of the whole output.  I would like to make it clear that the Department is not a buyer of kelp.  The Department is merely acting as agent for the kelp-makers. There is no question, therefore, of substituting a new monopoly for a monopoly that formerly existed. The Department wishes to encourage every buyer who is willing to pay a fair price.  All the former buyers were invited to meet us last year, to discuss the future arrangements in the interests of everyone concerned.  One of the principal buyers did so, and we entered into mutually satisfactory arrangements, which resulted in his making a larger purchase of kelp than in the previous year.  The other buyers did not come into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The object of the whole scheme is to ensure a fair price and a market to absorb a much greater output of kelp. It will be remembered that these were the great difficulties of kelp makers in former years.  They never knew if they would get purchasers.  The matter was carefully considered, and the conclusion we came to was that there was only one way in which it could be satisfactorily dealt with.  It is the way we have adopted.  I think it is one to which the House has given its full support.  It has been suggested that people are being put out of business owing to the action of the Department. So far as this country is concerned people are not being put out of business but they are actually being put into business by the Department. More kelp makers are coming in.  We have one iodine factory established in Galway, and there is no reason why anyone should go out of business.  Anyone who wishes to buy kelp we shall be glad to receive, and we have no doubt that the results will be as satisfactory to the buyers as to the kelp burners.  The only interest we wish to serve is the interest of the kelp makers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> A good deal of research is proceeding in the Galway iodine factory which, I anticipate, will result in further improvements in the quality of the kelp. There is research in the way of a better method of burning and in the general handling of the weed.  Some of the results already obtained are of a striking nature, and if they work out in actual commercial practice as they have done in the laboratory one may expect very great things indeed from the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>What does it say on other sub-heads?  The Minister has failed to explain the anticipated savings on other sub-heads of £27,725. The position is that last year a Supplementary Estimate was introduced amounting to something like £44,000, and we were told that that amount would not, in fact, represent a loss, because it would simply mean that it represented the purchase of kelp; that the kelp would be sold, that the net loss to the State would be nominal, and would, in fact, only amount to £10. The kelp scheme was to have been run on a self-supporting basis.  The Minister stated that in the preceding year 3,000 tons of kelp were collected but that under the scheme last year 5,000 tons were to be collected.  I do not know whether the 5,000 tons were collected or not.  It seems to me that if the scheme had improved in the way anticipated there should not have been any loss.  Whether the scheme has improved or not as regards the total output, or the total amount of kelp collected, the fact remains that something has gone radically wrong with the finances of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister definitely stated that the kelp was gathered largely in May. If that is so, the kelp should be saved and sold by this time.  The fact that there is £1,200 worth on hands should <Col N="656" /> not mean a deficit because the amount sold should have been sufficient to right matters.  In fact, we have only £1,200 worth of kelp on hands, so that the amount in hands is not going to help us to square accounts.  I am not clear at all as to how the deficit of £37,750 has arisen.  The trouble in this matter is that Deputies on this side of the House are absolutely out of touch with the details of the scheme. We know that the scheme has been going on.  We had to take the Minister's word for granted that the scheme was going to pay for itself, and that there would be no loss.  The Minister has come along now and has, I submit, given no explanation whatever for the deficit of £37,750 nor has he explained how, under this financial adjustment, the £37,750 is reduced by the anticipated savings to £11,450.  We are quite at sea as to the financial details of the kelp scheme.  We do not know exactly what has taken place.  We do not know what is the position of the persons in charge of the kelp scheme.  Is the whole thing from start to finish a State enterprise, or what is the position of those private individuals who have a commercial interest in the scheme?</P>
    <P>The Department is certainly to be congratulated on having made a serious effort to put this important industry, which concerns the lives of the poorest and the most Irish-speaking people in the Free State, on a proper basis.  But I submit that the House is entitled to more information than the Minister has given as to why things have gone awry in this manner.  The fact is that the explanations about the poor quality of the kelp and the proper type of weed not having been utilised and the fact that the Department did not want to let the kelp gatherers down&mdash;they bought this kelp from them even though they knew it was not proper stuff and knew that thereby the State was incurring a bigger loss&mdash;these explanations cannot be considered satisfactory although the thing is largely in an experimental condition.  Nevertheless, when we have the Department of Fisheries blazoning it forth as a wonderfully constructive scheme for the Gaeltacht areas I think <Col N="657" /> they should be able to show, if not a profit, at least some real effort to make the thing self-supporting in the earlier stages.  I am not at all satisfied with the explanation.  It seems to me that there has been bad management somewhere, and Deputies from the areas concerned will have something to say as to the manner in which this money has been expended.  We are all prepared to spend a certain amount of money in the Gaeltacht areas from which there will not be an immediate return if the object of putting an industry such as this on its feet is going to be secured, but what I am afraid is that in these particular circumstances there has been so much bungling in the beginning and bad handling of the whole situation that the State is in for heavy losses.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister asks the Dáil to pass the Supplementary Estimate I would urge him now, before the discussion goes any further, to let us have more details as to how exactly this scheme worked out during the past year, exactly how many tons were collected, and exactly what the losses were.  I cannot reconcile his figure of £4,000 for kelp and carrigeen with the £37,750 I see here in front of me. With regard to the carrigeen, we are in the same position.  The Minister says a big price has been paid, and if in the long run the product now being marketed by the Department is going to bring in an amount which will cover the expenses we shall all be very glad. I am afraid there will not be much possibility, even anticipating that the whole of the 100,000 boxes will be sold, that there will be any great profit for the State in the long run.  The Minister can boast that he has put a certain amount of money into certain areas in the country.  We all agree that that is a necessary and a good thing, but members of all Parties will look at this from the financial point of view, and they will really want more information as to the exact way in which this business is being carried out and as to the possibilities of its being run at a profit on some future occasion or not.  If there is no possibility of the carrigeen moss and the kelp industry being run at a profit as was anticipated, and if <Col N="658" /> the State is going to have to foot the bill as it has to do in this case, the sooner the Minister gets away from his generalities and makes that clear to the House the better.  I am convinced, however, that a much better effort could have been made to organise this industry properly.  I am not satisfied with the means taken to instruct kelp-gatherers in the proper saving of the weed.  I think, if necessary, the Frenchmen who are in this iodine business could have been brought across if suitable persons were not available in this country, as well as insisting that our instructors shall be as far as possible Irish-speaking.  Of course we must not be driven into the situation that we are going to pay instructors to come out just because they are Irish teachers to teach the saving of this weed which they do not understand themselves.  The whole question of the appointment of these instructors is one about which we have heard complaints, and we would like the Minister to assure the House that men are not going to be appointed as instructors until he is satisfied they have not alone the ordinary knowledge which a worker in the industry would have, but have some practical knowledge besides, and that some effort is being made by the Department to give them some technical training.</P>
    <P>The position of the other rural industries is one I would like the Minister to explain to us.  In the Gaeltacht areas, it seems to me, there has been a considerable falling off in the amount of money spent in wages in the rural industries, and now that we have established a central depot for these rural industries I think that the Department should have tried to keep all the persons who were being employed and to continue them in employment irrespective of any changes that were being made in design, and so on.  I feel confident that these girls who were working in these industries, and have been working in them for a good number of years, are quite capable of responding to any changes in fashion, and so on, that may be necessary, that they have the aptitude to make themselves suitable to these changes.  I am rather surprised that in some of the areas <Col N="659" /> large numbers of the girls have only a few hours' work in the week and were only able to draw a few shillings a week in wages.  The result is that every effort is being made by these people to get out of the country.  The fact that they cannot get out of the country now may be of some consolation to the Minister, but I submit more might have been done to keep them in constant employment.</P>
    <P>The position of the Sea Fisheries Association, which I think the Minister referred to, is one that is also causing some anxiety.  We have not seen any effort on the part of this Board to start operations, and I would impress on the Minister the necessity of the Board going to work as soon as possible. When we on this side of the House welcomed the appointment of members of that Board as men who had practical acquaintance with the fishing industry and who were familiar with the conditions throughout the country, we expected that these men when the responsibility was placed upon them would set to work in earnest and try and get a scheme going with the least possible delay.  So far there is nothing to show.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the housing grants there are some areas in the Gaeltacht which have not yet been visited by the Minister's inspectors, and it is a rather extraordinary thing after the way in which the Housing (Gaeltacht) Bill was rushed through the House with the cooperation of all Parties, and the amount of money that was provided for those grants, and the £5,000 that was provided for extra officials that, twelve months or more after the passing of the Act, no effort has been made to visit some of the areas let alone to give the grants, although in some of the areas I have visited the people have got their sand and stones together and, I was told, had actually remained at home from Scotland expecting that the grant would be forthcoming and that they would be able to start to build last autumn.  The Minister has a lot of responsibility on his hands, I know, but in the matter of houses I think more expedition could have been expected.  The Land Commission <Col N="660" /> have had housing schemes and grants in operation for a considerable time.  They are well acquainted with the details of the work, and there is no excuse whatever for not expending the money granted by the Dáil within the time allotted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Tubridy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see here under the heading I., Appropriations in-Aid, that the deficiency in the receipts from the sale of kelp and the deficiency in the sale of products of rural industries classes are all bulked together, amounting to a sum of £36,175.  As far as I remember, in the Estimate for the year the appropriation-in-aid of rural industries accounted for £15,850, which included repayment of industrial loans, so that I must take it then that the difference between the £13,000 and the £36,175 is due to a loss on the kelp and carrigeen services.  I do not think it was fair in this case to bulk the two together.  We should have been told exactly the deficiency in the kelp and carrigeen services.  I take it it is the difference between what was originally in the Estimates under the appropriations-in-aid, estimated at £13,000, and the £36,000 stated in this new Estimate. I have a suspicion in my mind that there has been even greater losses in the kelp industry, because in reply to a supplementary question that I asked to-day the Minister for Finance told me that the Minister for Fisheries was granted a certain sum out of the unemployment grant.  What sum it amounted to I cannot say.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us, when replying, what amount of money under the unemployment grant was handed to his Department, apart from the Land Commission grant, for expenditure in the kelp, and on what schemes it was spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of gangs employed in the West of Ireland collecting sea rods and building walls for the drying of the sea rods in the kelp industry at present.  They are paid directly.  I do not know whether this expenditure is coming under this heading here in the Vote for the Department of Fisheries and the kelp services or whether it is portion of the unemployment grant that is also being used <Col N="661" /> for this purpose by the Minister.  If the gangs at present employed in the West of Ireland in the kelp industry are being paid out of the unemployment fund, then the loss in the kelp business is much greater than what has been stated here.</P>
    <P>I think also that the Minister should have given us some information about the iodine factory in Galway.  I know that the Minister may say that the factory is a private enterprise and that he has nothing to do with the running of it or with the losses or gains that accrue.  At the same time, seeing that we in this House are assisting the kelp industry, and that the factory is set up as a result of the assistance given to the kelp industry, and that certain pressure has been brought to bear on the people of Donegal and of the Arran Islands to sell their kelp to the Ministry and that that kelp is only being sold to this iodine factory, we should be given some information as to the manner in which the factory is being run, how many people are being employed in it, whether it is at present running at a loss, or whether it is likely to last.  I hope the Minister will let us know exactly what is the loss on the kelp, as apart from the rural industries, and that he will also tell me whether the unemployment grant is being used for that purpose, and he might give us some information about the factory.</P>
    <P>I have very grave complaints to make as to the administration of the Department and the spending of this money on the kelp business.  I have very serious complaints to make against the Minister, who is, in fact, the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  He is supposed on all occasions to assist the Irish speakers and to see that the Gaelicising of the areas around the Gaeltacht is carried on and that no harm is done to the language in the fíor-Gaeltacht.  I think that the Minister has shown considerable neglect in the administration of this money.  I have always had occasion to complain about the administration of this Department. I know that the Minister cannot keep in touch with everything, and I know that perhaps some of his officials may be to blame, but I think that the Minister should take a more <Col N="662" /> serious interest in the administration of his Department in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I have to complain that in my district, in the island of Gorumna, which is, I suppose, the most Irish-speaking district in Connemara, that there was a man appointed as paymaster of all those kelp gangs, and that to my knowledge he has not a single word of Irish. I can safely say he is the only man on that island who does not know Irish, and his duty in paying those gangs and in seeing that the gangers appointed are doing their work must be done through an interpreter.  I think that the Minister has neglected his duty in seeing that in a place like Gorumna such an appointment was made.  I think it is a wrong thing to appoint a shopkeeper to a position like this. When I spoke on that subject before he said I was always a fault-finder.  I said I knew the way the money was going to be spent, and this is the way the money is being spent in Gorumna Island.  He could surely have found a man besides the one single individual who does not happen to know Irish. He could surely have found an individual other than a shopkeeper, because what must happen in this case, especially with the people on that island who are living on the verge of starvation?  They have to go to these people to get work, and the wages earned by these gangs are often spent before the work is actually done.  Does not the Minister know that when you appoint a shopkeeper or a man of that type, who is more or less a gombeen man, over people who are on the starvation level, that you are bound to have unsatisfactory work done, that you are bound to have people coming to that man asking for tea, sugar, bread, or the other necessities of life, and getting it on tick on the understanding that they will be employed? Their wages will, in fact, be paid in kind.  Does he not also know that these people are bound&mdash;it is human nature&mdash;to charge perhaps a little extra; and does he not know that there are other shopkeepers on the island who are trying to earn a living also, and who are at the disadvantage when working against that sort of thing?</P>
    <P>There is no differentiation either in <Col N="663" /> this estimate as to the loss in the kelp and the loss in the carrigeen industry. I have the same complaint to make about his administration of the carrigeen industry.  The Minister will perhaps say, as he said before, that it is hard to please me, that I am always finding fault with the administration of the service.  I think that the Minister should make some attempt to reply to this.  I put it to him that it is not a laughing matter at all.  I think the Minister should send down unbiassed officials to see that the administration of this money is being done in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>In the carrigeen industry the position is that we do not know who is working on the schemes and who is not.  The whole thing is a mystery. It is not a mystery to the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who go around with them.  That sort of thing is being done and the money is being spent in Connemara for the advancement of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. Even the Cumann na nGaedheal supporters in Connemara say it.  They have said it to myself.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the carrigeen moss industry, I know a man who is a publican, who has land and who is very well off.  His son recently got a very good job worth about £300 a year. That man is employed in the carrigeen moss industry, and so is his family. When an assistant was required in the carrigeen store a lady was brought from the Midlands to an area where there is nothing but Irish spoken.  She does not know any Irish.  She does not understand what the people are saying, and they do not understand what she is saying to them.  The Minister allowed that sort of thing to go on.  I am only referring to one particular corner of Connemara, but the same thing applies all round.  It may apply also in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Then an advertisement was inserted for instructors to teach the people how to make kelp.  One man was to be appointed in Galway.  The applicants were supposed to attend for an interview either in Dublin or Galway.  I was speaking to two or three persons who were looking for the position. They were native Irish speakers and <Col N="664" /> were educated young men, and had a good knowledge of the industry.  They told me that the man who was appointed did not turn up in Galway to be interviewed.  He may have gone to Dublin to be interviewed.  If so, he was probably the only man from Galway who went to Dublin to be interviewed. If they had two sets of officials to interview people for a certain position when there is no examination in question, how could they come to a proper decision as to who was the best man to appoint?  They could not do it.  Apparently it was a farce bringing these people to Galway for an interview, because the position was already given away.  I have made very particular inquiries lately, and I find that the person appointed never made kelp in his life, but his services to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were so great that he could not be let down.  That is the way this money is being expended in Connemara.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to get his higher officials to look into the matter.  They may know all about it, but may not be able to stand up against local opposition. After all, we expect something more than that from the Minister.  As to the Gaeltacht housing scheme, I have very little to say.  I spoke on the adjournment last night, and the Minister gave us some information.  I visited an island three or four miles from the mainland last Sunday and I saw a new house there.  There are only four houses there altogether.  The man who was building the house told me that an inspector came round and said the house was a bit too small and that if he added a porch to it he would get the full grant.  Some weeks later another came round and told him he would have to add another room to it or knock it down.  The Minister should let people know exactly what is required in order to obtain the full grant.  There appears to be some mystery as to what is required.  There should be some definite rules made.  If these rules are in existence they have not been made public.  People who have undertaken work and got beyond the foundations often find themselves in a fix because one man tells them the house requires certain alterations <Col N="665" /> and another man that it requires other alterations.  There is a considerable amount of uneasiness over the matter, and in some cases the people do not think they will get any money.  They think that it is a question of putting them off.</P>
    <P>I admit that the Minister is doing a lot of work for the kelp industry.  I do not want to minimise his work, but I want to criticise the administration.  I think he will find, if he goes around the West, cases probably just as bad as the particular cases I have spoken of.  The Minister should not be satisfied with that form of administration. The Minister also should look into the question of the slips and piers which he is erecting to assist the kelp makers.  In one place where a slip is being built I was told that there was never any kelp and never would be any kelp made.  Some years ago there was some kelp made with black weed, but it was unacceptable.  This slip is being built there, where it will never be utilised by kelp makers.  The whole thing at the back of it is that this work is being done in those areas where the Minister's Party expect to get the largest number of votes.  Instead of spending the money in a proper way, so that some return may be got for it, it is being spent solely to benefit certain areas which have been of good use to the Minister in the past, and which may require some little encouragement to be of some use in the future.</P>
    <P>If this grant were used in a proper manner I am sure the losses would not be so great.  There is one island particularly where the people were supporters of the Government Party.  I find that a considerable amount of kelp from that island has been sold to another company.  The price offered by the Minister's Department for kelp from Aran was considerably increased when the kelp was sold to a private company.  I have been told that these people in Aran who are getting a better price for the kelp from the company than they could get from the Minister's Department were not being employed in the collection of sea rods. I hear, however, that that order has been rescinded.  It was in force in Donegal and in Aran.  I have not been <Col N="666" /> in Aran since, but have had several letters from people there stating that they could not get work from the Department in the collection of sea rods because last year they refused to send their kelp to the Minister's Department and sold it to a private competing firm.  I do not think that it would be a very good thing to eliminate all these buyers, if that is to be the policy.  The Minister says it is not the policy.  It would look as if it were the policy to eliminate competition so that nobody would be left to purchase kelp except the Minister's Department.  I would not be in favour of that, because there is nothing like a little competition.  If these people succeed, as I have heard they did in Donegal, in raising the price offered by the Minister's Department, it would be a very good thing as far as we are concerned.  I hope the Minister will let us know exactly what is the deficit under Sub-head I.  How much was due to losses on carrigeen, kelp and rural industries?  I am rather anxious to know the total loss. I hope the Minister will let us know also about the factory.  I hope he will give us an assurance that this money will be spent in the proper manner and that the administration will be carefully looked into, that it will not be said, as it is said at present, that it is a one-sided affair and an agreement, and that those people I mentioned there and who do not know Irish should be replaced and that it should not be considered that nobody is to be allowed to earn anything under this grant except a supporter of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister why it is that nothing has been done for the kelp industry in Achill and Ballycroy during the past twelve months.  On a former occasion I mentioned that in West Mayo, especially in Achill, Ballycroy and Erris, the kelp industry was an oldestablished industry.  Recently kelp has not been made for various reasons. I am particularly anxious that the Minister would see that his officials should visit those districts and see the kelp industry established again under the new scheme.  But up to the present nothing has been done in the matter.   <Col N="667" /> In the Ballycroy district particularly huge quantities of sea rods are washed in by the tide, and it is therefore a very suitable district for the development of the kelp business.  It is surprising to find that the Minister has done nothing for the poor people in this particular district where the industry could be put on a secure basis, as the raw material is found there ready to hand.  I do not think that there would be any particular difficulty in having the kelp industry re-established there.</P>
      <P>So far as Deputy Tubridy's reference to securing instructors with a knowledge of the Irish language is concerned, I think the Minister should pay special attention to securing that instructors would be got in those localities where a knowledge of the industry is already at hand and where people know something about it.  It would be very easy for the Minister to secure that young men and women would be able to get the necessary advancement in technical knowledge in order to make them proficient in assisting in the establishment of that industry.  This I consider is very important, because sending down to districts like Achill, Ballycroy and Erris instructors who know nothing about the Irish language is in itself a very serious set-back to the language movement in the West, and is a thing that should not occur.  I know there are numbers of clever young men and women very capable of receiving any knowledge that may be imparted to them in the respect I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to rural industries, and the woollen industry in particular, I referred some months ago in the House to the industry around the Newport district.  I know the flannel producers of the Newport district make a famous cloth for which they receive from 7/- to 8/- a yard.  I requested the Minister on a former occasion to see what could be done for that industry in the Newport district, but, so far as I know, nothing has been done for the woollen industry there.  I know he could get hundreds of workers if he were willing to come to terms with them.  They would be only too glad, <Col N="668" /> and only too anxious, to assist in the development of the industry locally. The Newport woollens are famous for their beauty and good quality.  It is very seldom that you hear of homespuns getting a price of 7/- or 8/- per yard, but that is a usual occurrence, I know, in my district.</P>
    <P>We have the Housing Act in operation in the Gaeltacht for the past fourteen months.  I find that in my constituency in the west of the county practically nothing has been done for the building of houses.  From the figures given by the Minister of the housing operations, we find that out of 11,500 applications put before him only one-eighth of that number has been inspected, and the very small amount of one-thirtieth of the total amount has been sanctioned.  Those who have applied have been induced or encouraged to go on with building, but only one-thirtieth, or, in other words, 369, according to the Minister's statement, new houses have been sanctioned. That, in my opinion, goes to show that this particular branch of his Department is not being pushed as it ought to.  We believe much more could be done in the building of houses if only it was gone about in the right way.  I am sure the Minister could acquire the assistance of many more engineers if he felt it necessary to do so.  I do not think that the excuses he has given are at all to the point, because there is no question of obtaining capable engineers when he requires them.  I know several that would be only too glad to secure a job from the Department if they could get it.  So far they have not got it.  We find also that only a little over £2,000 has been paid to those who have been encouraged to go on with building.  £2,000 only has been paid out of the total amount voted in such a hurry last December twelve months for building houses in the Gaeltacht districts, and that is a very small amount to be paid out in the space of 14 months.  Surely the Minister could do much more to speed up these matters in order that people would secure the necessary housing and to enable them to live under more healthy conditions than hitherto?</P>

      <P>With regard to the Estimate itself, the question which Deputy <Col N="672" /> Derrig raised, asking whether that £27,725 and the savings from other sub-heads comes under the Appropriations-in-Aid, there was last year an estimate of £73,695.  I want to say that the estimated savings are on kelp and the rural industries.  There was voted in the House for kelp and rural industries £44,410, and out of this sum there was spent £22,270.  That accounts for a saving of £22,140 under those heads. In the matter of the rural industries, there was voted for kelp £5,000.  Of this, £3,000 was spent, leaving an unexpended sum of £2,000.  For materials, there were voted £12,000.  Under this head there was spent £10,000, and this left a saving of £2,000.  On these three items together there was a total saving of £26,140.  Other smaller savings under various sub-heads came to about £1,500, making a total saving of £27,640.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, £4,000 is the sum which it is estimated that the kelp schemes of last year will cost.  In fact, there will be a loss, if you like, of £4,000, less £1,200 worth of kelp that we have on hands.  The receipts from this when sold will come into the next financial year.  I should say, in fairness to the scheme, that from this there should be also deducted a sum of £1,700 which was spent in capital expenditure, like, for instance, the purchase of £25,000 bags, weighing-machines, and so on. The loss, therefore, on the scheme is comparatively little, considering what has been achieved as a result of that expenditure.  Deputy Tubridy was chiefly concerned about the expenditure of this money.  His suggestion is that the money was being deliberately spent by my Department for political purposes.</P>

      <P>Very well.  We will see. An advertisement was published seeking for six Irish-speaking instructors for the kelp industry.  Officials of the Department were appointed to interview the applicants.  There were 70 applicants, and these came from <Col N="673" /> various parts of the country, from Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, and, I think, from West Cork. Whether or not the same inspector interviewed all the candidates is, to my mind, a matter of no importance, because surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that they should have an agreement as to the standard they would set in making their selections. I do not know who the six were who were selected, but there were six names sent to me.  I certainly did not know a single individual amongst them.  The officials who made the selection&mdash;civil servants&mdash;had absolutely no political affiliations, and it is an entirely wrong suggestion for a Deputy here to make a statement in the House that these civil servants were guided by any political bias.  It was not so.  Personally I was asked to interest myself on behalf of several applicants from my own constituency. There was not one Kerryman appointed to these posts.  I did not interfere on behalf of any candidate.  I accepted the first six on the list that was sent in to me.  As to the persons about whom Deputy Tubridy was speaking who were interviewed in Galway, I believe there were two from Galway.  One of these was from the Aran Islands.  The man from Galway was, I am informed, a man named Keaney, and he was interviewed in Galway.  The man from the Aran Islands was unable to attend at Galway at the same time that the other candidates were interviewed owing to the fact that his boat was late, but he was interviewed afterwards at Galway.</P>

      <P>These are the facts.  It was because the boat on which this man came to Galway was late that he was not interviewed at the same time as the others.  The quantity of kelp sold to the factory at Galway was 1,578 tons.  In addition, 650 tons were sold to the French firm of Messrs. Devineau, a firm with whom the people there had dealings before.  I do not know to whom Deputy Tubridy was referring when he referred to the English-speaking agents in certain <Col N="674" /> places.  It is not at all a bad sign that amongst all the people taken on to administer the scheme there was a complaint only about one on the score of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. Tubridy Dr. Tubridy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to whom the Deputy is referring, but I do presume there was some good reason brought forward to the Department for making that appointment.  Deputy Kilroy was beating at an open door when he talked about sending down instructors to Ballycroy without a knowledge of Irish.  It was an essential qualification that the instructors should have a good knowledge of Irish and be able to speak it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister, with reference to the statement made by Deputy Tubridy, that there was nothing done in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that the instructors appointed had to have a working knowledge of the Irish language, and they must be capable of conducting all the business in Irish. They were selected to give their instruction in the Irish language only. They had to have a sufficient knowledge to carry out the instruction in Irish.  As far as Achill is concerned, I may say that several visits have been paid to Achill with a view to developing the kelp industry there, but there has been no great disposition on the part of the people there to take up the industry again.  One of the instructors appointed will give special attention to that area.  I might say that the very same complaint can be made with regard to Kerry.  For a number of years there has been practically no kelp industry in Kerry. There was a little effort made in the Maharees.  During the coming season special attention will be given to this place.  It is well to remember that the instructors have been appointed only a month and they are at present getting certain laboratory training in Dublin which will give them qualifications beyond what they would have had in <Col N="675" /> their ordinary experience in the past burning kelp.  The amount of money involved, as far as kelp is concerned, was £4,000, and you might deduct £1,200 worth of kelp on hands in various outlying places, and also the £1,700 invested as capital expenditure. The amount involved in the case of carrigeen was £300.  We believe that the receipts from the carrigeen in hands will recoup us that £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Gaeltacht housing, it was not, in fact, mentioned in the Estimate, but it has been mentioned and it was discussed quite a lot. I suggest the Deputies who mentioned it might have remained in the House when Deputy O'Connell raised the matter on the adjournment last night. I explained then what the position was.  I said that during the earlier months after the passing of the Act there was, possibly, undue slowness. In spite of what Deputy Kilroy says, it was not at all so easy to get suitable engineers for this job.  We had to get engineers who possessed a knowledge of Irish and who were able to conduct their business in Irish, because portion of their job as inspectors&mdash;so they are called&mdash;is to vet houses and be able to say whether or not Irish is the ordinary, spoken language of the household.  That is one of the necessary conditions under which these loans or grants are being made.  One Board that was set up by the Civil Service Commissioners for the purpose of selecting six such inspectors was able to find only two who had the necessary technical qualifications as well as the necessary qualification in Irish.  We now have, however, a staff sufficient to deal with the work, and whereas only 98 cases were reported on by the end of August there were something like 150 reported on in September, 135 to 140 in October, 200 in November, 460 in December, and 430 odd in January.  These are the figures up to 31st January.  We believe that from now on, with the staff of inspectors we have, we will be in a position to have reports on about 400 or 500 per month.  That pace will be quite fast enough to enable us to have spent the money in the time originally set out.  There will be a falling off in <Col N="676" /> the number of reports for a few months in the summer.  From May, June, July and August the inspectors will be switched off for the purpose of inspecting houses under construction in order to report on them for the purpose of issuing grants and loans.  I mentioned last night that sufficient cases will have been reported on by summer and sanction will have been given in sufficient cases by that time for as many houses as there will be handymen in the Gaeltacht available to construct.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that one of these instructors is going to be allocated to Mayo in a district where there are hopes of reviving the industry.  With regard to the woollen industry, I mentioned in my opening statement that a weaving centre is being established in Tourmakeady. I do not know how far or how <Col N="677" /> near that is to Newport, as my geography is not very good in regard to that area.  One centre is being opened shortly in County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the position is in regard to the iodine factory.  Have they taken over any quantity of this kelp?  How is the factory being run, if it is in existence yet?  Is it being run as a State institution, or to what extent is private enterprise responsible for it? What we do not understand about the loss of this £4,000 is this, namely, the Minister stated here very categorically on the Supplementary Estimate that Deputy McDonagh and an English company with which he was associated had made themselves responsible for the marketing of the kelp.  We took it as an absolute guarantee that there could not be a loss on the kelp, but it appears now that the State at any rate is to lose £4,000.  I would like to know how much the McDonagh combine has lost&mdash;probably not so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I, surely, never made a statement to the effect that Deputy McDonagh and the English Chemical Company were to be responsible for the marketing of the kelp.  I said they were establishing the factory as a private enterprise.  They have done so, and have conducted it entirely as a private enterprise.  I mentioned that 1,578 tons of kelp which we sold to them were sold by us as agents of the kelp-gatherers.  I would like to stress again the fact that we are not buyers of kelp, but merely acting as agents of the kelp-gatherers.  Any person who signs merely signs a membership form of entrance into an organisation of co-operative kelp-gatherers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say off-hand, but I would point out that, in order that the factory would be economically worked, it would have to deal with a minimum of 1,000 tons.  The maximum you would have in Fanad would be between 500 and 600 tons.  Perhaps with the Burtonport area thrown in you might bring the amount to 1,000 tons, which would make the proposition economic.  If it is any consolation to the Deputy, I may say that my own view is that the industry will not be on a satisfactory basis until there is a small subsidiary factory in Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for <Col N="680" /> the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate, as circulated, gives an indication of the purpose for which this money is required, namely, &ldquo;Legal costs and liquidation expenses in connection with guarantees under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924 to 1930.&rdquo; This, in fact, only refers to part of the legal expenses which are losses sustained in connection with trade loan guarantees, and with a particular trade loan guarantee.  The whole question of guarantees that had to be made by the State and of all expenses, other than this item, will fall for consideration later, as under a particular section of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act the Oireachtas has to have before it, within a month after the close of the financial year in which a loss has been sustained, a statement in regard to the guarantees.  The present financial year will be the first in which such a statement will have to be laid before the House.  It will have to be laid in April next.  The main matters remain over until that statement is before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is to meet a bill of a firm of solicitors who were acting for the plaintiffs in an action in which an injunction was sought to restrain the Receiver on behalf of the Government from selling certain assets claimed by the company as theirs.  Acting on legal advice, we decided to fight the case. We fought it and lost.  The solicitor for the plaintiffs is pressing for his costs, and they cannot be met out of the ordinary guarantee money; at least it is thought more desirable to meet them out of a Vote such as this.  The expenses on the Receiver's side will form the subject of another Vote in the financial year in which they have to be met.  As I say, this Estimate is to meet a pressing claim of plaintiffs' solicitor in the action to which I have referred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The action arose in connection with the loan guarantee to the Wicklow Ochre and Mineral Grinding Company.  It arose because, as I said, there were certain assets claimed by us as ours in order to meet losses incurred in connection with the company. We had put a Receiver in there to wind up the company.  We tried to sell the whole concern as a going concern, but failed to receive any offers. We then proceeded to sell on the basis of a break-up.  The plaintiffs in the case said that these assets were theirs, and they applied for an injunction to restrain us from selling them.  We defended the action, but lost.  This Vote is to meet the costs of the plaintiffs' solicitor in that action.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister agree to postpone consideration of the Estimate?  Until this moment I had no idea of the facts or of what the Vote related to at all. Personally I was under the impression that it related to an entirely different matter.  One would like to have an opportunity of looking up newspaper files for some report of that action, and of looking up the information available concerning the Trade Loan Guarantee itself before deciding whether it should be allowed to pass without opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What purpose would be served by the Deputy reading up legal reports?  The facts are that the case was fought.  If the Deputy wants to know why the case was fought, it was fought on the best legal advice obtainable.  The responsibility is mine for fighting it.  The action was entered into, the decision was against us, and costs were given against us. These costs have got to be met.  What reading of files will get over that responsibility? If the matter of the Trade Loan itself is in question and if any Deputy wants to investigate the facts under which the guarantee was given, he can do so when the statement comes before the House in the month of April next.  This Vote is connected with the solitary point of one part of the costs, the costs of the solicitors for <Col N="682" /> the plaintiff.  The action was brought for an injunction to restrain us from selling certain assets which the court held were not ours.</P>

This is the first financial year in which losses have been sustained.  Therefore, according to the Act, I must bring forward a statement with regard to this matter within a month after the close of the financial year.  This statement to which I am referring will come before the House in the month of April.

    <P>As Deputies are aware, the biggest item, £1,630 odd, really represents a book-keeping transaction&mdash;the amount paid to the revenue on account of public departments.  With regard to the sum of £279 2s. 5d., the position was that Mr. Barrington was in Geneva on Saorstát business when he became ill and died.  The medical and nursing expenses, and the expense of transferring the remains to Dublin, were borne by the Exchequer.  The recoupment to the unemployment insurance fund of benefit received arose in this way.  An insured person was prosecuted for obtaining by misrepresentation certain benefits to which he was not entitled, amounting to £5 8s. 4d. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the imprisonment not to take effect if the amount were repaid.  It was paid to the District Court clerk, who, by a mistake, treated it as a fine and transferred the money to the District Court clerk's fund.  That account had been wound up and the money found its way to the Exchequer.  The only way in which the money could be made good to the unemployment insurance fund was by paying it out of the contingency fund.  It was necessary to do that, because otherwise the person who had been ordered to pay this would not be entitled to benefit until the money was repaid to the unemployment insurance fund.  In connection with the item of £1 14s. 6d., certain processes in connection with sugar beet were assigned to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He thought it wise to accept the assignment, and the amount shown here is in connection with the stamp duty. The final sum deals with the case of a juror who, after trial, was subject to a good deal of persecution and annoyance. He suffered substantially in his business as a result of that persecution.</P>

I was not hard to find, and when I got word I came to the House immediately. As far as this Bill is concerned the House will recollect that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad was set up some time ago and brought in a report.  The terms of the report recommend that the age of certain Circuit Court Judges for retirement should be raised to 75.  We considered that question and came to the conclusion that it would not be wise or politic to increase the age of certain judges to as high as 75; that it would be wiser to increase the age merely to 72, which is the same retiring age as that fixed for High Court Judges.  Accordingly this Bill purports to raise the retirement age of Judges of the Circuit Court to 72.  The raising of the age to 72 leads to a rather curious situation. A judge might now retire at the age of 70, as in fact one Circuit Judge has done within the last few weeks, and become eligible for reappointment under this Bill, or under any other statute which would give effect to the recommendations of the Joint Committee.  It would appear rather unfair to a judge retiring under these circumstances that he should not have the same advantages in law as he would have had if his age limit had been reached a very few months after it actually was reached.  That is to say, if his age limit had been reached at the period at which the whole general Bill dealing with the recommendations of the Committee&mdash;very important and far-reaching recommendations&mdash;were being given effect to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So accordingly we are dealing with this particular matter, the raising of the age of certain judges, as a peculiar item.  The other large general question, which really means the reforming of a great deal of our present judicial <Col N="693" /> system, will, of course, be a very large and comprehensive measure, and will take of necessity, in the present state of the programme, some little time to prepare.  The age of retirement is dealt with in Section 2 of the Bill.  In Section 3 of the Bill the question naturally arises, and must be dealt with, as to how the pension of a judge who retires and is reappointed should be dealt with.  We propose to deal with it in this fashion, that the whole period when he was a judge of first appointment or a judge of second appointment should be taken into consideration for his pension, and that any period of interregnum, if I may use that phrase, will not be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Christmas is some months now, and I think that Bill is very much due, which will deal not merely with the question of a few of the judges, but will deal with the whole matter.  I have a suspicion that one of the reasons for the delay is not the Department of Justice, but the Department of Finance, and that we are going to have trouble with the Department of Finance in order to get a proper legal system working in the country.  Be that as it may, I want to comment now upon unnecessary delay in this matter and to remind the Minister that the Circuit Court Rules cannot possibly come into force or be passed by this House until we have disposed of a complete Courts of Justice Amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> As to the question of continuing judges, the attitude of the Committee in the matter was, generally speaking, that judges are very often better by mature experience, and that we have a great many of very distinguished cases where judges who were pretty old made better judges the older they got, and on those grounds we do not see there can be any objection to the passing of this particular Bill, which is really only a small matter, and to the question of pensions.  The principle upon which pensions are awarded to judges on, perhaps, a slightly more generous scale than in the ordinary courts is because otherwise they may be open to corruption, and so that, coming towards the term of their office judges would be as unbiassed as they ought to be.  In those circumstances we have no objection to this Bill except for what it does not contain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. Jasper Wolfe Mr. Jasper Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jasper Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse what Deputy Little has said.  So far as he and I are concerned we are parties to a joint report which has recommended that the existing ages of High Court judges should be raised from 72 to 75, the existing ages of Circuit Court judges be raised from 70 to 75, and the existing age limit of the District Justices from 65 to 67.  In voting for this Bill I wish it recognised that I stand, as Deputy Little stands, on the report that after twelve months we have compiled, and which has been approved unanimously by every section of this House and by every section of the Seanad.  It is a unanimous report on this particular point.  It may not have gone as far as Deputy Little and the Party he represents would like, nor as far as the views I hold, but we have agreed to these views and I am going to stand over the agreement and stand for the findings of the Committee on that as well as on every other point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Little has referred to the inconvenience caused by the delay in introducing the Circuit Court Rules, and he has pointed out a fact to which I think there can be no answer: that you cannot have those rules until you have legislation.  To bring in a series of rules now, patchwork or otherwise, and another series of rules in a few <Col N="695" /> months would be, as Deputy Ruttledge, Deputy Little and myself pointed out to this House, an utter waste of time and energy, and a very considerable expense, so that I do hope that the Minister for Justice will see his way, at as early a stage as possible, to introduce a Bill founded on the recommendations of the Committee, to amend the existing Courts of Justice Act in points in which it has become absolutely essential for the administration of justice in this country that they should be amended. With regard to the Bill, I am sure I speak for every representative when I say that it meets with their entire and unanimous approval.  I appeal to the Minister for Justice to put it through as quickly as possible, because the Circuit Court in Cork is hung up, and must remain hung up until it is passed. It should be put through the remaining stages without further delay and it will meet with everybody's wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may express a layman's opinion and not differ at all from the attitude Deputy Little has taken up with regard to this Bill, I should like to enter a protest against accepting generally the principle that as a judge gets older he gets better. There was a feeling of disappointment amongst connoisseurs who had bought brandy of 100 years old because of the fact that it had not improved in quality.  It had, in fact, attained to its zenith some years before, and then deteriorated.  In view of the fact that this is only a temporary measure to meet a temporary situation, and that the whole thing will be reconsidered when the Court of Justice Act comes before the Dáil, our attitude is the same as that of the lawyers, and we are not prepared to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am half way as between Deputy Little and Deputy MacEntee.  I would hardly go as far as Deputy Little and say that judges improve as they keep growing older, but certainly some judges, as we know in our experience, have been very fine judges indeed and have shown no signs of deterioration up to a great age.  On the other hand, <Col N="696" /> you find other judges who have deteriorated much more rapidly, and we have unfortunate examples of judges, long past their time, asleep on the bench when they ought to be hearing cases.  If you look at any particular individual you might say: &ldquo;Oh, he is good to 80,&rdquo; and draw the conclusion that because he is good to 80 everybody is good to 80.  That would be a very erroneous conclusion indeed.  What we would really have to decide is the age limit at which you could really put the weakest link of the chain, because all litigants are entitled to have competent judges on the bench to hear their cases, and you should not take as examples men who have carried their faculties unimpaired to a great age. You should rather consider the possibility of a man being on the bench whose faculties will go before the age of 75.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Rules of Court, I must say that twice there were brave efforts made to introduce Rules of Court into this House for the Circuit Court, and the Rules Committee certainly did their best.  They spend a great deal of time in preparing a set of rules.  They were turned down.  They were given suggestions as to what way they should work. They brought in another set of rules, and that also was turned down.  There has been, therefore, no defect at all in anything that has been done by the Rules-making Committee.  Any delay that there is cannot be attributed, I think, in common fairness, to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the general question, that printed report came to me roughly about Christmas.  That is the first time that I saw the report, the first time that I had any knowledge of the contents of the report.  This is, as I say, going to be a big measure.  It is a measure that must be very carefully drafted.  It is a measure that will take time; it is not a measure which can be rushed.  The Joint Committee, I think very wisely, did not rush the measure.  I think that the drafting of the measure and the full consideration of it should not be rushed.  I do not think that there should be any great delay, but to introduce a measure, say, at the end of six weeks, which is roughly the time since I got that report, <Col N="697" /> to expect to have a measure drafted and fit for introduction in that extraordinarily short period, is, I think, a piece of optimism on the part of Deputy Little that I think expressed a little bit more than he really felt.</P>

There are a whole lot of things of that nature which must be fully considered and which cannot be rushed.  I am as anxious as the Deputy is, or as Deputy Wolfe is, that this matter should be brought in within as short a space of time as it can really effectively be brought in.</P>

During the period of the negotiations for the German Trade Treaty the present German Minister pointed out that there were certain portions of the old code, known technically as the <Col N="698" /> Trading of the Enemy Code, which, though not operating here against nationals of his country, were still upon the Statute Book, and he asked and received from me an assurance that somewhere about the time of the making of the German Treaty I would bring forward legislation to remove certain sections and certain Acts which he pointed out to me.  Two are mentioned.  One is the prohibition of what was then described as enemy countries indulging in banking operations, and the other thing had relation to enemy nationals having posts upon ships.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, a very large and comprehensive measure dealing with licensing laws in this country became law in the year 1927. That Act largely carried out the recommendations of the Commission which had been set up to inquire into the working of the licensing laws of this country, the Intoxicating Liquor Commission of 1925.  It always happens when a measure as large and as important as the Licensing Act of 1927 becomes law and embodies a considerable number of new provisions there is doubt as to whether those provisions were good or bad, salutary or harmful to the general community. Four questions appear to have come in for a considerable amount of criticism and we considered that the wisest thing to do was to refer these matters to the same Commission as had already reported on the Licensing Laws. Accordingly, the Liquor Commission was reconstituted in the year 1929, and four questions were placed before it for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the new principles introduced into the licensing code by the Licensing <Col N="700" /> Act of 1927 was what is known as the split hour.  I need not define what the split hour means.  Another question was whether the power given to a District Justice to give area exemption orders outside the municipal boroughs should be extended so as to take in the four cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Another question was whether the law relating to St. Patrick's Day was or was not in a satisfactory condition.  The fourth question was a comparatively minor one, as to whether when a person holding a licence for a premises built a better premises, not merely adjoining but somewhere within the neighbourhood, he should be allowed to transfer his licence from the inferior old premises to the superior new premises. These were the four questions which were left to the Commission, and upon these four questions the Commission duly reported.  In this Bill we propose to carry out completely the recommendations of the Commission.  Where they have decided in favour of a certain proposal we suggest to the House that that proposal should be carried out.  Where they have negatived a proposal we suggest to the House that the proposal should be negatived.</P>
    <P>First of all, there was the question as to whether the split hour should or should not be retained.  On that matter the Commission reported:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After careful consideration, we are fully satisfied that no case has been made for the abolition of the closing period between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. in the afternoons on weekdays in county boroughs.  Although our sittings were open to the public, no one came forward save interested parties to complain of any inconvenience being caused thereby, and we are satisfied that the object for which we made our original recommendation when the Commission sat in 1925, namely, the prevention of excessive drinking by persons who remain in publichouses for long periods, has been substantially obtained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They also stated that the present hours are correct, but they made two recommendations of some minor importance. <Col N="701" /> One of them is that though licensed premises should not be open for the sale of intoxicating liquor during those hours, yet provision can be made by which licensed premises may be used for the purpose of delivering or removing goods during these hours, and they say that no objection could be reasonably raised to such a procedure.  In this Bill we propose, therefore, by Section 4 that between the hours of 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. licensed premises may be kept open for the purpose of dispatching goods from or receiving goods at such premises.  Of course, it must be an advantage to a licensed trader that during that hour he will be able to get in his supplies from the wholesalers who supply him, and send out his empty casks or bottles or anything else that he wants to return.  He would be able to keep his staff more regularly employed, and he would be able to carry on that work of receiving goods during the split hour.</P>
    <P>The other recommendation is this: As Deputies know, at present in hotels drink cannot be served with a meal between the hours of 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. If a person orders his meal before 2.30 and orders a drink with it he can consume the drink between the hours of 2.30 and 3.30, provided the meal is a substantial one and is taken in the place where meals are usually served. The Commission say that they see no harm, not only in allowing a person to consume a drink with his meal which he had ordered before 2.30, but if he is taking a substantial meal between 2.30 and 3.30 in allowing him to order a drink, provided he consumes it with the meal.  Of course a person resident in a hotel can get a drink at any time, as the split hour does not apply to him.  The Commission say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that although this inconvenience&rdquo; (that is the inconvenience of not being able to get a drink with meals between 2.30 and 3.30) &ldquo;is probably relatively slight, no real justification can be alleged for interfering with the normal and not abnormal use of intoxicating liquor, and that if hotels and restaurants are permitted to serve drink during this period, with bona-fide meals, no abuse is likely to occur.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> As the House knows, the same provision as to special hours applies to clubs, except that the hours are to be between 3 and 5.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, for the same reason, we propose that drink could be served with meals between 3 and 5.  I fancy that is a provision of practically nominal value, because I do not suppose many people, except an odd traveller, lunches between the hours of 3 and 5 in any club, but, however, for the purpose of symmetry, so to speak, for the purpose of keeping everything fair and square between the various members of the community, we adhere to the split hours modified to that extent if drink is served in the place where meals are regularly served, and consumed with the meals.  These are comparatively unimportant matters in comparison with the big principle of the split hours, and the principle of the split hours practically in its entirety is left unaltered by our proposed legislation in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The next question left to the Commission was whether provision should be made for area exemption orders in county boroughs.  That was a question which obviously had to be inquired into because, as the House is aware, last year we had to pass two special statutes dealing with special cases which arose where area exemption orders could not be granted, and there would not be adequate provision for persons visiting Dublin in the one case, and Cork in the other, on these special occasions.  However, the Commission have recommended on that that an alteration of the law should not be made.  There is, therefore, no provision dealing with that matter in this Bill at all, and I need not go into the merits or demerits or discuss it any further.</P>
    <P>The next question with which they deal is as to whether the provisions as to the law dealing with the sale of intoxicating drink on St. Patrick's Day were or were not correct.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We see no reason to alter the recommendations which we made in 1925, that St. Patrick's Day should be regulated by the same conditions as apply to Sundays.  We are confirmed <Col N="703" /> in this view by Mr. Cussen's evidence, and we quite agree with his opinion that the enforcement of total closing on St. Patrick's Day is a reflection on our national character as regards sobriety which is no longer justified by the habits of our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Cussen further pointed out that when one year St. Patrick's Day fell on a Sunday, Monday, 18th March, was a public holiday.  His court sat on Tuesday, and he stated that they had not more cases of drunkenness than they would have on any day after any other bank holiday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister read down to the end of that declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He also directed the attention of the Commission to the fact that this year, as St. Patrick's Day fell on a Sunday, Monday, 18th March, was a public holiday, and in spite of this fact the work in the courts on Tuesday, the 19th March, did not show any greater number of cases of drunkenness than on the morning after any other bank holiday, although on the 18th March the licensed houses were opened as on ordinary week days.  He told us that the number of cases arising on the 18th March was not above the average for any other Monday.  We also quite agree with his view that the conditions of opening on every bank holiday other than Good Friday and Christmas Day should be regulated by the same conditions as apply to Sundays.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Accordingly, St. Patrick's Day is by this Bill brought in on the same footing with Sunday, and the law is made practically the same as for a Sunday.</P>
      <P>Now, as far as the non-county boroughs are concerned, there is one matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  It is Section 15, sub-section (1) (b), which states as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The holder of an on licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Act of 1927.  It is a very small point:</P>
      <P>The holder of an on-licence in respect of premises not situate in a county borough from selling intoxicating liquor for consumption on such licensed premises to bona fide travellers.</P>
      <P>And then the time is set out:</P>
      <P>If his licence is not a six-day licence, on any Sunday during the period of summer-time between the hours of one o'clock and eight o'clock in the afternoon, or, on any other Sunday between the hours of one o'clock and seven o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Day is not a Sunday in summer-time or in any other time, and it is simply a question whether the hours should be from one to seven or from one to eight.  In the draft of the Bill we have put in from one to eight, but the House may possibly consider that it should be from one to seven. Sunday there is, so to speak, an indefinite word, and in translating the report of the Commission into this Bill, if it should become an Act, the House will decide whether the hours should be from one to seven or one to eight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which was referred to the Commission was the question of transferring a licence from one place to another.  The Commission reported that if the licence to be transferred was in the same licensing area, and if the licensing area was a rural area, the licence could be transferred, and accordingly we propose by this Bill to make it possible for the Circuit Court Judge to make an order transferring the licence from an inferior to a superior premises, so to speak, except they are in a county or other borough or urban district or town&mdash;that is, under Section 11 (c)&mdash;town there will have the same meaning as a town in the Act of 1927, and in the Act of 1927 it is defined as a town in the meaning of the Towns Improvement Act, having Commissioners under the Towns Improvement Ireland Act, 1854.  There are a couple of other minor matters as to which the Bill embodys some recommendations made by the Commission. <Col N="705" /> They also deal with the transfer of licences.  Where you have a seven-day licence and a six-day licence and there is to be a transposition, it can only be done at the general annual licensing sessions.  An application can under this Bill be made at any licensing sessions to the District Justice. They say that that is a reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <P>They say also that outside a county borough, if a person holds an on-licence and also holds, say, a wholesale dealer's licence&mdash;that is, under Section 12&mdash;that person, if both licences are in the same licensed area and outside a county borough, may apply at the annual licensing District Court held in such licensing area that in lieu of a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence there be granted to him in respect of the premises to which such wholesale dealer's licence is attached a certificate for a new spirit retailer's off-licence or a certificate for a new beer retailer's off-licence or certificates for both such licences.  That really means that while a person has got a wholesaler's licence and an ordinary publichouse licence he may, if he likes, extinguish his ordinary publichouse licence and get his spirit grocer's licence in respect of the premises in which he has a wholesale dealer's licence.  The object of it is that if the wholesalers find the minimum amount which they can supply is more than some customers wish to take, the Commission recommends that as this would mean the abolition of a full licence it would be very advisable that they should be permitted to do so.  But they do not advise it for towns, as they do not wish to have more spirit grocers' licences in towns.</P>
    <P>These are the principal points in the Bill, and I commend it to the House. I would only say, in conclusion, one thing&mdash;that we know that all matters connected with the licensing law are very controversial indeed.  We set up a Commission composed of well-known men.  They examined witnesses and they have taken a fair and unprejudiced view of the whole question, leaning neither too much to one side nor too much to the other and not paying overgreat attention to the cries that there <Col N="706" /> are too much restrictions on the liberty of the subject, and, on the other hand, not paying overmuch attention to the cry that there is not a sufficiently strict licensing code.  They have taken a fair line between these two, and I would suggest to the House that the wisest course for it to adopt is to take their fairly considered views and pass them into law.</P>

      <P>This Bill is as remarkable for its omissions as for its commissions or commitments, if you like to call them so.  When referring four matters to the Commission I am surprised that a fifth was not considered&mdash;that is the question of great interest to licensed traders, the endorsement of licences. In the old days jurisdiction was left to the justices to say whether, when the offence was merely technical, the licence was to be endorsed.  It seems to be an injustice that for three technical convictions three endorsements may follow, and then the licence is practically cancelled, or it cannot be renewed.  That is a matter that the Minister, when introducing his Bill, should have attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in this Bill sections designed to remedy injustices, sections to which nobody could object.  Section 2, giving in the case of the lapsed leases the same right to the off-licencee as to the on-licencee, is quite just, so as not to leave to the landlord the chance of <Col N="707" /> stealing the tenant's licence.  Generally there are objections raised to off-licences. Section 4 is also, as the Minister said, a reasonable and fair facility to give to the licensed traders. It is similarly the case with Section 5. No objection could be raised to Section 7.  I think, because the facilities afforded at these railway station buffets are very small, and certainly will not cater for one who sets out to get drunk.  Such a person will not have the time.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 9, I do not think any more facilities should be given to clubs than they have already, particularly in the case of non-residential clubs.  They are already in unfair competition with the licensed traders in many ways.  They have much less supervision, and are a greater temptation to drunkenness than an ordinary licensed house.  When granting licences to them many factors should be considered and a strict investigation held.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 11, which deals with the transfer of a licence to a more suitable premises in the neighbourhood, that also is a good section.  I think the Minister might have taken advantage of it in the Bill to allow one who has a licence to buy up one who has a wider licence perhaps, and then abolish that without any expense to the State.  Section 12 is also unobjectionable. Now we come to Section 6.  The Minister said that the Commission stated that there was very slight inconvenience caused by not allowing drink with meals in hotels and restaurants in what he calls the split hour. Why give an advantage to the hotels or restaurants that a licensed trader is not getting?  That strikes me as class legislation.</P>

      <P>If I understand it properly, the purpose of that order was to prevent men, not workingmen, but often students or business men, from making it an afternoon session in a bar or lounge when discussing business. It is not that they set out deliberately to do that, but a discussion <Col N="708" /> starts, and then the Irishman's habit of drinks all round, one man being as good as another, keeps them there all the evening.  What happens if you allow drink with meals in a restaurant? You start during the lunch hour with three or four at the table.  There is nothing to stop any one of them having a drink or two, and when the time of lunch is over they adjourn to the bar, which is then open, and you go back to the evils which you tried to remedy when you instituted that hour. I put it, therefore, that that is objectionable. It is similar with clubs as with hotels and restaurants.  They should not get further facilities.  The kernel of the Bill is in Sections 3 and 8.  The other sections are only the shell.  The Minister said that we should take the middle course recommended by the Commission.  I am afraid that all sections of the community were not represented on that Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember twenty years ago being engaged in a campaign to close licensed premises on St. Patrick's Day.  A national campaign closed them.  I do not see any solid reason now for going back and opening them on St. Patrick's Day.  I think doing so would be national retrogression.  I wonder where the demand for this has come? Is there any public pressure.  Who are so thirsty that they are calling out that the licensed trade should have the same facilities on St. Patrick's Day as on Sundays?  I have not heard of it except from interested parties.  I have heard of no complaints of the present system.  Nobody has spoken to me about its being a grievance except those directly interested in having the houses open on St. Patrick's Day.  It might be, of course, that opening on St. Patrick's Day, as on Sundays, would be but just getting in the thin end of the wedge, and having got thus far we might be asked in a year or two to have general openings on St. Patrick's Day, the national holiday. I do not want any reversion to scenes that I remember as a boy; I do not want any reversion to the time when I saw men, and sometimes women, but mostly men, drunk, sick and sore in the evening, saying: &ldquo;Oh, holy St. <Col N="709" /> Patrick, look at what I am suffering for you.&rdquo;  I do not want scenes of that sort again.</P>
    <P>Then let us look at the matter from the point of view of the assistants.  You have 1,000 or 1,200 men in Dublin, and they have very few days in the year free; they have Christmas Day, Good Friday, and St. Patrick's Day, and I think they should be left St. Patrick's Day free.  Apart from any consideration of them, I think it is not wise nor right nationally to pass this Bill, considering the present state of depression and considering such figures as were given to us to-day by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  What do these figures reveal as to the state of the City of Dublin? If you open the publichouses on St. Patrick's Day between 2 o'clock and 5 o'clock who will go there?  You will probably have a lot of visitors in the city in order to see matches in Croke Park, Dalymount, or other places. They are there practically for two hours, and they will not have much time to swallow a drink.  If they do swallow it hurriedly it will not do them much good.  They have their trains to catch, and they have not much time for the publichouse.  If the city people are anxious to visit the publichouse they will not have much time if they go to the matches.  If they do not attend the matches they might spend three hours in the publichouse and that would certainly be bad.</P>
    <P>Taking the conditions in the country, we hear it said that we should not deprive the poor man of his pint.  He has no right to have a drink except he is a bona fide traveller, and to be that he must expend more money on a bus. train, or something else in order to travel the necessary distance.  Can he afford to do so, and is money so plentiful at the present time that the countryman can afford to spend more on alcohol?  I do not think it is.  It is true we have changed somewhat and that there are counter attractions to the publichouse, such as sport, or motoring, or the cinemas.  Above all, the cost of drink has changed our habits considerably.  At the same time no further facilities should, on national grounds, be afforded for drinking on <Col N="710" /> St. Patrick's Day.  We are opposed to the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The records of the House will show that the members of this Party have never taken a bigoted attitude upon any proposals affecting the sale of intoxicating liquor.  Therefore I assume that we can approach the consideration of the proposals contained in this measure without any prejudice.  We were not affected by the plausible or the persistent appeals made by the people interested in the trade, and made particularly, as far as I know, by the bosses of the trade in Dublin; neither are we going to be affected by the threats and wild statements which have been made by temperance leaders in the country.  I entirely disagree with Deputy Fahy, and also with the statement which I read in to-day's paper, which is apparently in agreement with what the Deputy said&mdash;that a reversion to the opening on St. Patrick's Day will mean brawls and faction fights and so on amongst the population.  The price of intoxicating liquor, the poverty of the people, and the growth of temperance provide the best answer that can be given to these wild statements.  The following statement was published in to-day's &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>If every bona fide traveller can get intoxicants at every publichouse in the country, we shall, in a short time, witness a repetition of the disgusting scenes that disgraced St. Patrick's Day in the past.</P>
      <P>That statement should not be made by any sensible citizen of this State, because it cannot be supported by the crime records or any other statistics that are available to Deputies.  For that reason that statement should not have been published, and it should not be allowed to go outside this country to misrepresent the position of the people, whether made by temperance reformers or otherwise.  There has been a considerable decrease in the number of cases tried before District Justices and in other courts on charges of drunkenness, and that is the best evidence we have at our disposal, which will help to refute any statements with regard to excessive drinking in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> There is one thing the Minister has not told the House and that is the reason for rushing in here with a measure of this kind with such indecent haste.  From what source has he received the pressure which forces him to present these proposals to the House?  Was it from people interested in the trade in Dublin or from any organised section of the consuming population?  We are entitled to an answer.  The Minister is the very man who has made repeated promises during the past four years to bring in a Bill affecting the town tenants.  He has broken that promise on at least six occasions, and now he rushes in with this measure without any demand for it from any section of Deputies. Will he please tell us the reason why he is doing so?  There are Deputies here who believe that this measure is being brought in to confer favours upon people interested in the Dublin trade so that they can, in return, as they have done in the past, fill the coffers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in order to help to fight the coming general election.  That is my opinion and the opinion of many people outside.  I know that that has been done by the bosses of the trade in Dublin in the past.  They have contributed in one or two cases sufficient funds to return certain Deputies to sit on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches. There will be every opportunity afforded Deputies to answer these statements.  It will be very interesting to see how the treasurers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who sit on the Government Benches, will vote on this matter if it is left to a free vote.  There are people who boss the Minister in matters of this kind.  This is not the Minister's own Bill.  This is a Bill which he has been forced to bring in at the dictation of those who control the organisation from Parnell Square.  If that is not so, will the Minister tell the House from what channel the pressure has come and how have these proposals reached Government Buildings?  The Minister went so far as to say that the recommendations of the Commission, which he read in part, should be carried out completely.  Is not that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On all the matters referred to them.  The recommendation in regard to the opening of licensed houses on St. Patrick's Day is dealt with in Section 3.  The Minister read out the Report of the Commission in that respect.  For his information I will repeat that for the purpose of proving to him that he is not doing what he apparently intended to do. The members of the Commission said:</P>
      <P>We see no reason to alter the recommendations which we made in 1925 that St. Patrick's Day should be regulated by the same conditions as apply to Sundays.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would go to the last sentence in the same paragraph he will find:</P>
      <P>We also quite agree with his view that the conditions</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, District Justice Cussen&mdash;</P>
      <P>of opening on every bank holiday other than Good Friday or Christmas Day should be regulated by the same conditions as apply to Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister not carrying out that part of the recommendation?  I think it is simply because the people who boss the trade in Dublin will not allow him to do so and so give the benefit of the concession to their assistants, who will undoubtedly be affected if these proposals to open on St. Patrick's Day are approved.  There are between 4,000 and 5,000 assistants affected, so far as I am given to understand, by this proposal in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Waterford. Are we to understand that they are not entitled to enjoy St. Patrick's Day in whatever way they wish?  We think they are.  I go so far as to say that even outside these four cities there are many people, including the owners of publichouses in rural parts of the country, who believe that they are entitled to freedom to enjoy St. Patrick's Day in whatever way they wish.  Speaking for myself, and so far as I know with one or two exceptions, the members of this Party have not received representations of any kind from their constituents, either from <Col N="713" /> publicans in the area or from public bodies or the general public in regard to this matter.  Where has the demand come from in regard to this matter or through what channels has it been received by the Minister?</P>
    <P>There is a statement in the document, which I suppose has been circulated to all Deputies by the Licensed Grocers and Vintners' Protection Association, which says: &ldquo;We have gone to great pains to ascertain the views of the people on this matter.&rdquo; I would like to see a plebiscite taken on the question as to whether the people would like to have publichouses opened or closed on St. Patrick's Day.  I am not a teetotaller, and I am not bigoted on matters of this kind, and I believe that the people as a whole, men and women, teetotallers and others, would turn down this proposal.  I do not know what measures were adopted by the licensed grocers of Dublin to ascertain the views of the public, but in any case, if any members of Cumann na nGaedheal would take it upon themselves to speak from the benches opposite, following me, I would like to know from them what means were adopted and what channel was used to find out the views of the people.  How many were in favour of reopening or against it?  We are entitled to information on that point either from the Minister or those who can speak on behalf of the trade in this House.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the members of the Party to which I belong have been forced to consider their attitude on the Second Reading of this Bill mainly because it contains a provision for the reopening of publichouses on St. Patrick's Day, a provision with which we do not agree.  We agree with Deputy Fahy and others that there are certain things in the liquor laws which can be put right without doing wrong to anybody.  We could agree to vote for certain parts of the Bill, but we take strong exception to the opening of houses on St. Patrick's Day, because we believe that there is no particular demand for such a concession, and that it should not be revived at this particular period.  Therefore, I say: &ldquo;Throw out this measure and leave well enough alone.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry that the last Deputy who spoke approached the matter with such heat.  I shall begin by answering the last question which he put.  He wants to know the channel through which the Executive sought the views of the people.  That channel was the members of this Party of which I am a member, and I believe that they accepted the views of Deputies of this Party as representing to a great extent the views of the people of the country.  Deputy Davin commenced his speech by saying that the Labour Party has never approached this matter in a bigoted way.  I agree. I hope that any Deputy who follows me will proceed on the same lines, and I hope that those who are interested in the sobriety of this nation will approach the matter in no narrow way. If we are to attain any degree of unanimity we have to be temperate in our views as well as in our habits.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I intend to support the Bill whether it is a question of the Party Whips being on or off.  I see no provision in it that violates to any great extent the principles of those who are interested in the sobriety of this country.  Those of us who are interested in sobriety and who are not faddists will obtain no advantage by offering opposition to the mild demands of those who carry on a licensing business in this country.  For my own part, I do not think that there is any section in the Bill which I am prepared to oppose.  Deputy Fahy commenced his speech by offering opposition to the provision authorising the opening of publichouses on St. Patrick's Day, and he was followed by Deputy Davin.  Deputy Fahy said that he did not want a reversion to the scenes he remembered as a boy. Neither do I, and I think I am as old as Deputy Fahy.  Both he and I know that for many years the scenes which occurred, at least, when I was a boy, have long since ceased to occur, and I do not think that any Deputy would say that if the whole restrictions regarding the sale of liquor on St. Patrick's Day were removed the people would go back to the days of forty years ago, and that the scenes that occurred then would occur now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> I do not see any danger in granting the small concessions asked for in this Bill.  If I had any objection to the Bill it would be, as Deputy Fahy said, because of its omissions, which affect the people, rather than what it contains. The Minister said that there were four questions put to the Commission.  The first of these was the question of the split hour, but that is not included in the present Bill.  The Commission evidently did not see their way to report in favour of it, except to a small extent, namely, so far as clubs and hotels are concerned.  I cannot possibly imagine a reason why that provision was put into the original Bill. I was not a Deputy in those days, but, after looking up the matter, I believe that it was inserted because there were certain gentlemen in this city who commenced drinking at 7 o'clock in the morning and continued to do so until the publichouses closed at 10 or 11 o'clock at night.  They prided themselves on their ability to do so day after day.  The then Minister, in his sympathy for those rather extravagant drinkers, thought fit to bring in a provision to close the licensed houses for an hour in order to give those gentlemen a chance to recuperate, and not only to drink in the morning, but to slumber or eat in the hour's interval in order that they might continue their nefarious occupation for the remainder of the day.  That is, to my mind, a ridiculous and vexatious restriction on business men.</P>
    <P>I represent Limerick, and it possibly affects us more than it does the City of Dublin, perhaps in the same way as it affects Waterford and Cork.  It is an intolerable burden on the respectable men&mdash;and they are respectable men&mdash;who carry on the business of licensed traders and grocers.  The majority of the traders in Limerick are mixed traders.  Some of them are as big traders as any in Dublin, but business is carried on in a different way there.  There is a provision, wholesale and retail business carried on in the same shop&mdash;that is, tea, sugar, and goods of every description.  What happens? These houses are compelled to close down at the very hour of the day when business is at its highest, because <Col N="716" /> of fixing the split hour to accommodate the gentleman who wants to drink for eight or ten hours at a stretch, and who is enabled by this split hour to indulge his drinking habits.</P>
    <P>The cities of the country are at present the centres of the bus activity. These buses arrive in Limerick and Waterford about 1.30 or 2 p.m. in the day, mainly bringing young girls and women anxious to do their shopping. At the very hour when they are anxious to purchase their necessities the business houses are closed from 2.30 to 3.30.  During the winter months darkness often falls at 4 o'clock, and at the very hours when these people should be doing their business in daylight they are prevented by the provisions in this Act from doing so.  There are also in the City of Limerick three big cattle sales in the week and two market days.  I am in the habit of attending the cattle sales.  These sales come to an end about 2 o'clock, and you come down from the sales after having sold the cattle intending to do some business.  I, as a matter of fact, do not drink, but sometimes I want to do a little business in these houses.  I find these shops closed, with the result that I have to remain another hour in the city to transact my ordinary business just because again somebody thought fit that the gentleman I have mentioned should be able to slumber and continue his drinking afterwards. To my mind no case could possibly be made for the continuance of this split hour, and I hope that on the Committee stage some way may be found of inserting an amendment in the Bill to abolish it.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions that I personally would see no objection to putting in the Bill.  I think Deputy Fahy referred to the question of endorsement of licences.  I quite agree with Deputy Fahy that it is a very strong grievance with a very respectable body of traders, that when, perhaps, a trader is found guilty of a technical offence the licence has to be endorsed.  I think that there would be no objection either from temperance reformers or others if an amendment directed towards remedying that grievance were inserted.  The question of exemption orders might also be <Col N="717" /> dealt with in the Bill.  I think the Minister himself said that it would require two Acts of Parliament to get over the difficulty created by this section.  In the city of Limerick about two years ago there was a big religious celebration, at which about 100,000 people were present.  I think there was a demand for the the abrogation of this provision on that day.  The Church and people united in that demand, but the District Justice found it impossible to accede to it.  I see no reason why this particular provision should not apply to the four cities as well as to the rest of the country. These are some provisions that I think might be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Speaking as one who is as interested in the sobriety of this country as any Deputy in the House, I think that no useful purpose would be served by approaching this very controversial matter in a heated or bigoted manner. Those of us who are teetotal in our habits should not be intemperate in our views.  Sometimes the question of teetotalism and temperance are confused. I say without any fear of criticism that no matter what way we view this question, and no matter how much some of us deplore that there should be any drunkards in the country, if we must prevent the drunkard from having easy access to liquor, let us rather increase the penalty on him than impose a greater penalty on those who can carry a little drink.  At all events I hope Deputies in approaching this matter will approach it in a peaceful and non-controversial way.  In that way possibly before the Bill is out of Committee it may be improved in such a manner as to be of real help to some people without in any way infringing on the rights of people who think differently on the matter.</P>

      <P>The whole controversy seems to concentrate on Patrick's Day.  I do not know why we should take it for granted that anyone who takes a drink on Patrick's Day is going to make a beast of himself.  I fail to see why a man who wants a drink on Patrick's Day should not have it, and I am going to vote for the measure. As regards Deputy Davin's statement <Col N="718" /> that the Government have introduced this measure in order to get funds for the election, that is very far fetched. As far as the grocers' assistants are concerned, I believe they have a powerful Association and I certainly have not received representations from them or from atnyone on either side in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Drown the shamrock&rdquo; was the cry of our forefathers and we are not ashamed of it.  I look upon the Bill as a small slice of restitution from the Government for the great wrongs done to the licensed trade within the life of the Irish Parliament.  We expected fair play from them and I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because I am a publican although I did not sell a drop for a year and a half.</P>
      <P>At the same time I think that in this Bill the Minister for Justice is giving a small slice of restitution to us.  In my opinion the split hour will do no good.  As a member of the county council I have experience of the working of it in Cork City.  I see there people who come in from the country going about grumbling because during the split hour they cannot get into the shops, where a mixed trade is carried on, to do their business.  I believe that the people who should be victimised are not.  The real victims are those who during the split hour cannot get into the shops to meet their friends and do their business.</P>

    <P>I am glad to think that the houses will be open throughout the country on St. Patrick's Day because, after all, it is not a day of mourning.

We looked forward to having a good match on St. Patrick's Day and even if we had a good fight there were no murders committed at that time.  If there was a dispute we <Col N="719" /> fought it out fairly and squarely.  I think this Bill is only breaking the ice, because next year, or even within a couple of months, this Licensing Commission will be sitting again.  Another new Bill will have to come on because it is due to the publicans who, I believe, are the worst treated people in the country.  A couple of years ago a Bill was passed dealing with the poor down-trodden publicans.  A certain number of them were to go out of business each year and they were to get nothing.  Our own Government introduced that Bill and gave no excuse for doing so.  Was that proper treatment for publicans?</P>
    <P>There are people here on both sides of the House shouting for the publicans who contributed to the passing of that Act which I think was not fair or just.  That Act has not been put into operation for the last year or two but why I do not know.  It was passed because, I suppose, it was thought to be good for the nation.  If it was for the good of the nation then the cost of it should have been made a national charge, which it was not.  It was the publicans who remained in business who had to bear the cost.  I do not think that was right.  I am not saying that because I am one myself.  I do say that we want fair play.  I am whole-heartedly in support of this Bill.  It is the first bit of restitution that has been given back to us for a long time.  I hope that in a few weeks when framing his Budget, the Minister for Finance will be able to do more for the licensed trade than the Minister for Justice has.  I hope he will be able to reduce the pint to sixpence. I hope the House will agree to the clause dealing with St. Patrick's Day. I speak in support of those who cannot afford to go round in motor cars and carry supplies of drink with them.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Daly, I am convinced that there is only one thing misplaced this evening, and that is that we are not back in the old Parliament House in College Green.  I think it would make things sound perfect to hear Deputy Daly in the old Parliament House in the old way making the speech that <Col N="720" /> he made here to-night.  We returned here after extended holidays, and understood that we were to tackle at once serious questions affecting the majority of the people, farmers, labourers, and others.  We were told that we had very serious work to do, yet after all that we find the Minister for Justice putting aside Bills of very great importance on the dusty shelves, where they have lain for so long, and rushing in with this Bill, to give extended facilities for drinking on St. Patrick's Day.  I consider that there are far more urgent problems to be considered than the one that is now before the House.  If the problems that ought to be tackled were tackled the publicans would not have to be crying out for the relief that is proposed to be given them in this Bill, because then the country would be more prosperous than it is.  The speech the Minister made in moving the Second Reading of the Bill was the most apologetic that I have ever heard him make in this House, particularly when he referred to the two main clauses, 3 and 8.  He asked the House to agree to these two clauses simply because a Commission recommended that they should be put into law.</P>
      <P>Four years ago a Commission sat that travelled through almost every parish in the west, south and north of Ireland, and obtained the views of representative people.  That was the Gaeltacht Commission, which made very important recommendations, that have since received no attention from the Government or from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of that Commission was a very big and a very well considered one, and it was placed in the hands of the Government three or four years ago.  What was the result of the Commission's report which affected the lives of the majority of the people of the congested districts in Ireland?  We were not asked by the Minister for Justice to have these recommendations dealt with; we were not asked by Deputy Daly or Deputy Bennett to have questions affecting the people in the north, the south and the west tackled so that they might be kept from starving at home or prevented from going to <Col N="721" /> America to starve.  A Commission sits to deal with the liquor trade, then we have the report of the Commission rushed here, and we are asked to-night to accept recommendations three and eight.</P>
    <P>What of the other Commissions that were set up by the Government?  What about the Food Prices Commission that was set up and that went to great expense to inquire into food prices and profits?  What about the report that Commission brought in?  Is that of any interest, or does it affect the people? Are the members of Cumann na nGaedheal not interested in the question of the prices that people pay for food?  Is that of no interest to Deputy Daly or to any other Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches?  Are the recommendations of the Food Prices Commission to be thrown aside, while the recommendations of the Liquor Commission dealing with Sections 3 and 8 are of such major interest that they must be rushed, and the time of this House taken up so that they will be passed into law without delay to give the public extended facilities for drinking?  We want to give the members of the licensed trade fair play, but we believe that if the problems that affect the country were remedied the trade would be in a much better position to carry on its business.</P>
    <P>The licensed trade has been fooled for the past three or four years by the Government Party.  I remember reading the speech that Deputy Daly delivered to-night three years ago.  I remember reading a speech delivered in Mayo by Deputy Nally in 1927 in which he stated definitely that, from inside information, within a year the duties on beer and spirits would be reduced. Deputy Nally is in the House now and he can contradict me if I am not stating what is correct.  The statement was definitely made that the Government was going to tackle the high duties on beer and spirits, and was going to give relief to consumers and to the trade.  We believe that questions which affect the country, and which have occupied its attention, have been shelved by the Government Party.  We believe that if the question of economy, which Deputy Heffernan <Col N="722" /> tackled a few years ago, was tackled seriously a reduction could be made in the duties of beer and spirits.  That would be the honest, the proper, and the national way, rather than what is proposed in the present measure.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the President in the House to-night.  His absence is felt very much.  I would like to hear him speak on this question.  It is not often that we appreciate his presence here, but the present is a time at which we would appreciate it.  I would like to see the Minister for Education in the House and to hear him speak on this Bill.  I do not like them to be making a toad-stool of the Minister for Justice and have this measure foisted on him.  If it is going to be a failure the blame will be thrown on him, and afterwards they will pull the votes and the purses of the Temperance Party in the country, while he pulls the votes and the purses of the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not introduced on a question of principle.  It is introduced on the question of Party funds and nothing else, and people will realise that.  If you want to do justice to the licensed trade there is a way of doing it, but not by the hub-bub of Deputy Daly, Deputy Bennett and other Deputies. We know that if you give these extended facilities you are not going to have the scenes there were in the old days on St. Patrick's Day in Ireland. There is no thanks to be given the Government for that.  The thanks is due to the commonsense and the education of the Irish people, and also to the Gaelic League and other societies that worked hard for years to raise the status of Irishmen from that of the &ldquo;stage&rdquo; Irishman, and who do not want to let it go back to the stage we had Deputy Daly acting to-night. It is no thanks to the Government that we have succeeded so far in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is sickening to have a proposal of this kind made again after the years during which St. Patrick's Day was honoured as a national holiday.  The keeping of St. Patrick's Day as a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; holiday injured many parts of the country.  In Ballyhaunis the biggest fair and pattern of the year held was held that day.  Then all the publichouses <Col N="723" /> were closed on that day.  There was no pattern, and the fair was smashed, great injury being done to business and also to the farmers round the town.  It is not proposed to remove that injury by this measure.  It is proposed to extend the facilities for gentlemen with motor cars who can afford to be bona-fide travellers on St. Patrick's Day.  No facilities are given to the farmers or to the labourers. Extended facilities are to be given to gentlemen upon whom the Government now lean.  I do not blame the Minister for Justice.  No one is surprised to see him out to popularise a campaign for the opening of publichouses, but if he tackles one question affecting the people of Mayo he should tackle other questions on which Commissions have reported years ago, and he will be doing more justice to the people of Mayo, to the licensed trade and to people in general than by introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>We are asked to give facilities for drinking on St. Patrick's Day not to the farmers or to the labourers but to people who can go for a joy-ride of three or four miles and get drink during the extended hours.  We are also asked to give relief to the hotels and restaurants.  I think the hotels and restaurants are doing quite well.  This is a sop to the licensed trade.  We know that very well.  The proposal is to give relief in this dumb-bell fashion instead of giving it to the licensed trade direct.  There are to be no split hours in hotels or restaurants.  The position will be that people can get drink during the split hours by going to a table and ordering a meal.  They may not have a meal, but they may drink the whole time, and then return to the bar when it reopens.</P>
    <P>I think this is a retrograde step and unworthy of Deputies who face up to the facts seriously.  I think Deputy J.J. Byrne, of North Dublin, and Deputy Rice, of North Dublin, could do better for the people of North Dublin and for the licensed trade if they tackled the problem of unemployment and the slums.  If they forced the Government to do what Deputy J.J. Rice said he would do a few years ago, before he was elected for North Dublin, <Col N="724" /> to build thousands of houses and take the people out of the slums, it would be better.  I heard the Deputy speaking in Gardiner Street during the bye-election, and I almost got up to ask the people to vote for him, he looked so serious and as if he were in earnest.  He stated that if he was elected the slum problem would be settled, because he had a definite guarantee to that effect from a Commission that was then sitting.</P>

      <P>That settles that problem. I suggest it would be better for the licensed trade and for the labourers of North Dublin if he tackled this problem instead of trying to pull wool over the eyes of the licensed trade and get money for Party funds by trying to get a little measure like this through the House.  Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies are loud in their talk to-night.  Where were they last night when an industry was quenched out by the Government and thousands of labourers put on the dole?  Where were they last night when an effort was made on this side to waken Deputies to this House?  They were all silent.  Deputy Rice had no interest in the coach-building trade, neither had Deputy J.J. Byrne nor the Minister. That trade did not count.  It only concerned labourers.  They came from the common stock, but of course at election time the licensing trade can be useful.  I am sure we will have a speech from Deputy J. J. Byrne to-night for almost an hour.  I am quite sure Deputy Rice will take his place to-night and speak and give us his views on this important question, on this great evil of publichouses being closed three days in the year out of 365.  Is it such an awful disgrace for publichouses to be closed three days out of 365?  Is it that we cannot afford it, that the licensing trade cannot afford it, that the people cannot afford it, that they would die of thirst if Deputy Rice had not succeeded in having it reduced to two days out of the 365?  But I may be making a mistake.  He may be one of those who are trying to pull the other crowd.  He may be one of those who were going against the Bill <Col N="725" /> in order to pull the temperance crowd or the clergy.  We do not know at present but I consider that Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies have something better to do.  There are things in the country which we should tackle and do in this House and to which support would be given by members of this Party and members on the Labour Benches and we are prepared to tackle these matters and have united action in tackling this problem, but we are not prepared to go out on a question of this kind and remedy mythical evils which exist in this country.  If he would have common-sense and speak for the ordinary people of this country the Minister would withdraw this Bill.  There are a few evils or hardships that affect the licensed trade seriously, the question of endorsement of licences and questions of that sort.  We are prepared to tackle this and have these things which lean on the licensed trade remedied but we are not prepared to come up on a question of this kind at the present moment seeing the condition of the country is as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened now to the speech delivered by Deputy Clery.  I leave it to the intelligence of the House to say was there a single argument adduced against the Bill which is under consideration.  After a quarter of an hour's oration the only fact that emerged from the speech was that considerable injury had been done to the town of Ballyhaunis which Deputy Clery represents.  He did not adduce a single argument as to why this Bill should be rejected.  He spoke about everything under the sun except what was contained in this Bill.  He spoke about Commission after Commission; not a single reference to a single clause, not a single argument to show why any clause in this Bill should be either accepted or rejected.  He referred to the absence of the President from the House.  The President's views on the closing on St. Patrick's Day, which appear to be the great bone of contention amongst the Labour Party and amongst Fianna Fáil, are already well known.  They are already placed on the records of this House, and perhaps it would not be amiss for me to say that the President was an <Col N="726" /> opponent&mdash;when this Bill was introduced by the late Kevin O'Higgins&mdash; of closing publichouses on St. Patrick's Day.  There is no need for the President to be here to reiterate his views. If Deputy Clery had looked the matter up, the information was already on the records of the House.  Remarkable speeches were made.  A very well-reasoned speech was made by Deputy Fahy.  I would like to pay him that tribute.</P>
      <P>The speech that appealed to me was made from these benches, and that speech was made by a total abstainer, Deputy Bennett from Limerick.  Could anyone hesitate to believe in the honesty and sincerity of that speech? Had he any interest in the licensed trade?  Is he going to get any benefits, good, bad or indifferent, out of the attitude he took on this Bill, That is the kind of speech that is in the interests of the nation, and not the party oration which Deputy Clery has delivered.  I would like to say that this Bill was being considered in a very reasonable way until Deputy Davin rose to speak.  We have to make a little allowance for Deputy Davin.  We know he is a little bit volatile in his disposition, and sometimes says a great deal more than he means.  I do think Deputy Davin rather hit below the belt.  Deputy Davin, in the course of his speech, wanted to know where there was a demand in the country for this Bill, and when Deputy Bennett rightly informed him that Deputies of this Party were as closely in touch with the aspirations and the needs of the people as other Deputies in this House, Deputy Davin repeated it.  Why could not Deputy Bennett; or even Deputy J.J. Byrne, who has been held up to odium by Deputy Clery, be in a position to ascertain what the views of their constituents are?  Are they not living in the heart of a densely-populated district?  Are they not as well qualified to know what people want as Deputy Davin?  I am speaking for the people of North Dublin. You can never legislate a nation into temperance by passing legislation in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many examples of what penal legislation has been and a Bill that originally passed through the <Col N="727" /> House had many penal clauses and although Deputy Daly was held up to a sort of ridicule for speaking&mdash; we all know he is an old-fashioned sort&mdash;yet a great deal of what he said was the plain, unvarnished truth.  He went further.  He went on to say that there would be a reduction of the licence and spirit duties and of the taxes when the Minister for Finance would balance his Budget.  Does anyone reasonably think that statement would be accepted by this House? Let us accept the speech of Deputy Daly in the spirit in which it was made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made certain statements here to-night that I think on cooler and calmer reflection he will be sorry for.  One of the statements he made was that this Bill was introduced to bring party funds into the coffers of Cumann na nGaedheal.  My experience of Deputy Davin is that he is generally rather a reasonable and decent sort of fellow and he does not make those statements without some kind of proof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin never adduced a single word of proof to sustain that statement which should never have been made.  It will not do Deputy Davin any good personally. It will not do the Party to which he belongs any good.  Although, I suppose, the House knows I am not what might be termed a drinker, I would say that it is a gross reflection upon a very respectable body of men, the licensed trade.  Deputy Fahy, in the course of his remarks, said that this Bill was remarkable rather for its omissions than for what it contained. I feel in hearty agreement with Deputy Fahy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to misquote the Deputy.  It is quite sufficient for my purpose to say that he said the Bill is remarkable for its omissions. He went on to say, arising out of that, that one of the most important omissions from the Bill was the failure to deal with the endorsement and cancelling of licences.  I remember when the 1927 Act was being introduced. I had no connection with this House then, but a rough proof of that Bill was handed into my hands by a member of the licensed trade who said, &ldquo;Byrne, do you see that clause dealing with the endorsement of licences? What do you think of it?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;You know something about the licensed trade.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;That is the most scandalous clause that was ever incorporated in a Bill.  If that clause becomes law in its present form a man who has a grudge against a publican can get a drink and bring it to a drunken man sitting at the end of the shop, and if that man is found with the drink the licence is endorsed, and two endorsements remove the licence.&rdquo; I agree with Deputy Fahy that that is a very serious drawback, and I do suggest that if an amendment can be incorporated in this Bill, to have power given to the District Justice, or the right to say whether or not a licence should be endorsed, it will have my support.  I agree with Deputy Fahy and, as I say, I think everybody in this House will fully appreciate the spirit in which Deputy Fahy delivered his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to what Deputy Fahy dealt with, the kernel of the whole Bill, and that is the closing on St. Patrick's Day.  He said that there was a long campaign waged in the country to bring that closing about, and that the passing of this Bill and giving Sunday facilities on that day would mean a retrogression.  He said, &ldquo;I do not want to see scenes like what I <Col N="729" /> witnessed in my boyhood.&rdquo;  I am as old a man as he is, and I ask the question, is there any fear of scenes on St. Patrick's Day if this Bill passes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clery even admitted that the present happy position of sobriety which this nation enjoys was due to many causes.  That was the only remark that I agreed with in the course of his whole speech.  He pointed out what has been done by the Gaelic League and by other bodies for the upliftment of this nation, but if one thing has made for the upliftment of this nation more than another, it is the present price of drink, which is an absolute prohibition, and which is one of the greatest things that has tended to the present sobriety of this nation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fahy that the only thing about this Bill is that it does not go far enough.  There is no man in this House who will not agree that you can easily go too far by measures of this sort, and that penal legislation on licensing matters will do more harm than good.  I want to remind the House that when the original Bill was introduced it contained nothing about closing licensed premises on St. Patrick's Day.  The Bill actually passed in the Dáil with a clause giving the publicans the right to open on St. Patrick's Day.  It was only when the Bill went to the Seanad that an amendment was introduced to close on St. Patrick's Day, and that amendment was carried by a majority of one.  I ask the Labour Party and I ask the Fianna Fáil Party should a majority of one in the Upper House keep the licensed premises closed on St. Patrick's Day?  It would be much more important if a majority of one in this House closed the licensed premises on St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>By our Party who were endeavouring to do the best between conflicting interests in the country, for which I am sure every reasonable man will give them credit.  I need <Col N="730" /> not refer to what I have already described as penal legislation.  The example of America is before us.  We have seen what prohibition has done for America.  This namby-pamby rhetoric is without a scintilla of common-sense.  I would like to point out that the licensed trade are a perfectly legitimate trade, that they are a trade who always acted well in the national interests, that they are a trade from which a very important revenue is drawn by this State.  They pay very heavy rates and taxes.  I think a sum of £119,000 per annum comes in from the licence duties to the revenue of this State.  We all know that the licensed trade is passing through a very critical period of its history at the present moment. Anybody who knows the values to which licensed property has fallen will realise the period of depression which the licensed trade, in common with other trades, is passing through at the present time.  Are they not entitled to relief which will do no harm to the morale of the people, which will do no harm to the temperance movement in this country, and which will do, perhaps, a lot of good.  I am one of those who believe that a man should have a reasonable opportunity to drink or not to drink as he wishes.  I am one of those who believe that this split hour closing in the middle of the day has been a greater hardship on the poor working man than on those with better means and better resources at their disposal. As I have already said, the fault I have to find with the Bill is that it does not go far enough.  As regards this closing from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m., I hope it will be possible in the Committee Stage of the Bill to move an amendment to do away with it.  I know, speaking for the City of Dublin, that it was never wanted.  I know it has been resented and by no body of men has it been resented more than by the working men.</P>

I wonder what man's pocket could stand that.  Take any of us in this House. Which one of us could afford to sit in a publichouse from the early hours of the morning till the closing hours? That is just absurd.  It is a ludicrous argument.  I know on the North Side a certain road that cattle drovers are passing through to the country between 2.30 and 3.30 o'clock and these people have to go without getting refreshment of any kind.  It is a concrete instance of how this Bill is operating against the working classes of this country.  I hope that the House will pass this Bill.  It is only doing a small measure of justice to a very important trade.  I hope when it comes to the Committee Stage that Deputy Fahy will agree with me to wipe out the split hour.  I do not know whether or not it will be possible under the title of the Bill to incorporate an amendment dealing with the endorsement of licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has had a most mysterious origin.  We do not quite know whether it originated with the licensed trade or with certain Deputies on the opposite side who have, according to the Press, aspirations for higher positions and are anxious to advance their claims to judicial honours.  If these Deputies are going to persist in advancing their claims to judicial honours, and if they succeed in setting up this Bill as a triumph for their statesmanship, they can be well assured that there will be, at least, one grateful interest in the Twenty-Six Counties which will strew their paths to the judicial benches with bouquets of flowers.  But, as regards the ordinary working man, about whom so many crocodile tears have been shed to-night, I doubt if he can find very much room for gratitude to a House, to a Government, or to a Minister that stands over a measure of this kind and demands that our attention should be given to it until such time as it is disposed of, when, as Deputy Clery pointed out, matters affecting the bread and butter of every citizen, <Col N="732" /> and for which we here are responsible, are pigeon-holed in the different Government offices.  We had, as Deputy Clery pointed out, various Commissions which reported on matters far more important to the country than this, and which require urgent attention, matters affecting the farming community, affecting town tenants, affecting the cost of living to ordinary labourers.  We do not hear a single word about these Commissions, nor do we see the Minister or his colleagues taking up the attitude that the recommendations of these Commissions are going to be carried into effect.  But, because a small body of individuals, called together hastily to try to placate this interest, have seen fit to introduce a number of recommendations we are told that the House must now take what we, at any rate, consider a definite step backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahy has called attention to the fact that twenty years ago the Gaelic League set in operation a boycott of licensed houses on the national festival and compelled them to close. The Gaelic League stands for the same thing to-day, and so does the G.A.A. I was very proud to read that the Leinster Convention of that splendid body of young Irishmen had protested against the attempt to turn the clock backwards and to revert to the old manner of celebrating our national festival.  That an attempt should now be made to revive the idea of St. Patrick's Day as &ldquo;the day we celebrate,&rdquo;&ldquo;the drowning of the shamrock,&rdquo; and all that kind of thing, and that the national ideals that so many Irishmen have struggled and fought for in the last quarter of a century&mdash;that the clock should now be definitely set backwards, and that we should set all at nought and take this retrograde step, which in itself may not be a very big one, but which nevertheless is a step backwards, and which will probably lead to further steps back-wards&mdash;that that should happen at this stage of our existence in a country which has boasted so much of its freedom and independence and of the tremendous importance that it holds in the religious life of the world, that such a thing should happen is certainly an extraordinary commentary on Irish <Col N="733" /> ideals.  The only explanation is that this is simply and solely a political move. Under the guise of protecting or helping the licensed trade, an effort has been made by the Government which finds its forces scattered and finds itself in a weak position to attempt to put up a camouflage to persuade that trade that in fact something valuable is being given to them, that some great contribution is being made to alleviate their present position, and that in fact something is being done to improve the position of that trade.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that this measure will not improve the conditions in that trade.  There is first, as Deputy Clery pointed out, the general condition of the country.  Money is scarce, depression exists, and that is the first thing that the licensed trade suffers from. That can only be remedied by this House attending to the economic problems which confront us and striving to settle them, and by our preparing to meet this economic blizzard which, we are told, is not alone blowing now but will blow for some years to come.  The best way we can restore prosperity to the licensed trade or restore it to the community in general is by setting out to build up and develop the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the reduction in duties.  Our attitude in that matter has been stated.  We cannot see that the taxpayer at present can afford to give one and a half million pounds in the form of subsidy for the sake of a penny reduction in the pint of stout.  We cannot see that it is reasonable.  We are not alone in that. The Minister for Finance has constantly steeled his heart against all the appeals of the licensed trade.  My friend Deputy Daly has time after time, with some of his colleagues on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, asked for some alleviation of the tax on drink, and the Minister has only steeled his heart and told him that such a thing is impossible.  There is the other point which might have brought some relief to the licensed trade, and that is the provision for compensation under the 1927 Act, to which Deputy Daly has rightly called attention.  Deputy Aiken asked the <Col N="734" /> Minister for Finance last year, when he introduced a small Supplementary Estimate of £300, to cover outstanding expenses in connection with compensation for licence holders what the position was, and the Minister stated: &ldquo;After our year's experience of the working of this compensation clause we are giving up the proposals for a year in order to examine the position; we are, therefore, only applying for a small sum of £300 to cover expenses, and we are going to start off again in September.&rdquo;  September has come and gone and very many months have passed since, and still there is no sign from the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance that this matter, which every publican has expressed himself as being interested in, and which the licensed trade in general regarded as a remedy which might relieve the situation by removing a large number of the redundant public-houses&mdash;not a word has been said about it, and there is no indication that the Government are going to pursue the forward and progressive policy that we expected from them in that matter.  I say that so long as these questions are not tackled then to talk of the present measure being anything in the nature of a real alleviation of the depressed condition of the licensed trade is simply trying to camouflage the whole issue and throw dust in the eyes of those who, as we all know, are finding it difficult to make ends meet, but, unfortunately, seem to have no alternative employment open to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clery has also called attention to a very important matter in this Bill which has often been brought up before whenever this question of the licensed trade was discussed, and that is the question of the bona fide traffic. Does any Deputy on the Government Benches honestly believe that he can persuade this House that this privilege or concession which it is now sought to give the country publicans by enabling them to open during the same hours on St. Patrick's Day as on Sundays is either going to be of benefit to the trade or to the ordinary labourer or farmer?  The people living in the immediate vicinity of these houses, whether in towns or villages, <Col N="735" /> cannot avail themselves of the opportunities of getting drink on St. Patrick's Day.  They will not be bona-fide and, in fact, there is no real concession of value to the trade in this.  I am quite certain that any publican, either at a cross roads or even at a church, or in a small town, will agree that this is no real concession whatever.</P>
    <P>The only thing about it is this: as Deputy Fahy pointed out, it is the thin end of the wedge, and by giving a vote in this House in favour of retrogression, and the opening on St. Patrick's Day you are doing a thing that once commenced there is no knowing where it is going to stop. Pressure is going to be applied on all sides to all Deputies and the attention of the House instead of being devoted, in the coming months or years, to present-day problems to which all its time and attention should be given will find its energy dissipated in fruitless discussions upon future concessions to the licensed trade.  It has been well and truly said that when this law which has been in operation for a number of years, whatever the hardship it may have brought upon individuals or interests of the community initially, nevertheless when it was in operation for a number of years and without any general demand for its repeal the Government would have been well advised if they left well enough alone.</P>
    <P>We know that the Vintners' Assistants' Association are strongly against the proposed opening on St. Patrick's Day.  We know that 1,200 or 1,500 young men engaged in that industry claim that since they had only been getting two days they should get this extra one, and they point out also that the three hours' opening in fact means nothing; that as far as the publican is concerned in the City of Dublin he would cherfully open at 2 o'clock in the morning if he could make anything out of it.  The three hours therefore would inflict hardship upon these young men who are the backbone of the national and Gaelic movement, and who would be up in Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day trying to divert the attention of the population to more congenial and <Col N="736" /> national pastimes than sitting in publichouses if they are not sent back to the publichouses to work on St. Patrick's Day.  And I maintain that any income that the publican and the trade will get&mdash;if what we hear from the Government Benches is true, that there is a great change in the country and that people are not drinking as much as they used to and that there is no fear of a reversion to what we were used to many years ago&mdash;will, if that is so, be negligible and if there is not to be an orgy of drinking on St. Patrick's Day then what is the necessity of opening the publichouses at all?  If there is not going to be a considerable amount of drinking there is no great benefit to the licensed trade in opening the publichouses on St. Patrick's Day.  The only advantage in opening the publichouses must be supposed to be that you are to have as well as a large number of poor people in Dublin, a large number of visitors attracted to the City and that these people are going to drink on that day.  If that is so, it simply means that we are opening the door not to something temperate and moderate and reasonable, but we are simply telling all these people that we have opened the publichouses in order that they may go and drink as they can.</P>
    <P>The split hours have also been referred to.  We take that, as Deputy Fahy pointed out, to be a piece of class legislation.  We believe that hotels and restaurants have quite sufficient facilities already.  The matter is a very small and insignificant one, but, just the same as the question of opening on St. Patrick's Day, it is a beginning. It is quite obvious that Deputy Daly and the trade he represents do not consider this Bill of much importance, that it is only a beginning, and they are satisfied that they have got the Government into the position that they are forced to turn back upon the work done by the late Minister for Justice. They are assured of bigger things in the future, and they are not prepared to carp or criticise to any great extent at the moment.  You are going to give the restaurants this hour in the middle of the day; you are going to enable a gentleman who is not able <Col N="737" /> to finish his lunch and to order his drink before half-past two, another hour in which to order it.  At the end of that time, if he is thirsty he will be allowed to go down to the bar and continue there for the evening.  I think it is simply preposterous.  If you admit that, you cannot in conscience and reason deny to the carter or labouring man at the North Wall the right to go into the publichouse and have his snack and bottle or pint of stout.  You are opening the door, and the moment you do that the pressure will become so very great that you will be forced to go further.  Once you admit there is reason in this, and that it is a question that must be reopened, and not now definitely closed, but that anybody can, at any time, reopen the whole matter again, you are letting yourself in for any amount of trouble and difficulty.  It would be a very good solution of the question generally if a provision was made&mdash;I am not a lawyer, but I understand that there is in the licensing code a provision which a number of respectable publicans in the trade try to adhere to&mdash; that is, to insist on supplying the worker and the labouring man with food at the same time as he was taking drink.  If that provision was carried to its logical conclusion, then well and good.  There is some hope in that of reforming the licensed trade on a proper basis, but to suggest that you should make one law for the man in the restaurant, who can spend hours over his meal, and exclude the other class of case because a man cannot afford to go into a restaurant, is simply preposterous.  Before Deputies agree to pass that into law they should remember that if they admit that principle in the one case they will inexorably be compelled to admit it in the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin very rightly called attention to the point to which attention was also called by the Vintners' Assistants' Association, and that is, that if they could have the concession they asked, and which, I think, to some extent the licensed trade was pledged to give, that is, that there was to be a definite understanding that all bank holidays should be put upon the same basis as Sunday&mdash;if they could have <Col N="738" /> got that extra time off they were willing to accept that, but because that principle was not agreed to, of closing on all bank holidays as on Sundays, they naturally and very strongly objected to the proposal that St. Patrick's Day should be an opening day and that they should have to go back to work for one of the only three days that they have off, and that nothing is done to try and close, for at least some time, on other bank holidays.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that we think deserves attention besides the question of endorsement that Deputy Fahy referred to.</P>
    <P>No doubt the question of endorsement is one we are prepared to consider as sympathetically as we can, but we are not prepared to consider it in the company of such provisions as that of the reopening on St. Patrick's Day and the abolition of the split hour.  We want to call the attention of the House to another matter, and that is the question of the opening of licensed premises after midnight on Sunday night.  We see here a flaw or a deliberate omission in the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1927.  It appears that not alone publichouses, but hotels throughout the country, can open for bona fide drinkers after midnight on Sunday night.  We are told by those who have knowledge of the circumstances that what happens is that when a dance or some other pastime is over, or perhaps during the dance, the boys who have been drinking perhaps until 8 o'clock in the evening come along after 12 and go to the publichouses, which we understand are open to receive them if they can be said to be bona fide travellers.</P>
    <P>We know that the bona fide laws are supposed to be very strict and in fact if a policeman calls even if you prove you are a bona fide traveller, if he should call again in a quarter of an hour you will then be no longer a bona fide traveller.  You are then a loiterer on the premises; you will no longer be able to say you are a bona fide and you will be prosecuted for a breach of the law.  In order to administer properly this law regulating <Col N="739" /> the licensing of clubs, and the prevention of facilities to golf clubs to become drinking dens, you will simply require an enormous police force working at night as well as in the day-time.  I think it would be physically impossible for the police, who, I must admit, have done their best, as far as I am aware, to carry out the law, to track all these so-called bona fide people who go into publichouses or hotels at 12 o'clock on Sunday night and stay there until all hours on Monday morning.  There is no reason why publichouses or hotel bars should be open after 12 o'clock on Sunday night any more than after 12 o'clock on Saturday night.</P>
    <P>There will always be the argument that you may have individual cases of hardship and that you want to make provision for people attending fairs or markets or travelling on business.  We are quite prepared to consider that.  There is at present a system by which publicans can get occasional licences where fairs are held or where for some reason a crowd is likely to gather and people may want refreshments.  That is a matter that can be dealt with by the District Justice.  You may, however, have a state of affairs which may not be prevalent in some parts of the country but which is a great and growing evil in other places that are associated with the dance halls which we hear so much about.  I submit that those dance halls might not nearly be so harmful as is alleged if publichouses did not exist side by side with them and if the people attending the dances were not permitted to visit the publichouses on Sunday nights in the way I have mentioned.  We believe there may be exceptions and that it ought to be possible, while ending that grave evil which we suggest is very bad and dangerous and which has reached alarming proportions in certain parts of the country, to leave adequate safeguards for people who are travelling on business or who are compelled to be out at abnormal hours legitimately and who should get refreshments if they wish to get them.  It <Col N="740" /> ought to be possible to tackle and eradicate the great evil I have mentioned, while admitting necessary safeguards. We believe that definite steps should be taken to remedy this situation. Definite steps should be taken to remedy the omissions in the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the speakers who say it is a reflection on the national character that publichouses are closed on St. Patrick's Day.  We have to recognise that we have particular circumstances in this country, and that there was a time when we were not above criticism.  We have to recognise that this is a matter in which our personal feelings or predilections must not reign supreme.  We must try to give a good example to the country, to set a proper headline.  We must show that we are in earnest in this matter.  It may be hurled at us that if we refuse to open on St. Patrick's Day it can be taken as an indication that the Irish people are not able to look after themselves and they have not the spirit of self-respect necessary to sustain them. I contend that by undoing what has been done already, by upsetting the law that has proved so satisfactory and in regard to which there has been no public demand for a repeal, we would be in danger of losing our national spirit of self-respect.  It would indeed be a retrograde step if, because of some demand from vested interests in this country, we were to undo all the good that has been done.  If we do that I do not think we could do anything that would be a greater reflection on our national character.  The whole matter is closed and done with, and in the name of God let it be so. We are now approaching a time when an important religious function will be held in this country, and I say if this whole question is to be reopened it will do harm to the country, not alone socially, but it will tend to give Ireland a very bad name internationally.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin, in the course of his observations on this Bill, was curious to know from what source the inspiration came for the introduction of the Bill.  I thought Deputy Davin would have remembered that a Commission had inquired into these <Col N="741" /> matters in 1929.  He referred to the indecent haste with which this Bill was introduced.  I do not think there was any indecent haste in introducing a Bill in the year 1931 upon recommendations made by a Commission in 1929.  Deputy Davin was curious to know what were the sources from which the Government got the inspiration and at whose suggestion this Bill was introduced.  I would like to remind Deputy Davin that the Commission was a very representative body and it included in its ranks a leader of the Labour Party. I may say, without meaning any offence to Deputy Davin, that that member of the Commission is much more prominent and more representative of Labour than Deputy Davin himself. I refer to Senator O'Farrell.  If Deputy Davin will take the trouble to look at the report he will find that it is signed by all the members of the Commission, including Senator O'Farrell. One of the recommendations was a reiteration of the recommendation which the Commission sitting in 1925 made in its report, that St. Patrick's Day should be treated for licensing purposes in the same way as Sunday.</P>
      <P>A speaker on the Fianna Fáil Benches, whose name I understand is Deputy Clery, deplored the absence of Ministers from the House during the course of the debate; he wanted to know why they were absent.  I wonder does the Deputy think that Ministers should be compelled to remain here to listen to the kind of nonsense that he treated the House to to-night?  He deplored the absence of Ministers and the long vacations, as he called them, which this House has had.  I wonder did he look around at the benches occupied by members of his own Party, and did he count how many Deputies were in attendance on his own side during this session, and how many voted in this House yesterday.  We heard moaning about what happened in the debate yesterday, but as the President pointed out last night, no support was given from either the Fianna Fáil or the Labour Benches to the motion moved by Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <P>The last speaker on the Fianna Fáil Benches, Deputy Derrig, referred to the scattered forces of the Government, and to the weak position of the Government.  I wonder what the Deputy meant, if he is truly reported in his speech last Sunday in Dun Laoghaire, when he told his audience in despair that the last effort his Party would make to put this Government out of power would be at the next General Election, and if they did not succeed then that they were going to withdraw from the Dáil.  The same Deputy refers to the expenditure that would be caused by a decrease of one penny to the consumer in the price of stout.  He said it would cost one and a half million pounds.  That is the kind of loose thinking the Party opposite indulges in, and the kind of nonsense they talk in the country.  The figure he gave was three times at least as much as the expenditure would be, but, of course, the difference to a financier like Deputy Derrig, between a half a million and one and a half millions is a matter for little consideration. The House remembers what Deputy Derrig introduced here, the freak Land Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been described as a Bill to make minor amendments in the licensing laws.  The only one I want to refer to is the amendment dealing with St. Patrick's Day. That is an amendment that has been recommended in two reports by the Licensing Commission.  It was recommended in the Report of the Licensing <Col N="743" /> Commission in 1925 and it was recommended by the Commission that had been set up in 1929 to consider these matters.  No person who reads the report and recommendations of the Commission in 1925 or in 1929 can accuse them of any bias in favour of the licensed trade.  Deputy Davin wants to know why the Minister did not deal in this Bill with the recommendation in the report to treat bank holidays in the same way as Sundays and St. Patrick's Day.  Deputy Davin is long enough in this House to understand the elementary principles of the proceedings here and apply his mind to them.  If the Deputy will read the terms of reference to the Commission he will see that the Commission had no authority whatever to go into the matter of bank holidays.</P>

      <P>There are two attitudes of mind in connection with St. Patrick's Day that I can understand. One is the attitude which is openly, plainly, prohibitionist, that this intoxicating liquor should be banned from the State just as in America. That is one attitude of mind.  The other is the attitude which was voiced by Deputy Fahy.  As Deputy Murphy said, there is the fear in Deputy Fahy's mind that the people of this country will make beasts of themselves &mdash;to use Deputy Murphy's own phrase. <Col N="744" /> That is, as I suggest, another example of the inferiority complex in the minds of the Deputies opposite.  They can see nothing good, they can see nothing manly in the people of this State. They cannot attribute honesty, sobriety or any manly virtues to the people of this country.  The only explanation of their attitude on this subject is that they think if licensed houses are opened on St. Patrick's Day the people will indulge in intemperance.</P>

      <Col N="745" /> He is the gentleman who, as everybody knows, is strongly in favour of temperance, and he dealt with this subject of opening on St. Patrick's Day. In the course of his evidence he said: &ldquo;Personally, I consider the provision for a total closing on St. Patrick's Day rather a reflection on our national character as regards sobriety on that day.&rdquo;  His attitude was that the people of this country are fit to be trusted on St. Patrick's Day as on other days.  I repeat that the observations from the opposite benches to-night are a reflection upon our national character; they as much as suggested that the people are not able to control themselves on a national holiday.  In a former debate on some kindred subject I said here that the habits of our people have been completely changed since the younger days of many members of the House.

He put them into two classes.  Possibly it is just as well that one should make clear his attitude of mind at the very start, so that there would be no doubt about it in the mind of anybody else. I am one of those who believe that if the drink traffic did not exist in this country it would be all for the country's good.  At the same time I recognise that this House, in regard to the sale of drink, must recognise that those who keep within the law have definite rights of citizenship.  I do not profess to understand the motives for <Col N="746" /> the introduction of this Bill.  I merely want to talk about the Bill as it stands. I do not think anyone in this House, or outside the House, can look on at the huge expenditure in this country on intoxicating liquor and not feel that it is a serious problem at a time like this, when there is unemployment and scarcity of money.</P>

I come a good distance in order to get to Dublin and I confess that only in this city have I heard a word from anybody about changing the law in regard to St. Patrick's Day.  I know a good many in the trade and, though I am not a customer of theirs, I am aware from what they tell me that they do not want to be bothered with the proposal that is now put forward here for consideration.</P>
      <P>Neither from the Minister himself nor from his supporters have we heard any argument in favour of a change. I have been reading the existing Act, and it seems to me that it does not prohibit anyone who comes to a football match or other gathering from a distance from getting refreshments. That, at least, is my reading of it, though I am open to correction, that a bona-fide traveller can get refreshment in the way of a meal at any time.</P>

      <P>Someone said that he objected to the restrictions, as they interfered with one's freedom, but I suggest that there is no law passed, here or elsewhere, which does not encroach on someone's freedom.  It is a natural consequence of all legislation and of modern civilisation that any law will operate more or less in that way. Deputy Fahy said that it was a reflection on the Irish character to find ourselves discussing this question at present.  Even representatives of the licensed trade who spoke to me to-day referred to the benefits that had accrued from less drinking.  Surely no <Col N="747" /> one in this House or in this State is of opinion that benefits will accrue by opening on St. Patrick's Day.  Someone has said that we have nothing to thank the Government for in regard to their restrictions in respect of the licensing laws.  I am not an authority on these things, but I think that the member of the Government Party who has gone to his reward and who first introduced licensing legislation here was regarded by most people as having accomplished a great deal.  There have been many leaders in Irish history, people like St. Patrick himself, Father Mathew, and others comprising all denominations who tried to uplift the country.  Their activities, and also the increased price of liquor in recent years, have combined to make the country more sober than it was in the days to which Deputy Daly and others have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we can claim that any one of these particular things has accomplished everything, but taken jointly they represent a great step forward in these matters.  Like other Deputies, I say that the Bill is remarkable for the omissions.  I do not think that anyone has referred to an omission which I have noticed.  In one paragraph of the Bill reference is made to a change from an on-licence to a spirit grocer's licence.  I would have thought from the evidence before the Commission, and also before the Minister, that steps would have been taken to do by legislation what many traders have done voluntarily, namely, to separate their premises so as not to have the sale of drink and the sale of provisions conducted in the one house. I think if that were done it would be a big step forward and would be fairer to other people in the trade.  There are a number of other things which one might say about this matter, but I do not intend to speak at greater length. Somebody has said that the temperance people are faddists, but I submit that those who accomplish anything in any country are enthusiasts, and that people who are lukewarm on any subject never get anywhere.  It is the people who direct their enthusiasm in advocating what they believe to be right who have accomplished anything. <Col N="748" /> I am not speaking on behalf of anyone but myself, and I will oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recollect that I gave notice yesterday that I would raise a matter on the adjournment motion in connection with widows' and orphans' pensions.  I addressed a question yesterday to the Minister for Finance asking whether it is the intention of the Government to introduce proposals for legislation to provide pensions for widows and orphans; and, if so, when it is intended that such proposals will be introduced. The Minister for Finance, in reply, said that the investigation of this matter had not yet been completed, and it had therefore not been possible for the Executive Council to arrive at a decision. Deputies will recollect that on 17th October, 1928, over two years ago, a motion was moved in this House which read:</P>
      <P>That this House is of opinion, having regard to the inadequacy of the provision at present made for widows and for orphans bereft of their breadwinners, and to the desirability of removing all stigma of pauperism in such cases, that the establishment of a scheme of insurance to provide pensions and allowances for widows and orphans would be desirable, and accordingly requests the Executive Council to prepare and present to the House a report upon such schemes of insurance and estimates of the cost.</P>
      <P>That motion was moved from the Labour Benches, and an amendment was moved and passed which read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;House&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;requests the Executive Council to take special consideration, whether, without imposing an excessive burthen on productive industry, further provision can be made for widows and orphans bereft of their bread-winners; in what manner (by insurance <Col N="749" /> or otherwise) this can best be achieved; and what may be the net cost of such provision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking in the House during the discussion on the original motion on 17th October, 1928, the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it would be quite proper that the Executive Council should conduct that examination and should lay the result of it before the House so that a motion or a Bill dealing with this matter could be more satisfactorily discussed by the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of a further statement he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would have no objection to having the matter examined by the appropriate civil servants, and such information as was available obtained and set out in proper form, having estimates prepared and explained and the whole matter laid before the House in a White Paper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the matter of actual expenditure we cannot afford to ignore what is done in other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Without desiring to go into the whole question of the principle of widows' and orphans' pensions, I would point out to the Minister for Finance that a scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions is in operation in Scotland, England, Wales and the Six Counties. As I have pointed out, this question has been already before the House.  A period of two years and three months has elapsed, but notwithstanding that fact, when the Minister was asked how matters stood yesterday, he stated that the investigation of the matter had not yet been completed.  &ldquo;Has not yet been completed,&rdquo; although two years and three months have elapsed since the question was first addressed to the Minister!  Since the matter was before the House in the form of motion and amendment thereto, it has been raised in this House on at least five occasions.  It was raised by a question on the 25th April, 1929, and in the course of his reply to that question the President stated that &ldquo;Figures are being compiled, and when the results of the actuarial investigation have been examined by the <Col N="750" /> Departments concerned and by the Executive Council the views of the Government on the whole question will be communicated to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter was again raised in the form of a question on 30th October, 1929, and the reply which was again given by the President was to the effect that the &ldquo;collection of data necessary for the proper consideration of any scheme for the further provision for widows and orphans is still proceeding.  A considerable amount of information has been collected, but some time must elapse before it will be possible to come to any final decision on the matter.&rdquo; In reply to a supplementary question on the same date the President stated that &ldquo;the matter is being expedited as much as possible.&rdquo;  That was on the 30th October, 1929.  The question of widows' and orphans' pensions was again raised in the Dáil on 19th February, 1930, and the Minister for Finance replying on that occasion for the President stated that &ldquo;the present position is that an actuary's report on the whole matter is being obtained and when the report is obtained the question will be considered by the Executive Council.&rdquo;  Again the matter was raised by way of question on the 19th November, 1930, and the Minister for Finance in the course of his reply again stated &ldquo;The investigation of this question has not yet been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter was raised yesterday for the fifth occasion since it was first raised when the motion and the amendment were before the Dáil, and the Minister in the course of his reply stated that it was still under consideration. In reply to a supplementary question the Minister became rather flippant on a very serious subject.  He became flippant not to say discourteous because in reply to a supplementary question he stated that &ldquo;I think that if the inquiry is repeated at regular intervals it may probably result in getting the desired information.&rdquo;  May I point out to the Minister that that reply is both flippant and discourteous?  I do not mind if the Minister is discourteous to me personally because I happen to <Col N="751" /> be a person who is prepared to meet courtesy with courtesy and, if necessary, discourtesy with discourtesy, and at the same time meet flippancy on a serious subject with the contempt which it deserves.  I put it to the Minister why should it be necessary that these questions should be raised at regular intervals in the future in view of the fact that it has been under the consideration of the Minister's Department for two years and three months?  Still, we were told yesterday after two years and three months that the matter is still under consideration.  I want to know from the Minister what is the cause of the delay which has taken place. Have the figures or the statistics been compiled?  If they have not been compiled and instructions had been given two years and three months ago to civil servants to compile them, I suggest it is a slur on the competency of the civil servants.  Speaking generally, I believe that we have competent civil servants, and I believe that it would not have taken that length of time to compile the necessary data.  If they were not compiled in that time, what is the cause of the delay?  Is the delay deliberate on the part of the Executive Council?  I suggest it is.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the Executive Council are at the present time holding the whole matter up. They have not told us what their decision is in regard to the matter. They should have laid that matter before the House.  I would like to know from the Minister now why it is that the statistics, together with the decision of the Executive Council, have not been laid before the House in the shape of a White Paper.  As I have pointed out, a system of widows' and orphans' pensions is already in existence in Britain and the Six Counties.  I suggest that as far as this country is concerned we at least should have as good a system of widows' and orphans' pensions as is in operation in the Six Counties.  I hope the Minister will reply to these points, and let us know what is the cause of the delay. I have mentioned that the matter has <Col N="752" /> been under consideration of the Executive Council for two years and three months.  I would point out to the Minister that even before the motion was discussed in this House it was on the Order Paper for almost a year, so that I would be correct in saving that the matter has been under the consideration of the Executive Council for three years, but neither the data, statistics, nor the decision of the Executive Council have yet been communicated to the House.  When the matter is raised in a serious way the Minister endeavours to treat it in a flippant manner.  I suggest to him that it is not me he is treating in a flippant way, but the widows and orphans of the Free State, who are holding out their hands to the Executive Council to get at least the same treatment as the widows and orphans in other places.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say as to what caused the delay, and when he expects to be able to communicate the decision of the Executive Council to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any more information than I have already given him, and I was endeavouring the other day to point out that the raising of this question five times or fifty times does not really expedite it or help it in any way.  The whole problem is a very big and intricate one, and it has been engaging the attention of the civil servants of the Department of Finance and of the National Health Insurance Commission, who have been in touch with the actuary in regard to the matter. It would not be correct to say that it has been under the consideration of the Executive Council, because the data that would enable the Executive Council to consider the matter are not yet available.  When the various schemes, or, at least, a couple of alternative schemes, have been fully thought out, and when the whole figures in connection with the probable cost have been prepared, the Executive Council will then be in a position to consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council will then be in a position to consider the matter, and to make some recommendation, <Col N="753" /> one way or the other, to the House, and to submit such figures as have been prepared.  We are not in a position to do that yet.  The Deputy may think two years a very long time to deal with such a matter.  It is not a very long time for a matter of this kind, and if the Deputy had gone into the matter very fully he would be aware that it is not a long time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just refer to one point that I omitted to deal with when speaking earlier.  The Executive Council is not holding up the matter, but is anxious to have it dealt with, with all reasonable expedition&mdash;that is, when the matter has been thrashed out sufficiently, and when full data are available to enable the Executive Council to deal with it without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister undertake to expedite the matter as far as he can, because when it was raised first by Deputy T. Murphy we got an undertaking, or what amounted to an undertaking, that certain inquiries would be made and statistics secured which would enable the Executive Council to go into the whole matter fully?  The Minister must know that less important matters, involving nearly as large an expenditure, have been expedited, and when mooted took less than twelve months to become an Act of Parliament.  Surely the question raised by Deputy Cassidy is one of extreme urgency.  The Minister <Col N="754" /> must know also that much of the money provided by way of outdoor relief and for institutions such as industrial schools and orphanages would, if diverted into the channels indicated by Deputy Cassidy, be saved for the State.  I am not going to suggest for a moment that the Minister is not interested. I believe that he possibly is as sympathetic as most of us, and that he is interested in seeing that widows and orphans here will get just as favourable treatment as they do in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I also hope the Minister will give some indication that he will push the matter in his Department, and see that the question raised by Deputy Cassidy is brought to fruition in the near future.  I appreciate the difficulties that there are in a matter of the kind.  We know that we cannot have the demand satisfied in a short time, but, as I have said, matters of less importance have been expedited.  I would ask the Minister to give us even a guess as to the time when the Executive Council will take this matter into serious consideration, with a view to passing the necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that less important matters had been dealt with more rapidly.  That is so.  Less important matters can be dealt with much more easily.  The Executive Council, when the resolution was passed by the Dáil, gave directions for steps to be taken and for figures to be prepared.  From time to time inquiries have been made to see that the matter was being dealt with, as I have said, with all reasonable speed.  I do not want to mislead the House and say that civil servants were told that this was a matter to be treated as one of extreme urgency, for which everything else was to be laid aside.  I did not intend to take that view or to take such steps.  There are certain things, such, for instance, as revenue matters, that have to be dealt with in a limited period.  For instance, the examination of the Estimates in my Department is a matter of urgency and, at this period of the year, everything else has to be laid aside to enable the Estimates to be dealt with.  No matter what the other work might be, it <Col N="755" /> would be left aside to have the Estimates dealt with.  We have not told civil servants to lay aside other work and treat this matter as the Estimates would be treated during, say, the months of January and February.  On the other hand they have been asked to deal with it as rapidly as they can, that is to deal with it as an important <Col N="756" /> matter.  I am anxious to have it dealt with on that basis&mdash;as an important matter of considerable urgency&mdash;but not as one of those urgent matters for which all other sorts of work must be laid aside.</P>
