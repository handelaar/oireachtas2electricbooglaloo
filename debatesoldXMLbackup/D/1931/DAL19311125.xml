      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of claims for Dáil Loan payments that do not appear to have been registered received from the old parliamentary divisions of West and South Cork, and the steps he proposes to take with a view to disposing satisfactorily of such cases, in many of which strong local evidence of payment is available and in some cases has been furnished to his Department.</P>

      <P>The preparation in an exact form of the information asked for by the Deputy in the first part of the question would involve an amount of labour which, in my opinion, would not be justified.  I may say, however, that only a very small proportion of the subscriptions received in the Dáil Eireann Department of Finance from the former parliamentary constituencies of West and South Cork has not been registered, but the applications which have been received in respect of the unregistered subscriptions appear to exceed the amount available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, all claims in respect of which satisfactory evidence has been furnished are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  In a number of cases the applicants have failed to substantiate their claims and accordingly I am not at present in a position to authorise repayment in respect of <Col N="1986" /> these.  My Department is in communication with collectors and others with a view to obtaining reliable lists of subscribers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to state the specific obligations of the Electricity Supply Board under the Electricity Supply Acts to which the Minister called the attention of the Electricity Supply Board, as stated by him in the Dáil on November 11th, and, further, if the Minister will lay on the Table of the House the correspondence in which he called the attention of the Electricity Supply Board to these obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he informed or in any way intimated to the Electricity Supply Board as his opinion that the Electricity Supply Board were obliged by the Electricity Supply Acts to provide not only a sinking fund but also a depreciation or renewal fund, and, if so, to what amount and on what legal or other advice the Minister acted in so defining the obligations of the Electricity Supply Board, and, further, to name the section of the Act imposing such obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to questions 4 and 5 together.  The effect of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, in Sections 14, 15 and 21, is to require the board to repay advances in such manner as may be determined by the Minister for Finance and to make such provision as the board may think proper for reserve fund, extensions, renewals, depreciation, loans and other like purposes.  I inquired as to the intentions of the board in respect of these matters, but have not otherwise defined its obligations.  I have not yet decided that any correspondence between myself and the board should be laid on the Table.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to state (a) the amount chargeable to date by the Great Southern Railways in connection with or arising out of the Drumm Battery and Drumm Battery experimental trains; (b) the cost of <Col N="1989" /> crection and equipping of charging stations, and whether these costs were included in the figures already given of money spent to date, and if he can state the total cost to date under all heads, such figure to include all items, whether paid, unpaid, or not yet requested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy in the first instance to the figures given to him in reply to his question of 18th November, 1931. These figures referred only to expenditure by and liabilities of Celia, Ltd., and, therefore, did not include any item for charging stations.</P>
      <P>In a previous statement to the Dáil on the 22nd November, 1930, I referred to payments by way of indemnity that might have to be given to the Great Southern Railways Company.  No claim by way of indemnity has as yet been made by the Railways Company. While I am not aware of the exact amount of the possible claims, I have been informed that in amount they will not exceed the sum mentioned by me in my statement referred to above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that even the accounts for 1929/30 are not 20 months overdue.  The Deputy obviously is going on the impossible assumption that accounts are ready for presentation the day after the financial year has ended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might at least be good enough to save Deputies putting down additional questions by indicating when he hopes to be able to present a particular year's accounts and permit time for discussion of the accounts already presented to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not definitely made up his mind as to the accounts he really means.  A year and a half ago I told the Deputy that <Col N="1991" /> a day for the discussion of accounts can always be got by making an approach through the usual channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an approach last week by way of a question to the President.  Would not that be considered a proper method of approach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be considered a proper method of approach, but the subject was improperly raised. The Deputy now indicates that he wants to discuss accounts that have been in the hands of members of the Dáil for at least eighteen months. The mere fact that eighteen months have elapsed since the accounts were circulated is surely sufficient indication that the House does not want to discuss them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there has not been a discussion on the 1929/30 accounts is certainly not the fault of the House.  No opportunity has been given for discussion.  As regards the 1930/31 accounts, if a period of eighteen months elapses before they are submitted for discussion, I hope the Minister will not take that as an indication that Deputies are not anxious to have them considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never have taken it in that light, but I must take into consideration the time in which the accounts have been in the hands of Deputies and no question was raised upon them.  That is a totally different question from the question of delay in presenting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that because he is not asked in what he deems to be an appropriate manner, he is entitled to refuse a discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not refuse a discussion that was never asked. The mere fact that a discussion was not asked is surely proof that it was not required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a second time.  The Bill contains a number of rather technical provisions, but the purpose and the main principle of it are fairly simple.  The purpose is to avoid a danger, which is very serious, of railway valuations on revision being reduced to nil if the law remains as at present.  It is a very long time since some of the railways were revalued. I think it is 50 years since the section which constituted the Midland Great Western Railway was revalued.  Although some lines have been revalued in more recent times, no difficulty arose with the present system until a great decline in the prosperity of railway undertakings commenced in comparatively recent times.  In 1925 the railways applied for revision of their <Col N="2005" /> valuation, and we were immediately faced with very considerable difficulty. It became apparent at that time that the present formula could not remain. The Valuation Office made a rather rough revaluation of the railways, and they allowed certain percentage reductions. The Minister for Local Government did not consent to any rating authority contesting the ratings or appealing against any new valuation, because at that time it was apparent that there was not any satisfactory material for a thorough revaluation on the present basis.  It was also apparent that there were large sections of lines on which the valuation would probably be wiped out altogether.  The railways at the time, in consideration of the attitude taken up, agreed to cooperate with us in elaborating a new basis for valuation.  It was very difficult to get ahead.  Meantime, as a matter of fact, a similar problem confronted the authorities in Great Britain, and finally last year an Act was passed which represented that cooperation and, in a large measure, agreement between the railway companies and the various other interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill follows to a large extent the Act passed in Great Britain, except that we have introduced the principle of minimum valuation which was not incorporated in the British Act.  That minimum valuation is necessary because if it were not in the Bill you might have it that although the railway system as a whole was not by any means reduced to nil there could be sections of lines in respect of which the valuation would be nil.  The valuation is determined on the basis defined in Section XI of the Valuation Act, 1852: &ldquo;an estimate of the net annual value thereof; that is to say, the rent for which, one year with another, the same might in its actual state be reasonably expected to let from year to year, the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance, and other expenses (if any) necessary to maintain the hereditament in its actual state, and all rates, taxes and public charges, if any, (except Tithe Rent charge) being paid by the tenant.&rdquo;  That is, the <Col N="2006" /> basis of all valuation is the rent at which the hereditament might be let. The Act, of course, applied to railway undertakings as to all other hereditaments.  An estimate had to be made on the basis of a landlord owning and running the line and the railway buildings and letting them to a hypothetical tenant.  The basis adopted was to take the net annual receipts and to deduct from the net annual receipts an allowance in respect of renewals and a further allowance in respect of the tenant's capital which went towards the creation of those receipts.  For a very long time&mdash;fifty or sixty years&mdash;that practice has been established and very generous allowances have been given in respect of tenant's capital.  Of course, the allowance on the tenant's capital extends to rolling stock of all descriptions, workmen's tools, to the chairs in the offices, to everything except the actual fixtures and fixed plant, which was allowed for in another way.  In respect of tenant's capital the allowance in no case was less than 10 per cent., and it was very often as much as 17½ per cent.; the average was something like 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The railways have reached the position at present that if a revision were carried out in the ordinary way, if the net receipts for the year were taken, and if a fair deduction was made from them in respect of renewals of permanent way and all fixed plant, and if a further deduction was made from the net annual receipts in respect of tenants' capital at the rate of 15 per cent., which is the average, the valuation in some districts would be not only nil, but there would be a position where, if everything were carried out logically, there ought to be a minus valuation. It is quite clear that if revisions were carried out generally now there would be in respect of some systems in some districts a nil valuation.  If the total valuation came to be distributed over the railway lines there would be in respect of many sections a nil valuation. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that a change is necessary.</P>
    <P>I might say that it is regarded as certain that it would not be possible in the courts to get a change made in <Col N="2007" /> the percentage allowances for tenants' capital because the matter is so well and so long settled that the courts would not make a change.  This Bill proposes to make quite a number of changes.  For instance, it provides for a quinquennial valuation so that we cannot have the position that existed in regard to the Midland Great Western section, where for over 50 years there was no general revision.  In the past a general revision could only take place if it were asked for by the railway company or asked for by the rating authorities through whose areas the line passed.  Take the case of the Great Northern line.  The Dublin County Council could not have got a general re-valuation of the Great Northern line.  It could only have contested the division of the valuation. It might have contended that it should have got more than the County Meath or other counties got, but it could not have obtained a general revision of valuation of the undertaking.  The railway companies naturally did not ask for a general revision except at a time when they thought they were likely to get a reduction.  We provide that in future every five years the railway undertaking as a whole shall be re-valued and that will prevent the position where it is being under-valued seriously or over-valued seriously.</P>
    <P>We provide that the Commissioner of Valuation and any courts to whom an appeal may in future be made &ldquo;shall not be bound to give effect to any custom or practice affecting the valuation of railway hereditaments which obtained prior to the passing of this Act in regard to the deduction or allowance to be made in respect of the capital of a tenant, but shall have regard to all relevant circumstances.&rdquo; That is, we are removing the obligation on the Commissioner of Valuation and the courts to have regard to the practice of fixing an allowance for tenant's capital at an average, as it has been, of 15 per cent.  We also provide&mdash;and it is not in the British Act&mdash; that there shall be a minimum valuation, so that even if the condition of the railway undertakings were to become worse than it is, we could not <Col N="2008" /> have the position where there would be nil valuations generally, even on the new basis.  The minimum valuation will be, so far as the running line is concerned, the agricultural land value. On station buildings and other non-running line hereditaments the minimum valuation will be one-third of the 1914 valuation; so that in no circumstances, no matter what happens to railway profits, can any county council receive with respect to the running line through that county less than the agricultural land valuation, and no district in which there are stations and similar buildings situate can have rates based on any valuation less than one-third of the 1914 valuation.  That provision is put in because as long as the railway line is operating it must be assumed, whether there are profits or not, that the railway company is in beneficial occupation of the various hereditaments, and consequently should make a contribution to the rates.  It seems to us that that meets the situation fairly.  If there are small profits, or if there are no profits, it allows the railway undertaking a substantial reduction of valuation, and allows the total value of its property to be relatively low.  On the other hand, it assures the local authorities that they will always have what, in effect, will be a substantial contribution to the rates from the various railway companies.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may ask why, in respect of buildings, we are taking one-third of the 1914 valuation rather than the whole of the 1914 valuation.  It is true that a factory owner or a shopkeeper will have to pay on his whole valuation whether he makes any profits or not.  The position of the railway company is different.  If a shopkeeper has two shops, or a shop and a store, or if a man has two factories situate in different places, if profits were small or non-existent, or if business were bad he might close one of them, and in many cases might escape a proportion of the rates.  He might dispose of the premises in various ways if there were no profits, and he could not actually close them.  The railway company is carrying out a public service, and is not really free, to a considerable extent <Col N="2009" /> to close without serious inconvenience to the public.  It is felt that this provision of minimum valuation, taking everything into account, is an entirely reasonable proposal.  It really has this effect, that it is imposing on the railways a liability which at present does not exist.  If a railway company is now making no profits on the existing basis, and re-valuation goes through, that railway company can obtain a nil valuation.  We are taking away the possibility of that nil valuation.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need refer to the considerable number of points of detail in the Bill.  There is only one other thing I will say, that the railway companies have only been dissuaded from proceeding with an application for re-valuation in the present year, because they were informed that this Bill would be introduced.  I think this Bill will probably give them some reduction in their total valuation in each case.  It is not absolutely certain that it will do that, but, I think it is most probable that it will give some reduction. I would not say that the reduction will be very striking.  They were given a certain reduction in 1925, and I am not sure that the further reduction will be very appreciable. However, we have to have regard to the principle, and the principle is that of basing the new valuation on the net receipts, calculated as prescribed in the Bill.  The Commissioner of Valuation and the courts shall be no longer bound to give enormous allowances in respect of tenant's capital, which has been the practice heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, this is a very technical Bill. It is one of these Bills that Deputies in opposition have to take largely on trust.  We have got to assume that it will have the effect that the Minister says it will have.  I take it from the Minister's speech, and from what I could gather by reading the Bill, that the intended effect of it is to permit of some reduction of the valuation of railways for rating purposes, but that it will not permit of their valuation for rating being reduced to nil. We were given to understand by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2010" /> that the whole railway position is under review by the Government and that proposals for legislation in that respect are likely to be introduced. If that is so, should not this Bill form part of these proposals or be withheld until these proposals have been submitted to and discussed by the Dáil? Someone said, and rightly said, that we are getting the transport policy of the Government delivered to us backwards. Any ordinary person thinking of a revision of the transport policy would suggest that the main outlines of the proposal would be the first thing that should be submitted, and that the detailed proposals should follow.  Instead of that we are getting the Traffic Bill firstly, and this Bill secondly, while the main proposals have not been submitted or any indication of their nature suggested.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that this Bill is urgent. If it is not urgent it should be withheld until the main transport proposals of the Government are submitted to the Dáil and discussed, so that we will know exactly along what lines the Government propose to proceed.  The Government's mind is closed in that direction.  It is possible that there will be considerable changes in respect of transport policy in the future.  A number of us believe that such changes are urgently needed, in which case the position in respect of valuation for rating of railways may be so altered that the Bill would not be necessary. I would like the Minister to give us some information as to why this Bill is introduced at this stage, before the Transport Bill has been introduced to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  The question of railway ratings and valuations has been occupying the attention of the local authorities for three or four years.  Those of us who have been associated with local authorities know that for the past five or six years there has been a reduction of the amount of rates payable by the railway companies with the result that the local authorities were seriously handicapped.  The losses incurred by the local authorities in respect of railway rates had to be borne by the other <Col N="2011" /> ratepayers.  It was very difficult for some of us to understand this Bill before the Minister had made his Second Reading speech.  The first part of the Bill, providing that valuations in respect of railway property cannot be reduced below a certain point, will be welcome to the local authorities. Like Deputy Lemass, one wonders why a Bill of this kind is introduced now, having regard to the promise that a Transport Bill will be introduced in the near future.  This is a Bill that will require careful consideration in Committee. The local authorities have suffered already in respect of the reduction of railway valuations and we do not desire that they should suffer more under this Bill.  As regards railway stations, one wonders why dwellings attached to railway stations should be entitled to a reduction of valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat surprising that the Minister when outlining the proposals of this Bill, did not give the House more details in regard to the Transport Bill which is to be introduced later.  For a considerable time, railway companies have been complaining of the amount of rates they have to pay.  It is well known that railway companies are, to a certain extent, handicapped in this respect.  A railway company has to pay rates to the county council of every county through which their line passes.  The greater part of the money which the railway companies pay in this way is devoted, in most cases, to the upkeep of the roads.  That is tantamount to the subsidising by the railway companies of their greatest competitors&mdash;the bus companies and the companies controlling heavy lorry traffic.  This Bill is comparable with the curate's egg.  It is good in parts, both in respect to the county councils and the railways.  It is provided that even if the railway companies are run at a loss they will have to pay a certain amount of rates to the county councils.  Those rates will go in great <Col N="2012" /> part to the upkeep of the roads.  In the constituency I represent, the Donegal Railway Company, although it made a comparatively small profit, had to pay during the past year about £1,000 to the Donegal County Council. Portion of that money ultimately went to the upkeep of the roads.</P>
      <P>It is provided in this Bill that there will have to be a revaluation every five years.  What is the Minister's idea as regards that?  If the Minister finds that the railway companies are in a better position than now at the end of the first five years, will he introduce amending legislation?  I was glad to hear that the valuation of railway station buildings will be one-third of the 1914 figure, but I was surprised to hear the Minister tell Deputy Corish that stationmasters' houses on railways will not come under that provision of the Bill.  I think the Minister should regard these stationmasters' houses as part of the station buildings, because in remote parts of the country it is essential, where a railway company has a station, to provide a house for the stationmaster.  For the purpose of rating, the stationmaster's house should be regarded as part of the station building, and I hope that in Committee the Minister will agree to that suggestion.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I understood the Minister to say that the minimum valuation would be one-third of the 1914 land valuation.  I am not clear whether that applies to buildings in urban areas&mdash;whether the houses, stores and station premises in urban districts will come under that provision as regards the land valuation, and whether the valuation and rates of these districts will be materially altered by this proposal.</P>

      <P>The Minister made quite an understandable case for the Bill, provided things were normal in the railway world.  I agree with Deputy Lemass in hoping that the Minister will postpone the further stages of this Bill until we see the Transport Bill.  What is to be the position under this Bill if the Transport Bill gives the railway companies power to close down branch <Col N="2013" /> lines or sections of their lines?  Deputy Lemass hit the nail on the head when he said that the Government, in these matters, were moving in a backward direction.  If the Minister is to state the transport policy to the House before the adjournment or before the next general election, I think that should be done first and that this Bill should be postponed until we see the measure which will disclose the Government's transport policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry that the Minister did not deal in greater detail with this Bill.  The Bill was ordered to be printed on 10th July, 1931, but it was only placed in the hands of Deputies during the past week or ten days.  It is exceedingly hard to get a grip of its provisions.  In Part 2, Rule 2, reference is made to railway districts.  Towards the end of Part 2, in Rule 7, there is a reference to the rating of the Great Northern Railway Company, which says &ldquo;In relation to the district which is part of the undertaking of the Great Northern Railway Company.&rdquo;  I cannot find in the Bill any definition of &ldquo;railway district.&rdquo;  So far as the Great Southern Railways are concerned, they seem to be fairly well covered by Tables 1 and 2, because all the areas covered by the Great Southern Railways, or lines associated with them, are definitely allocated to districts.  I have had to read the Bill rather hurriedly, and I have not been able to find any section or clause defining a &ldquo;railway district.&rdquo;  I do not see, therefore, how Rule 7 can be construed in relation to the Great Northern Railway undertaking.  In regard to Table 1, in which the valuation is to be allocated over the several railway districts, I should like to know whether there has been any negotiation with the local authorities concerned as to the manner in which the various parts of the railway undertaking will be allocated to those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite obviously their interests will be significantly affected according to the way in which the allocation is made, whether the allocation is as a result of agreement with the railway <Col N="2014" /> company only, or whether the local authorities have been consulted.  I think it is important that we should have some information on that point. In connection with the proposal in the Bill to fix the minimum valuation on running lines at the agricultural value of the land over which the lines run, and to grant to the railway companies a concession of one-third on the 1914 valuation in relation to non-running hereditaments, I would like to know whether, before that minimum value was determined, the Minister had any understanding with the railway companies as to the new allowances that will be made under Section 5, sub-section (2).</P>
    <P>Upon the Minister's own showing, the allowances which have hitherto been made have been altogether excessive. That naturally will have to be taken into consideration now in regard to any concession which we make to the railway companies.  If the position is that over a considerable number of years they have enjoyed unwarranted allowances not only in regard to the rates payable to local authorities but also in regard to a number of other things, I think most people will say that certainly over a considerable period of years pre-war the finances of the railway companies were not administered as carefully or as economically as they should have been.  In view of a number of things which we all know, such as the unnecessary building of railway stations and the manner in which lines were laid out in a considerable number of places, if the position now is that the railway companies have got into rather low water I think we ought to be very careful before, first of all, we grant them a concession vis-a-vis their other competitors in transport, the canals and the omnibuses, and also vis-a-vis the local authorities to whom they properly pay rates.</P>
    <P>On the case which the Minister has made I am not certain that sub-section (2) of Section 5 is one that ought to appeal to the House.  I think we ought to be much more definite in prescribing the lines on which the valuation commissioner will proceed when making a re-valuation of the railways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> The present sub-section does mean that he is not going to be bound by the precedent with regard to excessive allowances.  It does not bind him in any way, but it still leaves him, I think, far too much discretion in regard to the allowances which he may make, and for that reason I think the sub-section would need to be more precise than it is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for urgency is simply this, that if this or some other Bill of the kind is not passed to take their present rights from the railway companies, then the law will take its course and the valuations in many cases will be reduced to nil. The Bill is absolutely necessary.  Up to this the railway companies have been held back from making application for revision because discussions with regard to this Bill were in progress. We informed them that we would introduce the Bill as soon as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised to introduce a Transport Bill before the adjournment of the House for Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite different from this problem of railway valuation for rating purposes.  We kept the railway companies from exercising their ordinary rights for a couple of years because we informed them that a Bill would be introduced as soon as possible. We got general agreement amongst the railway companies with regard to the principle of the Bill. The railway companies in June last made application to the rating authorities for a revision.  If this Bill is not passed, or some Bill to take their present rights from them, they naturally will exercise them.  The revision will be carried out by the commissioner of valuation.  If they are not satisfied, then there will be the usual appeals. The result of that may be that <Col N="2016" /> the valuations will be unreasonably reduced.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Cassidy, the provisions of this Bill will not in any way apply to stationmasters' houses, hotels, or anything that is not strictly necessary for the carrying on of the undertaking.  It may be a great convenience to the railway companies, or to their employees in many cases to have houses, but they are not strictly necessary for the carrying on of the undertaking. This Bill will apply only to the things that are absolutely necessary: the running lines, the station buildings, signal cabins, and things like that.  Deputy Hogan asked me whether it is the value of agricultural land that will be the minimum value in the case of a running line in towns.  It is not.  There will be a valuation that will approximate to a ground rent valuation in the case of a running line in an urban district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is going to be a differentiation as between urban and rural districts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the rural districts the value of agricultural land will be the minimum value, and, as I have stated, in the case of urban districts and towns the valuation will approximate to the ground rent valuation. Deputy MacEntee asked where the Great Northern district was brought in in the Bill.  It is brought in in Section 7, on page 10, where the percentage is fixed at 27.3.  In the case of the Great Southern Railways there are various percentages, which are set out in Table 1. These percentages are based roughly on the existing position which represents the position when things were fairly normal.  There must be great differences in the valuations which will be allotted on buildings on some lines as compared with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, on the line running from Harcourt Street to Bray and from Westland Row to Bray there is a great number of stations and of station buildings, having regard to the mileage of the line.  Consequently a much higher percentage must be allocated <Col N="2017" /> to buildings or to non-running line hereditaments on a section like that as compared with what would be allotted in the case of a line where there are very few and inexpensive stations.  This represents the position as it has been up to date.  It is not proposed to change the existing distribution of valuation as between a running line and non-running line hereditaments.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after every 30th day of June and every 31st day of December, <Col N="2019" /> after the passing of this Act lay on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas a report containing particulars of every lease for a term exceeding two years actually made under this Part of this Act during the six months ending on such 30th day of June and 31st day of December respectively.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment that was promised to give the Dáil certain notice after the event with regard to leases that have been made.  I call attention to two different points in it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We adopted the course deliberately of leaving it to the Commission and to the Executive Council, to say whether or not a restriction order would apply to samples. We do not say &ldquo;shall not ever&rdquo; and we equally want to avoid having to say that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and it arises to a certain extent from considerations that have been argued in relation to this country and also to many others that have been argued outside the country. The economic organisation of the League of Nations have had their attention directed for many years past to what they consider to be certain unfair types of discrimination attached to goods in different ways.  They attempted to clarify the situation and find out whether there are devices of a certain type and certain secret and hidden types of subsidy.  They tried to clear the ground so as to get directly down to these things.  In clearing the ground they ran up against this matter of samples and it has been the experience even of countries which are opposed to the economic policy that is favoured by the League of Nations in the main that generally speaking the imposing of handicaps upon samples is a thing which should not be done or at any rate, if done, that it should be confined within very narrow limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an expression of opinion on the part of the economic organisation of the League that travellers' samples in particular should be left outside whatever restrictions should be put upon goods for sale.  We do not want to go to the point of saying that nowhere <Col N="2022" /> will there be a possibility that travellers' samples will be subjected to a restriction order.  We take the midway course.  If the Commissioners think there is likely to be any abuse of the travellers' samples, then they can say, &ldquo;Very good, the restriction order will apply,&rdquo; but we want to leave them to the Executive Council's discretion, so that in the main we can meet the objection put up, that a rather indiscriminate and doubtful kind of procedure can be adopted with regard to the samples that may be brought in as such.  We therefore take the midway course to leave it to the Commission to make the recommendation, and we leave it to the Executive Council to have the case presented as to whether or not the restriction order shall apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not thinking of the restrictions order being abused and of samples getting in in consequence. I was thinking of the inconvenience to traders.  A trader may not be aware that a certain restriction order may be in force.  If samples are offered to him by a commercial traveller which did not bear the indication of origin, which imported goods will be required to bear, it may not occur to him that they must be delivered bearing this indication of origin and that they may be of less value than he contemplated when inspecting the samples.  If it is desired, for the convenience of commercial travellers, that certain privileges should be given or certain exemptions made, well and good.  But I think these travellers should be required, when offering these goods for sale, to give verbal or other representations to the potential customer to the effect that this restriction order was in force, and that the goods on importation or when offered for sale must bear the indication of origin required by the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is going to be obviated.  At least, if Deputy Lemass's amendment is passed it is going to increase the delay, because it means that samples are to be labelled and subjected to the same order.  Ordinarily speaking, samples can be identified easily enough by the manner in which they are brought in.  On the precise point which Deputy Lemass raised he has to bear in mind that samples may be used as samples not merely in this country but in other countries, and it will be putting rather a burden on traders who are dealing here and elsewhere to ask them that certain samples when brought in must have attached to them certain marks of origin that will not be required in other countries.  As to the point that traders ought to know, we take it, on the whole, that it is a trader's business to keep himself vigilant and active as to orders issued from time to time; and as to the orders issued, it is hardly right that restrictions should bear so heavily on certain traders' samples that the importers should have a warning; but that, I suggest to the Deputy, is rather a different point.  If the Deputy at some other stage makes a suggestion for a provision, say, imposing upon commercial travellers who are coming here with samples that they should state to their would-be customers that certain marks are enforced on the goods for sale, we could consider it, but I think when the amendment is put down that the Deputy will see the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says it is only a question of where one puts the emphasis.  The clause sets forth that a restriction on sale order shall not, unless the order provides that the goods to which such order applies shall bear an indication of origin at the time of exposure for sale wholesale, extend to the case of the exposure for sale wholesale by a person who is a wholesale dealer.</P>
      <P>We do think that the Commission would have before it an order; the Commission would have before it also the scope of the order.  They would have to single out precisely whether it is to apply to the exposure for sale wholesale or whether it shall not, and we think it puts the burden upon them of considering the wholesaler's case.  It puts more precisely on them to say that it shall not apply unless they say affirmatively that it shall.  We think the Commission must, under the clause as it stands, face up definitely and say is this to extend to the wholesaler and that they must consider the wholesaler's case.  We want to put the Commission up against two terms of reference.  Is it to apply or is it not?  It will not apply unless they say affirmatively that it shall. There is not much in it.</P>

      <P>In connection with that matter, has the Minister borne in mind that there are certain shops in the country where the wholesale and retail <Col N="2026" /> business are done in the same premises, where the goods are intermixed and where the owner can say, &ldquo;These are for wholesale only&rdquo; and vice versa?  It seems to me that in many cases a distinction between wholesale and retail will be very difficult to establish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) If, where a restriction order has been made with respect to goods, representations are made to the Executive Council by persons appearing to have a substantial interest in the matter that the application of the provisions of such order to any particular class or description of those goods has caused or is likely to cause injury or hardship to those persons, or any of them, or make an application for the revocation of such order, the Executive Council may refer to the Commission for their consideration the question whether the restriction order should be amended in accordance with such representations or be revoked and the Commission shall report to the Executive Council on such question.</P>
      <P>(2) When the Commission reports in favour of amending or revoking a restriction order the Executive Council may make an order amending or revoking (as the case may be) such restriction order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is, in fact, consequential on what I have been saying previously in connection with this Bill. The Bill, as it stands, provides that applications for restriction orders must be made by persons representative of those engaged in the manufacture or sale of the goods concerned.  They apply to the Executive Minister, and <Col N="2027" /> that Executive Minister may refer their application to the Commission, which then reports to the Executive Council, and upon their report the order is made.  There is long and elaborate procedure set up to secure that restriction orders will be made.  The Bill provides a very rapid method by which a restriction order may be amended or removed.  We think that the procedure should be the reverse, that there should be every facility given to persons engaged in any trade or business in getting a restriction order put into operation, but that such restriction order should not be amended or revoked unless positive application was made by the persons affected, and that that application be reported on by the Commission.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the procedure set forth here in this Bill will be deleted, and that, instead of an order being amended or revoked in which persons claiming to be affected by it or suffering hardship in consequence of it have made application, the Minister should have that application referred to, considered by, and reported on by the Merchandise Marks Commission.  The Minister has, I think, undertaken to consider the suggestion that the Executive Council should have power of its own initiative to refer applications to the Commission, or to refer questions relating to the making of orders to the Commission. If that was accepted there would be a case for giving the Executive Council similar powers in respect of the revocation or amendment of the order.  If we are going to have definite restrictions placed upon the manner in which orders are to be secured, we think that similar restrictions should, at least, operate upon the manner in which orders are revoked or amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, I want to make a case for the retention of Section 11 as it stands.  The Deputy <Col N="2028" /> has, I think, failed to appreciate the distinction we make between an exemption order when a restriction order has been made and the revocation or amendment of a restriction order.  We intend the exemption order to be one made on behalf of individuals and in urgent cases.  We want, in other words, first to safeguard against an order which has been made after consideration both by the Commission and the Executive Council, and just on the morrow of the making of the order people making a good case may be excluded by a certain small amendment of the order.  If they are injured, and if it is not in the interests of the State that they should be injured, then we give the power to the Executive Council in these peculiar circumstances to make an exemption order, and having done that they must refer the exemption order that they decide to make to the Commission.  The Commission afterwards may say, &ldquo;Take out that exemption order,&rdquo; or they may otherwise amend their own restriction order previously passed, so as to get it into accord with the exemption. That is on the basis of urgency. Apart from that, completely distinct from it, we want to have revocation and amending of restriction orders, and those two things go through exactly the same procedure as the original restriction order.  The revocation and amendment of restriction orders say that the Executive Council may revoke or amend a restriction order:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Executive Council proposes to revoke or amend a restriction order they shall, unless the proposed amendment has been referred to the Commission in pursuance of the immediately preceding section, first refer the question of the proposed revocation or amendment to the Commission, who shall report thereon.  The Executive Council shall not revoke or amend a restriction order until they have considered the report of the Commission in relation to the proposed revocation or amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to have the procedure with regard to the making of the original <Col N="2029" /> restriction order, and the amendment or revocation of that, on the same lines, but we do want in between to have some other power to meet an emergency case.  Cases might suddenly arise, and we would have to act on the emergency, afterwards referring back to the Commission. Reference back might mean either the removal or going on with the old restriction order, the removal of the exemption order, or that the original restriction order should be amended in certain particulars.  Although it is hard to say at this moment whether there will be any big number of cases coming under this section, we think it wise to have power there.  It may happen in the interests of a trade that they want to have that particular power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister intend to give the power to make representation to persons outside the country? Does he not think that if he amended the third line of Section 11, by inserting &ldquo;citizens of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; it would possibly save himself and the Commission a lot of trouble?  If he leaves it as it stands he may have a lot of representations from people outside the country.  I take it that &ldquo;persons appearing to have a substantial interest&rdquo; should be persons within the country.</P>

      <P>That would definitely be the intention.  I want to say that the particular gap that the Deputy has shown is blocked also in the original application for the restriction order.  Certainly, with regard to Section 11, the intention was to have reference to persons in the country. I am not sure that the phrase &ldquo;citizens of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; would meet the point.  There might be people who would have substantial interests in the country, and whose trade would be of substantial interest to the nationals of the country, but who themselves would not be nationals or citizens.  The point the Deputy has made is a good one, and that is a matter that will have to be attended to.  The intention is clear.</P>

If a person is not entitled to be heard, they can rule him out.  With regard to the point about people who may have substantial interests not being heard, it is quite conceivable that <Col N="2031" /> the Commission may get to a point where they would have heard as much evidence as they would require in order to cover the ground that ought to be covered, and it would not be necessary for them to hear further evidence even though it might be the evidence of people substantially interested. They might decide that they would not need any further evidence. I think, however, that cases of that sort would be so rare that it is scarcely necessary to consider them.</P>

      <P>I really do not know what can be suggested.  This section sets out that reports made by the Commission shall be laid upon the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy wants to add that, on a report being presented to the House, the Minister should put down a resolution approving or disapproving of it.  Under a similar type of legislation in England I know that at least seventy orders have been issued; seventy orders that were accepted were issued. It is quite likely that there would be applications for at least forty or fifty orders here during the first six or nine months of this legislation.  Supposing there were twelve such orders rejected, would it mean that there would be a dozen resolutions brought in by the Minister disapproving of the report of the Commission?</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 10:</P>
      <P>Before Section 20 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) From and after the expiration of six months from the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful for any person to import into Saorstát Eireann any goods, or to sell or expose for sale either retail or wholesale or to distribute by way of advertisement (whether such advertisement relates to the goods distributed or to other goods) any imported goods, to which there is applied within the meaning of Section 5 of the Principal Act, either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(b) any mark, description or sign which might reasonably be mistaken as indicating that such goods were produced or manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>(2)  The previous sub-section shall not apply to any goods bearing the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann which is a trade description lawfully and generally applied to such goods.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment raises one of the major issues arising in this Bill.  The Act provides that it shall not be lawful to sell or expose for sale imported goods bearing the name of a manufacturer, a trader or a dealer, the trade <Col N="2034" /> mark of such a person, or a trade mark calculated to deceive, or the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann unless such goods bear, at the same time, the indication of origin. The case I put to the Dáil on Second Reading, and that I want to repeat now, was that goods bearing the name of an Irish district, place or area, or a mark, design or emblem calculated to create the impression that the goods were of Irish origin, should not be imported at all, whether they bear an indication of origin or not.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the practice of attaching various types of names and marks to imported goods in order to deceive as to their place of origin is widespread.  To some extent the provisions of the Bill requiring that the goods shall bear a clear indication of the place of origin will deal with the evil, but it is our view that it is much better to kill the practice altogether.  Our opinion is that the goods coming here shall not be marked in any way likely to create a wrong impression as to the place of origin. We do not want to have Shamrock shovels or St. Patrick's flour, or anything of that nature, imported as in the past.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this amendment is very perfect, and that it is as good as anything the draftsman's office might produce.  It possesses, however, the idea that I am anxious the Dáil will consider, and I would like to see it accepted in principle.  On the Second Reading we discussed the difficulty likely to be created by the fact that certain classes of goods were described in the trade throughout the world by names originating in certain towns and districts here, such as Balbriggan hosiery, Limerick hams, and other names of that kind.  I would like, if possible, that we should be able to prevent the use of these terms in respect of goods not produced in this country.  Having examined the matter it is quite obvious there are considerable difficulties in that connection.</P>
    <P>
      <i>[An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, there may be goods manufactured in this <Col N="2035" /> country and exported, bearing trade descriptions which originated in place names in other countries.  I decided to include in the amendment that such names, if regular trade descriptions, would not come under the ban which I propose.  The amendment is limited in effect to the use of the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann, or to any mark, description or sign which might reasonably be mistaken as indicating that such goods were manufactured here.  That is that it was calculated to create the impression that the goods were produced in this country.  I mentioned on the Second Reading the particular difficulty that I foresaw.  We might require that the imports of flour, or shovels, or hams should bear an indication of the country of origin.  I mentioned the possibility of the origin of the goods being printed on them in the Irish language.  In the earlier parts of the Bill, in respect to goods to which restriction orders apply, the form of indication of origin was described to the Executive Council by the Merchandise Marks Commission.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of this Bill the form is what is prescribed here, and there is a definite indication of the country of origin, that is the country in which the goods were produced and manufactured.  If that indication is given in the Irish language, and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent its being so given, then quite obviously that may have a bigger effect in deceiving the intended purchaser than a particular trade mark attached to the goods.</P>
    <P>The best and simplest procedure to adopt in relation to such goods is that they should be definitely excluded from being imported into this country and that after six months such of them as are in the country should be debarred from being offered for sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that it would be easy to apply this amendment in the case of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann, but there would be a considerable difficulty in applying it to any mark, description or sign.  We cannot claim to have the <Col N="2036" /> sole use of the harp and we are not the only nation in the world that has round towers.  There is only one Blarney tweed and there would be very little use in an advertiser suggesting that you could get goods as good as the Blarney goods.  I can quite suggest the name of a place or district being applied, but let us take for instance &ldquo;Slainte match&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Slainte boot.&rdquo;  That would be Irish enough and yet I do not suggest that we should have the sole copyright in that word.  I suggest that Deputy Lemass finish his amendment at (a) and not include &ldquo;any mark, description or sign.&rdquo;  That would be more acceptable and more workable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most difficult section in the Bill, and the amendment now proposed would definitely add to the difficulty of administration. I am not sure that it would carry us any further than what is in the Bill already.  Remember that this Bill must be read with the Principal Act, the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887.  It is very difficult to explain the complete repercussions of Section 20 plus the Act of 1887, and the precise way in which the provisions of that Act are disturbed by amendments or rather by groups of amendments which we have down here to Section 20 of the Bill, because we will have to take all of them together.  I would like first of all to segregate these a little bit.  One has in all this matter to pay attention to certain items and to keep them distinct and clear.  One of the amendments is dealing with the selling of goods and another with the importing of goods.  Then there is another dealing with advertising certain types of goods that are brought under whatever the heading is.  Then there are classifications made here and in the section.  Goods which bear the name of a place, and which according to the Bill bear the name of a manufacturer, trader or dealer in Saorstát Eireann; or the trade mark of any such person as is mentioned, or a device so closely resembling such trade mark as to be calculated to deceive, and finally, the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> Are these goods of whatever class to be allowed in provided there is in addition to what is mentioned a clear indication of outside origin, or are these things to be prohibited altogether? That is the main effect of Deputy Lemass's amendment.  It weakens the Bill in its generic aspect.  The thing we have to determine is whether certain goods are to be prohibited from being imported from another country altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two possible methods of procedure outlined &mdash;one is the prohibition of these goods coming in altogether; and, secondly, to say &ldquo;We won't allow those goods to come in except they come in without misleading titles,&rdquo; and that they have also a clear indication of the country of origin.  As regards advertisements, I propose now that, on a later Stage, Section 21 will be taken out of Part IV altogether.  That is the section which relates to false representation in connection with goods not produced or manufactured here.  It is a section which extends the representation to a representation direct or indirect, and either verbal or in writing.  I propose to take that section out of Part IV and to put it in some other part of the Bill, so that it will have reference to the whole of the Bill and not to the special type of goods referred to in Section 20.  The Deputy raises a point: Would it be a definite indication of the country in which goods were produced if the goods bearing the name of a place in the Free State had on them in Irish &ldquo;Made in Poland&rdquo;?  I think that would depend upon the circumstances of the case.  It would have to depend on whether a court would decide is that a definite indication and could it be brought within the phrase, &ldquo;bearing in a conspicuous manner at the time of such sale, or exposing for sale, or distribution, a definite indication of the country in which such goods were produced or manufactured.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may attend to that by an amendment <Col N="2038" /> of those words.  I think it would be difficult in this country&mdash;and I should like to hear Deputy Buckley on the point&mdash;to say that you have to assume such an ignorance of the Irish language that an indication of origin in Irish would not be an indication of origin, whether a clear or definite indication or not.  That is the difficulty we are in.  Taking it away from the Irish altogether, supposing goods came in here bearing in French or in Italian an indication of origin.  Is that a definite indication so as to bring us within the meaning of the section?</P>

      <P>I doubt it very much.  The Irish raises a difficulty peculiar to itself, and we shall have to get that attended to.  Let us assume we have that out of the way, and that we have before us for determination either the prohibition of goods marked in a particular way or permission to allow them in, provided always that they are marked clearly and distinctly in some way that the people of the country will understand that they are of foreign origin.  We can argue these points later.  They are smaller points. The ground is cleared a little bit that way.  I suggest that the amendment suggested by Deputy Lemass does not carry us any further than the proposal in the Bill would carry it when added to the 1887 Act.  The 1887 Act must be taken in conjunction with this.  There are four sections in that Act which bear upon the matter we are discussing&mdash; Section 2, 3, 16 and 18.  To summarise these sections is difficult, but I want to put it generally this way.  Under Sections 2 and 3 of the 1887 Act it is an offence which is punishable summarily or on indictment to sell &ldquo;goods to which there is applied any description, statement or other indication, direct or indirect, which amounts to false representation.&rdquo;  Let us apply it to this case.</P>

    <P>Under Sections 2 and 3 it is wrong to sell goods which have applied to them any description which would <Col N="2039" /> falsely lead one to believe that the goods were manufactured in this country. Also under that Act, to get to the other word, the importation of such goods is forbidden, and in addition to that there is a definite prohibition of the importation of goods to which there is attached the name of any manufacturer or trader in this country unless that indication is accompanied by an indication of the country of origin.  So that leaving this out of the question for the moment, it is wrong to apply a description, whether directly or indirectly applied, to goods which would falsely represent that these goods were manufactured in the Saorstát.  That is one precise point.  I am making the general portion of the Act concrete to this point. Under Section 16 of the 1887 Act one is forbidden to import goods where there is an indication of origin falsely given unless at the same time the goods bear the proper indication of the origin.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the 1887 Act deals with what Deputy Lemass has down as the generic use of this phrase.  Deputy Lemass's amendment is that the previous sub-section shall not apply to any goods bearing the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann which is a trade description lawfully and generally applied to such goods.  That weakens to a certain extent the 1887 Act, Section 18 of which is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, at the passing of this Act, a trade description is lawfully and generally applied to goods of a particular class, or manufactured by a particular method, to indicate the particular class or method of manufacture of such goods, the provisions of this Act with respect to false trade description shall not apply to such trade description when so applied: Provided that where such trade description includes the name of a place or country, and is calculated to mislead as to the place or country where the goods to which it is applied were actually made or produced, and the goods are not actually made or produced in that place or country, this section shall <Col N="2040" /> not apply unless there is added to the trade description, immediately before or after the name of that place or country, in an equally conspicuous manner with that name, the name of the place or country in which the goods were actually made or produced, with the statement that they were made or produced there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section is the section which I call the generic section of the 1887 Act, and that does not, as Deputy Lemass's amendment does, halt merely at the point of saying that the section shall not apply to goods bearing the name of any place, district or area in Saorstát Eireann, which is a trade description lawfully and generally applied to such goods.  It says that if there is a name of a place or country, then you do not have certain penalties attaching, but you do have them attaching where there is the name of a place or a country applied, whether as a trade description or not, if it is calculated to deceive.  It is legislation by reference, and this debate by reference is very difficult.  If the sections are put together, I think the Deputy will agree that Section 2 of his amendment weakens the existing Act, because it would allow the application of a generic phrase &ldquo;whether calculated to deceive or not.&rdquo;  The Act of 1887 would not allow a place name to be used, even though it had got to the point of being considered generic if it was calculated to deceive.  That is a useful safeguard, because a lot of these words are slipping gradually from place descriptions to generic or trade descriptions.  It is a good thing to have our own courts as the authority as to whether or not a name has slipped from the point of being a local description to being a generic or trade description, and the amendment would weaken the effect of the 1887 Act. While excepting these points for later determination, and provided these things can be properly met, I think it is better to leave the law as it is under the 1887 Act, plus these provisions in the Bill rather than to accept the amendment, because it gives us power to punish for the sale of goods which have false descriptions applied to them under the 1887 Act.  It gives <Col N="2041" /> power to prohibit the importation of goods which bear a place name, unless accompanied by the actual name of the country where the goods were made.  If we remove the advertisement clause, as I propose to do, from this section to the general sections of the Bill, it gives us more complete power and more extensive power than we have with regard to verbal representation as to the country of origin. Under the 1887 Act, in addition to these provisions, we have a certain allowance with regard to the generic use of place names, but we do not allow the use of a place name on goods if at the same time it is calculated to mislead or deceive.  So that we have not merely the passing over of a generic name, but the passing over of a generic name on the basis that it has gone so far from a local or trade description that it is no longer calculated to deceive.</P>
    <P>I would therefore prefer to leave the Bill as it stands.  I would not have it if the 1887 Act were not behind it, but the addition of the 1887 Act to this provision leaves us in a stronger position than the amendment would, even although the amendment is to be read in addition to the 1887 Act, because to my mind the amendment will weaken it in one particular, and where it overlaps I do not think it strengthens it.  I throw out these as suggestions.  I do not think this can be argued unless people have the Act and the provisions in the Bill and the amendment before them, and I suggest that, instead of putting this to a conclusion, the matter should be better considered between this and the Report Stage, and that the Deputy, after considering what I have said and reading his own amendment in the light of that, should let me know whether there is any real difference of a strengthening type between this amendment and what I have proposed, and then we can deal with it.</P>

      <P>I am willing to let the matter stand over as suggested by the Minister.  I was impressed by what he said, particularly in regard to sub-section (2) of the proposed amendment. I would like to make it clear, <Col N="2042" /> however, that the case to which Section 20 of the Act applies and the case to which the next amendment would apply are not quite the same.  I do propose to exclude goods bearing the name of a trader or manufacturer or bearing the trade mark of a particular trader or manufacturer behind which there can be no other intention but that of deception.  I mean, for instance, foreign goods bearing Irish place-names or marks such as harps or shamrocks or things of that kind&mdash;that is, applying a name or mark which is only put there for the purpose of deceiving as to the country of origin.  It is only these classes of goods which should be excluded under the amendment. However, I am willing to leave the matter over until the Report Stage, and then have another discussion, if necessary, upon the matter.</P>

The only thing additional is &ldquo;any mark, description, or sign which might be reasonably mistaken as indicating that such goods were produced or manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; That is the only additional classification the Deputy gives.  I want to mention that I think that is covered by Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1887 because I think these things can easily be brought under the description of a trade description which is calculated to deceive with regard to place of manufacture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ways in which this has to be considered. <Col N="2043" /> One is as to decided cases&mdash;court proceedings. The other is the practice, for years, followed by the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Deputy looks at the 1887 Act he will see there are two forms.  One is to proceed summarily, or by indictment, against certain people who have got goods in. The other is to prohibit the importation. I can very definitely say that the Revenue Commissioners have clearly interpreted for years past Sections 2 and 3 of the 1887 Act as giving them all the power that they would have under paragraph (b) of the Deputy's amendment, while I cannot say much about decided cases because that has not come under my notice. But on the other side, with regard to the prevention of importation, the Revenue Commissioners have read undoubtedly Sections 2 and 3 of the Act as giving them the power they would be given under this amendment.  It is clearly as extensive in their view.  The other point has not been referred to previously.  It is an addition made by the Deputy to the classifications I have, and I think is clearly met by Sections 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>Amendments 10 and 11, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 12:</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Every order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the next preceding sub-section shall be submitted to each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and shall not have effect until each House has by resolution approved the making of such order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (2) the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered by order to &ldquo;exempt from the provisions of this section goods of any particular class or description, or goods sold under any particular description, if he is satisfied that, having regard to the special circumstances of the trade in such goods, exemption is desirable, and would not materially prejudice public interests in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; I am proposing that any such order <Col N="2044" /> made by the Minister should not come into effect until approved of by the Dáil.  There is a principle involved here that we discussed on the Traffic Bill some days ago, namely, that the Minister should not be empowered by order to amend legislation.  It would appear that this sub-section would give the Minister power, by exempting certain classes of goods, to defeat, if he so desires, the intention of the Dáil. I recognise that under legislation of this kind considerable powers to proceed by way of order or regulation must be given to the Executive Minister. But in this instance I think a good case could be made to require that this Executive Minister should seek the sanction of the Dáil for his order.  Because if the Dáil passes the Bill as it stands, it is the obvious intention of the Legislature that these restrictions should be imposed upon goods such as those described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) of this section.  If the Minister could exempt these goods from the operation of the sub-section by order, then it would be in his power to amend the Act; and I do not think he should have that power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only power to amend the Act if notice is given, because sub-section (8) requires that every order made under the section, and that applies to sub-section (2), shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The only difference is that the Deputy wants that the exemption order shall not be legal until passed by the Dáil.  I want the more normal thing, that I give notice of the order, and if within the next subsequent twenty-one days the House is sitting after the order is made it is annulled, then it ceases to have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what use the Deputy imagines is going to be made of the exemption provision of sub-section (2), but quite clearly, what we had in mind was this: We have had representations made to us by two Departments with regard to containers for Irish produce, which they have so far found it impossible to get made in this country.  We are faced with this difficulty. The containers are made outside. Can they be sold inside the <Col N="2045" /> country without an indication of their origin?  If an indication of origin is required, how are we to discriminate when these are filled with Irish produce and sent out of the country? How are we to make it clear to the people purchasing elsewhere that the mark of origin attached to the container does not apply to the whole contents?  It is with regard to these containers that we want power to make the exemption in these circumstances. We want it to be on the basis that they would not be exempt until a case is made.  We have had a case actually made in a very strong way by the Department of Agriculture that for certain types of Irish produce sold in England it is impossible to get proper or indeed any container manufactured at home.  They face us with the difficulty that under the Act we would insist upon the container being marked though it contained some sort of Irish produce.  When that goes to the British market to be sold the discrimination may not be as they want it, and they asked us to take the power to exempt in these cases.  Once we give the House notice, and the case can be raised, there is not going to be very much done even within the 21 days if the House is out of session. The order being laid upon the Table, the people who have got an exemption order will always have before them, even though the House is out of session during a lengthy summer adjournment, that the matter can be raised when the House resumes.  People who are a little bit anxious about trade-marks, who are not sure that their case is sound, will not involve themselves in liability if they feel that the matter is to be subject to debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the particular case mentioned, not merely is there no necessity to give this power, but the Minister has no option in the matter. These goods are excluded from the Bill under the provisions of sub-section (1), which refers to goods imported here for consignment by the vendor to somebody outside the country.  They are excluded under the definition of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; contained in Section 1.  The other point is merely a matter of safeguarding <Col N="2046" /> the constitutional principle, if you will.  We had the point discussed on the Traffic Bill.  The Minister for Local Government accepted our view and agreed to the amendment of the Bill in the manner we suggested&mdash;that where the regulations to be made were of such a nature that they might be regarded as an amendment of the statute those regulations should not come into force until approved of by the Dáil.  In the case of other orders to be made by the Minister under this section and other sections of the Bill, we are agreeable to the procedure, which is the usual procedure, as the Minister says&mdash;that is, that they be tabled and come into force immediately, but that they can be annulled within twenty-one sitting days.  In this particular case the order is of such importance that it might be tantamount to an amendment of the Act, and that is why we suggest that special procedure should be adopted and that the order should not come into force until approved by the Dáil.  The Minister has referred to the period of twenty-one sitting days, but the twenty-one sitting days might cover a period of six months.  If the Dáil adjourned for a period of five months, and the order was made at the beginning of that period, it could be in operation for a half-year, and its subsequent annulment by the Dáil would not render illegal anything done under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out two things.  On the question of sitting days, the point is not that the order made under the section can be laid before the House within twenty-one sitting days.  The order must be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, on the Table of the House, so that the House gets immediate notice of it.  The point about the twenty-one sitting days involving a period of six months is not relevant to this argument.  The point is: What is the earliest time within that period that Deputies could get on to the resolution?; that is evidently the longest period of adjournment there might be.  This does not mean that they are prohibited from dealing with the order until twenty-one sitting days have passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> Again, on that point, the Deputy speaks about constitutional matters. I do not see where any constitutional point is involved.  There is a point of procedure involved.  The procedure generally in this House has been&mdash;the placing of orders on the Table of the House, these orders to have effect until annulled.  That is the form the order takes in nine cases out of ten in which orders are required or allowed to be made by the Minister.  On the point as to the exclusion of these containers, the Deputy appears to think that these articles are excluded by the definition of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; in the definition section.  I do not think he gets the point at all.  I am presuming that the Deputy is going on the first sub-head of the definition&mdash;a sale of goods for consignment by the vendor to a person outside Saorstát Eireann.  That does not apply.  The container is ordered by a purchaser in the Free State.  The goods are consigned to him.  They are not consigned to a person outside Saorstát Eireann.  They are coming in here and that person is getting that container because he wants to put inside it certain goods produced here which he is going to sell outside.  He wants to get that container brought in here marked &ldquo;Produced in the Irish Free State,&rdquo; that having reference to the contents and not to the container.  That is the case in respect of which the Department of Agriculture have considerable difficulty. I do not feel equal to arguing the precise difficulties of the Department of Agriculture.  They are more present to them than they are to my Department, but they were sufficiently grave to warrant our asking power to make this exemption order. These are the cases I want to cover and I do not see any other series of cases at present.  We think that these are reasonable cases and that it is a reasonable way to meet the difficulty by making an exemption order. There will be nothing so fundamental as an amendment of the Act.  The power sought is merely to meet these cases of goods produced here to be sold outside.  As regards articles to be used in conjunction with goods produced here and to be sold here, they <Col N="2048" /> would probably come in without any mark that would bring them inside the section, and, therefore, the question would not arise.  The only body of cases we see arising is of the container type of article and we think a case has been made for that.  We think also that the case has been met by giving the Minister power to make an exemption order which the Dáil can annul afterwards if it so desires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that butter boxes are a fair example of the goods we are talking about?  He made two remarks which prompted me to intervene with a view to correcting him.  He said that these were goods which were going outside the country.  Butter boxes come here from Sweden.  It is not that they cannot be made here, but the class of timber most suitable for preserving butter without giving it a certain taint is only found in Sweden.  The custom has been to import butter boxes from Sweden.  Some of these butter boxes are used for internal deliveries, and others go outside the country.  These are articles that could be made in this country, and in many cases are.  For the purpose of containing goods, they may be sent outside the country.  I think butter boxes are a good example of the class of goods we are considering and that the Minister's point is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy said is very sound.  Butter boxes can be made here, but I understand, according to the representations made by the Department, that there is some change of flavour or colour given to butter by these boxes, mainly because the wood has not got time to mature. In the end, the question will amount to this&mdash;whether you want to protect the butter container industry here, or whether you think it more important to preserve your export of butter.  I think nobody will have any doubts on that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point, I think there is power under the section as it stands to secure that there would not be use made of this section to allow in containers which were going to be used in <Col N="2049" /> the country and not outside.  The Minister may exempt goods of any particular class or description, or goods sold under any particular description, if he is satisfied that having regard to the special circumstances of the trade in such goods, such exemption is desirable, and would not materially prejudice public interests in Saorstát Eireann.  I think there is room to meet any distinction the Deputy wants to make there.  If there is not, we could amend it.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of referring to the Principal Act, and I would be glad if the Minister would say whether clause (a) &ldquo;it shall not be lawful for any person to sell or expose for sale any imported goods to which there is applied within Section 5 the name of a manufacturer, trader, or dealer in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;&mdash;is elaborated in the Principal Act. Is provision made to meet the case of a name which could be held to be not the name of a manufacturer or trader in Saorstát Eireann, but would so resemble it that it would be mistaken by people in this country for the name of that trader?  I am thinking of such an instance as Scott's jams, which are manufactured in the Saorstát. Would &ldquo;Scot's&rdquo; jams&mdash;spelt with one &ldquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;coming into this country be forbidden? Would it be unlawful to import &ldquo;Maypole butter,&rdquo; the correct description of the Maypole Company being the Maypole Dairy Company? A multitude of things could be quoted. I would like to know if the Principal Act makes provision for guarding against such evasions of the law?</P>

      <P>I want to quote other instances&mdash;traders who are not merely traders in this country, but who trade and manufacture outside the country, for instance: Burtons, the clothiers; the Dolcis Shoe Co., or Woolworth's. If goods were brought in bearing their names, are these goods required by this section to have an indication of the country of origin marked upon them, or can they come in bearing the <Col N="2050" /> name without indicating the country of origin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section that is referred to, Section 5 of the Principal Act, mainly deals with the word &ldquo;applied.&rdquo;  The application of marks to substances is defined in the Principal Act.  The reference to Section 5 of the Principal Act in Section 20 (1) is mainly for the purpose of bringing in the limited manner in which the word &ldquo;applied&rdquo; is used.  Section 5 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A person shall be deemed to apply a trade mark or mark or trade description to goods who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) applies it to the goods themselves; or</P>
      <P>(b) applies it to any covering, label, reel, or other thing in or with which the goods are sold or exposed or had in possession for any purpose of sale, trade, or manufacture; or</P>
      <P>(c) places, encloses, or annexes any goods which are sold or exposed or had in possession for any purpose of sale, trade, or manufacture, in, with, or to any covering, label, reel, or other thing to which a trade mark or trade description has been applied; or</P>
      <P>(d) uses a trade mark or mark or trade description in any manner calculated to lead to the belief that the goods in connection with which it is used are designated or described by that trade mark or mark or trade description.</P>
      <P>In the course of defining the word &ldquo;applied,&rdquo; Section 5 of the Principal Act brings in the phrase, &ldquo;trade mark or mark or trade description.&rdquo;  The trade description is defined in Section 3 of the Principal Act.  It means a number of things:</P>
      <P>(a) as to the number, quantity, measure, gauge, or weight of any goods; or</P>
      <P>(b) as to the place or country in which any goods were made or produced; or</P>
      <P>(c) as to the mode of manufacturing or producing any goods; or</P>
      <P>(d) as to the material of which any goods are composed; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> (e) as to any goods being the subject of an existing patent, privilege or copyright...</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;false trade description&rdquo; means a trade description which is false in a material respect as regards the goods to which it is applied, and includes every alteration of a trade description, whether by way of addition, effacement, or otherwise, where that alteration makes the description false in a material respect.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the elimination of a word from a well-known trade name, or even the elimination of a letter, might be brought in as a false trade description, by reason of the effacement or addition of something in the original mark.  That is merely the definition.  What a court would decide is another thing.  The question that Deputy Lemass raised &mdash; dealing with Burton's suits or anything like those&mdash; would, I think, clearly come under the definition here of a false trade description. I think the Deputy had better apply the particular case that he has in mind to the definition in the Principal Act, and to raise the difficulty hereafter if it is still in his mind.  It is rather a fine point that Deputy Moore raised, but I think the definition happens to cover it.  If Deputies are going to consider these particular cases, they should read Sections 2 and 3 of the Principal Act together, and Sections 16 and 18 in conjunction with Section 20 of this Bill.  It will be seen that the definitions are wide enough to include most of the types of false descriptions that would occur to anybody. There may be cases where possibly we would think of extending the provisions if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think between now and the Report Stage the Minister should consider whether he could elaborate clause (a) in order to guard against such evasions as I have suggested.  A multitude of them suggest themselves to one's imagination.  If the case that I refer to could happen, that Scot's jams could be imported so long as the name was spelt with one &ldquo;t,&rdquo; that would rather destroy the whole purpose <Col N="2052" /> of the Bill.  I think that clause could be elaborated a good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I started off by saying that Section 5 was brought into Section 20 mainly to bring in an extension of the term &ldquo;applied.&rdquo;  If Deputies want to get after what matters are covered, and to see whether the description is wide enough, or if it is too limited, they would have to go to Sections 2 and 3 of the Principal Act. I remember a case more or less on the lines of that which the Deputy spoke of, but I do not know how it went in the end.  A case was brought against a manufacturer of a well-known brand of sardines, and on the first trial the decision was against the people who attempted to get over the law by dropping the final &ldquo;e&rdquo; and calling the goods &ldquo;sardins.&rdquo;  It emerged in the course of the appeal that neither brand of &ldquo;sardines&rdquo; were really sardines; that they were all bristling.  Whether the attempt to get over the law was ultimately successful or not I cannot say.  I think it is almost impossible to meet devices of this sort when one considers what one's imagination could run to.  It is only a question of getting decided cases to see how far the law is a block to these subterfuges.  There might be an extension of (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 20, but more likely it would be to some definition clause applying to the Act generally, because the point the Deputy is raising was not with regard to certain goods coming to the Free State with misleading descriptions of origin, but might be with regard to goods generally&mdash;that they should be prohibited or not allowed in unless there was a clear description of outside origin.</P>

A company has established itself in Dublin recently, and is selling shoes described as &ldquo;duty free.&rdquo;  These shoes are imported, and <Col N="2053" /> duty was paid on them on importation. That sort of description might create the impression that the goods are of native manufacture, which are the only shoes that could be sold duty free.  Is that &ldquo;false description,&rdquo; and is it liable to involve those engaged in the practice in a prosecution under this section?</P>

      <P>I cannot see how it would arise under Section 21.  It would be very far removed from this section, which refers only to false representation in any material respect in connection with goods not produced or manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.  It might be a mis-statement.</P>
      <P>People may argue that they want to say that the customer is getting them as cheaply, which I think is the intention of the phrase, as if they had not paid duty.  I do not think that would come under this section.  I think that we would have to go back to the original Act.  I doubt very much if it would come in here, because most descriptions, if false, are false in regard to the one particular country of origin.  It would be very difficult indeed to establish that it is a false description.  It is a point on which a solicitor might be consulted.</P>

      <P>On the section I want to say that I am not satisfied that the machinery for the enforcement of the Act is adequate.  In relation to foodstuffs, there is definite machinery provided.  The local authority may send its inspectors to take samples and initiate prosecutions, but in relation to other classes of goods, the only <Col N="2054" /> thing suggested here is that the Minister may act as prosecutor in certain cases.  I think the Minister should consider the advisability of taking powers to appoint some of his own officers as inspectors, to give them authority to take samples and to initiate prosecutions whenever they are satisfied that an infringement of the Act has taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says that the Minister &ldquo;may, subject to the prescribed conditions being complied with, undertake as prosecutor the prosecution of any offence under the Principal Act or any offence under this Act in cases appearing to him to affect the general interests of the country, or of a section of the community, or of a trade, or of an industry.&rdquo;  Naturally I would have to rely on the use of whatever inspectors I have, who are to any degree itinerant, that they would investigate here and there, as it seemed to require, and report, but the prosecution would always have to lie at the suit of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Public Charitable Hospitals (Amendment No. 3) Bill, 1931.  The hospital mentioned in the second section of this Bill is the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Wellington Road, Cork.  It has for many years catered for the poorest class of patients.  Over 60 per cent. of the beds have been occupied by patients who pay nothing.  They are supported by poor law institutions, public bodies and private subscriptions.  Early this year this hospital made application to be included in the original Bill.  It was then thought that they were not strictly eligible, but since that time other hospitals have come in because of certain other regulations made regarding the qualifications necessary for participation in the Sweepstake.  To show what very useful work is carried out in this institution I will give you a few figures.  I do not want to overload my statement with figures, but I think it is essential that the House should know the useful work this institution is doing, and the number of patients treated.  The number of free extern patients during 1929 was 4,213. The number of intern patients treated during the same year was 817; the attendances at the extern department total 11,791.  This hospital is without endowment or grant of any kind.  It is supported by voluntary subscriptions from the public, payments from patients, from public bodies and from private patients.  The large number of free patients&mdash;roughly over 4,000 per annum&mdash;treated at the extern department would alone suffice to satisfy any reasonably-minded person that they are entitled to come under the provisions of the Public Charitable Hospitals Act.</P>
      <P>The great majority of the special affections treated in this hospital do not require admission to the wards, but a large number of cases treated are first extern cases and are subsequently admitted to the hospital and occupy beds in it.  There is a very considerable and increasing overdraft at the bank, and most, if not all, of the money was secured during the war period, when it was rather difficult to get money in certain directions.  At the moment, funds are very urgently needed for this hospital, which, as I have already stated, is doing a lot of useful work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the medical profession will endorse this statement when I say that the persons treated there have been very excellently served by the many famous men who have passed through that institution.  Many have gained world-wide fame in their profession; and the services that those professional <Col N="2059" /> men gave not alone to the people of Cork but to the people of adjoining counties certainly deserve the sympathetic consideration of this House. People from outside the city are treated there.  They come from Kerry, Tipperary and the neighbouring counties. The services there are very good and efficient.  The hospital possesses all the necessary qualifications for participating in the Hospitals Sweepstake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  I would like to point out as well that a similar hospital in Dublin has recently been included in the Hospitals Bill.  That is the Royal Victoria Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. If the matter is examined, I think it will be found that on the same grounds the Cork Hospital can, without any difficulty, be included.</P>

      <P>I personally do not know anything about the merits or demerits of this hospital, but I agree with what Deputy Egan said, that on the figures which have been put forward by Deputy Anthony there are no grounds on which we could fairly discriminate between the Cork Eye and Ear Hospital and the Dublin one.  I venture to hope that it is the last hospital which will come forward asking for special Bills, because really any hospital that wishes to participate in this scheme has had an ample opportunity to put its claim forward.  I say I hope that this is the last time we will be troubled with these Bills.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has accepted the Bill brought in by Deputy Anthony and Deputy Barry Egan.  Like the Minister, I have no personal knowledge of the hospital mentioned, but I have been told on reliable authority that it does work of a similar kind to the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital here in Dublin, which as a special hospital was included. Cork thought its hospital should be included likewise.  I am told it is a hospital which pays very special attention to the poor, and that without it poor patients would often be in a bad way.  I do not know whether it is the last hospital that will apply. Possibly it is not.  I hope if some <Col N="2060" /> others do come along that the Minister will keep in mind that they are doing good work and give them careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I support the Second Reading of this very heartily. There is no doubt whatsoever that the hospital referred to is doing excellent work in the South of Ireland.  The Royal Eye and Ear Hospital was taken in though they were not able to come under the terms of the original Act, as they were not showing 25 per cent. of treatment of the poor at 10/- per week.  I see no reason why this hospital should not be brought in.</P>
      <P>The only thing I would like to know from Deputy Anthony is what the total income of the hospital is and in what proportion contributions come in from private persons and public bodies. That would have been a desirable statement.  However, it has not been made, and perhaps Deputy Anthony does not know what these figures are. I would like personally to know what voluntary support the hospital gets from the public.  I support the Second Reading very heartily, but if Deputy Anthony is able to give the figures here I will be very pleased.</P>

It has been a great boon to the poor of Cork and of Munster.  I am very glad that the Bill has been brought in.  I can assure the Minister that we have a few more hospitals in Cork that he will hear of in a very short time.  I believe that this Sweepstakes money should be applied to every hospital where the need for it arises, and that we cannot give too much assistance to those who had to bear a very heavy burden for a great number of years.  I heartily support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be given a Second Reading.  Since the Bill was introduced it was suggested that it should be withdrawn and recaptioned so as to include various amendments that have been suggested by Deputies on all sides of the House. If it were withdrawn now, or if Deputy Ryan's amendment was put and carried, it would mean that the several hundred pounds that have already been spent in bringing the Bill to its present position would be lost, and the protection which the Bill would afford to the general public would be indefinitely postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am indebted to several Deputies for suggested amendments which undoubtedly improve the Bill as it was originally drawn.  My co-sponsors of the Bill have undertaken that those amendments shall be proposed to the committee that will be appointed if the Bill is given a Second Reading.  It is doubtful if the House as a whole have any knowledge of the losses which fraudulent auctioneers have in the past inflicted and are in the present inflicting upon the public.  The public are protected to a certain extent if a stockbroker or a solicitor makes default or is guilty of fraud.  If an auctioneer <Col N="2062" /> does away with the money of his client the client has no redress whatever, and at present there is nothing to prevent an auctioneer from repeating the transaction as often as he can.  Anyone at present, no matter how shady his antecedents or how small his capital, if he can scrape up £10 for the purchase of a licence and advertise sufficiently, finds himself able to help himself to other people's money.  On the 15th March of the present year an arrangement was carried for £5,000. That was to pay 4/- in the £ in five instalments, spread over 18 months. Anybody who has any knowledge of getting payment of a debt by instalments will realise, of course, that they are exceedingly lucky if they get the first instalment.  On the 20th May a judgment was given for £149 and another for £795, and as far as I know nothing has been realised on these judgments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>[An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>On the 20th June a client here in Dublin paid an auctioneer a deposit of £200.  That £200 has probably gone to swell the total of the November Handicap Sweep receipts.  Certainly the unfortunate owner of the £200 is in the position of the person who has not drawn a horse in the sweep.  On the 9th July there was a fraudulent conversion registered against another auctioneer. On the 8th July there was another arrangement for £5,000.  There is a total for the present year of £11,145.  In December, 1930, there was a fraudulent conversion registered for £4,700.  In the same month another well-known firm failed for £8,000, and another for £4,532, and still another for £18,744.  On the 16th June a complaint was sent in to the Auctioneers' Association that an auctioneer in Dublin had sold property in 1928, and from that day to this the owner of the property has been unable to receive any dividend.</P>
    <P>I could go back to 1925, but I do not want to weary the House with further particulars.  I can vouch for all these items.  They are taken from official documents, and there are many other <Col N="2063" /> cases which have never been reported, but which we know of.  I have only mentioned those to show the importance of a Bill such as the one I am proposing for the protection of the general public.  Something like ninety per cent. of the present auctioneers have agreed that this Bill is necessary. The particulars of the Bill have been in the hands of members of the House, and any amendments that we consider improve the Bill have already been printed and are in the hands of every member in the House.  Deputy Haslett, Deputy Cole, Deputy McFadden and myself have undertaken that those amendments shall be proposed.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through the various sections of the Bill now. Deputies, I am sure, have studied it. I would like to point out, however, that the really important section is Section 25, in connection with which there is a suggestion dealing with the bond which the general committee of the association say should be given by anybody practising as an auctioneer. It is suggested that the proceeds of any bond, or of any security held on behalf of registered persons by the council shall in all cases be applicable solely towards the discharge of the obligations of such registered persons upon any sale, letting or transfer of land or other property in respect of which the registered person, or the firm or company by whom he is employed, has been declared liable to their clients by a decision of a competent court of Saorstát Eireann.  I formally move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan does not propose to move the proposal which stands in his name.  This is a Bill to which members of our Party have given considerable attention. When it was circulated, and when we discussed it originally, the feeling was that the Bill was so badly drafted that it was doubtful if anything could be done with it.  We all agreed that it was necessary to take steps to protect the public against the possibility of fraud and loss through persons being <Col N="2064" /> licensed as auctioneers who really should not get such licences.  We thought that the whole position should receive examination before any action was taken to legislate in this matter.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that steps could be taken to protect the public other than by a Bill of this particular kind. Direct legislation dealing with the matter could be introduced without any idea of making auctioneering a profession, as is more or less proposed in this Bill.  That was why Deputy Ryan's proposal appeared on the paper.  Recently there have been a number of conversations between the promoters of the Bill, those who are interested, and members of our Party. From what the Deputy who introduced the Bill has said, it is quite evident that members of other Parties have similarly been discussing this Bill.  The assurance which the mover of the Bill has given us that the amendments we think are essential will be introduced, has satisfied us that the Bill can be let through the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>A great deal of work will have to be done on the Committee Stage.  The general opinion is that the Bill will have to be completely recast before it can pass through the House finally. We are agreed upon the need for protecting the public and, as some of the principal dangers that we apprehended are going to be met by amendments, we propose not to vote now against the measure.  One point upon which we wanted to have assurance was that no unfair barriers would be put against new people who are qualified to enter the profession.  There was a fear that examinations of an unsuitable character might be put up, that a severe period of apprenticeship might be instituted or that some other barriers that we think would be unnecessary might be proposed.  It is understood that there is no intention to erect such barriers.  That being the case, we do not propose to vote against the Bill at this stage.  We are prepared to give the measure every consideration when it comes before us with the amendments inserted.</P>

Until a few moments ago I was not aware that Deputy Ryan was not moving his proposal.  It seems to me that Deputy Ryan's proposal was a proper one.  It was one that would have got our support had it been moved.  It seems to me there are more things involved than the mere question of the protection of the public.  It looks very like creating a monopoly, and it seems that the real object behind the Bill is not so much to protect the public as to protect auctioneers and valuers.  Of course we have to wait until we see, eventually, how the Bill will turn out, but there is a suggestion running right through it that here we are creating something for the auctioneers such as we created for doctors, dentists, and lawyers.  Deputy Cole suggests teachers, but the fact is that no such position has been created for teachers or members of other bodies.</P>
      <P>Are we setting out here to create corporations, monopolies, self-governing bodies for various classes of workers or professions?  Is that to be a general policy?  If that is the case I think we should not deal with the matter piecemeal, taking one profession or body to-day and another to-morrow or the next day according as these various interests will press their claims upon the members of the House.  I think that is a matter that deserves some consideration from us. We had an application from the barbers some months ago, and for some reason their application was turned down.  I do not know whether it was that they commanded less influence in pressing their claims than the auctioneers and valuers.  If for the auctioneers and valuers, why not for the plumbers?  We are sure to have the surveyors very soon.  Then we will have the accountants coming forward. Many other professions that can be mentioned will undoubtedly come forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear especially from the Government some indication as to what is their policy on this particular <Col N="2066" /> line, or whether it is to be part and parcel of our procedure in the future that bodies like this may come forward and may get power to create what is to all intents and purposes a self-governing trade or business of any kind.  I am not saying at the moment that I am opposed to that particular idea.  A good deal can be said for it. What I do not like is that we are dealing with a matter piecemeal instead of dealing with it as part and parcel of a general policy here in the reorganisation of our business.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal, of course, about the protection of the public from fraud.  That is necessary so far as the shopkeeping profession is concerned just as well as in the case of the auctioneers.  That is necessary so far as a great many other businesses that have dealings with the public are concerned.  Most of our ordinary laws are framed with the intention of protecting the public from fraud.  Many of our Acts of Parliament deal specially with the necessity for protection of the public against fraud.  I am afraid I cannot compliment Deputy Leonard on throwing very much light on the matter of this Bill in his introductory speech.  The Deputy told us that a person requires only to get a licence of £10 in order to be able to engage in this business.  There are many people who engage in business without any licence of any kind whatsoever and there is no registration system whatsoever to interfere with them.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill to which Deputy Leonard referred as being the most important provision in the Bill.  That is to say that certain deposits would be necessary from people who would be engaging in this business so as to protect the public.  I do not know whether a Bill of this kind is necessary or whether it is necessary to set up what is to all intents and purposes a self-governing body or a controlling body for the auctioneering business with a council controlling entrance into the profession in order to secure that arrangement. If a licence has to be paid at present before a man can engage in work as an auctioneer and valuer, there is nothing so far as I can see to <Col N="2067" /> prevent the Minister making regulations. If there is anything to prevent these regulations being made, it could be made easy to secure its removal. There would be nothing to prevent the Minister making regulations, say, that in addition to paying the licence, the person proposing to engage in this business should get some adequate security, and that adequate security to be determined by the Minister who would be in charge of that particular Department of State.  I would be rather surprised to see that the particular Minister in charge of it would be the Minister for Lands and Fisheries who is now sitting on the Executive Benches.</P>

      <P>I would be surprised if it were.  It would appear to me that in this case it would be the Minister for Industry and Commerce who would make regulations which would ensure that the person engaged in this particular business would give what the Minister would consider ample security.  Unless care is taken in the course of this Bill through the House there might be a danger, and a great danger, that this particular business would be made a close borough to some extent, and that people who legitimately engage in business in a small way, as we know they do down the country, would find themselves debarred from engaging in this business.  Then, if a farmer down the country had a few acres of meadow to sell, or a few pounds worth of furniture and farm effects and things of that kind to auction off, he would require the services of a specially qualified man who had passed all the necessary stages of getting into this profession, a profession that in the future will be a very dignified and noble one. In view of the line that has been taken with regard to Deputy Ryan's amendment, I do not wish to press an objection to the Bill at this stage.  I want to say that I am refraining from voting against the Second Reading with great reluctance.  My own personal view on the matter is this: I would like, before <Col N="2068" /> the House commits itself to the principle of this Bill, that we should have the kind of investigation that we could have got under Deputy Ryan's amendment. There would be an opportunity there, and a better opportunity than can now be afforded on the Stages of the Bill, for examining into the whole position, having regard to the bearings of our action in accepting a Bill of this kind and having regard to the effect of our action and the general attitude in regard to other applications which may come before the House in the near future.</P>
      <P>I think it would be well if the House came to some general decision as to what its future action in regard to such applications will be, and have some guiding principle in regard to these applications.  I have no special objection to the adoption of this as a general policy, but I do think that each section or each profession should not come along in this way and, according to the amount of particular influence they can exert in the House, get a Bill through the Dáil conferring rights and privileges upon the members of a particular business.  I would much prefer that we would have the examination that we could have had under Deputy Ryan's amendment; but in view of the circumstances I do not wish to press my objection to the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to supplement what Deputy Leonard has said in introducing this Bill.  Perhaps I might state the main outlines of it. At the outset I might say that the attitude of Deputies towards it so far is a great argument for the Bill.  No Deputy who has spoken has said that he is in opposition to the principle of the Bill.  I have had a good deal of conversation with Deputies on all sides of the House, and I found a great desire on the part of everybody to make this a useful measure.  At the present time, the auctioneering business is not on the sure and satisfactory foundation on which it ought to be. At present it is open to anyone who can put £10 together to go to the Custom House and get an auctioneer's licence and start business.  I have no desire to criticise anybody, but I think <Col N="2069" /> that that fact speaks for itself.  There are people suitable for carrying on this business, but, on the other hand, there are people who are totally unsuitable who would aspire to carry it on.</P>
      <P>What is asked for in this Bill falls under three heads.  The first is that there should be somebody to have the right to say who should get a licence to become an auctioneer, and that there should be some supervision over, say, the character and ability of the person taking out a licence.  The second is that such a person should give security or take out a bond with an insurance society to cover his auctioneering business.  If Deputies read the Bill, I think that they will find that that is clearly stated.  It is not to be a bond covering a person's general business, but a bond to cover his liability to the public.  The third thing is that there should be some body, preferably the same body, to see that a person who has taken out a licence conducts his business in a straightforward and business-like way.  They are the main outlines of what is asked for in the Bill, and I do not think they are unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it from the standpoint of the person who has business to transact, it should be made reasonably safe that the business entrusted to another person shall be transacted in a straightforward and business-like manner, so that not alone shall that person not suffer loss, but that his interests shall be protected.  In discussing this point, Deputy de Valera expressed the wish that there should be no unfair barrier to becoming an auctioneer.  I do not think that is in any way intended.  In fact, one of the amendments suggested after consultation with several of the members was that it should not be a question of examination at all, but a question of the ability of the person to perform the work.  There are certain professions and callings for which it is necessary that there should be certain scholarly qualifications.  In this particular business the school of experience is one of the things which fit a person for it.  It is an undertaking on the part of a person to transact business for someone else.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that plumbers <Col N="2070" /> might come along and seek something similar.  I suggest that that is an entirely different thing.  Plumbers as such do not undertake the transaction of public business.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Connell's opinion of plumbers in general would coincide with that of Harold Begbie, but I suggest to him that they are in a different class altogether.  Auctioneers and valuers undertake work for somebody else, and that person should have a reasonable amount of protection. Deputy O'Connell said that he was in considerable difficulty, as the Bill asked for more than the protection of the public.  I do not think it does.  I do not think it is meant at all that auctioneering should be a close borough, as was suggested.  I do not think it is to the discredit of any worker or any business man that he should try to magnify his office.  If workers and business men seek to make themselves more proficient and put their business on a sounder basis, I think they should get credit for it. They should be like the old stone-breaker who, when he was twitted about what he was doing, said that he was helping to build the King's highway, meaning that he was contributing to the work of the State in a way that they did not think about.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be considered in Committee, and I do not think it is necessary that we should go through the sections, except to answer any queries which may be put.  I personally think that the attitude of Deputies towards the Bill is a reasonable one, that it should stand its examination, and that the House should make it as good a Bill as possible.  So long as the three things I have outlined are preserved, we are more than anxious that the Bill should be amended, and should be framed in such a way that the public shall be safeguarded, and that the people engaged in this business shall be compelled, if I may use the word, to do their business in a straightforward and honest way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise rather to get some direction from the Ceann Comhairle than to criticise the Bill.  This Bill has been submitted to Deputies, and certain suggestions were made to the <Col N="2071" /> promoters that an endeavour was made to carry out later on.  It has been promised that we shall be met in many directions.  The Bill contains not one principle, but three distinct principles.  I am quite satisfied that once the Bill gets a Second Reading containing certain principles, these principles cannot be removed.  I should like to have a decision from somebody competent to give it as to whether, once the Second Reading has been agreed to, these principles must be maintained.  The Revenue Commissioners get a fee of £10 from those taking out an auctioneering licence. They have done very little after getting that £10 to protect the public from whom that £10 ultimately comes. Certainly something should be done by the State in that direction in view of the amount they receive from these licences.  We should all like to see the public protected because we all know of cases where they need protection. Many of us know of cases where auctioneers, who were engaged in other business besides auctioneering, became insolvent, with the result that people who had entrusted to them the sale of farms or other property did not get the money realised as a result of these sales.  In this Bill a charter is being asked for.  I cannot call it by any other name.  If that principle, which is at present contained in the Bill, can be got rid of in Committee, we would be satisfied.  If the Bill gets a Second Reading, and we can get rid in Committee of the principles contained in it, I am quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy O'Connell's appeal to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries as representing the Executive Council to state the Government's attitude with regard to the organising of the different professions in the Saorstát. As far as I can learn, there are a number of professions preparing similar Bills to this, naturally encouraged by each Bill presented.  Every Bill passed here of this nature will encourage other professions to go ahead and say: &ldquo;We are as well entitled as the auctioneers <Col N="2072" /> to be organised under State protection and representation as they are.&rdquo;  That will be said by a number of professions to-morrow.  Already, if rumour be true, there are a number of professions preparing Bills similar to the one we are now discussing.  The accountants, I understand, are engaged in looking for recognition for their profession.  The engineers are doing something similar, and no doubt the architects will copy the example set them by the North of Ireland Government, mentioned in the Press to-day.  It is time, as Deputy O'Connell suggested, that the Government should say whether they have any general opinion with regard to this question, whether it could be done in at least a more time-saving way.  If we approve of these proposals, could they not introduce a general measure to cover a number of them, leaving the differences that would be necessary to be dealt with by regulation?</P>
      <P>Deputy Haslett and Deputy Leonard have both emphasised that this Bill is intended as a protection for the public with regard to the funds handed over to auctioneers.  But there are other people in the country, I think, who handle public moneys and against whom the public have no protection.  I think solicitors, already themselves protected by this House, do not give any bond or guarantee as to the money they handle, and without any disrespect to solicitors, I may mention that there have been cases of embezzlement on the part of solicitors resulting in very great hardship to their unfortunate clients.  If such provisions are necessary in regard to one profession handling money, they ought to be necessary in regard to other professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that there is any protection in the case of bank managers, for instance, who deal with insurance. I think they are in a position to defraud their clients.  There are other questions in regard to the protection of the public as well as in regard to their money.  There is the question of protection with regard to the safety of human life.  In my opinion no profession has had as good a claim for recognition and organisation under State protection as the engineers. There is no other profession that has <Col N="2073" /> so much to do with the safety of human life: It is really time, in view of the number of cases that come before us, and that are likely to come before us in the future, that we should have some agreement amongst us as to the way in which we could deal with them in future.  There is no section in the House, I think, opposed to the regulation of the professions in so far as they do not intend to make their professions close boroughs.  If that were the point in this Bill I think there would be almost unanimity in this House that it should not be given a Second Reading.  We are not yet prepared for that, but whatever the ultimate attitude may be as to the question of limiting the number of people entering any profession, we are not prepared for it at the moment.  I do not think we would say that it is right that the auctioneers' profession should be confined to 500 people within the Saorstát and that the engineers should be confined to 1,000 people. We are hardly in a position to say that yet, whatever we may do afterwards; it would require a great deal more experience to deal with that aspect of the question.  Any attempt to embody such a provision should be resisted by the House.  There are several provisions in the Bill that seem to me to be very faulty.  I was one of those who found most fault with the Bill as drafted.  I do not find fault with the principle of regulating the different professions.  But I certainly found fault with the drafting.  I do not know how some of the things got into the Bill.  Sections 12 and 13 will have to be examined very carefully in Committee, but I do not think, in view of the case that appears to exist for such a measure, that we should refuse to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. George Wolfe Mr. George Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. George Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those who have been thinking for a long time that there ought to be some regulation governing the work done by auctioneers and valuers.  Of course, I speak from one side only and that is the side of the public, where they have the necessity of employing auctioneers. There is also the auctioneers' side of the question.  I do not agree with every section of this Bill.  I think more <Col N="2074" /> or less with Deputy de Valera that it should be given a Second Reading and then well considered in Committee so as to make it acceptable, as far as posable, to all Parties in the House.  I think it must be obvious that it is right that people who have at their control very large sums of money, as some auctioneers have, should be under some pretty tight regulations in regard to it.  Of course a large number of auctioneers and valuers are extremely honourable and upright men, as we all know.  But I can remember some cases that were different.  It seems from what Deputy Leonard says that they could deal with moneys which they handle pretty much as they like.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>I remember a case where I was let in for a small amount and some people in my area were also affected, but where the whole sums amounted to something like £20,000.  I do not think that anything ever happened in the way of restoring their money to them. I never heard of it anyway.  We had simply to bear our loss and the matter ended there.  I do not think that is a very satisfactory state of affairs.  I think also, particularly in the case of valuers, that it is hardly suitable that it should be possible for anybody who pays £10 for a licence to be able to call himself an auctioneer and valuer.  I think that is rather ridiculous.  It is not so in any other profession.  It is not so in the case of solicitors and doctors.  I agree with what was said that it would be absurd to have great examinations of people trying to be auctioneers.  Still, I think there ought to be some reasonable regulation governing them.  I agree that the Bill is very badly drafted but I think it could be improved and I think it could be made serviceable by attention from everybody in this House, and I hope it will be given a Second Reading on that account.</P>

      <P>I agree with the statement of Deputy O'Connell, except that portion which was repeated by Deputy Moore, that the Government should outline their views on this matter.  I do not think that would be possible or <Col N="2075" /> desirable.  Like Deputy O'Connell, I am disappointed that Deputy Ryan has not moved his amendment.  I think it would have given the House an opportunity of examining the question and seeing if such a Bill was necessary. The only case put forward in favour of the Bill was the necessity of protecting the public.  That is the only case that could be put forward.  Although Deputy de Valera does not intend to oppose the Second Reading, he said, and said very truly, that this matter could be met in another way.  Of course it could.  Auctioneers' licences should not be granted to people unless they can be held responsible for the money that comes into their hands.  That could easily be done if there was some regulation in existence which would compel applicants for licences to have an insurance policy or some other security, so that the public would be protected against fraud or embezzlement. If that was the case I do not think there would be any necessity for this Bill.  Deputy Haslett stated that if the Bill was passed, the public, in addition to being protected, would have their business carried out in a business-like way.  I do not see how that could be done, except Deputy Haslett wants to contend that no one should be permitted to act as an auctioneer unless he had some experience, or had served an apprenticeship to the business.  I am not aware that a case has been made that the public have at any time suffered through the inefficiency of auctioneers as apart from their probity.  It has not been suggested that they have suffered in that way.  The public are very careful when dealing with auctioneers, and do not often place their business in the hands of people, as a Deputy said, with shady antecedents.  Deputy O'Connell stated that plumbers might be applying to-morrow.  I would not say that, but you might have egg merchants and fowl merchants.  They pay licences in order to carry on trade, and they might come along next year and endeavour to make their business a close preserve.  The danger behind this class of legislation is that if you try to make a profession of an ordinary <Col N="2076" /> business, undoubtedly a close preserve will be made for some people.  I do not wish to vote against the Second Reading of the Bill, but I think it deserves very close consideration.  I do not see the necessity for the Bill if the other measures for the protection of the public are taken in a direct way.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out that the council shall consist of certain people and they have suggested amendments to that.  Both the original and suggested amendments propose that the new council will be appointed by the Council of the Association.  I do not know anything about the Council of the Association, but I would like to know why the members should not have the appointment.  That is a matter for Committee Stage.  I do not think there is any necessity for making a profession of auctioneers, any more than there is any necessity of making a profession of egg and fowl dealers who also pay licences.  I am sorry that Deputy Ryan did not move the amendment, so that the House would get an opportunity of examining the whole matter.  As Deputy de Valera said, I think the matter could be met in a simple way, and Deputy de Valera, and people like myself who agree with that, should stand for that method.</P>

      <P>Apparently Deputy Moore took seriously what I took to be the semi-jocose remarks of Deputy O'Connell, because I cannot conceive the Government outlining a general policy for organising all crafts and trades.  I do not think any such Bill would be possible.  At any rate there is a great distinction between professions or trades which are handling the money of the public, and those which are not, but which are merely doing their work in the ordinary way for a wage.  Deputy Moore also contrasted auctioneers with solicitors and said that solicitors have not to provide bonds.  I suggest that auctioneers and solicitors are in an absolutely different position.  The public is protected from fraudulent solicitors, to a large extent, by the fear that solicitors have of being struck off the rolls.  If a solicitor does wrong he is brought before the Incorporated Law Society and <Col N="2077" /> he is not allowed to practise.  As far as I understand it, an auctioneer who commits a fraud can next week or next year take out a licence and continue to practise.  Of course the public will, probably, protect themselves by not dealing with such a man.</P>

      <P>As I understand, as long as a man planks down £10 he must get a licence.  This Bill is to prevent such a thing happening.  Naturally the public will take steps to protect themselves, but you have to consider a case where such a man might set up in another part of the country as an auctioneer.  The Government Party have not committed themselves to the support of this Bill, so that each Deputy is free to take any line he wishes. At the same time, the majority of us believe that some such Bill as this is necessary.  I agree entirely with Deputy de Valera that it will require very great scrutiny in Committee.  We are supporting the Second Reading because we believe that some such Bill is necessary for the protection of the public.  I believe that the Bill secures that by the provision of this bond.  For that reason, I am giving the Bill my personal support.  The majority of Deputies on this side are supporting it also, but each Deputy on these benches is free to take his own line.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that the Minister could meet all that is to be gained by making a regulation that the person concerned should provide security by way of an insurance bond or by way of surety.  I think that would require legislation.  The Minister has no such power at the moment.  There is admitted necessity for some type of Bill, and since this is the measure before us, I support its Second Reading. In Committee, we can see what is objectionable in it and what is not.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the remarks of Deputy Gorey.  I conclude that the Bill to which we are giving a Second Reading is really the Bill as amended by this memorandum which the movers of the Bill have accepted, and <Col N="2078" /> which the House has been assured will be placed before the Committee and accepted by the promoters.  I further conclude from the criticism levelled at the Bill from all sides of the House that there will be many other amendments moved in Committee, and that even when the Bill comes from Committee it may not be safe if it does not allay the fears of Deputies.  Many points which would be Committee points could be mentioned.  It is obvious that a man who auctions hay in Galway or some such county would not require a bond to the amount that a person auctioning property valued for thousands of pounds would require. That is, of course, a matter for Committee consideration.  I support the Second Reading of the Bill on the understanding that it is not the Bill before us, but the Bill as amended in accordance with the memorandum, and that careful consideration will be given to its provisions in Committee.  The title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to make provision for the registration and control of auctioneers, valuers, house and estate agents, and for other purposes connected therewith.&rdquo;  I think that title is wide enough to permit of any amendments we desire to introduce for the purpose of meeting any fears which are entertained.  It is on that understanding that I support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that <Col N="2080" /> there is a necessity for this Bill, if only in the public interest.  Only six or seven months ago cases were brought to my notice in which I was asked to intervene on behalf of some poor girls from the country who were victimised by an auctioneer. That man should never have been an auctioneer.  He lived in a garret. That was his only address.  You might call twenty times a day, but would never find him in.  After a good deal of judicious legal intimidation and after taking him into court, he reluctantly refunded the money he had received from these poor simple country girls.  I do not believe that the auctioneers, bad as they are, have introduced this Bill for their own benefit.  I think they realise there are black sheep amongst them and want to get rid of them.  That, I think, to a great extent is the spirit that underlies the Bill.  If the auctioneers wanted to advance their own interests they could have done much better by organising themselves into a trades union, membership of which would bring them more than this Bill will. As far as I can understand from the memoranda we have been supplied with, which pleases me better than the Bill itself, the auctioneers are satisfied to accept a scale of fees sanctioned by the Minister.  If my interpretation of the memoranda is correct, that is a very important thing.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in having a council elected by a limited franchise.  I do not see why all the members of the Association of Auctioneers should not elect the council.  I think a council elected by the full membership would command more confidence than one elected on a limited and small franchise. I hope the amendments to be introduced by the promoters of the Bill and the members of the House generally will get careful consideration. I intend voting for the Second Reading of the Bill on the condition that certain amendments are introduced on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied the Bill rather carefully and I cannot see any necessity for it.  I would like to know who is going to elect the council in the first instance?  Three are to be <Col N="2081" /> appointed by the Minister, but who is going to appoint the other thirty? Deputy Hennessy referred to the proposed new Section 15.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Provided the consent of the Minister shall have first been obtained in writing, the Council shall have power to fix a minimum rate of fees which can be legally demanded by registered persons for work done or services rendered, but the failure to charge or observe said minimum rate of fees shall not be a ground for removal of any person from the Register.</P>
      <P>The minimum rate of fees?  What about the maximum?  Is this ring to be formed amongst auctioneers going to fix the maximum rates?  Who is going to fix the maximum rate that the unfortunate people of the country will be fleeced into paying?  I would like to hear someone tell us the qualifications that will be necessary under the Act to become an auctioneer, or what degrees will have to be taken out.  We will probably hear that later from the Grand Preceptor of the Black Rod.  The only qualifications that I could ever attach to an auctioneer are, first, that he should be a good shouter and, more necessary still, that he should be a good liar.  These, to my mind, constitute their principal qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part I am not prepared to see the Bill getting a Second Reading when we have no assurance as to the type of amendment that can or cannot be moved on the Committee Stage. We had experience of that before when amendments were refused because it was held they were against some principle supposed to be contained in a Bill when it got a Second Reading.  I want to warn Deputies of that danger.  It seems to me that the purpose of the Bill is to form a close borough for a profession that does not exist.  I see no necessity for the measure at all.  At present people have a way out in this sense, that if one auctioneer demands too high a fee they can go to another auctioneer whose charge is more reasonable.  But if this measure is passed into law it will mean that you will have an <Col N="2082" /> auctioneers' ring.  That would be a most dangerous precedent to establish. I entirely object to the Bill.</P>

      <P>My inclinations are altogether against closed boroughs or closed corporations of any kind.  I have had some experience of auctioneers and I say that a case has been made for this Bill.  All the arguments that I have heard against it are more or less arguments in its favour.  I admit that it is necessary that the public should be protected. In moving the Second Reading of the Bill, Deputy Leonard read out a long list of judgments obtained against auctioneers which could not be executed.  He also referred to cases in which compositions had to be made. People throughout the country have had experience of that.  In many instances that was due to the fact that people with no qualifications were allowed to rush into the auctioneering business.  As I know myself, some of them went into it because of the fact that a friend was about to sell some property.  They paid the fee of £10, and this enabled them to earn £30 or £40 on that one transaction.  Deputy Corry asked about the qualifications of auctioneers.  His definition was that they should be good shouters and good liars.  Would the Deputy tell us what the qualifications should be for membership of this House?  The definition that the Deputy gave of auctioneers could possibly cover the qualifications necessary for membership of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I did not hear what the Deputy said.  I intend to support the Second Reading of the Bill though there are certain things in it which possibly none of us like.  At any rate, I think it is a step in the right direction.  If the Bill is properly handled by a joint committee of both Houses I believe that it will emerge a very useful measure for the protection of the public generally.  It will mean that people who want to place their goods or property in the hands of an auctioneer will have a wide field to <Col N="2083" /> select from.  The auctioneers carrying on business will be men with a guarantee behind them; they will be men of probity and honesty with an organisation behind them.  It will ensure, too, that people's property will be properly dealt with, and that whatever money is paid in will be handed over to the vendors in full.  With some little amendment, I think the measure can be made a useful one.  I intend voting for the Second Reading of it.</P>

I would like to have a more detailed explanation of what the Bill proposes to do than we have got so far.  At present I am completely at sea as to what the primary intention of the Bill is.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy White says that it is intended to safeguard the public. I would like to safeguard the public, but I definitely do not know how the public are going to be protected by this Bill.  If I take the cases mentioned by the proposer of the Bill, how is a bond of £2,000 going to protect the public? He mentioned the case of a man who settled at 5s. and who went down for £5,000.  How are you going to protect the public against a man of that kind? To make the bond sufficiently large in that case it would have to be a bond for such a sum as would prevent all but a very small section from ever becoming auctioneers.  Take another case mentioned by the proposer, when a man went down for £17,800.  In such a case, unless you are going to make the bond so big that it would prevent any new man from coming into the business, the bond is going to be useless. These things may be met in Committee, but there are some things even that cannot be met in Committee. To my mind the public cannot be absolutely safeguarded, financially, in this or any other business.  As far as the other provisions of the Bill are concerned, as for trying to get a man <Col N="2084" /> of integrity and probity, there might be a case to be made for it.  Probably a case will be made for it when the Bill goes to Committee, but even before the Bill goes to Committee I think it has killed itself.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to get by legislation any safeguard for the public in a Bill of this kind, if it is not provided for in the principle of the Bill.  We all know that the reputable auctioneers of the country do practically all the business, and that they will continue to do so. The public fight shy of the man with a bad reputation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries alluded to the fact that an auctioneer may burst in business and start again.  The public generally have some commonsense and will not entrust their business to a man of that description.  The commonsense of the public will always be their greatest safeguard, and the public must be left some discretion to employ what auctioneers they like.  As I say, if there could be a reasonable proposition put up that would safeguard the public, I could see a great necessity for the Bill.  I am voting for the Second Reading of it just to see what amendments can be introduced to make it acceptable to the House and to me personally.  I am pointing out the difficulty I see, that if the bond is to be of sufficient magnitude to protect the public in this business, it is going to have the effect of preventing the ordinary honest citizen, without a very large capital, from ever becoming an auctioneer.  For that reason I think there will be grave danger in any section which is intended to safeguard the public financially in this or any other business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Bennett and other Deputies who have put forward certain objections to this Bill.  I fully recognise that some protection is necessary for the public, but as the proposition is put forward in the Bill, it is protection without protection. Deputy Bennett has very lucidly pointed out that an indemnity of £2,000 will not safeguard the public against a man who is carrying out a transaction involving £20,000.  £18,000 of that £20,000 will not be covered at <Col N="2085" /> all.  Again, as Deputy Bennett has properly pointed out, when it comes to a huge transaction of £20,000, where is the man in the country who can secure a sufficient indemnity to enable him to carry out that transaction, and at the same time give the public protection? There is no such man, and the only result of such a provision would be that the auctioneering business of this country would be confined to a limited few in the near future.  In a matter of this kind, the public are free agents. There are plenty of reputable auctioneers in the country, and if there are disreputable auctioneers, the man who entrusts any business to them is a man who deserves to pay for his stupidity and carelessness in the management of his own business. I agree that more protection is needed, and if the Bill had been properly drafted, so that it was clearly intended as a matter of protection, and that there were some practical suggestions contained in it that would convince anybody that it secured protection for the public and nothing else, I would agree whole-heartedly with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do fear, I hope I am wrong in my fears, that there are other matters underlying the Bill that certainly are not intended as protection for the public.  I grant that there is such a thing as protecting the public in the case of default by men holding certain positions.  Take, for instance, the position of rate collectors.  The public have to be protected there, and the holder of the position has to have the necessary indemnity.  He has to be guaranteed by a guarantee society. When he goes out with his warrant he must have sufficient security to cover and indemnify the public to the amount of that warrant.  His books also are examined every month.  These are indemnities for the public, but this Bill as it now stands does not hold any indemnity for the public.  I would certainly be whole-heartedly with the moves of the Bill if I could see that protection was afforded, and if they had afforded that protection on lines which would not debar any worthy man from entering this business.  I can see only one protection, protection on the lines provided by rate collectors, <Col N="2086" /> who secure the necessary indemnity for the public before they are handed their warrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  Every Bill needs amendment, but I think a Bill should be produced in a form on Second Reading that would leave the least ground for complaint.  We have got three memoranda about this Bill. Each one suggests amendments.  So much so that one does not know what the Bill is about at all.  Personally, there are a few amendments which I would like to suggest, but I do not think that those amendments would be quite in order.  I am very sorry that Deputy Dr. Ryan did not stand by his motion.  My colleague has spoken about the suggested bond.  The bond is limited to £2,000.  A bond of £2,000 may be all right; the premium may not be very great and any ordinary auctioneer may be able to meet it, but what is a bond of £2,000 to the average individual who has to deal with an auctioneer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the cattle salesmen in Dublin are exempt.  For the life of me, I do not see why they should be exempt as they are auctioneers to all intents and purposes. I might take the mover of the Bill. He may sell cattle by auction; if he does a bond of £2,000 is required.  If he sells them in the market there is no guarantee or bond required.  I am not saying that Deputy Leonard is an individual <Col N="2087" /> who is likely to run away, but I am pointing out that as far as cattle salesmen in the market are concerned, when cattle are sold in the market, there is no guarantee for them.  At first when I was interviewed by some of the auctioneers they told me they would not bring them in.  They interviewed me again and told me there would be a guarantee.  This evening I was interviewed and I was informed that it was intended to introduce an amendment to that effect.  I do not see how such an amendment could be brought in under this Bill, because it would alter the title of the Bill, and I do not think the Ceann Comhairle would be able to accept this.  The Bill is entitled &ldquo;Auctioneers, Valuers, House and Estate Agents Bill.&rdquo;  I would like to know how cattle salesmen could be brought into that Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other merchants are as well entitled to a Bill as the auctioneers.  It is a mockery to say that the Bill is for the protection of the public.  It is not for the protection of the public.  It is for the protection of a closed borough and for that only.  I have spoken to a good many auctioneers.  These auctioneers were in the association, but they said they were forced into the association for the simple reason that they felt that if they were not in the association before the Bill became law, they might have a difficulty in getting in afterwards. A good many auctioneers do not want this Bill at all.  If the Bill passes Second Reading, we will have a motion for a Money Resolution. We will have the same people in a day or two afterwards saying that taxes are too high and that we have too many officials.  In this Money <Col N="2088" /> Resolution the Minister will have to have a representative on the Council. That means more taxes on the people.</P>

      <P>Is that all you know about it?  The hairdressers brought in a Bill some time ago.  There is no reason why they should not get it passed.  A hairdresser has as much right to have a licence as a bankrupt salesman.  I am sorry that Deputy Ryan did not stand by his amendment. I daresay there is no reason why cattle salesmen should not be included, but a £2,000 bond is no good in their case. Any cattle salesman can sell £5,000 or £6,000 worth in a week.  They can do away in a few weeks with £16,000.  In the month of September they may have £30,000 worth of property in their possession.  Therefore a bond of this amount would be of no use.  If it were to take any effect it would have to be arranged in the same way as the insurance companies arrange it in the case of employers' liabilities.  The premium and the bond should be for ten years. That is the only way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Nolan was quite serious in what he said.  I believe he had some assurances from the people who introduced this Bill that the bond would be regulated.  At least I have some little assurances from them that the amount of the bond would be in proportion to the amount of dealing that an auctioneer carried on over a stated period so as to ensure a reasonable amount of security.  There is hardly a doubt about it.  Since the war the public have been subjected to a great deal of hardship and losses through the <Col N="2089" /> actions of auctioneers.  The Government could have stepped in and have proposed perhaps a better system of licensing auctioneers.  What I would like to see and what I am sure the Committee will ensure is that this auctioneering business will not become highly centralised and left in the hands of a certain number of auctioneers down the country who have a monopoly in the good name they hold and who as often as not prevent younger people from starting.  I take it the bond will be regulated so as to allow beginners to enter into what will now be the profession of auctioneering, and that it will be in proportion to the transactions carried on.</P>
      <P>We have to deal with different classes of auctioneers.  The ordinary country auctioneer is concerned with the sale of live-stock, farm implements, land and all that kind of thing.  It is necessary that those men should have a certain knowledge of the value of the commodities that they sell.  Here in Dublin you have men who perhaps have a greater turnover and deal with commodities that are sometimes of great value and sometimes demand information and knowledge that the average country auctioneer does not have.  For that reason I think it would be very advisable if the business were put on a professional basis, and that in the near future the council that will be set up should have some form of examination.  Considerable losses have been incurred by people through the country allowing auctioneers to sell valuable furniture, pictures and other objects, who did not understand the value of them.  I believe those things should be offered to auctioneers who could produce some definite indication that they had passed a certain form of examination which would guarantee a knowledge of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that the committee which will examine this Bill now will give the same information as the committee which Deputy Dr. Ryan proposes.  It seems to be rather superfluous to have Deputy Ryan's committee set up.  I do not think that the principles of the Bill will exclude us from introducing amendments that will make it acceptable <Col N="2090" /> to the community and will make it a definite guarantee.  I believe it is quite broad enough, and I believe that the people who introduced it are anxious that the Bill would really attain the object they meant it to attain, that is the security of the public.  At the same time I would like to see definitely guaranteed in that Bill that it would not have the effect in the different countries throughout Ireland of leaving the auctioneering business completely in the hands of certain people in each county.  I think the young people ought to get an opportunity of entering that business with a bond which would be security enough for a small business.  I have no misgivings in allowing the Bill to go through, and I have confidence that the committee will make such a report that we will be in a position to amend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time my experience of an auctioneer is that when he gets a deposit on a farm or gets the price of furniture or cattle, and that when later on financial difficulties arise there is nothing to prevent him calling a meeting of creditors and paying a composition.  I think that is not a state of affairs which should be permitted.  I can only speak from the experience I have had of country auctioneers.  I know myself there are a large number of respectable, honourable men in the business, but I have known in other cases where considerable difficulty had arisen between the time when a deposit had been paid to the auctioneer and the date of completion of the sale and where many an unfortunate poor man in the country lost his deposit.</P>

      <P>Of course all the honesty of the country is concentrated in Cork. Very often a poor man loses the deposit that was paid on a farm by reason of the auctioneer getting into difficulties between the date of the sale and the date of the completion of the sale.  That state of affairs should not be allowed.  I believe that the Bill is very sound in principle, and for <Col N="2091" /> that reason I am going to vote for it. I believe if it is amended in a reasonable way and passed, that it will be a considerable safeguard to the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated by certain Deputies, who ostensibly support the Bill and yet are suspicious of some of its provisions, that the only argument that has been used by its promoters is that it is for the protection of the public.  In my opinion that argument alone is sufficient to justify the introduction of the Bill, and that is the main reason why the Bill has been introduced.  Certain analogies have been made between auctioneers and people connected with other businesses.  I think it was Deputy Brennan who referred to fowl and egg dealers.  There was no analogy there. The auctioneer holds the money in trust for his clients.  The fowl dealer, if he buys fowl, has to pay at the time of purchase.  I could hardly visualise a country-woman giving a couple of dozen fowl to a fowl dealer without being paid for them.  The same thing applies to the selling of eggs.  Therefore there is no analogy between auctioneers and fowl and egg dealers.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced mainly to protect the public and as such I think it should have the support of all Deputies in the House. Any one who has had experience of the auctioneering business during the past six or seven years knows that very serious losses have been incurred by people least able to bear these losses, the small farmers in the Free State, and if this Bill can do anything to prevent a repetition of such losses it will have done much to improve the position of the people in the country.  For that reason, I am heartily in sympathy with the principle involved in this Bill. If there are any sections of it which do not find favour with any Deputy it might be possible, when the Committee Stage is reached, to have general agreement.  I think on the whole the Bill ought to command the support of every Deputy in the House.</P>

Nearly every Deputy who has spoken has been more or less in favour of it, and they all are agreed that something of the kind is needed. Deputy Nolan, who is more interested in a Hairdressers Bill than in an Auctioneers Bill, has admitted that he has not read the Bill.</P>

I think that should leave him without doubt in the matter.  The Bill will go before a joint committee and every amendment proposed will get full consideration.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy O'Reilly's question about security for those who are not already in the association, they will have a much better opportunity of getting into the association now than they had years ago, because heretofore it depended altogether on the council whether or not they would be admitted.  If this Bill is passed and if the council refuses to admit them for some flimsy reason, they can appeal to the court; they can place their case before the court, and if the objection to them is not reasonable they must be admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards insurance, I think it is very unfair that auctioneers who pay their licences should have to pay several insurance premiums.  I have been secured in two or three different bonds.  You have got to have a bond for the Bankruptcy Court or any other receivership.  If this Bill is passed one bond will cover everything, so that it will be a certain relief.  There has been a good deal of discussion as to the amount of the bond.  That will be considered in Committee and will probably be fixed according to the business.  Somebody has said that few people would be able to enter into a bond for the large furniture business which some of the auctioneers in Dublin do.  On the other hand, there would be very few of these sales. Somebody remarked that solicitors had not to enter into a bond.  The Minister for Fisheries has answered that <Col N="2093" /> question.  He said that when a solicitor defrauded he was immediately struck off the register.</P>

      <P>It is for the solicitors to look after that.  The Land Commission have a claim on auctioneers since the 1924 Bill was passed.

      <P>The Land Commission insist on the auctioneer making sure that the annuity is paid.  That was imposed by an Act that was passed in 1924 or 1925.  I do not think it is necessary to deal with Deputy Brennan's point in regard to egg merchants. It was asked why should the present council appoint the first council.  It is for the reason that there is no one else to do it, and it is only in the first year that it will be done.  Afterwards, the members of the association will appoint the council in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any other serious question to decide.  I think the House and everybody here is practically in favour of the Bill and everybody sees the necessity for it.  I can assure you that the auctioneers are anxious that the Bill should go through this House and come out as perfect as possible.  We cannot expect the Bill in its present form to be watertight. We realise the fact that though the Government Ministers here have draftsmen to prepare the Bills which they have to introduce, yet these Bills require amendment, and it is hardly to be expected that a Bill of this kind would not need very careful amendment. <Col N="2094" /> What we want is that the Bill should pass through the House as perfect as possible.

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925).</P>
      <P>This is a very brief Bill and I move it in the absence of my colleague, Deputy P. Boland.  The purpose of the Bill is to get a change made in the Local Government Act of 1925 whereby members of county councils who attend at least 50 per cent. of the ordinary meetings of each county council or board of health would be paid expenses instead of, as at present, payment being made only if there is a minimum attendance of 75 per cent. at such meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some counties there are very long distances which members have to travel from their homes to the place of meeting.  Sometimes in the year it <Col N="2095" /> is not possible for members without very great sacrifice to attend a sufficient number of meetings to enable them to qualify for payment of their travelling expenses.  I would like, and I am sure everybody here would like, that as far as possible, except where sickness intervenes, members of county councils, boards of health and other such important bodies should attend if possible every meeting.  But that is aiming at an ideal, and while we have to aim at what is an ideal, we have to face facts as they are.  We realise that even this Assembly, which, I suppose, looks upon itself as a much more important body than county councils or boards of health, does not get a 75 per cent. attendance all the year round at its meetings.  Sickness and other things of that kind over which the individual has no control arise to prevent members attending to their duties regularly on these public boards.  Once the principle of payment for attendance at meetings, that is to say, payment of travelling expenses, is admitted, I think it is only fair that 50 per cent. should be taken as the minimum instead of 75 per cent. as heretofore.  That should be admitted when one takes into account the obstacles that are in the way of many members of such bodies giving a full attendance.  I do not know what the attendance in Mayo would be, or what the attendance in Cork would be.  Both are large counties.  I do not know what their attendance would be compared with the attendance at meetings in places like Louth.  I have not any figures, but I imagine it is much more difficult to get a good attendance in places like Cork or Mayo than in places like Louth or County Dublin. Certainly it is very easy to get to a meeting in the County Dublin.  They have there a variety of conveyances. That is not the case in other parts of the country.  This matter has been brought to the notice of members of our Party by members of the Party who are also members of the county councils and boards of health and by colleagues of theirs who complain that while they may have been attending almost 75 per cent. of the meetings of the local bodies, they might be 1 per <Col N="2096" /> cent. or 2 per cent., perhaps, under the figure fixed by the Act of 1925. Therefore, according to the law as it now stands, they would not be permitted to put in a claim for their travelling expenses.  For my part, I would go further and allow sufficient to members on public boards where it would be convenient to do so to give them a meal.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I know this is outside the Bill, but I wish to mention it in passing.  If I had my way I would make some such provision for those who have to go long distances.  I will not discuss the matter further than to say that I think it justifiable, in the public interest, that they should be given a meal, because in the case of many county councils and boards of health members have to leave early in the morning and they do not get home until late at night.  They are at business connected with public authorities all day long.  However, that is not our present proposition. I desire to move that leave be granted to introduce this measure.</P>

      <P>In opposing the introduction of this measure I will submit to the promoters what has been suggested by Deputy O'Kelly himself, that this is a very small point which can hardly be referred to without going outside it. Part of the Local Government Act of 1925, which this Bill proposes to amend, consists of a section, introduced at that time with a certain amount of diffidence, making provision, not for the payment of the total cost of travelling expenses to members of county councils, boards of health, and generally committees of local bodies, whose members have to travel certain distances to meetings, but a provision to make a contribution towards their travelling expenses.  It was restricted in many ways.  In the first place, the members had to attend for a period of not less than three <Col N="2097" /> hours if the meeting lasted longer, and if the meeting laster shorter than three hours, they should attend the whole of the time.  A person had to travel five or more miles before he became entitled to get any contribution towards his expenses.  In the case of persons travelling by rail the rate was 4d. a mile, and other than by rail, 5d. a mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of making payments was introduced with a certain amount of diffidence.  Various aspects of the matter have been subject to criticism. Some people still hold, as was then held, that the whole principle is undesirable, that much good local government work was done in times when there was much more difficulty in travelling and there was no payment of expenses.  Others have criticised the amounts of 4d. and 5d. a mile.  Others criticised the necessity for a person spending three hours at a county council meeting that might last all day.  County council meetings begin at 11 o'clock, adjourn for lunch at 1 o'clock, and then continue in the evening.  It was pointed out that a person who attended from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock, during a very material part of the business, and then did not turn up after the luncheon interval, should not be counted as being present at the meeting for the purposes of expenses. There were all kinds of criticism of the provision regarding payment.  Now Deputies Boland and O'Kelly bring in this Bill for the purpose of amending that original provision. They suggest that persons travelling certain distances should get what might be tantamount to a small subsistence allowance&mdash;a contribution towards a meal.  Somebody else might bring in a measure dealing with the <Col N="2098" /> necessity for attending three hours, or increasing the rate 4d. to 6d. and 5d. to 8d.  My attitude with regard to these small amendments relating to local government legislation is to oppose them, except a very strong case can be made out in their favour.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that we propose to introduce, at the earliest possible moment, legislation that will remodel the county council machinery. I have been approached on different aspects of this matter, not upon this particular point raised by Deputy O'Kelly, but upon other matters.  I have suggested to those who have approached me that a thing which has stood for six years may very well stand for another year, when the whole principle, as well as any details that require to be straightened out, will be dealt with, if the principle of the thing is approved of.  I think we may very reasonably leave the subject matter of the Bill to be considered in connection with the general measure that will be introduced remodelling local government machinery.</P>
    <P>I am not opposing the introduction of this Bill because I disagree with what is in it.  I am opposing it because, to a certain extent, it is inadequate.  It does not make any attempt to cover the general thing which has been the subject, from different quarters, of various types of criticism.  As we are on the eve of introducing important legislation that must deal with this general matter, I suggest that there is no need for this measure.  I suggest that in the first place it is undesirable, and, in the second place, there is really no need for pressing this Bill at the moment.</P>
