      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state what progress has been made with respect to the payment of the Dáil Loan (Internal) 1919-1920, in the former Parliamentary Constituency of South Sligo; and if he can state the total number and amount of claims outstanding, and what time will elapse before these claims are finally dealt with.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the repayment of sums subscribed to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-1920, in the former Parliamentary Constituency of South Sligo, but the compliation of precise figures would entail an amount of labour which, in my opinion, would not be justified.  I may say, however, that approximately two-thirds of the subscriptions in this area have been repaid.</P>
      <P>As to the last part of the question, the position is that correspondence is still proceeding regarding a number of lists which were submitted to my Department by collectors.  There are also outstanding numerous applications from individuals whose names are not included in any list and who have not furnishted satisfactory evidence in support of their claims. The rate at which progress will be made in disposing of these lists and individual applications must necessarily depend to a large extent upon the parties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In my answer to Deputy Wolfe's question I relied on a letter that the Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries received on 4th January, 1928, from the late Secretary to the Cork County Council.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been directed by the Cork <Col N="1355" /> County Council to inform the Department of Fisheries that the County Council, on the motion of Councillor T.J. Murphy, T. D., passed the following resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;Resolved: That in accordance with the offer of the Department of Fisheries to defray half the costs, viz.: £200, for the erection of lights at the entrance to Castlehaven and Glandore harbours, the council authorises such lights to be erected, and that the remainder of the cost be defrayed out of the County Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter is signed &ldquo;E. Callanan.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that letter bear out the line that I have taken in putting my supplementary questions, that the Cork County Council did give that guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely saying that they were responsible for half the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>And they have agreed to contribute that half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very involved matter.  The official responsible for the letter read by the Parliamentary Secretary is no longer secretary to the county council.  The man is dead, but there is no question whatever about the guarantee being given as well as a guarantee for the maintenance that was given in response to a deputation from the districts concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a long time because so far we have only reached the preliminary stages.  Practically all these lands are subject to a Land Commission annuity.  That will add to our difficulties in carrying out the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any chance of the work being carried out before next spring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that these tenants have organised themselves and say that they will not take conacre until the lands are divided, could not the Land Commission take over the lands in the meantime and let them to the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Land Commission could not possibly take them over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there will be a crux there this year if the tenants follow up what they state they intend doing.  They believe they are entitled to these lands.  They have been paying £6 an acre for them.  If the Land Commission <Col N="1358" /> are going to divide the lands at some future date, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he could not take them over immediately and have them let to the people. Whatever profits are got out of the lands this year could then be applied towards a reduction of the rents to be put on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that the lands are subject to a Land Commission annuity.  The owners are entitled to equivalent holdings elsewhere.  Of course they may not claim such an exchange.  The Land Commission cannot take over possession of the lands until the owner has accepted our price and has agreed to hand over possession of the lands. So far, as I have already stated, the negotiations have only reached the preliminary stage.  In the normal course of events it may be twelve months before we reach the stage when a price can be offered for the lands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing yesterday, when the debate was adjourned, the proposal for compulsory third party insurance which is contained in this Bill, and certain difficulties which the Bill did not meet were referred to.  The principal difficulty that arises in consequence of the scheme of insurance embodied in the Bill is the possibility of being denied insurance by insurance companies and consequently being deprived of his right to drive a car.  The Minister and.  I think, Deputy Myles stated that in their opinion anybody who was denied insurance by an insurance company should not be allowed to drive a car.  In the majority of cases that is probably correct, but we have got to face up to the fact, if we are going to <Col N="1361" /> allow that position to be created we are, as Mr. Duff said in his addendum to the inter-departmental committee's report delegating to the insurance companies the power at present exercised through the court to suspend driving licences on statutory grounds, with this difference, that whereas a licence would be suspended by the court after a judicial examination and a public submission of the reasons a licence may, in fact, be suspended by an insurance company which would be under no obligation to state these reasons at all.</P>
      <P>Cases have been known, one has been referred to by Deputy Sir James Craig, of drivers being denied insurance because they became involved in accidents for which they were not to blame.  As I explained, insurance companies have a system by which they obviate the possibility of wasting their funds in cases in the court by paying the costs of their own clients and not arguing between themselves the question of negligence.  That does mean that a person whose blamelessness might be established if the case went into court has not the opportunity given him of clearing his reputation as a driver.  He finds, when he comes to renew his insurance because of the heavy outlay an insurance company had to meet as a result of the accident, that he is refused his policy.</P>
      <P>That applies particularly in the case of buses.  We have been discussing the case of private cars up to the present, but there are very special circumstances existing in relation to cmnibuses.  I think I could fairly correctly say that the present position is that no insurance company wants to take a risk of covering any omnibus company.  I am sure that there are Deputies in the House who know the difficulty that the owners of omnibuses have had to contend with in trying to get insurance cover.  I got the other day a letter from the proprietor of an omnibus service in the city from which I would like to read an extract:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Here again is my own case&mdash;for the year 1930/1931 I had policies (3rd party) for my 4 vehicles, and <Col N="1362" /> the total premiums paid to the Insurance Company totalled £200&mdash; in all cases and for every single claim.  I myself was liable under the policies for the first £25 no matter what the amount of any single claim was.  In the year given I paid out £200, but did not cost the Insurance Co. one single penny.  I had a few trifling claims falling under the £25 clause which I had to meet out of my own pocket and these did not exceed £15! Do you think that I got any sort of reasonable treatment by the Insurance Co. when the renewals fell due?  They simply indicated that the premiums were increased by the equivalent of 100 per cent., so that what I paid £200 for last year would now cost me £400 and that if I didn't like it I could go where I liked with my bus insurances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that the experience of that individual bus owner is not uncommon and that other bus owners have had similar experiences.  The insurance companies do not want omnibus insurance now and the difficulty will therefore arise that it is quite possible that some company or bus owner may either be denied insurance or offered insurance at rates which would be altogether excessive.  If we are going to insist that everybody driving a car is to be insured by private insurance companies then we must provide for the regulation of these private insurance companies.  We must either insist that they give insurance cover to everybody who applies for it or else provide some court of appeal to which a person, who is denied insurance, could apply and which if satisfied that the denial was not justifiable could direct the insurance company to issue a policy.  In addition there should be some check on the premiums charged as otherwise it is quite possible, in relation to particular individuals or the whole class of motorists or the particular class of bus owners, that excessive premiums will be charged. If we pass this Bill in its present form such excessive premiums cannot be prohibited in any way.  There is no power in the Minister or in anybody to interfere. We are all in favour of compulsory <Col N="1363" /> third party insurance.  It is the view of Deputies on this side of the House that if the State desires to make insurance compulsory it should itself provide the facilities but we cannot argue that out now.  What we can insist on is that if the issuing of policies is left to private companies the whole system will be subject to strict regulation to prevent abuse.  If the Bill goes through in its present form there is a danger, even if there is no likelihood, of abuse, and some safeguard would have to be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Lemass has said.  A case came to my knowledge in the last couple of years in which the owner of a private car had the misfortune to meet with two accidents.  Both of these accidents were settled by the insurance company, but when the reinsurance of the car came up the insurance company said to the owner, &ldquo;We will not continue the insurance on that car unless the driver is changed.&rdquo;  I happen to know in that particular case that the owner was quite satisfied that in neither accident was the driver in any way to blame and the insurance companies, if we are to allow that practice to continue, would have the right of depriving men of their livelihood. That to my mind is unfair and I agree with what Deputy Lemass has suggested that there should be some tribunal and that that power should not be placed in the hands of an insurance company.  The dealings I have had with insurance companies have been very fair and equitable but placing such power in their hands is unwise.  We have no guarantee at all that those powers will be wisely used. Therefore I think there will have to be some tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question the Deputy raised with regard to buses I have had several communications from bus owners.  In one of these the bus owner stated that the insurance companies had refused, I suppose for some similar reason, to renew the policy of insurance. The question put to me was: &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; I could not make any sugestion to the bus owner as to what he should do, but it seems <Col N="1364" /> an extraordinary power to put into the hands of an insurance company and say that not alone could they put a number of men out of employment, but that they could put certain bus companies out of business.  One need not stress the point in detail.  I think it is sufficient to say that there is a case which the Minister ought to consider and devise ways and means to meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we certainly agree that a third party insurance is necessary as far as buses are concerned.  We must take into consideration that a big percentage of the buses plying for hire on the streets of Dublin and throughout the various counties in the Saorstát have been bought by their owners on the hire purchase system, with the result that, if an accident takes place, in many cases they are not able to pay compensation to injured persons or to relatives of people who have been killed.  I think Deputies will recollect that in Dublin a year or two ago there was a lamentable accident in which one life was lost and another person was maimed for life.  I understand that, owing to the fact that that particular company had no third party insurance, no compensation was paid out.</P>
      <P>There is another question to which I would like to refer in regard to insurance. It is the question of buses going from the Free State into the Six Counties.  I understand that these buses have been held up in the Six Counties and asked for their third party insurance policies.  Further, I understand that they will not recognise the insurance unless it is taken out with a British insurance company.  I understand that they will not recognise third party insurance policies that are issued by Irish companies.  If that is so in the Six Counties, when we are making insurance compulsory here we should consider whether these policies should be taken out with Irish companies so that the premiums and profits accruing will be kept within the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>The question raised by Deputies I realise is important, but the question for us <Col N="1365" /> is can we, at this particular stage, complete our insurance provisions so that we shall force insurance companies to take people whom they know to be bad risks.  If we do, then we are adding to the dangers that people run as a result of traffic on the roads and we are adding to the price that the ordinary motoring public will have to pay for the insurance policies they take out.  I have pointed out already that although this Bill has been before the public for a considerable length of time the problems that arise for bus owners in regard to speed and other things have not been put before me, although it would appear that some of the problems have been put before individual Deputies. If bus owners put these matters before the Department they would have to be thoroughly gone into and we would get at the realities of the position. We are dealing with a very complicated and widespread thing and except we have the initiative as well as the co-operation of all persons interested in it we are not going to hammer out a scheme in the most satisfactory and fullest possible way. Naturally insurance companies are businesses that look after in the first place their own material interests.  We are dealing here with a special problem. We expect that we are going to have the full co-operation of insurance companies if the companies are going to be regular institutions here, existing on the business that is provided here. I have no evidence at all&mdash;because during all the time that this matter was being inquired into before the Traffic Committee the insurance companies held back&mdash;that they are not going to meet us in the fullest possible spirit of co-operation.  If we are going to force a particular insurance company to take a bad risk I would like to know what the effect of that is likely to be.  It might be possible where an insurance was refused by any insurance company that it would be required to state a case on which the refusal was made and that there might be an appeal to a District Justice as to whether it was reasonable or not, but I would not like to say offhand that we can produce a scheme like that.  There might be a <Col N="1366" /> scheme by which a statement of the reasons for refusing might be argued before a District Justice, but the question arises as to whether that District Justice could order the insurance company to take that particular case.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that insurance companies should be required to test out in the courts the question of negligence in relation to accidents.  If an accident takes place the insurance company should not merely pay damage, but the case should have to be investigated in court as to whether or not their client was negligent, or whether a claim should be directed against the other party. If you do that, although it would be the fairest thing, it is going to ensure that the cost of insurance will be increased and also the profits of the lawyers.</P>

I do not think that it is beyond the bounds of possibility to devise some means of dealing with this problem.  It is a very wide power to put into the hands of insurance companies that they have the right to put men out of employment or to put bus companies out of business.  It is a power that I think this House ought to be slow to give to any insurance <Col N="1367" /> company.  I think if the Minister will give consideration to it he will find that there will be some tribunal to which such a question could be referred for decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is pinning the discussion down to the class of bad risk and the attempt to force the insurance companies to take the bad risk.  I think the issue really arises as to whether we should put the onus on the insurance company of appearing before a certain tribunal to prove that the risk which it has refused is definitely a bad risk because the vehicle is unsafe or the driver is careless or reckless.  Nobody in this House or outside wants to see a person, who has either a faulty vehicle, or is a careless driver, or employs a careless driver, running a motor vehicle.  If the tribunal is satisfied that he is that sort of person nobody is going to attempt to compel an insurance company to insure him and put him on the road.  But there is the case of a man who may have been in an unfortunate accident in the real sense of the word, or who may have had some trouble with an insurance company in regard to the settlement of a claim for an accident in which he was possibly the injured party.  For one reason or another, that man may have been turned down by an insurance company. He may have got a bad reputation or an undeserved reputation, and there should be some tribunal to which he could appeal.  If the tribunal decides that definitely he is not a bad risk there should be some means whereby that man can get insurance and be put on the road.  The Minister says there is a difficulty.  I think a way out might be that the insurance companies who are doing this business might form a re-insurance pool, and whatever company carries that man's insurance could re-insure in the pool formed by the insurance companies.  That would get over the difficulty of the risk and make everybody doing insurance carry the risk of this person which the companies as a body consider an undesirable risk, but which the tribunal to which he has appealed has decided is a risk which <Col N="1369" /> should be undertaken.  At any rate, the person should definitely not be put off the road.</P>
      <P>The matter has been argued merely from the point of view of those who are running buses for profit or of business concerns employing drivers.  But it also affects professional men and commercial travellers.  Motor cars are essential to their business.  If these people were not insured and could not drive a car they could not follow their daily occupations.  In addition to that, the fact that insurance companies have definitely turned them down is a reflection on their personal character and reputation which would not assist them either with their clients, if they are professional men, or with their employers, if they happen to be commercial travellers.  The matter ought to be examined carefully and certainly some machinery should be devised to meet the position which has been dealt with in the House. There is another point which I might mention and that is, since we are compelling drivers to insure, we ought also have some machinery to secure that the premiums charged will be reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Without prejudicing the suggestion made as to this tribunal, I suggest that the Minister should take power under the Bill, at least in regard to public service vehicles, requiring the insurance companies to furnish quarterly returns to him of the number of applications for insuring public service vehicles that have been refused during that period. That would be a moral warning at least to insurance companies that they could not refuse applications without very good reason.  I am sure the insurance companies would regard it as such a warning and would be careful that they would not refuse any case where they could not give substantial reasons.  As well as the returns, there should be given the reasons for refusing the applications.  I think that would be useful with regard to public service vehicles.  I think that the private car case is much less important. It is a purely personal opinion. I think that with the competition that there is between companies, the number of good applications that will be turned down from private motorists for insurance policies will be very few, without at least very considerable justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I see very little difficulty in the case of privately-owned vehicles. If there is an appeal to the District Justice against the decision of the insurance company, the District Justice can decide whether the insurance company is to continue to insure the motorist or not.  If the District Justice has that power over all the insurance companies when each of them, I suppose, will be carrying a portion of the risk, there will be few appeals to the District Justice.  I think there is no great difficulty in that.  I do not see why the Dáil should have any doubts about giving leave to appeal to the District Justice and leaving the power in his hands to decide whether the man should be insured or not.  Everyone knows that there is a great difference between the risk covering buses and the risk covering an ordinary vehicle.  I am sure that the insurance companies who refuse to take buses do so on the <Col N="1371" /> ground that if they took buses generally, and if they are not going to put the bus insurance at an extravagant rate, they will have to raise the premiums on the ordinary vehicles.</P>
      <P>It struck me that as there is a big difference between the insurance of ordinary cars and the insurance of buses we should segregate them.  If you had a mutual insurance company compulsorily established, all the buses having to come into it, when an accident occurs whatever damage is assessed should be distributed evenly over every seat in every bus throughout the country.  If a man has a 20-seater bus he would have to pay a twenty-secondth thousandth part, or whatever is the number of seats in the country.  If you had that you could have a mutual insurance company established compulsorily.  In that case if this mutual insurance company objected to some particular driver or bus there could be an appeal to the District Justice.  I think it would be to the interest of the bus companies to see that no rickety vehicle or bad driver was allowed to be on the road. The problem of the insurance of buses is going to be a difficult one, and at the moment I do not see any way out except for them to come together and insure themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. Murphy Mr. J.X. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if this proposed tribunal is established as Deputy MacEntee suggests and if pressure is going to be put upon the insurance company to take a risk that the Company thinks undesirable that company should be indemnified by the State if they have to pay for an accident incurred by the bad driving of the insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must be careful, particularly in respect of buses, that we shall not be putting a burden upon the well-organised road transport services of this country, because, for one reason or another, we allow others to run buses which in the eyes of responsible and well established and critical insurance companies working here are thought to be bad risks. <Col N="1372" /> I think, however, considering all the disabilities and burdens under which road transport at the moment rests, it would be quite unreasonable that we, for the sake of a bad bus business, should put an additional burden on the State.  We naturally have to think how we can get around that.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the discussion here, what I see I can get consideration for is this: That where a person is unable, after application to all the insurance companies which are operating here, to get any one to insure him at the premium that he considers reasonable, then he might apply to the District Justice to have a case stated&mdash;I do not know whether by one or all the insurance companies working here&mdash;as to the ground on which he was refused the licence.  If part of the grounds on which they refuse the licence are that the vehicles are in a bad condition, or that the drivers are unfit and incompetent, then under this Act, whether it was the case of private persons or public service vehicles, the machinery of the Act could be applied in the testing of the vehicle on the ground arranged for, or for the testing of the fitness or competency of the people objected to as drivers.  The District Justice, with that before him, could then give a decision.  But is the District Justice then to say that this person is fit to be insured at a normal premium, or is he to fix the premium at which, taking all the circumstances into consideration, this particular person or firm should pay for the carrying of the insurance risk?  There might then be an appeal from the District Justice to the Circuit Court either on behalf of the insurance company or on behalf of the applicant.  The question whether we could, by formal provision, make such companies as are operating here combine to accept risks of a particular class is another matter.  These are the lines upon which, so far as I can see after this discussion, that investigation might be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on this question that insurance companies should not be compelled to insure vehicles plying for public hire if defective either from a structural or a mechanical standpoint. However, power is being given under the Bill to have a proper system of inspection of vehicles and to have a proper system of testing as to the capabilities of the various drivers. What I suggest is when these vehicles are inspected and found to be quite all right from the structural and mechanical standpoint and that the driver is found to be competent is as much as a licence is issued to him then it should be made compulsory for the insurance companies to insure drivers whether they be private drivers or drivers of public conveyances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, in the first place, we are here passing an Act to make it compulsory on every user of a motor vehicle to have his driver insured.  We are coming to the point where insurance companies established for the transaction of business are to be compulsorily compelled to insure drivers.  We are asked to embody a compulsory clause in this Bill compelling companies to accept business which they do not want.  I hold that if we are to pass an Act here compelling insurance companies to accept business which they did not want, then, obviously, they would immediately close down their business in respect of that particular type of insurance, and accept no insurance for motor vehicles at all.  That is the difficulty I see in the matter.  In all probability legislation to that effect would mean some of those companies going out of business on the motor side altogether.  On the other hand I <Col N="1374" /> believe if State insurance could be established and if, at the time of the taking out of the registration of motor vehicles, it was possible for the county councils to issue insurance policies it would go a long way to facilitate the owners of buses and motor people in general.  But I think the greatest possible difficulty will be experienced in trying to get companies to accept motor insurance irrespective of the risks.</P>
      <P>It is also very hard to say that you should have to pay for a good risk the premiums that would be demanded by insurance companies in special circumstances.  Certainly some way must be found to cover the risk and there is no way to cover a bad risk except by distributing it over the good risks and making good drivers pay for the bad and careless drivers, so that to secure this you would have to inflict hardship upon the people who are most careful and who seldom or never have an accident and make them pay for the careless.  In my opinion if it is found that insurance companies are not prepared to continue insuring then the Dáil should consider the advisability of having State insurance for motorists in general.</P>

I feel that if I did bring forward an amendment now I should be told by you, sir, that it is entirely outside the scope of the Bill. As a matter of fact, if we come to consider the feasibility of forcing insurance companies to take insurances we shall have to be very careful in our handling of the situation, so that we shall be able to run the gauntlet of the Chair and not be told that it is outside the scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section again there was a point mentioned by Deputy Cassidy a few minutes ago that I should like to bring again to the attention of the Minister, and that is with regard to the possibility <Col N="1375" /> of putting something in this Bill that would make it necessary that any insurance to be done should be done with a company registered in the Free State area.  Recently a case was brought to my notice of somebody who was prosecuted in the Six Counties for not having his car insured&mdash; there is a compulsory third party insurance law at present in operation in the Six Counties&mdash;and though the person charged proved that he had taken out insurance with a Free State company, that was declared not to be sufficient because he should have taken out an insurance with a British company.  That case was reported in the newspapers about a fortnight ago.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of that and irrespective of what they may do in Britain or in the Six Counties area, I think that as we have insurance companies in the Free State area whose moneys are invested in Irish securities and by whom employment is given practically altogether in the Free State area, whose headquarters are here and who are registered here, I think that, as we have such companies in existence, preference ought to be given to them by the State in matters of this kind. We should be glad if the Minister would consider the advisability of giving a preference to what, though it cannot be called an Irish industry, may be called an Irish Free State commercial undertaking which gives employment to our own people and pays taxes here.  We, on this side, would have preferred that the State should take up this risk altogether in the form of State insurance.  But the Minister has already turned down that proposition.  We think, however, that he should give serious consideration to this and the other suggestions we have made.</P>

If the British authorities and the Six Counties authorities are going to legislate against companies which have their headquarters in this country, we should at least give these companies some advantage, load the dice, as it were in their favour, and ensure that whatever additional business may arise under this Act shall be given to them in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I move: Before Section 51 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person hiring a public service vehicle, a street service vehicle or a private hire vehicle shall not become liable to pay any sums by way of damages, costs or otherwise on account of injury to person or property occasioned by the negligent driving of such vehicle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We were discussing on the last section two important points, one of which was the question of compulsory third party insurance for all vehicles.  Sub-section (2) of that section deals with the penalties that are incurred by drivers of vehicles and owners of vehicles which are not insured and which ply for public hire.  As regards vehicles plying for hire there is a doubt as to whether under the existing law a person who hires one of these vehicles&mdash;take, for instance, a taxi&mdash; does not become personally liable for any damage that may be done or for any accident that may arise in the driving of that vehicle.  At the moment that is a difficult point, and is not, I am advised, defined by settled law.  I think the House will be agreed that no liability should attach to the unfortunate hirer of any such vehicle who has no knowledge that the vehicle which he gets into is not insured.  It would be very unfortunate and very unfair that, in a civil action, such a hirer should be liable; and it is to meet such a contingency that this new section is proposed.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the amendment of Deputy Good, if it were necessary.  So far as I understand the law at present all the amendment does is to declare by statute what the law states.  It goes one little step further.  I do not think that that is Deputy Good's intention, but I think the Minister might bear it in mind.  Deputy Good has stated that the unfortunate hirer should not be mulcted.  I quite agree.  I do not think the law at present makes him guilty; but there may be cases in which an unfortunate hirer is himself responsible for the accident.  For instance, if Deputy Good hires a taxi, tells the driver that he will give him an extra half-crown if he gets him to the Kingsbridge within 2½ minutes, and the driver in his effort to do so meets with an accident, the negligence is Deputy Good's just as much as it is the negligence of the driver.  It is the negligence of both of them.  In that event Deputy Good says that the hirer should not be held responsible. In my opinion if there is negligence on the part of the hirer, the liability should remain.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 52:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section deals with a person convicted of an offence against the regulations as regards insurance and yet <Col N="1380" /> there is brought into the same Section the power of combining penalties for that offence with what are ordinary civil court proceedings for damages due to negligence of the driver.  Personally I think it is a very great mistake to confound in any way those two entirely different things.  On general grounds I do not think civil court proceedings should be mixed up in any way with what are proceedings on charges for breaking the law.  The proposals I have put down are directed to remove completely sub sections (1) and (2).  I am now dealing only with sub-section (1).  It gives the court for the purpose of trying an offence against the regulations under this Act, so far as the insurance sections go, the power of inflicting damages in what ought to be civil court proceedings for damages.  It is a great mistake to confound these two things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposal is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute therefor the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where a person is convicted of an offence under the next preceding section of this Act and it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court by whom such person is so convicted that injury was caused to a person (other than an excluded person as defined in this section) or property by the vehicle in relation to which such offence was committed, the Court may if it thinks fit so to do and the person who has been injured or his representative so consents inflict on the person so convicted in addition to any other punishment authorised by this section, a fine not exceeding the damages which in the opinion of the Court the person so injured or his representative would be entitled to recover in an action where negligent driving had been proved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal amounts to this, that where a person has been convicted of using a car not insured, that does not carry third party insurance, the court in using the power that is provided for it at present in Section 51 of the Bill should presume negligent <Col N="1381" /> driving.  That will enable this sort of case to be compensated.  If a person deliberately uses&mdash;and remember, he has already been convicted of an offence under the proceeding section&mdash; a car which does not carry third party insurance and he causes damage to life or property while he is so using that car, irrespective of whether the damage was caused by negligent driving or not, the judge of the court should be empowered to assess damages in respect of such injury.  I do not see why any serious objection could be held to that amendment.</P>
    <P>I think it is notorious that in numbers of cases where action for damages for negligence take place, the judgment is often decided on very narrow grounds.  I have heard it said that you would have as much chance of getting justice by agreeing to the tossing of a penny as by appearing before a court and hoping for a correct judgment in many of the cases where swearing as to negligent driving and cross-swearing to the contrary has to be gone through.  My proposal is simply that all that should be cut out and where a car is used illegally and causes damage to life and property when so used the Justice should be entitled to assume that negligent driving has occurred and he should proceed to assess damages on the grounds the negligent driving had occurred.  If I had my way I would so amend the Bill that all cases of damage to life and property, irrespective of whether they were caused by negligent driving, would be insured against, but as that is not practicable, we should at least make every provision with regard to the class of case dealt with in Section 51.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section is sailing very close to the wind.  It is very much in danger of coming into conflict with the Constitution.  It is far more revolutionary than any of the sub-sections of the Bill known as the Constitution (Amendment) Bill which I think was passed by this House a week or a fortnight ago.  It gives the right to send a pauper to jail for non-payment of a civil debt.  It provides that a civil claim shall be met by an <Col N="1382" /> award from which there will be no appeal.  I am sure that was not present to the mind of the Minister.  I can almost imagine myself present when he was considering it in relation to the Constitution, and I can almost hear him pronouncing the words of a famous judge: &ldquo;I will chance it.&rdquo;  I rather like that, because there is a great deal of good behind this amendment. I would be inclined to swallow the little difference between it and the Constitution and that it should remain subject to one point only, and that is the point that I have suggested in amendment 54:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 30, after the word &ldquo;convicted&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and not exceeding in any case the sum of £25.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whatever I may think about amending the Constitution I certainly do think that you should not give to the District Justice a jurisdiction larger than he has at the present time. That matter has been very carefully considered by the Courts of Justice Committee and there was a unanimous recommendation, after hearing witnesses from all over Ireland, that the justices should be kept limited to a jurisdiction of £25.  At the present moment you are in this position that if a man is injured and is paid compensation under this measure, and if he has not a match to pay it, he has to go to jail for non-payment of a civil debt. If he is insured that will do no great harm.  There might be something in the Constitution against it, but let us leave it and say what the Minister says: &ldquo;I will chance it.&rdquo;  If you limit the jurisdiction to £25 that will be perfectly fair.  I would ask you not to increase by a side-wind the jurisdiction of the District Justice in a civil action beyond what it is at present.  It might be as well to have all the amendments considered together, and therefore I will move amendment 54.</P>

      <P>I do not quite appreciate the Constitutional point that Deputy Wolfe raised except the point is that we are breaking the Constitution by taking power to send an innocent pauper to jail for debt.  We are doing no such thing because this is not an innocent pauper.  He is a <Col N="1383" /> pauper who, under Section 50 (2) can be fined for the first offence £50 and/or get three months and for the second offence £100 and/or get six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is an extension by way of fine to meet particular circumstances.  If Deputy Wolfe goes down Grafton Street and throws bricks into a window there and is hauled before a District Justice, the Justice says &ldquo;I will fine you so-and-so, but if you undertake to pay for the window I will let you off.&rdquo;  Deputy Wolfe will say &ldquo;I will pay for the cost of replacing that window.&rdquo;  It may be £25 or £50 but he pays for it and is let off.  The Constitutional point goes by the board.  This is no case of an innocent pauper.  As to the question of mixing up civil and criminal business, there may be something in that, but I do not even appreciate that point. I was not driven even to the extent of saying &ldquo;I will chance this.&rdquo;  The thing appealed to me from the very start and I think it has met the approbation of most of the people who have read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite understand Deputy Thrift's position with regard to it.  I will come back to Deputy Thrift's position after I deal with Deputy Moore.  Deputy Moore says we are providing here in so far as we can that if a person on the road, as a result of the negligence of other persons, is injured by a motor car, compensation will be available.  Deputy Moore wants to have the position that a person meeting with an accident due to his own negligence shall be entitled to compensation.  We do not intend to go as far as that and I have no sympathy with Deputy Moore's amendment.  In reply to Deputy Thrift, the general position is that there may be circumstances in which a person who is not insured will go out on the road and, due to his own negligence, will meet with an accident.  Being the type of person who drives a motor car without the statutory provision of insurance there is fairly good reason to assume that he may be clearly a bad <Col N="1384" /> mark for insurance.  If so, a poor person injured by such person is put into the position that he has to go before the civil court against this man and incur a certain amount of legal and other expenses and his chances of getting anything by way of compensation are lessened.</P>
    <P>To meet that case we make provision that when it goes before the District Justice the person who has been injured asks the District Justice who has determined the cause of the negligence, to fix by way of additional fine, damages.  The District Justice may do so.  The question of limit arises.  The District Justice in a case of smuggling may award a fine entirely unlimited except by some relation to the amount of goods.  In certain betting cases he may impose a fine of £500.  He is not forced here to deal with any case.  Having considered all the circumstances he is not forced into consideration of amounts outside his capacity or general competence.  I might consider putting in a limit of, say £500, but I think it would almost destroy this section if we put in £25 because a poor person's leg might be broken by a person who was a bad mark.  That person might have a chance of getting £100, but if he had to go to court and fight it out the amount might be reduced to £40 or £50 by the time the legal expenses were covered.  The means might not be there.  I think it is implied in the section that a person who had been found guilty of negligence, and, who in fact had been fined, would have the power to appeal to the Circuit Court. The person who had consented to the fine being fixed by the District Justice would not have any power to appeal because he had asked to have the thing done and it was finished.  I commend the powers contained in this section to the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think that under Deputy Moore's amendment the person who met with an accident, because of his own negligence, by reason of the fact that the vehicle was uninsured, should become entitled to compensation.  We would prejudice the effectiveness of the whole section by putting in a limit of £25 when it is considered than an <Col N="1385" /> accident might reasonably run to £100 in damages, and that the District Justice has power on consideration of all the circumstances to say that the case should not be dealt with in that court.  He has full power to do that and has capacity and competence to deal with larger sums.</P>

It is simply a question that there is a chance of getting the job finished in that court.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister is right.  I am a strong believer in the maxim that if you try to do two things at the same time you do them both badly.  I think that is likely to occur in this case.  This case is brought primarily to settle the question whether the person has obeyed the insurance laws or not.  If he is convicted, for instance, other questions will come up as side-issues and must be treated as such.  I ask the Minister to consider what he has been saying from the other angle. Supposing that a person is a mark and supposing it has been found that he has been negligent the District Justice may say: &ldquo;I will fine you £50 in addition to the insurance penalty.&rdquo; The person may be very glad to consent to that order to save £500 in a civil court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister consider that the sub-section as it stands imposes a considerable hardship on the person who may be convicted? In the ordinary way a person comes before a court to meet a criminal charge&mdash;whether or not in this case he is guilty of a particular offence under Section 50.  This sub-section as it stands empowers a court to proceed on a completely different enquiry, that is as to the amount of the damage that the person convicted of the offence should pay to the person who has been injured.</P>
      <P>As I see the section it is open to the court, once the person convicted is present, immediately to proceed to the assessment of damages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  One of the first ingredients in enabling a court to determine what quantum of damages should be awarded to a person is medical evidence as to the nature of the injuries received by that person. If the section is to be carried into full effect, every person who is prosecuted <Col N="1387" /> under Clause 50 must go to court prepared with medical evidence. He must have the person who was injured examined by some medical expert if he wants to defend the case as to the question of damages.  I think there is an undue hardship on the person who has been convicted under this section. The question of damages raises a completely different issue from the issue before the court, in the first instance, namely, whether the person has been convicted of an offence under a previous section or not.  Another matter that would appear to me to be a grievance, not to the person convicted of an offence but to the person injured, who invokes the aid of the court, is that the proceedings here will be proceedings at the suit of the Gárda Síochána or the Attorney-General prosecuting through a member of the Gárda Síochána for an offence under Section 50.  I am assuming that the person invokes the aid of the court. There is no reason why a person who invokes the aid of the court to have damages assessed, and feels aggrieved by the decision of the court as to the quantum of damages should not have a right of appeal as any ordinary person has from the decision of the District Court.  Under this section, as I see it, the person aggrieved who invoked the aid of the court has no right of appeal.  He is not a party to the proceedings.  The proceedings are a prosecution at the instance of the Gárda Síochána against an alleged offender, and the person who invokes the aid of the court would have no right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  I think this sub-section is trying to short-circuit proceedings which should not be short-circuited.  If a person has suffered personal injury I think the better course for both parties concerned is to let them pursue the ordinary remedy and sue for damages against the person who is alleged to have committed the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is primarily intended to short-circuit cases that should be short-circuited.  Those are cases in which somebody has been injured by a car which is not covered by insurance.  The offender may be in <Col N="1388" /> the eyes of a District Justice a bad mark for damages.  Where the District Justice has found negligence and where there may not be any reasonable expectations of funds being available to pay compensation, the sooner that case is short-circuited, in the interests of the injured party, the better.  If the injured party asks the District Court to finish the question, then he has to take whatever comes to him.  If the person found guilty of the offence is dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, he has the Circuit Court to appeal to.  It is intended to short-circuit cases that in the interests of the injured party ought to be short-circuited by reason of the fact that money in any liberal measure is not available to pay compensation, and that if law costs were to be taken out of whatever money was available the injured person would benefit to a lesser extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1927" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, I cannot see how there could be an appeal to the Circuit Court under this section.  Under the sub-section as it is framed, there is no proceeding whatever, no originating process, in the District Court between the person aggrieved and the person alleged to have committed an offence under the section.  In other words, there is no proceeding whatever in the District Court with regard to that. The only proceedings before the District Court are the proceedings at the suit of the Gárda Síochána or at the suit of the Attorney-General against the defendant, and, ancillary to the powers of the District Justice in that matter, he may award compensation to a third party.  But that does not constitute proceedings between that third party and the party convicted of the offence so as to enable an appeal to be brought to the Circuit Court.  If it is desired to provide for an appeal to the Circuit Court, there should be a specific provision inserted in the section to that effect.  If that difficulty be got over, I still doubt, on the whole, whether the advantage of having a summary method of dealing with a person alleged to have no means out weighs the disadvantages I have indicated.  If a person has no <Col N="1389" /> means, it is quite immaterial what court proceedings are brought in or whether they are brought in any Court.  If a person has no means, I think it would be just as well that the person aggrieved should have time to consider whether he would institute any proceedings or not.</P>

That is not likely to help or cure him.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Finlay has just said.  Some advantage may be secured by this section, but the injurious effects likely to arise will entirely outweigh the advantage.</P>

He is being convicted of an offence under Section 50.  That is to say, he is uninsured against third party risks.  But before he can be mulcted in damages, he must be convicted of negligent driving and he has a right to have a jury to decide whether, in fact, it was negligence that led to the accident.

      <P>I am not surprised that the Minister had such contempt for my amendment.  The only thing he saw in it was the possibility of people who are anxious to commit suicide getting damages against motorists.  I suggest that there is a great deal more in the amendment than the Minister says there is.  I think nobody can be satisfied with the Bill, since it does not cover cases of persons injured through a mishap to a car.  Take a case such as happened in Dublin during the past few weeks.  A man was knocked down in Dame Street and killed.  There was no negligent driving on the part of the motorist, so that no action lay.  If a man meeting with such an accident has big family responsibilities, I do not think that any of us can be satisfied, when we are <Col N="1390" /> making a big change like this, compelling insurance and providing against accidents due to that very doubtful and vague thing called &ldquo;negligent driving,&rdquo; that provision is not made for that type of case.  So long as we are leaving out that big class of case I do not think any of us who take the Bill seriously can be satisfied with its provisions.</P>
      <P>If a man who has no right whatever to take a car on the streets, a man who has already been found guilty of defying the law, does harm to life or property, either accidentally or through negligence, he should be accountable for it.  The difficulty of proving negligent driving is extreme, and I venture to say that in nine cases out of ten none of those concerned is satisfied that justice has been done when the proceedings are over. My idea was to cut out all that in the case of a man who has no right to be on the street in charge of a motor car.  Whatever damage he does, he should be responsible for, irrespective of whether it arises through negligent driving or not.  The Minister says I am trying to deal with people who, through their own negligence, meet with motor accidents. Very few people stand in front of a motor car in the hope that it will hit them and enable them to get damages. The Minister should have seen that that is the case least likely to happen. I am very sorry that the Minister has adopted so contemptuous an attitude towards the amendment, because I am sure it is one which would be more likely to be useful than to cause grievances of any kind.</P>

I said the Deputy wanted to provide for a person injured by a motor car as a result of his own negligence.  Any kind of accident that may be brought about by a car of that type could be brought about where you have negligent third parties.

      <P>In all cases in which persons are injured in circumstances in which the driver of the vehicle was not negligent, the burden of their insurance is to be put upon the driver of the car.  I do not think that is reasonable.  People have to run all kinds of risks every day.  There is the normal kind of personal insurance that prudent people enter into. We cannot put all that down on a few picked classes, with the owners of motor cars in one set and some other classes in another set.</P>

It is a pity that there has not been a full attendance of the members of the Dáil to listen to the powerful case which the Minister has repeatedly made in support of the section as it stands and of his own point of view.  The debate, so far as I have heard it, has amounted to this: that there has been a powerful defence on behalf of insurance companies and of those who are or may be the owners of cars but who will not look after them, or take reasonable precautions to see that they are not used in the wrong direction.  Deputy Moore made a powerful plea on behalf of people who own cars but who will not see that they are not allowed to get into the hands of people who may cause personal injury with them. The point of view that we, as Deputies, have to stand for is that of the pedestrian and of the innocent person who may be injured owing to the carelessness of the owner of a car.  I do not think we are expected to sit here carrying on an unduly prolonged discussion in the interests of insurance companies and people who will not look after their cars.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore apparently is under the impression that under the sub-section as it stands it would not be open to the court to consider whether the aggrieved person had been guilty of contributory negligence in bringing the injury on himself. It is perfectly obvious under the section that that is one of the things the court will have to address itself to.  What the court will have to determine is whether the injuries were caused by the negligent driving of the person alleged to have committed the offence.  If the injuries were caused through contributory negligence on the part of the aggrieved person, then they could not possibly have been caused by the negligence of the person accused.</P>

      <P>I have not anything to say on that point, but I will have it investigated.  Dangerous driving is a thing that the District Justices can deal with.  In certain cases where a person has been driving and has not been insured, we propose that the District Justice shall be enabled to assess negligence and impose a fine. The charged party will have the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  Deputy Finlay thinks that the section as it stands does not secure an appeal to the Circuit Court.  I will have that examined.  I do not know whether that appeal to the Circuit Court would involve a jury.  I will see whether it will not be possible to include a jury when there is an appeal to the Circuit Court.  I can see whether or not we <Col N="1393" /> can round off the matter in that particular way, but I would ask the House to have this particular class of case dealt with by the District Justice on the ground of negligence and with a fine on the application of the injured person when the circumstances dictated that it was a fit case for the District Justice to deal with.</P>

      <P>In the case of a public service vehicle, we require compulsory insurance in respect to third parties who may be injured on the road, the property outside the vehicle that may suffer damage, and the person of passengers inside the vehicle, but we do not require that the property of passengers inside the vehicle should come under compulsory insurance. Ordinarily it would not mean very much but it might mean a lot. A person might be carrying a case of jewels or might have a valuable diamond necklace and we do not think that property of that kind should come under a compulsory insurance scheme.  The section does want some re-drafting, because I realise that as it stands at present if a farmer came from Naas to town and was returning to Nass by bus and the bus ran into some of his own cattle, he should not be compensated for it.</P>

      <P>This is rather an important matter and I find it difficult to say what we might do.  All kinds of questions are asked of persons who come along for insurance. Take a bus company.  It is asked whether its garages are made in a certain way, the gradients of the road and the particular roads that the buses travel, and a lot of other queries running into fifty or sixty questions in some cases.  I have not got the supplementary question form here, but the answers to the questions are made the basis of the contract.  Cases have happened in which certain insurance companies have relieved themselves of the contract by reason of petty conditions not having been attended to by the insured parties.  I agree that it may be necessary to amend this section somewhat like this&mdash;that the liability of the insurer under the policy is not subject to any condition, restriction or limitation other than such as may be approved by the Minister.  It may be necessary to give the Minister power to prescribe the conditions, that if not properly attended to, will void the policy.  On the other hand, there are conditions which it would be reasonable for the insurance company to insist should be fulfilled.  If a private car were being insured and that it was stated by the owner that the car would not be used for racing, it would be reasonable that that condition should be properly adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, condition such as that the person had not a licence at the time or a condition that the machine had to be in good order, or that the driver had to be sober, I do <Col N="1397" /> not think are conditions that we ought to allow to void a policy entered into for the protection of third parties.  I do not know if any Deputies have found themselves up against the wideness of these conditions but there are certainly conditions which some insurance companies have been relying on to void their policy and that we should not allow.  I have been giving consideration to this and I will introduce an amendment on report.  I do not know whether any Deputies have anything to say on the matter in the meanwhile.</P>

      <P>In sub-section 1 to delete paragraph (e), lines 14 to 19.</P>
      <P>It seeks to legalise a contract obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. I would like to point out that there is a certain group of contracts which are voidable by the party misled, who enters into them, unless each Party has disclosed to the other every material fact within his own knowledge or that of his agent at the time the contract is made.  These contracts are known as contracts <i>uberrimae fidei.</i>  These contracts include contracts of insurance.  In these contracts the rule is strictly enforced, as the facts are generally within the knowledge of the insurers alone.  This section strikes at the root of all insurance business and it is doubtful whether the insurance companies will undertake third party risks under the conditions set out here. I am entirely in sympathy with the object of the section, which is the safeguarding of the injured person, but I do not think this safeguarding should be obtained by the introduction of an immoral principle amounting to the condonation of fraud.</P>

      <P>This amendment is much in the same position as the previous amendment.  That is that a false statement may be made in answer to some of the numerous questions I have spoken about which are contained in the application for a policy or in <Col N="1398" /> the subsidiary statement.  Section 59 makes it an offence punishable by two years' imprisonment to make knowingly a false statement, and after giving some consideration to this matter I shall be prepared to amend this section in this particular way&mdash;that a policy shall not be liable to be voided by the insurer on account of any fraud, misrepresentation, or false statement, unless it shall have been proved before the Circuit Court in some way that will be arranged on the initiative of the insurance companies that the person involved in the contract has been guilty knowingly of a series of false statements and misrepresentations such as would void the policy.</P>
      <P>That will safeguard this idea of contract, but I think no contract ought to be voided except a decision were given in the Circuit Court that a false statement or misrepresentation was knowingly made and was sufficiently serious to warrant the voiding of the policy.</P>

      <P>I am not at all happy about the suggested amendment.  We have to remember the person concerned, that is the person who may be killed or injured as a result of the accident.  There should be some obligation on the part of the insurance company to satisfy itself as to the statements made by the insured before it issues the certificate of insurance.  As soon as the person gets the certificate of insurance he is entitled to drive a car within the law.  He may kill or injure a person and the relatives of the killed or injured come forward seeking compensation.  It is referred to the insurance company.  The insurance company may proceed to investigate the statements made and if they find that some of them are false, try to get out of the contract.  I think it is much better that the insurance company should have a definite obligation placed on them at the beginning to take whatever precautions are required to satisfy themselves that the statements are proved, and they should not issue certificates of insurance until they are so satisfied.</P>

I would not be inclined to insist so much on the insured person making a full disclosure in such cases.  My anxiety would be to protect the people injured in motor accidents.  In the other cases of damage to car or damage to property I think the Minister should leave it that the amount of disclosure in an insurance policy could still stand, making some differentiation in cases of accidents to the person.</P>

There were certain contracts relying on the good faith of the parties, the basis is that there are certain particulars within the knowledge of the parties and not within the knowledge of the insurer.  You are now going to upset that.  Up-to-date the premium bears a certain relation to the risk. The Deputy is now going to change the whole basis of the contract previously entered into with regard to the damage to persons and is going to make the insurance companies, for the future, take the risk that the person insured has not made a full disclosure.  Is there likely to be any change with regard to the premiums asked by the insurance companies taking that risk?</P>

      <P>On the section I think this is the best way to raise the <Col N="1401" /> matter.  I want to have some reference to it.  A case has arisen in England where an insurance company was fined for having renewed a certificate of insurance but allowed the person a month's grace to pay the premium. The usual practice at present is that a period of grace is allowed on the expiration of one policy.  After the expiration of one policy the payment of the premium on the second policy, or on the new policy, is dated as from the expiration of the old policy.  A case arose in England where a company gave a month's grace to an insured person and issued the certificate as from the date of the expiration of the old policy.  That was held to be illegal, and the insurance company was subjected to a substantial fine.  The result has been that insurance companies have tightened up the regulation and have refused to issue new policies until the premiums in respect of them have been paid.</P>
      <P>I can see, however, that some difficulties may arise in that connection, due to the fact that the owner of the car may forget the fact that his policy is expiring, and allows it to run two or three days before securing a new policy.  If he drives his car during those two or three days he leaves himself liable to a substantial fine or imprisonment. I would like to know is there any possibility of inserting a provision in the Bill to enable an insurance company to give some period of grace in respect of the payment of the premium while at the same time issuing a certificate of insurance as from the date of the expiration of the old one.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the policies that motorists enter into are of a kind that makes them responsible, say, for the first five, ten, fifteen or twenty-five pounds damage.  It is these small amounts, apparently, that insurance companies are most afraid of. They will give you a policy to cover any damage above £10 or £25.  We want to ensure that that gap there will not be left uninsured and that whatever gap is left there in the policy will be covered by a guarantee.  When we are forcing a company to be insured they will have to get a certificate from a bank or they will have to lodge a certain amount of surety with the company if the company so desires, and then for a nominal fee the company will cover them with the guarantee for one part and all extra costs by their insurance.  A difficulty may arise inasmuch as certain people may want to cover themselves by guarantees with one company, say, with their bankers, and an insurance company will say to them: &ldquo;We will not do your insurance policy except we do your guarantees for you as well.&rdquo;  I understand that bus owners are in difficulties as to how they may be treated in the matter of guarantees by insurance companies. Some of them cover fairly substantial sums before they actually insure.  The <Col N="1403" /> insurance company enters into a policy for damage above the first £500.  The possibilities in that particular section will have to be examined particularly to see that bus companies will not be charged exorbitant rates of guarantee, and that if they do their guarantee in one particular way they will not be in a position of being unable to insure because they have not done their guarantee with the company they ask to insure them.  A combined policy and guarantee, the guarantee to cover the small thing which insurance companies very often require in order to give reasonable premiums, that the first small expenses will be borne by the insured person.</P>

We will endeavour to be as explicit <Col N="1406" /> as possible in that respect.

      <P>I can see some conditions which would be quite reasonable from the point of view of insurance companies and which would not be in any way in conflict either with Section 56 for an approved policy or Section 58 for a combined policy and guarantee.  At present if an insured person does not give all the necessary assistance which he can to insurance companies in defending an action and in procuring witnesses, the insurance company is entitled to repudiate liability.  Under the Act, and under a policy approved of by the Minister, it would not be open to them to take that course.  But I can see a condition added by which the insurer, in the event of his not taking all steps necessary, or by neglect in any way to assist the insurance company to defend a claim on the policy, would render himself liable to the insurance company for any amount that they would have to pay under the policy.</P>

      <P>On this question I would like if the Minister would give us some indication of the nature of the test of competency likely to be applied and also that these tests will be uniform throughout the country.  There is the possibility that the Superintendent of the Gárda responsible for the enforcement of these tests in a <Col N="1411" /> particular area may apply a standard altogether different from that in another area and that a person might be refused a certificate in one area who could obtain it in another.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the test will be taking a person out to drive and going through different evolutions with the car that the ordinary driver in normal circumstances might be expected to go through in handling the car.  I take it that the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána will see that he is technically and properly advised as to the best means and as to the essential things that must be done in order to test the competency of the driver.  As far as standardisation throughout the country and uniformity in the test go I think I can assure the Deputy that the importance of that will be realised by ourselves and by the Commissioner and that all our efforts will be brought to bear to bring about circumstances in which there will be uniform tests.  It is a question of working it out in practice and I think there will be no dissatisfaction at its working.  Any dissatisfaction that may from time to time arise will be readily remedied and settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point that arises.  Personally I am not at all satisfied that these provisions of certificates of competency are going to be of any use whatever.  I think there may be a danger in connection with them. There may be a danger that the driver of a public service vehicle charged with negligent driving may be able to produce a certificate and say: &ldquo;That is my proof that I am a good driver,&rdquo; when in fact it may prove nothing of the kind.  That aspect of the matter was adverted to by some persons who gave evidence before the Departmental Committee, and who were opposed to imposition of tests of competency.  It seems to me that either these tests are <Col N="1412" /> really tests of the competency of the driver in securing them or else they have to be a mere formal business with no satisfactory result at all.  The tests are likely to be mere formal tests.  The actual circumstances under which the driver of a public vehicle is likely to have his skill properly tested cannot be reproduced in any scheme.  They arise under a peculiar combination of circumstances in traffic.  If a man was not fit mentally to estimate distances and speed at sight, and things of that kind, and could have his competency established and his defence on a charge of negligent driving sustained by the mere production of his licence, then it would be much better if we did not have this certificate at all, particularly as I believe that this is a case where people who seek to get a licence and who will not be fit to get a licence will be remarkably few.  Then with regard to the fee to be charged, there is no indication given of the size of the fee. I do not know at what limit it is intended to fix it.  There are a number of people driving buses now who have been driving buses for years, and who probably are as competent now as they ever will be.  Is it intended that these people should pay a fee, whether small or large, to get a certificate?  I think persons driving buses for a period to be fixed&mdash;say, three or six months&mdash; should at least be released from the obligation of making this payment.  It might in the case of some of them be a great hardship.</P>

      <P>I certainly will give consideration to the suggestion that people at present driving or who have been driving for some time should get the certificate of competency without test.  I believe with the Deputy that bus drivers are practically born and not made, and a lot depends upon the temperament of the person, and on the person himself, what he is, as distinct from what he has learned to do with the car.  Nevertheless, I think there is a safeguard here in requiring a certificate of competency. It may be shown in time that that is not very satisfactory, and that the person ought to have a probationary period, but there are provisions <Col N="1413" /> by which a driver's licence could be taken from him.</P>
      <P>No doubt we shall have a review of the general conduct of public service vehicles by the Gárda in a pretty systematic way.  So that I do not know that we should operate our imaginations too much as to what is likely to happen under this section. But I think that it is desirable to have it so that there may be some kind of selective process, so that people obviously unfitted by temperament or otherwise will not be placed in charge of public service vehicles.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister arrived at any definite decision as to what he is prepared to do in the matter of issuing licences to people who are learning to drive either private motor cars or any others?  I think that it is a very important question to consider, and as I said before, a very difficult question to decide.  But I think we should know what the attitude of the Minister in regard to it is, because there is no doubt that people will be seeking for drivers' licences in order to learn driving.  The people referred to here, people with large vehicles, must learn to drive as well.  If they are caught driving without a driver's licence, they will be in a rather tight corner.  I should like to know whether the Minister has arrived at any decision with regard to that.</P>

      <P>There is the driving licence which ordinary persons may get and the driver's licence which is the licence intended for drivers of public service vehicles.  I do not think that any person is likely to come up and apply for a driver's licence who has not been for some time before in possession of a driving licence.  The drivers of buses are generally recruited from rather experienced drivers of other types of vehicle; and I do not think that anyone would issue a driver's licence to a person who is at the same time applying for a driving licence.</P>

I do not think that right will be exercised very often, but I suggest it should be there, and that a person who thinks he has been misjudged as to his driving powers should have the right to appeal to the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to labour the point raised by Deputy Dr. Hennessy on the question of a sight test.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy knows that in the case of railway engine drivers a very severe sight test has to be passed before the engine driver will be allowed to have charge of an engine.  The same sight test applies in the case of a guard or signal man. To a certain extent, not to the same extent, sight tests are imposed and have to be passed in the case of tram drivers.  It is as important in the case of a man who wants a licence to drive a motor bus that he should be obliged to pass a sight test and should be obliged by the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána to produce a certificate of fitness, so far as eyesight is concerned, before he would <Col N="1417" /> be given a licence.  I do know that no such test has been applied up to the present.  I do not see why one set of people charged with responsibility for the safe conduct of the travelling public should be obliged to pass a severe sight test and another section is not required to pass any such test. I should like to know the Minister's view on the matter.  If we are going to have the law fairly applied in the interest of the travelling public it should apply to those who seek licences to drive on the roads just the same as to those in charge of engines on the railways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary for the Minister to look into this matter carefully because colour-blindness is a much more prevalent affection than many people think.  I have had, in the case of a society, experience of thirty people being tested and it was extraordinary the proportion of them who were actually colour blind.  Some were defective only in a small way but there were others defective in a very large way. It would not be a difficult thing when people are getting certificates to have them tested for colour-blindness, and give them an opportunity of recognising any colours shown to them.  I do not think it matters quite so much about short-sightedness as about colour-blindness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a test of fitness for all drivers was considered and it was dropped and we made provision by which a person applying for a driving licence must make a declaration that to the best of his knowledge he is not suffering from any disease or physical or mental disability which would be likely to cause his driving to be a danger to the public.  That applies then to all persons looking for a driving licence.</P>

      <P>As I have said, the question of a test of fitness for all drivers was dropped, and it was only where a person was not prepared to make that declaration that we provide under Section 71 that he can go to a doctor and get a report.  In the light of that report the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána will have him tested as regards competency to handle a car.  The practical test in connection with the doctor's report will decide as to whether he will be given a certificate of fitness.  The discussion now brings us to whether we are going to require, in respect of all drivers of public vehicles who apply for drivers' licences after the passing of this measure, that they shall all have to submit to a physical test, including eyesight and everything else like that. If we had a system like that of requiring a medical report we could not bring them all to Dublin to have them examined in a particular place or by a particular person.  They would have to be examined on the spot by some doctor of their own selection.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is very simple.  I think it is quite possible to rectify short-sightedness by the use of glasses.  It is not possible to rectify colour-blindness by such means.  The great point about it is that the person who is colour-blind as a rule does not know it.  A brown or a red thing may look green to him, but he does not know that he is colour-blind. He thinks his sight is quite good as regards colour.  Deputy Davin refers to the fact that engine-drivers and people like that have to be tested, not for their short-sightedness, which <Col N="1419" /> can be rectified but for their colour-blindness.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that a superintendent of the Guards without any medical experience is competent to say that any man coming before him for a driver's licence has perfect eyesight, or that he could read a number plate of a motor car a certain distance in front of him on the public road?  Could he tell, if asked, the number of a car that was coming towards him or the width of the road?  I think it is a very necessary condition in the interests of those travelling by bus to see that some test is applied by somebody who has a knowledge of what good or bad eye-sight is.  The debate on this Bill has been remarkable for the number of Deputies who spoke about the safety of innocent people.  As far as I can see, there are far more innocent people engaged in the motor industry than any other industry.  The plea raised by Deputy Thrift and other innocent Deputies has been for mitigation of the fines and to see that these people do not get imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this is a new tax that is being brought into force.  Up to the present no fees have been chargeable for public service licences.  Seeing that the Minister is getting very big taxes from these vehicles already is he prepared to defend the idea of a further tax, a tax that is to be indefinite so far as the Dáil is concerned?  Section 76 provides that fees are to be fixed by regulation made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  If the fees are only to be nominal surely he could fit them into the Bill without leaving the matter uncertain and to be made use of by the Minister for Finance for any purpose he may have in mind.  It seems strange that in the case of vehicles already subject to two big and growing taxes&mdash;a seating tax in addition to a petrol tax&mdash;advantage should be taken on a Traffic Bill to increase the taxation upon them.  I would like to hear from the Minister what is his idea for introducing further taxation on these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea primarily is to meet expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the licensing in the same manner as in regard to competency certificates. Since 1921, there has been no such fee paid, but prior to 1921 there was a fee of four guineas paid.  Deputies have referred to the British practice in other matters.  The position under the British regulations is that for the licensing of a public service vehicle the owner pays three guineas.  A certificate of fitness also costs three guineas.  It lasts for a period of five years, unless revoked.  Here the general proposal is simply to fix a fee that will cover the expenses incurred in dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 69.</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A public service vehicle licence shall not be granted to any person <Col N="1426" /> in respect to any large public service vehicle unless such vehicle is constructed so as to isolate the driver from the passengers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to ensure the greater safety of the travelling public.  It refers only to the large public service vehicle and proposes that the driver of such a vehicle should be isolated from the passengers.  I think that the House will agree that the driver of such a vehicle should have his whole attention concentrated on the management of his vehicle and on looking out for other traffic, and that it should not be possible for his passengers to distract him.  Cases have been reported where there has been overcrowding and where sometimes two or three persons crushed themselves in beside the driver, thus preventing him from properly managing his vehicle.  Some provision such as this should be inserted in the Bill to ensure that distraction shall not take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be enforced. It is intended that some provision of that kind shall be enforced under the regulations under this Bill. If we put the provision which Deputy O'Connell suggests into the Bill now, it would apply to char-a-bancs, and you could not have a position in regard to char-a-bancs whereby the driver would be isolated.  You have also the case of the one-man bus, carrying less than fourteen passengers, <Col N="1427" /> where a conductor is not required.  It would be unreasonable to provide that the driver in that case should be isolated from the passengers, because he has to collect the fares.  In the case of bigger vehicles, in the case of vehicles fitted with permanent roofs, the intention is that the drivers should be isolated.  Some of these char-a-bancs are not covered by permanent roofs.  They are driven quite openly and there is no necessity to have the driver isolated from the passengers. The intention the Deputy has in mind will be adequately provided for under the regulations.</P>

      <P>The danger in the case of the char-a-banc is just as great as in the case of other vehicles.  I was in an accident in a char-a-banc and the accident was due simply to a passenger&mdash;a very attractive young passenger&mdash;conversing with a rather susceptible driver.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that under the existing law it is compulsory for the driver to be isolated from the passengers.  In the Minister's own constituency&mdash;North Dublin&mdash; there are hundreds of buses plying for hire, in which the driver is not isolated from the passengers.  I should like to call the Minister's attention to the lamentable accident, referred to by Deputy Lemass, which took place in the Coombe district some time ago. If the provision that Deputy O'Connell is now seeking to have incorporated in the Bill had been in operation then, that accident, I suggest, would not have occurred.  The Minister is further aware that in his constituency fourteen-seater buses regularly carry fifteen, sixteen or twenty passengers and that passengers frequently converse with the drivers. In view of the long hours that these men work and in view of the danger to passengers, the Minister should accept Deputy O'Connell's amendment.</P>

      <P>There is a danger as regards this matter.  Sometimes you see passengers draped about the driver and occasionally the driver draped about a passenger.  Where a passenger happens to be sitting beside the driver at a critical time, if that passenger, whether man or a woman, happens to be hysterical, they may make a grab at the wheel.  I have seen that occur while I was driving myself.  Only I saw, in time, the hand coming, there would have been a crash.  It is undesirable in a vehicle of this description to have passengers beside the driver.  This matter should be considered and passengers should not be allowed to sit beside the drivers of vehicles carrying six passengers or more.</P>

I do not want to see these people driven out of business right away, but I suggest that regulations might be made or that the section should be amended in such a way as to make it impossible for a new bus of this type to come into existence after the passing of the Act unless the conditions laid down in Deputy O'Connell's amendment are complied with.  The amendment, if put into operation right away, would apply to a number of these fourteen-seater buses that probably have another year or year-and-a-half to live in the transport world.  An alteration could be made in some cases.  I am not so bigoted against buses operating in this country as to refuse to travel on them, particularly when I cannot get any other means of taking me from one point to another.  Some time ago I got into a bus at Burgh Quay late at night.  It was a fourteen-seater, going out on its last journey.  There were twenty-five passengers in it.  On that bus the driver had to act as conductor.</P>

These buses may have been on the road before the Order I speak about was made.  At any rate the matter has had consideration, and regulations have been made.  In the case of public service vehicles which provide for the carrying of fourteen passengers, you have only one man on board who acts as driver and collector of the fares.  In these cases you cannot require that he shall be a good way from the passengers.  But you may require that the construction and fitting of the bus shall be such that no one will be sitting alongside him.</P>

      <P>I am, but there is no objection to that.  In the case of these one-man buses, as they may be called, it is much more satisfactory that the passengers would enter in that particular way if the driver has also to collect the fares.  Otherwise, he would have to be going to the end of the bus to collect the fares.  You have that class of bus and you have to cater for it.  We can take into consideration the laying down of regulations with regard to the construction and fitting of buses of that particular kind.  We do not want to put the driver into the position that Deputy Gorey speaks about.  Then you have the charabanc. That has to be considered, too.  Our attitude is shown in the regulations which we have made with regard to the more than fourteen-seater buses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to the phrase &ldquo;otherwise fit&rdquo; in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of the section.  I think it is a pity to leave to the Commissioner who, as far as I can understand from the Minister, is not to be responsible to this House either through the Minister or in any other way, with such a loose general phrase as that for his guidance. Apparently the interpretation of the words &ldquo;otherwise fit&rdquo; is left to the Commissioner himself.  I understand that in recent months the Garda authorities refused a licence for a vehicle on the grounds that it was not properly painted though the owner of it would seem to me to be a man who would be a competent judge of what suitable painting was.</P>
      <P>It is not for any petty reason that I am raising this question.  There is a very big issue involved in it.  Before the vehicle is passed as suitable in the Commissioner's office the tax has to be paid on it.  In the case that I have mentioned, although the tax was paid, a delay of a fortnight took place before the vehicle could be used.  That was a very serious matter for the owner. Is there no way by which the owners of public service vehicles could be protected against having to suffer loss of that kind?  The owner of the vehicle may not be in any way to blame, and yet on his own individual opinion the Commissioner may refuse to licence the vehicle.  In my opinion this phrase &ldquo;otherwise fit&rdquo; should either be struck out, or the owner of the vehicle should be relieved from the payment of the road tax during the period that the alterations to the vehicle, required by the Commissioner, are being executed.  I submit that for the Minister's consideration.</P>

      <P>With regard to the phrase &ldquo;otherwise fit&rdquo; I do not know what other words you could put in.  The regulations dealing with the construction, equipment and general condition of buses will be such as to indicate what is expected, and the Garda authorities, in turning down a <Col N="1432" /> vehicle as being unserviceable, will have to do so knowing that there is an appeal to the District Court against their decision.  Did I understand the Deputy to suggest that there shall be a deduction from the road tax payable in respect of it during the period that the vehicle is off the road because the Garda authorities have decided that it is unfit for use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I pointed out the fact that the fault that the Gárda may find with the vehicle may be a matter of opinion or judgment.  It may be, as happened in recent months, that the Gárda do not approve of the painting of the vehicle and that it will have to be painted in a different way.  It is a matter on which any two persons will differ, and practically to fine a man for not painting the vehicle, according to what the Gárda would require, would be wrong, and it may not be what the Minister would intend. Yet that would happen under the Bill as it stands at present.  You may have a vehicle rejected because the Gárda do not approve of the painting.  The repainting may take two or three weeks or a month.  Meantime, a very heavy tax has to be paid on the vehicle.  I suggest that such an owner would have a very good grievance.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) of this section would the Minister explain what is the object of making the driver responsible for the vehicle-plate being missing.  After all, questions of that kind may easily cause friction between <Col N="1434" /> an employer and his employees.  I can see no reason why two persons must be held responsible, particularly as the driver is not the owner of the vehicle. He has not any control over it, and he must raise the question with his employer. It may then lead to unpleasantness. We know that it is very hard to get employment at present.  Very many drivers are so glad to have it that they do not want to be raising questions of that kind with their employers. I suggest that there is no need for that provision, and that it is quite sufficient to make the owner responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be rather ineffective to make the owner responsible.  After all the driver is the person close up against the vehicle, and the person that you must hold responsible for seeing that from day to day, or from place to place, the vehicle in the matter of lights, and in the matter of any other statutory requirements, complies with the law.  I do not see that you could possibly exonerate the driver for driving a motor without a vehicle plate.  On the other hand, in order to strengthen the control over these matters, we include the owner. We put the owner into the position also of being chargeable in respect of this offence, but if anyone is going to be charged in the first place in connection with the matter I think it should be the driver, because he is the person who has immediate control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will admit that a case like this may arise. A plate gets lost, and a new plate may not be obtained.  The driver cannot replace that, he has to go on driving. The owner may take the risk of the vehicle being kept in use without a plate.  He may say to the driver &ldquo;You will manage to escape the Gárda.&rdquo; We all know that very many simple things like that are not observed until they have been missing for a long time. The owner may give the driver instructions that he is to go ahead and leave the question of the plate to him. It may be that the owner has the plate locked up in some office.  It may be that he wants a new plate.  Anything <Col N="1435" /> may occur in connection with it.  Why does the Minister set out to provoke unpleasantness between the driver and the owner in regard to a matter like that?  The driver has got to say to his employer &ldquo;You must produce the plate or I will not take out the vehicle.&rdquo;  This is a new provision and I do not think there could be a more unsuitable time for introducing it than the present, because of the difficulty of getting employment.</P>

      <P>As far as relieving the driver of responsibility in the matter is concerned, I am quite sure that any court would relieve the driver of responsibility if he had duly reported the absence of the vehicle plate to his employer, and passed on the responsibility in that particular way.  I think it is necessary to force the driver into the position that he will pass on that responsibility to the owner, if the owner is the person to supply the vehicle plate.</P>

      <P>The members of this group regard this amendment as a very important one. For that reason I hope the Minister will reconsider the section as it now stands and agree that a member of the Gárda Síochána is not in the ordinary way a fit and competent person to say whether a 'bus is from the mechanical point of view fit to ply for public hire. I am told by a skilled workman engaged in the trade of vehicle-building that if a skilled man had been previously appointed to go into the question of applications for licences, bearing in mind only the question of the construction of the vehicle and its condition, that many of the taxis and buses now plying for hire in the public streets and thoroughfares of the country would certainly not be on the roads. This Bill, and I give full credit to those who were responsible for framing it, has been largely drawn up on the lines of the British Road Traffic Act. Many sections have been copied word for word into this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister why, when reading the British Road Traffic Act, he did not follow the lines laid down by the British Government with regard to inspection.  Provision is made in the British Act for inspection to be done by skilled men, who know more about the construction and condition of a vehicle than unskilled men naturally do.  The latest information I have in relation to the operation of the British Road Traffic Act, is that in four controlled areas skilled inspectors have been already appointed.  Three further appointments were under consideration at the time I received this information. I understand, also, that the Six County Government has already appointed a skilled man as inspector within their area.  The safety of the travelling public depends upon the competency, fitness, and qualifications of the driver, upon the construction and condition of the vehicle in which the passenger travels, and I think in a matter of this kind the cost is not going to be very great.  Bearing in mind that the police force that we have in this country is very young compared with what it is in Great Britain and other places, where skilled men are doing this class of work, I think the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>In the case of railway engines and trams, the driver is practically a mechanic himself.  Although the engine driver, before he is allowed to take charge of an engine, would on the average have 15 or 20 years' service as an engine cleaner and a fireman, still the engineer and the railway works must inspect the engine before it leaves the shed for service on the rails. The same thing applies to the tram, and I do not see why an unskilled man should be allowed to take over the work which a skilled man only is competent to do, and I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  We regard it as a very important question, and I will, if the Minister cannot see his way to reconsider the matter, be forced to ask the House to divide on the issue involved.</P>

      <P>There is a phrase in Section 85: &ldquo;the Commissioner may at any time and as often as he thinks fit.&rdquo;  Does the Minister not think that that is too wide and that there ought to be some limitation?  In some areas it might lead to victimisation, or petty tyranny of some kind or another.  An official might get his back up against a person for some purely private wrong.  God knows what grievance <Col N="1439" /> they might have against one another, and the position might happen that a bus-owner might be driven out of business before any complaint could be investigated at headquarters as to the tyrannical actions of the subordinate officer.  I think the wording as it stands at present would leave it open to an individual who might be inclined to act in that way to do so and to put a car-owner to very great difficulty and even to the extent of driving him out of business unless the Minister could see some way of tightening it up.  &ldquo;He may at any time and as often as he thinks fit&rdquo;&mdash;several times a day a car might be operated on.

      <P>To carry the point from theory to practice, perhaps the Minister would be interested to hear that the bus owners in Dublin are at present jealous of each other on the grounds that the Gárda are supposed to favour particular bus services.  Nothing is more common than accusations of favouritism by the Guards towards bus owners.  I do not say for a moment there is any foundation for it, but it is everyday gossip that certain people are getting away with it in the matter of freedom from prosecutions, and so on.

I do not think that we can contemplate that the Commissioner will act in a discriminating way as between different classes of buses or between the buses of different owners.  Once it is agreed that the Commissioner must have power to have a bus inspected at any time he thinks it reasonable because of anything he knows about it, or because of the way in which it is behaving he should have that power.

The intention is that any member of the Gárda Síochána at all, if he thinks it is called for, may enter on any bus and inspect it superficially.  If he has any doubts on seeing how the bus acts in a particular place and fears there is something wrong with the brakes he may ask the driver to operate the machine with a view to verifying that the brakes are really in good condition.  It is a superficial inspection of a kind that the ordinary Guard on traffic duty or otherwise ought to have power to do if there is anything obviously wrong.</P>

If a member does not himself drive how could he <Col N="1443" /> be capable of carrying out duties under this section?  Even if he did drive there are some hundreds I am sure in that service who like myself and many others could not understand the mechanism of a car no matter what training they got.  The Minister ought to know that there are people who are incapable of understanding the mechanism of a motor car.  There are as many people as there are people suffering from colour-blindness which we spent a lot of time discussing to-day.  It is not merely a superficial inspection.  It is going to be a very thorough inspection. It gives an officious Guard a tremendous opportunity for causing trouble.  This would be equivalent to passing a vote of confidence in every Guard in the country, that he will act with scrupulous care and avoid giving unnecessary trouble, that he will have no such thing as a grudge against a bus driver, a conductor, or anything like that, that he will be a judge of the mechanism of a car and can tell whether the engine is in order or not.

I appeal to the Minister that between this and the next stage of the Bill he will reconsider the drafting of the section so as to leave to the Guards any work of the kind he has referred to dealing with the question of lights, but we will not admit that an ordinary Guard who has no experience of vehicle-building, and who is not a skilled man, should be given rights under this Bill, which in our opinion should be held by skilled vehicle builders.</P>

      <P>May I point out that I think the object of this section is misunderstood.  The inspection that we were talking about under the previous section is inspection that has to take place at regular intervals to see that the vehicle is in proper running order.  Let me illustrate what I understand by this clause.  Supposing I am motoring along a roadway. I have to pull up suddenly by reason of some obstruction.  I am followed by a bus and that bus runs into the back of my car.  I get out and ask what he means.  He pleads that his brakes are defective.  Is that a vehicle that should be allowed to <Col N="1445" /> continue on the roadway?  I can call any Guard who is in the particular area and draw his attention to the fact that this vehicle is not safe for other road users and should not be on the roadway.  He can inspect it and if he is satisfied with the statement he can order it off the road. That is the protection that ordinary road users are entitled to.  It is not a point turning on whether it is mechanically perfect with which the other clause deals.  It is dealing with the rights of ordinary users.  I hold, as an ordinary road user, that I am entitled to call upon a Guard if I see a vehicle on the road that is a danger to other road users.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good put it perfectly as far as brakes are concerned. It may be that the Deputy sees a driver going around a corner in a way that suggests his brakes are not working.  Naturally he gets terribly vexed and calls a Guard and says this is one of these terrible buses.</P>
      <P>That Guard surely is entitled to stop that bus and say it cannot carry on until repairs to the brakes are carried out.  Buses are required to have all kinds of little things in order.  They are supposed to have their fuel tanks properly corked and not stopped with a rag.  They are supposed to have a fire extinguisher and other little details like that.  It should be within the function of any Guard to board a bus to see whether the minor regulations were being carried out.  I do not accept at all that there is any relationship between the type of inspection contemplated in Section 86 and the inspection provided for in Section 85.  Under such provision as we make in Section 86 we want to give a Guard power to do the type of thing suggested.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will admit that under the existing regulations the Gárda have a certain amount of power.  Has that power been exercised in all cases to the safety of the travelling public?  I quoted a few cases here last week in which I pointed out that buses were plying for hire here in the Saorstát that had been condemned in Northern Ireland.  As Deputy Davin pointed out, under the British Road Traffic Act it is necessary for vehicle Inspectors to be appointed who are competent and skilled men.  No such regulation at present applies to the Saorstát, with the result that there are buses plying for hire here which are a danger to the travelling public.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should agree to some modification of the section, so that skilled men should act in lieu of Guards.  I think it will be admitted that a Guard who has no mechanical or other knowledge of a car is not in the position to say whether a vehicle is safe or unsafe.  If it were an ordinary driver of a car he would be in a much better position, as he would have the same knowledge as the driver. I think the Minister should take into consideration what is embodied in the British Road Traffic Act, and see that competent men should act as Inspectors and decide whether a public vehicle is properly constructed, and is kept in a proper mechanical state of repair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to make it compulsory that all buses plying for hire shall carry a conductor.  Under the terms of the section it is not necessary for a bus to have a conductor if it has capacity for not more than 14 passengers.  I think that every argument that could be advanced for <Col N="1451" /> a bus having seating capacity for more than 14 passengers to have a conductor could be advanced to a greater extent in connection with buses having seating capacity for 14 or under.  In many cases it will be found that buses having seats for only 14 passengers carry 18 or 20, and sometimes a 12-seater bus carries 15 passengers.  Under the terms of this section a 16-seater bus would be required to carry a conductor, but if the owner of a 16-seater bus wanted to come within the terms of this section he could quite easily remove a double seat and make it a 14-seater bus, so that he would not be required to carry a conductor.  There is one important point to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention in connection with the safety of the travelling public.  The Minister is aware that so far as the 14-seater bus is concerned, the person in charge must not only be his own driver but he must also collect the fares.  He has also to open the folding doors.  It is well known that when passengers are travelling in a 14-seater bus, and when they rise from their seats to get out they do so before the bus becomes stationary, and the driver holds out his hand to get the money while the bus is still in motion. I submit that this is a positive danger to the travelling public.  As I said, every argument that could be put forward requiring a bus having seating capacity for more than 14 to have a conductor could be put forward to a greater extent in the case of a 14-seater bus.  There are hundreds of 14-seater buses that have no conductors. The drivers of these buses have to work from an early hour in the morning until late at night.  Some of them have to work 14 hours a day.  I put it to any person in this House competent to drive a motor car to say what is the physical condition of a driver who is driving for 14 hours, and who, in addition, has to collect the fares and who has to open and close the folding doors for passengers.  I submit that in the interests of the travelling public the Minister should accept this amendment.  In addition to ensuring the safety of the travelling <Col N="1452" /> public, the acceptance of this amendment is going to mean the absorption of quite a large number of unemployed drivers.  There are a great many such drivers in the country, and I think the Minister should agree to accept this amendment in their interests as well as in any other.</P>

      <P>The amendment is not acceptable.  In the first place, if a 16 seater bus should take away two seats that is not going to have the effect mentioned by the Deputy, because under Section 16 we have power to make regulations for calculating the seating capacity of any vehicle.  As a matter of fact, that is going to be changed in order to make it the calculation of the passenger accommodation. So that it need not necessarily depend upon the seats whether a bus is regarded as a 14-seater or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 is framed in terms of seating accommodation, but we want to make that passenger accommodation, and there will be a consequential amendment, so that the 14 seats mentioned here will be 14-seater accommodation as measured under the regulations that will be prepared. I do not know any bus carrying eight passengers.  But in certain places a 14-seater will be the economic bus.  If you insist that a 14-seater bus must carry a conductor as well as a driver you will put such buses off the road.  You tend, at any rate, to increase fares.  In the case of a 14-seater or a 12-seater bus you have a particular number of passengers whom the driver can serve both as driver and conductor.  We consider that the 14-seater bus is of that particular type.  Under section 109 regulations will be made governing the number of extra passengers that, in special circumstances, such as rush hours, a bus may carry.  I will bear in mind when framing these regulations that the one-man bus cannot be expected to deal as satisfactorily with a rush hour as the bus in which you <Col N="1453" /> have a conductor.  Precautions may be taken in that direction that may save the particular type of abuse in respect of the one-man bus that the Deputy refers to, but I think it would be wrong to require a 14-seater bus to have a conductor as well as a driver.</P>

      <P>The Minister has endeavoured to point out that it would be a hardship on the owner of a 14-seater bus to have a driver and conductor. I may mention that in Dublin the Tramways Co., which have larger buses, have both drivers and conductors.  In addition to that the Tramways Co., whose buses are running on the permanent way have to pay a certain amount for the upkeep of that permanent way over and above road taxation or insurance. Consequently it will not be such a hardship on the owners of 14-seater buses to have to employ a conductor. I submit that it is advisable to have both driver and conductor, first, for the sake of the travelling public, and in the second place, in order to absorb some of the unemployed drivers and conductors.  The Minister has not given any definite reason why a 14-seater bus should be exempt from the regulations which he wants the owners of buses of larger seating capacity to adopt.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment for the purpose of putting these small owner-driver buses out of business quicker than they will put themselves out.  These people buy the buses on the hire-purchase system and they go out of business when the buses themselves go out of existence.  The average individuals who own these small buses go into the business with out any realisation of the fact that they will have to go out of it within a very short time.  Experience during the <Col N="1454" /> last four or five years has shown quite clearly, and I am sure the returns that ought to be available will prove that, that these people come into the business under certain conditions and they go out with the life of the bus.  I think we should encourage those other people who can put buses on the roads that will properly accommodate the traffic that is waiting for them.  There is ample traffic available if only proper provision is made for the carrying of passengers.  I am referring now to the transport business in so far as it applies to the roads.  Perhaps some Deputies have been sufficiently interested to observe the conditions which apply in the case of Dublin with regard to the requirements of passengers who want to be carried to and from certain parts of the city and suburbs.</P>

There is ample trade for the people who make proper provision for carrying passengers to and from different parts of the country.  In the interests of the transport industry, and in the interests of the people who think there is a lot of money to be made out of 14-seater buses or other small buses of that type, the stricter the regulations that will be applied to them the better in the end. Deputy Lemass will not have to attend the funerals of many of these people if he supports Deputy Cassidy's amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(k)  approving the places in such area which may be purchased by approved omnibus companies for the purpose of erecting terminal stations for approved long distance routes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section sets out a number of purposes for which the Commissioner may make by-laws.  My amendment proposes to make an addition to that. The proposal is not in any sense man datory.  It only gives the Commissioner power to make recommendations, and the underlying feature in connection with it is that it is considered by many that there should be terminal stations, somewhat similar to railway stations, for buses running long distances, where there can be waiting-rooms and other conveniences for the public.  At present we have nothing at all of that kind.  These long distance buses park in the streets. A large number of people are waiting for them to start.  The people have to wait in the streets, and in many cases there is inconvenience caused.  This merely gives the Commissioner power, with the consent of the Minister, to approve of suitable sites for such stations for long distance buses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seeks to make provision in this amendment <Col N="1458" /> for a thing that, as far as the Bill is concerned, we do not contemplate taking any power for.  This Bill deals with traffic on the roads, and sub-section (1) (a) gives power to the Commissioner to make by-laws appointing the places which may be used as a stand and starting-place for large public service vehicles.  It has not been argued that the proper regulation of the traffic demands the putting off the streets of all vehicles using the streets as starting-places.  This amendment suggests that the Commissioner ought not to allow buses to use the streets as terminals in their journeys: and it speaks of approved omnibus companies. We have been particularly careful in this Bill that the Minister and the Commissioner will not be placed in the position of discriminating between one bus company and another at all.  Any discrimination of that kind would eat in on the Industry and Commerce side of the transport problem.  We have to deal with traffic alone in this Bill; and if there are any problems involving discrimination between different omnibus companies they must arise in connection with the framing of a Transport Bill.  I do not know that the Transport Bill would contemplate stating that omnibus companies approved under the Bill should have proper private terminal stations. I do not know whether that would not be imposing a great burden upon some of these omnibus companies.  But as far as my responsibility goes, and as far as the responsibility of the Commissioner goes, I do not know how he can deal with approved omnibus companies in any way under this Bill; and I have not heard it argued at all that the Commissioner should be given any power to order the buses that are at present using the public roads as their terminal stations off the roads, and order them to find terminal stations of their own.  I think that would be a far-reaching power to give the Commissioner.</P>

      <P>Yes; it is well overdue, at any rate.  This Bill, apart from the very limited power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, deals with the regulation and licensing of the road traffic services, and fixes very definitely under its sections, and the regulations that may be made under it, the conditions under which licences shall be given, and the conditions under which these companies shall operate on the roads.  If companies are to be allowed to operate on the roads under an Act passed by this House, for which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is responsible, I think it is not wrong that the Minister should be asked to take power or be given power to say that these people will provide proper stopping places and terminal stations for those who will have to wait for a long time, so that they may not have to wait under the very unfair conditions which prevail at present, and that he will be given power to secure that provision will be made for waiting rooms, and for the conveniences required by the travelling public. Deputy Corish suggests that that would kill the railways.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been given by this House power which has, I think, nearly killed the railways. These powers, put into operation by the Minister who is responsible for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was putting down this amendment I was in some doubt as to whether it really came within the jurisdiction of this Bill, but when I came to consider the matter under this Bill I observed that the Commissioner of Police decided starting and stopping places; and really if the Minister thinks that this question of starting and stopping places would more properly come under a Transport Bill, it seems to me that there is a certain amount of overlapping.  I think the question of stopping and starting places comes within the jurisdiction of this Bill; and if that is so, the starting stations and the waiting rooms and the other conveniences of such a station should certainly be settled by one and the same person, that is the person who settles the starting and the stopping places.  I think that is clear.  And as I pointed out to the Minister, there is nothing mandatory in this.  If he thinks that it is not desirable to authorise these companies to erect such conveniences and shelters for the public, so that they might wait in some comfort for the departure of the buses, well, then, my amendment is not mandatory and need not be put into effect.  But it seems to me that a certain amount of development of that kind is desirable in conjunction with the development of the bus traffic; and as I visualise the ambit of these two Bills, it appears to me that the regulation of such a development comes within the Road Traffic Bill rather than within the Transport Bill.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before making a by-law under this section the Commissioner shall give notice to the appropriate local authority and the representatives of the traffic operators and of the employees of the operators of his intention to make such by-laws and shall have regard to any representations made by such local authority or persons before making such by-law.</P>
      <P>Under the section the Commissioner is given certain powers, some of which up to this were in the hands of local authorities.  For instance, obstructions in the streets of urban areas were attended to by the local authorities, and in view of that I think the Minister should accept the amendment. If the Minister wants the Bill to be carried out the co-operation of the local people will be required.  I do not see anything unreasonable in the amendment necessitating that the Commissioner of the Gárda should consult the local authorities.  I believe that it will be found more satisfactory if that is done.</P>

The position is that under Section 8 whenever I have to approve of by-laws, as in this particular instance, the proposal to do so may require to be published and an enquiry may be held.  I stated then that I would go into the matter and see that the cost of enquiries was reduced to the cheapest possible rate.  It seems to me that putting in this amendment might easily involve more expense and more confusion than by having the matter dealt with under Section 8 and going through the usual process of publication and enquiry if necessary.</P>

What <Col N="1462" /> I want to secure is that any powers local authorities have will be retained. I think it is not unreasonable that local authorities should be consulted by the Gárda before a station of this kind is established.

In so far as the by-laws will refer to any specified area it will arise out of the conditions there and out of the consideration given the matter by the Gárda in conjunction with the local authorities or whomsoever else may be involved.  Naturally the most efficient way of having them brought together would be for the local people to be consulted by the local Guards before the material for the by-laws was submitted to the Commissioner, so that the sending of them down for any enquiry under Section 8 will be purely formal, as the ground would have been completely sounded beforehand and the by-laws would have grown out of local experience and consultation.</P>

    <P>(a)  the suitability of the routes on which a service may be provided under the licence;</P>
    <P>(b) the extent, if any, to which the needs of the proposed routes or any of them are adequately served;</P>
    <P>(c)  the extent to which the proposed service is necessary or desirable in the public interest.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subject to the provisions of this section the Minister may attach to a road service licence such conditions as he may think fit with respect to the matters to which they are required to have regard under the preceding sub-section and in particular for securing that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the fares shall not be unreasonable;</P>
    <P>(b) where desirable in the public interest the fares shall be so fixed as to prevent wasteful competition with alternative forms of transport, if any, along the route or any part thereof or in proximity thereto;</P>
    <P>and generally for securing the safety and convenience of the public; and the Minister may from time to time vary in such manner as he thinks fit the conditions attaching to a road service licence.</P>
    <P>(5) Every person applying for a road service licence shall submit to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  particulars of the type or types of vehicle to be used; and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> (b)  in the case of regular services the time-tables and fare-tables of the services which it is proposed to provide under the licence; and</P>

    <P>(6)  If where an application has been made for a road service licence it is represented to the Minister by any person interested in or affected by the application that it is necessary or desirable in the public interest that the Minister should fix the minimum and maximum fares which the applicant proposes to provide under the licence, the Minister may fix such fares and make it a condition of the licence that fares shall not be charged under or in excess of the minimum or maximum.</P>
    <P>This amendment is, more or less, an extension of the section which has been passed.  It indicates in a more definite way the conditions which we think should be laid down by the Minister for the control and regulation of traffic.  The purpose is that if a public service is initiated it should have regard to the public needs, so as to prevent the kind of thing we see, especially in the suburbs of the city, where small bus owners come along and ply only at times which suit themselves, taking as it were the cream of the traffic, and having no regard for the public convenience.  I understand that one of the biggest bus companies in the country is subject to regulations laid down in the Railway and Road Motor Services Act, and that the tramway buses are similarly controlled.  We should like to see some regulation which would govern private bus companies and private owners, so that they would have some regard for the convenience of the public.  That is the object I had in putting down this amendment, and I would, like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to wait for the Bill to be introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I would like to get intimation from the Minister that the principle of the amendment moved by Deputy O'Connell will be given effect to in that long-promised Bill.  The real intention of the amendment moved by Deputy O'Connell was to put pirate buses under proper public control.  We have certain bus services tied down very strictly by regulations which this House gave power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to enforce.  There are other bus services not subject to the same control.  Every Deputy interested in securing proper transport services&mdash;whether by road, rail, or canal&mdash;will admit that the same conditions should apply to those who apply for licences in any class of transport. Why should we allow, by refusing to bring in proper legislation, pirate buses to come along and pay their employees, who work 16 hours a day, 10s. a week, and undercut the fares of bus services which employ men on a fair and reasonable basis?  That is what Deputy O'Connell wants to get at.  The sooner the Minister for Industry and Commerce brings in a Bill and gets it through this House the better it will be for those who want proper transport services and those who want to get fair, reasonable, and proper employment on road or rail services.  He should stop making promises, and let us have the measure and let us have one Minister in control instead of three.</P>

      <P>This section gives the Minister authority to allow the carrying of additional passengers during specified hours or on specified occasions.  I take it that that will include the occasion of football matches or other occasions upon which large crowds will have congregated and the normal traffic facilities will not be sufficient.  In that connection, considerable complaint has been voiced by representatives of the bus owners that the regulations concerning the maximum number of passengers are very difficult to enforce, and that frequently they are subjected to substantial fines for allowing a number of passengers on their vehicles in excess of the maximum permitted when it is practically impossible for them to keep them off.  The regulations are not apparently enforced in some instances with any degree of common <Col N="1469" /> sense.  That applies, particularly, to the number of passengers permitted on buses on Sunday evenings returning from seaside resorts such as Howth.  It is the practice of people going to these resorts to defer their return to the last minute.</P>
      <P>There are only a limited number of buses available and they all try to mount the few buses there are.  Bus owners have been fined for permitting them to do so.  They themselves are prepared to take any risk rather than be under the obligation of walking home or staying for the night.  I do not think there is a single case of an accident happening to a bus because of the additional number of passengers permitted to board it.  Some easing of the regulations might be permitted wherever special circumstances exist or, generally speaking, all round.  In England and Northern Ireland the regulations in that respect are not nearly so strictly enforced as they are here.  An accident due to this cause has not, I think, yet happened in this country.</P>
      <P>I think the bus owners have a legitimate grievance because either they have got, by force in some cases, to expel the additional passengers from the vehicles or leave themselves liable to a substantial fine.</P>

      <P>I know that it would be more appropriate for Deputy Davin to refer to Geneva in connection with this amendment.  This amendment is proposed in order to keep in line with the International Labour Convention, which prescribes a weekly rest.  I cannot see why drivers of taxis employed by a company or by private owners should be exempt, as they seem to be specially exempted by putting in the word &ldquo;large,&rdquo; and applying this weekly rest only to drivers of public service vehicles.  I cannot understand why a taxi driver or two or three taxi drivers employed by a man who may have taxis on the streets, should not come under the regulations.  I am therefore moving this amendment to delete the word &ldquo;large.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is a very different thing.  It is perfectly obvious that the conditions of work of a driver <Col N="1471" /> or conductor of a large public service vehicle are very different from the conditions of service of a taxi driver or the driver of a private hiring vehicle.  It is because of the long and continuous strain on the bus driver and the regular continuous hours that we have applied these provisions, but the conditions under which the taxi driver or the driver of a private vehicle works are entirely different, and the regulations would not be warranted in our opinion in these cases. The difficulty is that it is too much rest these people will have.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 79:</P>
      <P>Before Section 111 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The wages paid to any person employed in connection with the operation of the public service vehicle and the conditions of his employment shall not be less favourable to such person than the wages which would be payable and the conditions which would have to be observed under a contract made by a Department of State which contained a clause providing that &ldquo;the contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised by employers and trade societies (or in the absence of such recognised hours and wages those which in practice prevail among good employers) in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which we regard as a very important one, is put forward for the purpose of endeavouring to get <Col N="1473" /> the Minister to make it a condition for the getting of a licence that public service conditions, generally, should be imposed upon the people who look for or mean to secure a licence.  The amendment embodies in reality the operative part of the fair wages clause, which is supposed to be inserted in Government contracts.  I have been supplied with a long list of the conditions of service of the various bus companies in the Free State, including some of the principal ones as well as some of the very small ones.  I have been given the conditions which apply in the case of the Great Northern Company Omnibus Service, the Irish Omnibus Service, the General Omnibus Service, and also a large number of cases showing the conditions which operate in what are properly called the pirate bus companies, because they are taking from those bus companies, who can afford reasonable conditions for their employees, the fares which they should not be allowed to take.  I have a case here of one small bus company operating on the Dublin-Dalkey line where a young man is supposed to be engaged for 16 hours a day at 10s. a week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and other high-wall tariff supporters protest against certain goods being allowed to come into this country from countries where these articles are manufactured under slave conditions.  What I am really trying to secure, through the medium of the amendment, is that small or large bus companies or the owners of small or large buses, will not be allowed to secure licences through the agency of this Bill unless they undertake to give fair and reasonable conditions to those who secure employment in their service.  The same issue is involved in this case as is involved in the case of this Government or this House allowing articles to come in from Russia or other countries where it is known that the articles are manufactured under unfair conditions.  That is the case that has been put to the House by Deputy Lemass on many occasions, and we are in agreement with him on that question.  I hope Deputy Lemass will look at the amendment from that point of view.  I know <Col N="1474" /> the Minister will endeavour to look at it from that point of view.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Davin's amendment.  I think it is common knowledge that the wages paid to their employees by some of the bus companies operating in this country are scandalously low and the insertion of a clause of this kind would have, I think, a very beneficial effect. Some such clause was inserted in the British Act and there seems no reason why we should not follow their example in that connection.  If we are going to provide facilities for the operation of omnibus services we should at least see that the conditions of employment are such as not to be, as they are in some cases, a scandal to the country.  We know that it is only the bad economic conditions that prevail that make it possible for the proprietors of the buses in question to get people to work at such wages and under such conditions.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  I have practical proof of nearly everything Deputy Davin has stated, corroborated by Deputy Lemass.  In Cork City very <Col N="1475" /> bad working conditions exist on the services.  The tramway service as you are aware was replaced by a bus system.  The wages and the hours and conditions are abominable.  I would appeal to the Minister, if he cannot see his way to adopt the whole of the amendment, at least to adopt the idea underlying it.  I think it is admitted by most Deputies that people in charge of such vehicles as buses and other mechanically propelled cars should enjoy good working conditions. When I say good working conditions I mean that they should not be compelled to work abnormally long hours. The system that had obtained for a considerable period in Cork was that these men were compelled to work seven days, roughly between 60 and 80 hours a week.  To my mind these conditions were a menace to pedestrians and other vehicular traffic.  It cannot be argued that a man working for twelve or fourteen hours a day is fit to look after the valuable lives that he may be transporting over a long distance of country.  When I say proper conditions, I mean ordinary working hours prevalent in that particular area and a six-day week.  That is a kind of guarantee that the lives of those people who are travelling in these vehicles will at least get some measure of protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that one of the reasons why this amendment should be accepted is because it is in corresponding legislation passed in England.  First of all, the legislation that was passed in England was passed by what was described as a Socialist Government, and secondly, in so far as the other matter is concerned, it was not a traffic measure only.  It was traffic and transport, providing for regulation by the normal licensing of certain people.  We make a distinction here.  This is traffic.  Transport is to come.  If this amendment is to be discussed here, I want to raise an objection to it in advance of its making its appearance on a Transport Bill.  There is no precedent that can be quoted to me for regulating wages by statute in this <Col N="1476" /> way.  It may be answered that it is done under the Trade Board Acts.  It is done when certain specified conditions have been fulfilled, or rather when certain conditions are recognised as not being fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are free to this extent, that whatever restrictions are applied they are applied to everybody, but it is not a Government controlled agency.  It is not Government work.  There is only one example that can be quoted as a precedent, the Trade Board Acts, which regulate wages compulsorily by legislation.  For that there must be present two conditions, (a) that there are notoriously sweated conditions operating in a particular industry, and (b) that there is no trade union organisation strong enough to protect the workers.  It is only when these two conditions are present that a trade can be specified under the Trade Board Acts, and the conditions which are to be applied to a sweated industry come into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no example comparable to what is being done here.  The amendment provides: &ldquo;The wages paid to any person employed in connection with the operation of the public service vehicle and the conditions of his employment shall not be less favourable to such person than the wages <Col N="1477" /> which would be payable and the conditions which would have to be observed under a contract made by a department of State&rdquo;&mdash;that clearly indicates that what is being brought in here is the machinery that regulates Government contracts&mdash;&ldquo;which contains a clause providing that &lsquo;the contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised by employers in trade societies (or in the absence of such recognised hours and wages those which in practice prevail among good employers) in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment states &ldquo;in the trade,&rdquo; but Deputy Davin, by implication in his speech, confines it to the small bus companies: that the small bus companies must do what the big bus companies should do.  I do not think that it is a fair test to apply.  I do not think it is fair to try and equalise the conditions.  What is the definition of trade in this amendment? Is it transport that is to be the thing? Is it an equalisation say, as between bus wages and bus hours and railway wages and railway hours?   Might I advert to the distinction that has to be made in the conditions here as opposed to the conditions in England?  People can say in England that there will be a number of transport agencies in any area, in any district in which work is carried out.  What is the situation here?  Leaving Dublin out of consideration for the moment, in most of the areas in this country there would be at the most two or three transport agencies of any substance where people could be called the folk from whom a standard is to be taken.  This amendment means that you are going to stereotype in a particular area the conditions which are the best that have been achieved by the ordinary play as between employers and employees.  I suggest that that is not fair in the conditions in this country.  It is going to be much more unfair in the conditions that are likely to exist hereafter.  To my mind, what the amendment does, whether it is intended or not, is to bring about this condition, that you <Col N="1478" /> are going to stereotype railway wages and railway hours on road services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On an analysis of the amendment I think it is within it. Even if it is not, and even if it only goes to carry out the limited idea that the Deputy gave expression to, it will have the effect of stereotyping the wages, hours and conditions of the big bus owned companies upon the smaller companies.  That is unfair. Further, it is without precedent by legislation to establish these things, excepting only where two conditions are present: (1) that there are notoriously sweated conditions in the business, and (2) that there is no organisation of employees able to stand up to the conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in arguing against the acceptance of this amendment, brings in the question of trade boards.  As far as they are concerned, he said that before a trade could come under the Trade Boards Acts there must first of all exist bad conditions in that trade.  On that I would like to say to the Minister that if he knew anything as to how the 14-seater buses operate on the north side of the city and in the county of Dublin he would be aware of the scandalous conditions that exist, both as to the hours the employees have to work and the wages they get.  If the Minister is not prepared to extend to those in the smaller bus companies the conditions that obtain in the case of the larger bus companies, it may be information for him to know that many of the bus drivers in this city are called upon to work fourteen, fifteen and sometimes sixteen hours a day.  Some of the drivers of these one-man buses are in receipt of the scandalous rate of pay of 25s. a week.  Does the Minister mean to suggest that these are not bad conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second stipulation that he brings in is that there is to be proof given that there is no trade union existing as far as the employees are concerned. It is true as far as the City of Dublin is concerned that the trade <Col N="1479" /> unions have forced the larger bus companies to give at least a living rate of wages, but owing to the fact in many cases that these small buses are only what are known as one-man buses, they pay a scandalous rate of wages.  It is impossible from a trade union standpoint to get the men organised.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that while these are independent agencies and he does not want to compel them to come under the conditions of the amendment, at the same time Government interference has taken place and rightly so.  I refer to another industry.  Under the Shop Hours Act a shopkeeper, through legislation, is compelled to give an employee a half holiday.  I do not think that this amendment of Deputy Davin is asking too much.  After all the licence is issued through Government authority, and it is most important that these men should observe proper conditions as far as labour is concerned.  In the interests of the travelling public it is not fair that these employees should be called upon to work long hours, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, instead of defeating Deputy Davin's argument has made out a good case for it, and I hope seeing that this Bill is not being looked on as a Party Bill, as far as the House is concerned, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will be prepared to leave it to an open vote of the House and then we will see who stands for proper wages and proper conditions and who does not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amused by the Minister's attempt to frighten off the Deputies who normally sit on his left by asserting that the provisions in the British Act were passed by a Socialist Government.  It was passed in the British House of Commons where the Socialists were not in the majority and it was also passed by the House of Lords, a body which, no matter what may be said about it, cannot be described as an organ of any Bolshevik institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> Members of the House of Lords thought it advisable to insert in the Road Traffic Act a clause prescribing that certain minimum wages should operate on public road services authorised under that Act.  It has got to be quite clear that it is wrong and misleading to compare conditions in this trade with conditions in any other trade.  This is a trade which can only exist subject to the licence and the rigid control of the Government. Nobody can operate a road service here unless they are licensed to do it, and unless their drivers have undergone tests of skill in relation to their driving licences, and unless their drivers are licensed and have paid a licence fee and that all the regulations we have discussed are observed. In that trade, which we permit to operate, subject to all these restrictions, it is common knowledge that the wages paid to the workers are scandalously low.  Surely it is an obligation on us to take some steps to see that an improvement is effected.</P>
    <P>I am not defending the particular form of Deputy Davin's amendment. Neither Deputy Davin nor the Minister is an expert Parliamentary draftsman, but there is a clear idea that we want to have expressed in this Bill, and that is that these appalling conditions which we know exist in relation to some omnibus services should not be permitted.  These conditions would not exist at all were it not for the pressure of unemployment which compels people to take any work they can get at any wage they can get.  In this particular case, that pressure of unemployment had produced conditions worse than in any other trade because of the fact that it only started recently and started in a hurry.  The usual methods by which organised labour can defend itself could not operate there.  There is not, as far as I know, a highly organised financially strong trade union for omnibus workers, whether drivers or conductors. In time it may be possible to put pressure on employers to improve conditions, but at present the employers know, and the officials of whatever trade unions that exist know, that there is outside the union <Col N="1481" /> a huge number of persons with the necessary skill to operate in this trade, on the verge of starvation who would be prepared to step in and take any position offered if the existing trade unions refused to work under the prevailing conditions.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it appears to some of us that there is a duty especially on those who profess to be so much concerned with obviating the danger of social trouble in this country to see that these conditions are removed by Acts of Parliament, and that those who are permitted by the State to operate services under this Act shall at least treat their workers in accordance with the principles laid down in the Pope's Encyclical.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce lay down as his main argument for opposition to this amendment the fact that it was put through the British House of Commons by a Labour Government.  Deputy Lemass has answered that argument very effectively.  The Minister says that there is no precedent for an amendment of this kind in any other Act except the British Act.  The British Act does not exactly legislate in the way in which the amendment if it is accepted by the House would operate. There is a clause in the British Act which makes provision for the setting up of an industrial court to which disputes arising out of the contents of that clause are to be referred for arbitration and decision.  If I am to take the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government as being opposed to this amendment either in the spirit or the letter, I certainly must assume that they are standing for the intolerable conditions which at present apply in the case of the small bus companies of this State.  In other words they are standing for sixteen hours a day at 10/- per week.  If you are not, what is your alternative to this amendment? The Minister says it is not fair to equalise the conditions between small bus companies and the larger ones.  Is it not a fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Railways <Col N="1482" /> Amalgamation Act of 1925 brought in under the Act all the large and small railways then operating in the Saorstát and equalised the conditions so far as conditions applied to them and to those who work for the amalgamated company?</P>

      <P>What the Minister did in the Railway Amalgamation Act of 1925 is quite good enough to be carried out and applied to the public services which ply for public hire on the roads of this country.  He says that the conditions which led up to the establishment of the Trade Board Acts were notoriously sweated conditions which could not be allowed by any trade union organisation in existence.  Does he agree with this intolerable state of affairs that young or old bus conductors should be allowed to be engaged in this country by people who are getting the benefit of this Act and forced to work for 16 hours a day at 10/- per week.  Was there anything worse at the time the Trade Boards were established by his Department or his predecessors, the British Government?  I happen to be fairly well acquainted with the conditions which apply to men engaged as drivers and conductors on the different companies that ply for hire on the Dublin-Dalkey line.  Is it fair to have the Blue Line Bus Company conceding fair and reasonable conditions to its employees and to have the small companies come along and force a sixteen-hour day at 10/- a week on their employees?  Who is getting the benefit of that?  Sometimes it goes by way of reduced fares due to the conditions I explained and at other times it goes in increased profits to the people who are allowed to get a licence under these conditions.  The conditions which have made these intolerable conditions of employment possible must be attributed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1483" /> or the Minister for Local Government and to the Ministry as a whole who have allowed citizens of this State to purchase buses and run them on any route they like under any conditions they like.  I say it is the duty of this House to make it a condition for the getting of any licences to see that fair and reasonable and human conditions of employment are applied to those who get the benefit of this Bill from this House.  If you vote against the letter or spirit of this amendment&mdash;I do not say it is the last word in drafting&mdash;you are voting for the continuation of these conditions which I do not think apply to any other public service in this country.</P>

Deputy Cassidy acted in the same way.  I do not see what they alluded to in regard <Col N="1484" /> to sweated trades.  I said there is no precedent of regulating by law, wages, except in Government contracts, and outside that, in cases of trades to which the Trade Board Acts apply.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It lays down conditions and leaves it open to anybody who complies with these conditions to run on the roads.  There is no question of benefiting.  Benefiting means singling out people and giving them something over anybody else.  This is laying down conditions that people must comply with.  Merely to say that it benefits people does not bring it within the ordinary conditions to which the fair wages clause have been applied.  The fair wages clause has its application to work that is done under Government contract.  It has been insisted on in the case of Government work because the Government ought, at any rate, to be in the position of the best employers.  If we are going to have it applied in the future to any trade or business that is regulated by legislation I want to warn people as to the extent of this.  If there is a regulation made with regard to speed or any matter&mdash;there are regulations made with regard to building of houses&mdash;does that mean that the building trades' wages are going to be fixed hereafter or that every trade on which there is an impact in any piece of legislation is going to be regulated?</P>

If we were nationalising transport certainly there is a case then for doing it, but I think it is completely inappropriate <Col N="1486" /> to this Bill, however pertinent it might be to the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  That argument might be used on a later amendment in regard to broken hours, but it certainly cannot be used here. This is not a Bill produced on behalf of people who are not getting sufficient wages.  We were told by Deputy Lemass that because certain people could not get employment otherwise they had gone into this business.  He wants to regulate the wages.  What is going to be the end of it?  There will be more unemployment.  The Deputy urged here in connection with another amendment that it would lead to the unemployment of drivers and conductors.  This is definitely going to have the same effect.  Deputy Davin made no pretence of his railway interests predominating.</P>

      <P>It is also a railway interest, because for anybody who has a railway point of view this is a glorious amendment.  It will certainly result in putting a number of buses off the roads.  If that is what is aimed at let it be argued on that basis.  It is not going to get men wages where these wages cannot at present be paid. To anybody who quotes an Encyclical to me I say it must be remembered that there is always an overriding thing in it, that the industry can <Col N="1487" /> afford it.  That is fundamental to anything that is said in any Encyclical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made great play with the fact that there is no precedent for this.  On both occasions on which he spoke he stressed that there was no precedent for including in a measure of this kind such a thing as this.  We can make a precedent.  The fact that a thing has never been done is not an argument that a thing which is right in itself should never be done.  Therefore, the question of a precedent might very well be ruled out.  The Minister has properly described the Bill as one that lays down conditions and says that any one who complies with these conditions can run a service on the roads. That is his own description of this measure.  All we are asking is that one of the conditions should be that a fair wage is paid and fair conditions of service observed.  That is one of the conditions we think ought to be laid down.  Are we to take it that the Minister says in effect that he is not concerned with this particular condition that fair wages should be paid and fair conditions observed?  The Minister has control of the service inasmuch as without his permission it cannot operate.  It has to fulfil certain conditions which are laid down before it is allowed to operate.  All that we ask is that that condition, which we believe, and which everybody should agree, is essential, that fair working conditions should be observed by a company which gets the right and the privilege, if you like, to ply for hire on the road, should be <Col N="1488" /> insisted upon.  The Minister attempted to draw an analogy between this and buildings because there were regulations about pulling down buildings and things like that.  As was pointed out at the time, there is no analogy unless you licence builders and more or less give a monopoly to those who register.  If we formed a builders' register we might then lay down the conditions for getting on the register.</P>

Surely there is nothing wrong in that principle.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not going to say that he is not concerned in any way with the conditions that apply in a licensed service of this kind; that he is entirely giving it over to free competition and that he is going to allow free competition to rule and nothing else.

      <P>There was a point raised on Section 106 and it arises on other sections, including this, about consultation with the local authorities <Col N="1491" /> when the by-laws are being made. The Minister says that under Section 8 the local authority would be given an opportunity, but there is nothing in Section 8 that lays it down specifically that the local authority would be given any opportunity of intervening or of giving its opinion or that it would be asked for its opinion on any rule or body of rules that might be made by the Commissioner with the consent of the Minister.  If there is any authority in the area that ought to know something about the regulations&mdash;the appointment of spaces where vehicles might stand for hire and such other matters as are set out in the section&mdash;it ought to be the officers of the local authority.  They ought to have some say in the matter. I think the Minister ought to give the local authorities a locus standi and every consideration before the by-laws are approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge that view-point on the Minister.  I think the Minister ought to agree to amend the section by the addition of some such words as &ldquo;after consultation with the local authority.&rdquo; A few words of that kind would make it all right.  The local authorities ought to have some jurisdiction inside their own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Take Section 7. That section makes it clear that whenever power is conferred on the Minister by this Act &ldquo;To make, approve of, confirm or consent to any order, regulation or by-law, to consent to any matter,&rdquo; the Minister may, before exercising such power, hold a public inquiry into the matter.  My intention would be, where it impinged on the local authority in any way, that, before confirming any by-law with regard to any particular area, an inquiry, such as is contemplated, should be carried out in as inexpensive a way as possible.  I will have the general run of sections dealing with the framing of by-laws examined, so as to see whether we could not, without unduly restricting ourselves in the matter, put in a reference to the local authority. We could have the regulations sent on to the local authority so that the local <Col N="1492" /> authority may discuss them and send them back with any recommendations they may consider desirable.  Then the Minister, after examining these regulations, would have power to confirm the order.  That might be one simple way of dealing with the matter and airing the thing locally without the necessity of having an actual inquiry.  I will consider whether we could not put down something explicitly without tying ourselves up unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be quite sufficient.  I do not see the necessity at all for a public inquiry.  A public inquiry involves the public body in an expense which it is not prepared to incur; and I do not think there would be any difficulty in having friendly conversations or consultations carried out in a friendly way between the Gárda authorities and the local authorities.  By acting in that manner the matter would adjust itself.  But I do think the Minister will agree that the local authorities ought to be consulted before regulations of that kind are made.</P>

It would seem that if it be a monopoly, we are imposing a tax that may be unlimited on taxis plying for hire on the streets.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Act a person hiring a street service vehicle <Col N="1493" /> shall not be deemed to be the employer of the driver thereof and such person hiring the vehicle shall not become liable to pay any sums by way of damages, costs or otherwise on account of injury to person or property occasioned by the negligent driving of such vehicle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We discussed the principle underlying this proposed new clause when we were discussing amendment 51 to Section 51; and I do not know whether the Minister will adopt the same conclusion that he came to in that particular case.</P>

      <P>I am now dealing with amendment 81&mdash;&ldquo;a person hiring a street service vehicle shall not be deemed to be the employer of the vehicle.&rdquo;  That is open to two constructions. The first is that an ordinary man hiring a taxi or any other street vehicle shall not be deemed to be the employer of the driver and shall not be liable for damages in case he injures a person.  But at the same time it might be an inducement to some persons, for the purpose of carrying <Col N="1494" /> merchandise or for other purposes, instead of having a permanent driver of their own car, to hire a taxi off the street and thus escape a good deal of responsibility in case of accident. I should like to be clear on that point. If this amendment were passed it would be quite possible for any individual who up to then might be deemed responsible as being the employer of the driver of a commercial vehicle to escape that responsibility by engaging day by day any vehicle off the street.  I see the danger inherent in this amendment.</P>

He is entitled to employ some contractor or any other person to do his service for him.

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Commissioner may with the consent of the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, by regulation, provide for the licensing of drovers of cattle, sheep or swine, in any particular area or areas.  Where by-laws have been made under this sub-section for any area it shall not be lawful for any person to bring, or cause to be brought, cattle, sheep or swine on to a road or street in such area, unless in charge of a licensed drover.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is to give power to the Commissioner, with the consent of the Minister, to make a new by-law in the terms set out in the amendment.  The <Col N="1496" /> largest industry in the State is the cattle industry and it has been the surprise of many visitors to our State to notice the small amount of care that is devoted to such an important industry. We here in the State are more or less accustomed to seeing drovers treating cattle&mdash;I do not say in all cases, but in many cases &mdash;in a way that such an important asset to the State should not be treated.  I am sure the attention of all Deputies in the House has been drawn to this fact at different times. The extraordinary thing about it is that no action appears to have been taken.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of this amendment to give power to the Commissioner to take action, if he so desires, with the consent of the Minister.  It is in no sense mandatory.  The need for this particular clause should not require any stressing in this House.  All of us have seen drovers from time to time treating animals in a way they should not be treated.  These men have been summoned from time to time and I have before me a list of recent cases and the reply in all cases that I happen to have is: &ldquo;The name and address of the drover proved to be false, so the case had to be abandoned.&rdquo;  That is the reply in six recent cases.  It seems to be common knowledge amongst the drovers that immediately they get summoned for ill-treating animals, or driving any animal that is lame, or that should not be driven, they give a wrong name and address.  I think it will be obvious to everybody who gives any attention to the problem that it is in the interest of the State that practices of this kind in connection with our most important industry, should not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should debate on a Traffic Bill something that has reference to the ill-treatment of cattle.  I thought the purpose of this amendment was quite different.  We must deal with this thing from the point of view of traffic rather than from the point of view of the ill-treatment of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  Let us take the case of animals being driven through the streets.  It has been pointed out <Col N="1497" /> by members of the Gárda Síochána, those of them who direct street traffic, that they see these animals being unfairly dealt with by the drovers.  They are in the difficult position that owing to these men not being licensed and consequently not having numbers displayed on their arms, it is impossible to get information in regard to them.  The members of the Gárda Síochána would have to leave their posts in order to follow those men and get their names and addresses. That would take a considerable amount of time and the police, because of their special duty, have not that time available.  If these drovers had numbers on their arms the Gárda would be able to take a note of the numbers while the men were passing. It is absolutely essential, in connection with the protection of these animals, and in the interests of the State, that steps should be taken to prevent the injury that is being done them by drovers.</P>

      <P>When I read the amendment it seemed to me that that was the bearing it had on the Bill <Col N="1498" />&mdash;that as the Bill made provision with regard to the drivers of omnibuses it could make some provision also with regard to the drovers of cattle.

      <P>We strongly protest against any such discussion.  We think this amendment is a futile and unnecessary one, and it is making a laughing-stock of the Bill.  It could not possibly be carried into effect. Take the case of a farmer going to a fair.  It may happen that he will go to the fair in his trap.  He decides to buy a cow and, if the area is a specified area, if it is an area to be subject to licence, he cannot employ a man in that town to drive home the cow for him.  The thing would be quite impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Just because there is a little scorn thrown upon this amendment is no reason why it should be let drop.  I think it is worthy of serious consideration. It is quite reasonable to say that general regulations ought to be subject to special examples.  Of course the farmer ought to be allowed to make special regulations for the transport of his own stock.  But the trouble is there, that the traffic on the road, due to this kind of uncontrolled cattle crowding on the road and blocking out and frequently interfering with traffic is very serious.  Not alone does that trouble exist, but it is a great wonder that it very often has not caused more serious accidents.  It is quite a common thing on country roads to come round a corner and find a herd of sheep blocking the roadway.  There is no avenue of the slightest kind and <Col N="1499" /> unless the greatest care is taken when turning round a corner an accident is the inevitable result.  It is a great wonder to me that such accidents do not occur much more frequently.</P>
      <P>What is sought to be secured in the Bill is that the driving of cattle over roads ought to be properly controlled by those who know how to do it. Further than that, a great nuisance arises constantly by cattle passing from the public roads into private grounds and trespassing in these places.  I can speak from experience and say that that happens almost every week.</P>

      <P>It would be interesting to know by what right Deputy Thrift is entitled to keep the approaches to his avenue open so that cattle can go in there and trespass.  The idea of licensing drovers is ridiculous.  I have some experience in this matter and I would be inclined to make certain things done by drovers offences, but this amendment goes nowhere to meet the situation.  I have seen drovers who are very careful with young cattle and with sheep, but not so careful with big cattle.  Some drovers often take very little trouble to get cattle off the road in order that traffic might pass.  That is the only complaint I have to make.  That conduct, of course, is not common.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before sub-section (2) the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Commissioner may with the consent of the Minister make, in relation to mechanically propelled vehicles and vehicles drawn by mechanically propelled vehicles, by-laws preventing excessive noises being made by horns or other instruments for the purpose of signalling. In making such by-laws, the Commissioner shall have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the tone of such horns or other instruments as well as the hours and the localities in which the use of the said horns or instruments may be permitted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is directed at abuses referred to by two other Deputies on the Second Reading of the Bill.  They are abuses with which city Deputies are very familiar.  It is a long-established principle of common law that freedom from noise is essential to the enjoyment of a house, and that any acts that affect such enjoyment <Col N="1501" /> are actionable at law.  Modern municipal development tends to accept that principle.  In a large number of cities, particularly on the Continent, a good deal of attention has been directed to the prevention of unnecessary street noise which makes for discomfort and loss of amenity, due especially to the new motor traffic.  It has been found possible in some of the biggest Continental cities to abolish these noises completely.  I was in a famous Continental city a few years ago, with which many Deputies are better acquainted than I am, and I was surprised to notice the remarkable change and the great improvement that had taken place in that respect. The use of motor horns is forbidden in the evening in some cities in Germany. There was great laugh some three years ago when municipal legislation to that effect was introduced, and it was suggested that the police should go to the local musical academy in order to take lessons in musical tone.  The ridicule died down and the citizens now appreciate the change for the better that has been effected.</P>
    <P>In Dublin at some hours of the day and at some seasons of the year in certain quarters this abuse is a scandal.  There is a cacophony of horrible sounds&mdash;a great variety of ear-piercing squeaks, grunts and sounds&mdash; that I can only characterise as indecent. Some drivers think it is essential to make these noises in order to propel the car.  I can only account for it that way.  As was pointed out by another Deputy those who offend have a preference for quiet residential quarters and for late hours when there is no traffic about the streets.  It is on these streets that these people qualify as drivers and work the horns the whole time.  I think the Commissioner should have power to regulate the hours and to check the excessive use of horns in certain districts.  Two very distinguished scholars complained to me that their life during certain hours of the day was made almost impossible with buses thundering past and the howling horror of noise and squealing and heavy vehicles shaking the streets. A good deal could be done to reduce this nuisance and to make the city <Col N="1502" /> more pleasant for people who are not in these cars.  I have noticed that the better drivers rarely use the horns and rarely rush through the traffic making these horrible noises.  The offenders are few and should be strictly dealt with.  I do not allude to one source of complaint because the Minister I think has power to deal with it under Section 15.  A number of motor cyclists tear through the streets without silencers. That practice is particularly horrible and I hope that the Minister when making regulations will take cognisance of that.</P>

      <P>I accept entirely the intention of the Deputy as shown in the amendment.  The whole question of noises will require to be considered to see if we do not want some provision like this to give us special powers.  I refer not only to noises caused by horns and other instruments, but to noises caused by bad loading and the nature of the machine itself.  In dealing with this matter, I may as well touch on Deputy Hennessy's amendment, 84 (a), which asks that audible signals be used on public service vehicles which shall have a distinctive note.  According to that amendment, the Blue Line buses would have B flat and the Red Line buses C sharp.  In the hope of abating noises, I do not think we ought to give special musical notes to special classes of vehicles.  I think it would be found that a particular bus driver would be sounding his particular note all the time if there was a bus belonging to another line on the road.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Before making any regulations in pursuance of this section, the Commissioner shall consult the representative traffic organisations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the rapid development of traffic regulation and the great number of cars on the roads, I think it would be very advisable for the Commissioner to take into consultation the people who are associated with this kind of <Col N="1503" /> traffic&mdash;the Automobile Association and similar bodies&mdash;before regulations would be formulated.  He could send his regulations to them and ask for their comments.</P>

It means only, I presume, that the Minister is to consent to the making of the by-laws by the Commissioner.  In that case, we are in a very peculiar position.  A multitude of things will affect traffic at every point, and we have no power whatever to discuss them in the Dáil, as the Commissioner is not responsible to the Dáil.  I understood from the Minister's earlier remarks on the Bill that the Commissioner in this matter is not subject to the Minister for Justice, and that no Minister can be asked any question with regard to a by-law. Surely, it is not fair to leave the Dáil without the power to discuss a very objectionable by-law.  So far as I can see, if the Bill goes through in its present form, that will be the position. No matter what complaints there may be, the Commissioner will be the absolute authority in such matters.</P>

      <P>The Bill makes provision for the framing of regulations and by-laws.  In the case of orders and regulations, the Bill provides that they shall come under the review of the Oireachtas.  By-laws deal with <Col N="1504" /> matters of very considerable detail, applicable in many cases to very definitely localised areas.  It is considered quite sufficient that these by-laws, which will be prepared by the Commissioner, cannot be given effect without going through a prescribed examination and getting the definite consent of the Minister.  If there are objectionable details in them, then any Deputy or any organisation or any local authority has the period between publication and the giving of consent by the Minister to make representations. In the case of matters of detail, such as the by-laws will deal with, it is more satisfactory that individual bodies and Deputies should make representations to the Minister as regards objectionable provisions than that these matters of detail should come under the review of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>On the section, in consequence of local authorities being obliged to do certain things as a result of the by-laws made, I think it is apparent that local authorities should be brought into consultation when <Col N="1505" /> dealing with these matters.  Sub-section (3) provides that the Council charged with the maintenance of a road in relation to which a by-law is in force shall erect certain signs and notices on such roadway.  I think the Minister will agree that in fairness to the local authorities they should be consulted before any such by-laws imposing these obligations upon them are drafted.  I would like to have an assurance, in connection with this section particularly, that there will be consultation between the local authorities and the representatives of the Commissioner in the area.</P>
      <P>I do not see that it will do any harm at all.  In view of the way that this section is drafted it makes that more necessary than ever.  It will certainly make the task of the Gárda in a particular area easier.  I believe it will only lead to irritation and contention if these things are done over the heads of the local authorities where they have to provide the signs and to maintain them.  Provision should be made in the section that it be mandatory on the Commissioner's representatives in an area to have a consultation with the local authority.  I urge that on the Minister because I think it is necessary. In this section, as it stands, the local authority is ignored altogether. I do not think that is desirable.  If the Minister is desirous to have the traffic regulations carried out properly, in such a way as to ensure the safety of the public, then I submit that in giving effect to the section the local authorities are deeply concerned and ought to be consulted.</P>

      <P>During the consideration of this Bill a good deal has been said about omnibuses, tractors, lorries and ordinary motor cars, but very little has been said about the most important section that is affected by traffic, namely, the pedestrian.  It is nearly time I think that some one got up and, so to speak, put in a word edgeways for the pedestrian.  Any one who has observed traffic conditions in this city must have become conscious of the fact that the pedestrian who has a primary right to the roadway and the footpath&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a primary right to any part of the roadway or the pathway, does not get very much consideration. I am not finding any fault with the Gárda&mdash;I suppose it is due to tradition and to their training&mdash;but Deputies and others must have observed that in carrying out their duties in the city they will signal to the on-coming omnibus or ordinary motor car and will take no notice whatever of the pedestrian or group of pedestrians, of the infirm, or the nervous, who are waiting to cross the roadway.  They are left standing on an island around a telegraph pole or a tram pole waiting to get across. People who have had experience of the carrying out of traffic duties in cities in other countries will have seen a whole stream of traffic held up in order to allow 20 or 30 school children to cross the streets, as well as nervous <Col N="1507" /> women, aged people and other pedestrians. Is there any reason why there should not be a regulation of that kind here?</P>
      <P>What do we find in Dublin City? That buses pull up right across the street at points where pedestrians are expected to cross.  They pull up right in the centre of the roadway and pedestrians, in order to make a crossing, are expected to walk around them.  It is interesting to watch, too, the manner in which the Gárda give indications to motorists to approach as well as the manner in which motorists indicate that they are going to proceed in a particular direction. In the case of ladies, when they give an indication, one is not certain whether they propose taking a turn in a particular direction or whether they are simply &ldquo;ta-taing&rdquo; to some friend on the footpath.  One is left in the position that he does not know if he responds to the indication but that he may be running into danger. There should be a regulation prohibiting motorists and the drivers of omnibuses from pulling up at crossings. Frequently at the corner of Abbey Street you find a line of omnibuses pulled up.  You find two or three of them telescoped right in the middle of the street.  I think it is time that somebody said a word on behalf of pedestrians.  Motorists, as well as other people, have at one time or another to use &ldquo;shank's mare&rdquo; when going through the city, and they must have observed the conditions I have described.  Despite Deputy Good's doubts, the pedestrian has a primary right to the use of the road and the footpath, and it is time that some consideration should be given to him.  I hope that somewhere in the Bill a provision will be embodied enabling the Minister to make regulations to protect the pedestrian more than he is at present.</P>

      <P>I would like to back up what Deputy Corish said with reference to local authorities.  Sub-section (3) of Section 133, which has been referred to by Deputy Corish provides that &ldquo;the Council charged with the maintenance of a road in relation to <Col N="1508" /> which a by-law made under this section is enforced . . shall erect, place, or make and shall maintain on such roads all such notices, instructions and directions,&rdquo; and so on.  There is similar wording in other sections making it mandatory on local authorities to put up and maintain notices of various kinds.  What I would like to know is, who is to pay for these notices?  Is the local authority to be called upon to pay for them?  The matter was under discussion recently at a Committee of the Dublin Municipal Council.  They were of opinion that the cost of putting up these notices should be borne out of the Road Fund.  There is a considerable amount of money collected from motorists, and it is primarily to facilitate motorists that these notices will be put up.  It is the opinion of the Municipal Council, and members have been asked to bring it forward here, that the cost of these various notices&mdash;in Dublin the number of them may be very considerable&mdash;ought to be borne out of the Road Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it could be regarded as part of the maintenance of the roads.  We pay forty per cent. of the cost of the maintenance of all main roads.  The cost of these would be included in that.  I think that is the simplest way to deal with the matter. As to the local authorities I will see what we may say explicitly on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point of the pedestrian, as I understand it, the pedestrian has first right to the road.  That is my understanding of the common law at any rate.  Whether like many people, he is treated with the deference with which he should be treated, is another matter.  As far as crossing roads or anything like that is concerned Section 133 (1) (i) refers to it.  I have been concerning myself with the consideration <Col N="1509" /> of the position of pedestrians and cyclists in relation to motor traffic, whether it is reasonable that going along a country road, two pedestrians walking abreast should have to walk in single file in order that a motor car would pass them.  I feel that two pedestrians walking abreast should have as much right to the road as a motor car and that the same thing should apply with regard to two cyclists.  I do not know whether we might enshrine that in legislation.  I do not know on the other hand to what extent the alleged grievances of pedestrians are really well founded.</P>

      <P>While the arrangements for pedestrians are not very good, I do not think it would be quite fair to the Guards to say that as far as the most congested parts are concerned, their interests are neglected. For instance, at the corner where people turn from Nassau Street into Grafton Street, one may see the Guard on duty there holding up the traffic to allow pedestrians to go through.  In certain other parts very much consideration is not given to pedestrians.  On the other hand, pedestrians do not give much consideration to themselves.  I am driving a motor car for twenty years myself and I can say that it is an old established fact that if one is driving along Dame Street one is met with a constant procession of people crossing the streets at these points.  If a regulation were made according to Deputy Hogan's suggestion that people should cross the streets at one particular point, and that the Guard should allow them to pass in bunches, as it were, it would be a very good thing.  While the present condition of affairs may not be all that pedestrians <Col N="1510" /> could wish, in certain parts of the City the Guards do look after them.  I say that as a motorist who is constantly about the streets.</P>

      <P>Much has been said on this Bill about danger signals for motorists.  I would like to see some arrangement by which pedestrians would signal to motorists, but I would appeal to motorists to take some recognition of these signals.  The fact that these signals are ignored very often may not be so dangerous in the vicinity of Dublin where you have steam-rolled roads, but down the country where the roads are not kept in repair, you have large potholes which in wet weather become filled with water and slush.  Motorists driving along these roads at 30 or 40 miles an hour destroy the clothes of the unfortunate pedestrian.  On one occasion I saw a respected parish priest who had to get inside the ditch from one of these motorists, and even then he was not safe, because his coat was covered with mud.  I would like to see some arrangement by which when a pedestrian holds up his hand, a motorist would slow up.  I think there should be some recognition of pedestrians signals in that way.</P>

      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(o) Providing that the audible signals to be used on public service vehicles plying on specified routes shall have a distinctive note which will indicate the particular route on which such vehicle is plying.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has for its object the provision of distinctive signals that will indicate what route the bus is travelling.  In fact it would be as well for me to say that from the time a bus starts until it reaches its terminus there are no stopping places such as are provided in the tram service.  The traveller has to rely on his own alertness to signal for the bus to stop.  It is not such a problem in the daytime but it is very difficult at night.  Even in a short three-quarters of a mile a man or woman has to turn round many times to see if a bus is coming.  I took this measure of it myself, that I had to turn practically 100 times from one end of Harcourt Street to the other.  My suggestion to prevent that is that the buses travelling on each particular route&mdash;I do not think you would have more than five or six routes on the south side of the city&mdash;would have some kind of signal permanently attached to the bus and that would be permanently acting.  I do not see that there is any need to have disagreeable sound amongst them.  I remember in the old days of the horse trams each of them carried a bell and the bell was always ringing so that at any rate you knew when your tram was coming.  At present you have no idea of the bus that is coming behind you. As I stated, you have all the time to keep looking back to see if your bus is coming.  The fixture containing the signal could be simple and it could contain a note that would be of a more musical character than a noise.</P>

I do not know how many services there are in Dublin, but I can just imagine the horrible state of affairs we would have if each of these buses were to look for sharps and flats and run over the entire gamut.  There would be such a discord that the last stage would be worse than that envisaged in Deputy Thrift's amendment.  I suggest if Deputy Hennessy would improve the amenities of this country why should he not go a little bit further and have a chime on these buses.  We could have Deputy Thrift with his little chime &ldquo;At Trinity Church I met my doom.&rdquo;  We could have Deputy Donovan chiming &ldquo;Come to Glengariff, Come,&rdquo; we might have Deputy Mongan with &ldquo;The Men of the West,&rdquo; and Deputy Bennett might have attached to his motor car the chime &ldquo;Limerick, is beautiful,&rdquo; and so on.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 46, after the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;other than any conditions prescribing fees to be payable in respect of parking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendments 85 and 86 really hang together.  It is a matter of objection to paying fees for the parking of cars on the streets.  The streets are supported by the rates, and there is great objection on the part of motorists who live out in the country and have to motor into the city every day to have a tax compulsorily placed upon them and to have to pay fees for parking their cars on the street.  I do not think there would be any objection to paying a fee if the local authorities provided a suitable car park.  What a number of these motorists feel is that it is a very unfair thing to add to their motoring expenses a sum of £7 10s. a year&mdash;to pay 6d. every day for six days of the week, which adds considerably to their motoring expenses. For that reason I move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, arising out of street conditions in the city, the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána has actually arranged a certain number of parking places <Col N="1515" /> and appointed parking attendants, whose duty it is to see that there is no unauthorised interference with the cars and their contents.  As far as I know, and I would like to hear any Dublin motorist on the subject, it has been a convenience to the motoring public.  The attendants are there voluntarily.  They have no right to a fee, but, in fact, they do get a fee of about 2d. or 3d.  The whole arrangement as far as I know is regarded as a convenience.  This is simply a proposal that this ought to be organised by the Commissioner so that the fee can be charged for the motorist using the parking place.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would be favourable to giving out tickets that would be available in any parking place in the city.  If a person were moving from one part of the city to another he may have to pay in three or four different places which would be a rather serious matter.  In Belfast I believe they have an arrangement by which a ticket is given to each person who is parking a car.  That ticket may be used in any other parking place to which the car might be moved during the day.  If the Minister would consider such an arrangement here I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>I certainly think that that can be done in the working of the scheme.  If a person comes to Stephen's Green and pays twopence for a ticket that ticket can hold good for the day.  I think the fees ought to be arranged in such a way as would finance the scheme.  A ticket would be issued for the day and that could be used for all parking places on the street.</P>

      <P>In many towns throughout the country along the main thoroughfares it is the practice to allow cars to be parked on both sides of the street allowing only a narrow passage through.  The consequence is that there is great danger to children who run behind the cars.  The motorists have no chance of seeing them.  I have seen a child knocked down by a car moving slowly.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would put down for the Report Stage an amendment to this effect: &ldquo;In addition to any other light that may be carried, a red reflector be also carried showing the rere of every vehicle, whether mechanically propelled or not.&rdquo;  My reason for suggesting this is, that I once nearly met with a very serious accident when motoring at night by coming on top of a car whose rear light had gone out. The cost of a reflector would be very small, and if there were a reflector on every car everyone would know that even if the rear light had gone out, he would be safeguarded by the reflector. It would be a precaution which would save many accidents, and I ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>

How is it suggested that a load of hay should be lighted?  It would be nearly impossible.  I am afraid that a condition such as this would be irritating and annoying to farmers.  When a farmer's car has to go a few hundred yards from one field to another, he would be supposed to have a light at the rear as well as in front.
